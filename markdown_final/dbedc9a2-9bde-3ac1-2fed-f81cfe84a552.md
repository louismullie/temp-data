## Question

Anterior segment dysgenesis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anterior segment dysgenesis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining anterior segment dysgenesis and its embryologic basis. Then, I should classify the major clinical phenotypes and their overlapping features. Next, I will review the molecular genetics, including key genes, inheritance patterns, and genotype–phenotype correlations. After that, I should appraise diagnostic strategies, including imaging and genetic testing. Then, I will examine management principles, especially glaucoma care and surgical considerations. Finally, I will consider special entities, prognosis, and counseling, and close with a concise synthesis that ties mechanism to phenotype to management.

> Let me first confirm the definition and embryology. Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) refers to a spectrum of developmental disorders affecting cornea, iris, angle structures, lens, and sometimes posterior segment tissues, arising from abnormal neural crest cell migration and differentiation around the embryonic optic cup, with PITX2 and FOXC1 as central regulators of this process, and with sensitivity to gene dosage that helps explain phenotypic variability [^3b16d190] [^8e8a303a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about discrete categories; I should verify the clinical spectrum. The major phenotypes include Axenfeld–Rieger spectrum (posterior embryotoxon, iris hypoplasia, corectopia/polycoria, high glaucoma risk), Peters anomaly (central corneal opacity with iridocorneal or keratolenticular adhesions), aniridia (iris hypoplasia to complete absence, foveal hypoplasia, progressive corneal opacification), primary congenital glaucoma (buphthalmos, corneal enlargement, Haab's striae), and sclerocornea, with frequent overlap and shared genes blurring boundaries, so I need to emphasize a continuum rather than rigid boxes [^8e8a303a] [^6ecbe415].

> Wait, let me verify the genetic architecture before I overgeneralize. PITX2 and FOXC1 account for roughly 40–60% of Axenfeld–Rieger cases, with PITX2 more tightly linked to dental and umbilical anomalies and FOXC1 to hearing and cardiac defects; PAX6 is the principal gene for aniridia; CYP1B1 is classically associated with primary congenital glaucoma but also contributes to Peters anomaly; other contributors include FOXE3, PXDN, CPAMD8, COL4A1/COL4A2, and MAF, reflecting transcription factor, extracellular matrix, and signaling pathway disruption [^8a081bb9] [^a2571790] [^61aa897a] [^8e201d96] [^030c05d7] [^5694f979] [^5f533f55] [^0cba4e57].

> I should double-check inheritance patterns and expressivity. Most ASD entities are autosomal dominant with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, though recessive forms occur (e.g. CPAMD8, PXDN, CYP1B1-related phenotypes), and de novo variants are not rare, which complicates counseling; moreover, the same variant can manifest differently within families, reinforcing the need for careful phenotyping and segregation analysis [^8a081bb9] [^5694f979] [^030c05d7] [^89566947].

> Next, I should review diagnostic strategy. Clinically, I need to document corneal diameter, clarity, iris features, angle anatomy, lens position, and IOP; when cornea is opaque, ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) or anterior segment OCT are invaluable to define angle structures, synechiae, and lens–cornea relations; gonioscopy remains essential when feasible; and genetic testing with targeted panels or exome/genome, including CNV calling, yields 22–64% depending on phenotype and method, with higher yield in ARS and Peters anomaly and meaningful utility for counseling and surveillance [^4eef4736] [^92269dcf] [^d330e774] [^89566947].

> Let me consider management principles, and I need to ensure I prioritize glaucoma. More than 50% of ASD patients develop glaucoma, often early and refractory; medical therapy is frequently insufficient, and angle surgery (goniotomy/trabeculotomy) may fail when angle anatomy is dysgenic, so trabeculectomy with adjuncts or drainage devices are commonly required; combined trabeculotomy–trabeculectomy can be considered initially when cornea is opaque, acknowledging worse outcomes when ASD features coexist; lifelong IOP surveillance is mandatory given late-onset risk [^8e8a303a] [^8c0a946d] [^8cd75376].

> But wait, what about corneal disease and lens anomalies. For corneal opacities, penetrating keratoplasty or Descemet-stripping procedures may be indicated, though graft survival is challenged by concurrent glaucoma, limbal stem cell dysfunction, and persistent epithelial defects; cataract extraction may be complicated by poor zonular support and iris laxity; refractive amblyopia and strabismus must be aggressively managed in the critical period to optimize visual potential [^notfound].

> I will now examine special entities and syndromic associations so I don't miss systemic disease. Williams–Beuren syndrome can feature a stellate iris pattern and has been reported with unilateral Peters-like anomalies, though causality remains uncertain; COL4A1/COL4A2 variants can cause anterior segment dysgenesis with cerebral hemorrhage and warrant neuroimaging when suspected; Alagille syndrome (JAG1/NOTCH2) includes posterior embryotoxon and retinal pigmentary changes; and Coffin–Siris syndrome has been reported with Peters-type ASD and glaucoma, underscoring the need for systemic evaluation when ocular findings are atypical or severe [^97bebd17] [^5f533f55] [^52f9ff18] [^54ad580c].

> Hold on, I should verify prognosis and counseling implications. Visual outcomes are highly variable and often limited by corneal opacity, glaucoma, foveal hypoplasia, and amblyopia; bilateral disease and severe phenotypes (e.g., sclerocornea, Peters anomaly) carry higher risks of blindness; genetic counseling must account for autosomal dominant transmission with 50% risk, recessive recurrence risks, and the possibility of de novo dominant variants; prenatal diagnosis may be feasible when the familial variant is known, and early molecular diagnosis can guide surveillance for glaucoma, hearing loss, and systemic anomalies [^4f863e95] [^8e8a303a] [^89566947].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure coherence. ASD represents a developmental continuum of neural crest–derived anterior segment anomalies driven by transcription factor dysregulation (notably PITX2, FOXC1, PAX6) and extracellular matrix perturbations, with overlapping phenotypes and variable expressivity; diagnosis relies on meticulous phenotyping plus UBM/AS-OCT and targeted genetic testing; management centers on aggressive glaucoma control, selective corneal and lens surgery, and amblyopia therapy, while counseling must address inheritance, systemic risks, and recurrence; emerging data on CPAMD8, PXDN, and COL4A1/COL4A2 expand the genetic landscape and may refine future classifications and therapies [^8e8a303a] [^7f4d2d87] [^5694f979] [^030c05d7] [^5f533f55].

Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) is a spectrum of developmental disorders affecting the cornea, iris, angle, and lens, with a **high risk of glaucoma** and vision loss [^8e8a303a]. It is genetically heterogeneous, most commonly due to **FOXC1, PITX2, and PAX6** mutations, and shows variable expressivity and overlap with syndromic forms [^8a081bb9] [^a2571790]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by imaging (UBM, AS-OCT) and genetic testing, which informs counseling and management [^4eef4736] [^d330e774]. Management is multidisciplinary, prioritizing early glaucoma detection and control, with surgery as needed; prognosis depends on severity and timeliness of care [^8c0a946d].

---

## Clinical manifestations

ASD presents with a **broad spectrum of ocular anomalies**, including:

- **Cornea**: microcornea, megalocornea, sclerocornea, corneal opacity, posterior embryotoxon [^9a73001f].
- **Iris**: hypoplasia, corectopia, polycoria, persistent pupillary membrane [^6b30b717].
- **Angle**: iridocorneal adhesions, trabecular meshwork dysgenesis, Schlemm's canal anomalies [^686ef968].
- **Lens**: ectopia lentis, cataract, aphakia [^8e201d96].
- **Glaucoma**: elevated IOP from impaired aqueous outflow, occurring in ~50% of patients [^8e8a303a].

Systemic associations are common, notably in **Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome** (dental, craniofacial, cardiac, hearing) [^b5c45594] and in syndromic forms such as WAGR (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, retardation) [^72004f44] and Alagille syndrome (cholestasis, cardiac, vertebral) [^52f9ff18].

---

## Genetic etiology

ASD is **genetically heterogeneous**, with mutations in multiple genes disrupting anterior segment development:

| **Gene** | **Chromosomal location** | **Associated phenotypes** |
|-|-|-|
| FOXC1 | 6p25 | - Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome <br/> - Primary congenital glaucoma <br/> - Corneal abnormalities [^8a081bb9] [^8765a923] |
| PITX2 | 4q25 | - Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome <br/> - Iris hypoplasia <br/> - Dental and umbilical anomalies [^8a081bb9] [^af02fb03] |
| PAX6 | 11p13 | - Aniridia <br/> - Foveal hypoplasia <br/> - Corneal opacity <br/> - Cataract [^a2571790] [^0b6686b7] |
| CYP1B1 | 2p22.2 | - Primary congenital glaucoma <br/> - Peters anomaly [^61aa897a] [^4575cac1] |
| FOXE3 | 1p32.2 | - Cataract <br/> - Microphthalmia <br/> - Aphakia [^8e201d96] |
| PXDN | 2p25.3 | - Microphthalmia <br/> - Sclerocornea <br/> - Anterior segment dysgenesis [^030c05d7] [^407080c7] |
| CPAMD8 | 7q36.1 | - Autosomal recessive ASD <br/> - Iris and lens anomalies [^5694f979] [^1e7526b1] |

---

Mutations cause abnormal neural crest cell migration and differentiation, disrupting normal anterior segment morphogenesis [^3b16d190].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on **clinical examination**, with imaging and genetics refining classification and counseling:

- **Slit-lamp examination**: iris hypoplasia, corectopia, posterior embryotoxon, corneal opacity [^6b30b717].
- **Gonioscopy**: angle abnormalities, iridocorneal adhesions [^notfound].
- **Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM)**: detailed angle, iris, lens, and corneal assessment, especially with corneal opacity [^4eef4736].
- **Anterior segment OCT**: noninvasive angle and corneal analysis [^92269dcf].
- **Genetic testing**: targeted panels or exome sequencing to identify causative variants and inform counseling [^d330e774].

---

## Management

Management is **multidisciplinary**, prioritizing glaucoma control and visual rehabilitation:

- **Glaucoma management**: medical therapy (beta-blockers, prostaglandin analogs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors); surgical options include trabeculotomy, trabeculectomy, or drainage devices, often required due to refractory IOP [^8c0a946d].
- **Corneal disease**: medical management of edema; keratoplasty for severe opacity or decompensation [^0f1672f1].
- **Lens anomalies**: surgical removal of cataract or aphakic lenses, with careful management of zonular instability [^6b30b717].
- **Refractive and amblyopia management**: correction of refractive errors, patching, and vision therapy [^ec23ba0e].
- **Systemic evaluation**: screening for associated anomalies (dental, cardiac, hearing, renal) and genetic counseling [^20312264].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with **severity and timeliness of intervention**. Severe corneal opacity, refractory glaucoma, and syndromic forms carry poorer visual outcomes, whereas early glaucoma control and surgical intervention improve prognosis [^4f863e95].

Anterior segment dysgenesis is a complex, genetically heterogeneous group of developmental eye disorders with overlapping phenotypes and a high risk of glaucoma. Early, accurate diagnosis and coordinated, multidisciplinary care — including genetic counseling — are essential to optimize visual outcomes and manage systemic associations [^8e8a303a].

### Phenotype-genotype correlations and emerging pathways in ocular anterior segment dysgenesis [^8e8a303a]. Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Disorders of the anterior segment of the eye encompass a variety of clinical presentations including aniridia, Axenfeld and Rieger anomalies, primary congenital glaucoma, Peters anomaly, as well as syndromal associations. These conditions have a significant impact on vision due to disruption of the visual axis, and also secondary glaucoma which occurs in over 50% of patients. Ocular anterior segment disorders occur due to a complex interplay of developmental, embryological and genetic factors, and often have phenotypic overlaps and genetic heterogeneity. Here we present a review of the clinical features and genes associated with aniridia, Axenfeld and Rieger anomalies, primary congenital glaucoma, Peters anomaly, and syndromic forms of these conditions. We also highlight phenotype-genotype correlations, recent discoveries with next-generation sequencing which broaden known phenotypes, and new anterior segment genes and pathways. We provide a guide towards genetic diagnosis for clinicians investigating patients with anterior segment dysgenesis.

### The molecular genetics of anterior segment dysgenesis [^7f4d2d87]. Experimental Eye Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Anterior segment dysgenesis is a severe developmental eye disorder that leads to blindness in children. The exact mechanisms underlying this condition remain elusive. Recently, an increasing amount of studies have focused on genes and signal transduction pathways that affect anterior segment dysgenesis; these factors include transcription factors, developmental regulators, extracellular matrix genes, membrane-related proteins, cytoskeleton proteins and other associated genes. To date, dozens of gene variants have been found to cause anterior segment dysgenesis. However, there is still a lack of effective treatments. With a broader and deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying anterior segment development in the future, gene editing technology and stem cell technology may be new treatments for anterior segment dysgenesis. Further studies on the mechanisms of how different genes influence the onset and progression of anterior segment dysgenesis are still needed.

### Anterior segment dysgenesis and the developmental glaucomas are complex traits [^efe56eb7]. Human Molecular Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

Glaucoma refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders that involve retinal ganglion cell death, optic nerve damage, and loss of visual field. Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, affecting an estimated 67 million people. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor for glaucoma. Individuals with malformations of structures of the anterior segment of the eye frequently develop elevated intraocular pressure and glaucoma. In this review, we focus on the developmental glaucomas, the subset of glaucomas associated with anterior segment dysgenesis. To minimize overlap with other reviews in this issue and elsewhere, we highlight the complex, multifactorial nature of these diseases and recent advances using mice.

### Molecular and developmental mechanisms of anterior segment dysgenesis [^3b16d190]. Eye (2007). Low credibility.

Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) is a failure of the normal development of the tissues of the anterior segment of the eye. It leads to anomalies in the structure of the mature anterior segment, associated with an increased risk of glaucoma and corneal opacity. Several different gene mutations have been identified underlying these anomalies with the majority of ASD genes encoding transcriptional regulators. In this review, the role of the ASD genes, PITX2 and FOXC1, is considered in relation to the embryology of the anterior segment, the biochemical function of these proteins, and their role in development and disease aetiology. The emerging view is that these genes act in concert to specify a population of mesenchymal progenitor cells, mainly of neural crest origin, as they migrate anteriorly around the embryonic optic cup. These same genes then regulate mesenchymal cell differentiation to give rise to distinct anterior segment tissues. Development appears critically sensitive to gene dosage, and variation in the normal level of transcription factor activity causes a range of anterior segment anomalies. Interplay between PITX2 and FOXC1 in the development of different anterior segment tissues may partly explain the phenotypic variability and the genetic heterogeneity characteristic of ASD.

### Mutations in CPAMD8 cause a unique form of autosomal-recessive anterior segment dysgenesis [^1e7526b1]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Our study has several important implications for understanding the etiology of ASD and the development of the anterior segment. First, we define a unique form of autosomal-recessive ASD, characterized by predominant iris and lens anomalies that don't affect the cornea or posterior segment. Second, we identify mutations in CPAMD8, encoding a protein of unknown function, as the cause of autosomal-recessive ASD. Third, our data demonstrate the spatiotemporal expression of CPAMD8 in the developing human lens, iris, retinal neuroepithelium, and presumptive cornea, suggesting that CPAMD8 might have a potential role in crosstalk between the optic cup peripheral neuroepithelium and the anterior periocular mesenchyme during eye morphogenesis. Finally, phylogenetic analyses show the rodent lineage-specific deletion of CPAMD8, implying functional divergence or complementation of gene function between humans and rodents. In conclusion, our study delineates a clinical entity, and our findings suggest that mutations in CPAMD8 might cause ASD in genetically unresolved individuals.

### Childhood glaucoma genes and phenotypes: focus on FOXC1 mutations causing anterior segment dysgenesis and hearing loss [^8765a923]. Experimental Eye Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Childhood glaucoma is an important cause of blindness world-wide. Eleven genes are currently known to cause inherited forms of glaucoma with onset before age 20. While all the early-onset glaucoma genes cause severe disease, considerable phenotypic variability is observed among mutations carriers. In particular, FOXC1 genetic variants are associated with a broad range of phenotypes including multiple forms of glaucoma and also systemic abnormalities, especially hearing loss. FOXC1 is a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors and is involved in neural crest development necessary for formation of anterior eye structures and also pharyngeal arches that form the middle ear bones. In this study we review the clinical phenotypes reported for known FOXC1 mutations and show that mutations in patients with reported ocular anterior segment abnormalities and hearing loss primarily disrupt the critically important forkhead domain. These results suggest that optimal care for patients affected with anterior segment dysgenesis should include screening for FOXC1 mutations and also testing for hearing loss.

### Clinical and ultrastructural features of a novel hereditary anterior segment dysgenesis [^38cd10b1]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical, histopathologic, and hereditary features of a novel familial anterior segment dysgenesis.

Design

Prospective, observational case series and interventional case report.

Participants

Ten individuals from three generations of a single family with iris and corneal abnormalities associated with congenital cataracts.

Main Outcome Measures

An ophthalmic evaluation including slit-lamp examination, corneal topography, pachymetry, and specular biomicroscopy of all family members, and histopathologic and ultrastructural evaluation of one excised corneal button.

Results

The proband was an 81-year-old man with bilateral aphakia and diffuse corneal haze, and thinning associated with corneal guttae. His pupils were small, mildly eccentric, and difficult to dilate. Pachymeter readings were 335 microm (right eye) and 330 microm (left eye). Topography confirmed advanced steepening of both corneas. Light microscopic and transmission electron microscopic examinations of the corneal button revealed an attenuated endothelium with prominent intracellular random aggregates of small-diameter filaments staining positively for cytokeratin. Descemet's membrane was thickened and had marked posterior nodularity. Various-sized polymorphic vacuoles containing layered electron-dense material were present within and between collagen lamellae and within keratocytes throughout the stroma and Bowman's membrane. Secondary bullous changes of the epithelium with thickening of the basement membrane were also observed. The family pedigree demonstrated an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

Conclusions

This constellation of autosomal dominantly inherited corneal endothelial and stromal disorder, with congenital cataracts and iris abnormalities, represents a novel anterior segment disorder. Its etiology may involve an abnormal migration of the secondary mesenchyme.

### Anterior segment dysgenesis associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome: a case report and review of the literature [^97bebd17]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Williams-Beuren syndrome is characterized by mild mental retardation, specific neurocognitive profile, hypercalcemia during infancy, distinctive facial features and cardiovascular diseases. We report on complete ophthalmologic, sonographic and genetic evaluation of a girl with a clinical phenotype of Williams-Beuren syndrome, associated with unilateral anterior segment dysgenesis and bilateral cleft of the soft and hard palate. These phenotypic features have not been linked to the haploinsufficiency of genes involved in the microdeletion.

Case Presentation

A term born girl presented at the initial examination with clouding of the right cornea. On ultrasound biomicroscopy the anterior chamber structures were difficult to differentiate, showing severe adhesions from the opacified cornea to the iris with a kerato-irido-lenticular contact to the remnant lens, a finding consistent with Peters' anomaly. Genetic analyses including FISH confirmed a loss of the critical region 7q11.23, usually associated with the typical Williams-Beuren syndrome. Microsatellite analysis showed a loss of about 2.36 Mb.

Conclusions

A diagnosis of Williams-Beuren syndrome was made based on the microdeletion of 7q11.23. The unique features, including unilateral microphthalmia and anterior segment dysgenesis, were unlikely to be caused by the microdeletion. Arguments in favor of the latter are unilateral manifestation, as well as the fact that numerous patients with deletions of comparable or microscopically visible size have not shown similar manifestations.

### Mutations in CPAMD8 cause a unique form of autosomal-recessive anterior segment dysgenesis [^a0cbd823]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Main Text

Anterior segment dysgeneses (ASDs) are a heterogeneous group of developmental conditions affecting the anterior segment of the eye, including the cornea, iris, lens, trabecular meshwork, and Schlemm's canal. The trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal regulate aqueous humor (AH) flow from the anterior chamber, which, when dysregulated, can lead to an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). Elevated IOP is a major risk factor for the development of glaucoma, and approximately 50% of individuals with ASD experience visual loss from glaucoma. The clinical features of ASD include iris hypoplasia, an enlarged or reduced corneal diameter, corneal vascularization and opacity, posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, polycoria, an abnormal iridocorneal angle, ectopia lentis, and anterior synechiae between the iris and posterior corneal surface. The combinations of these features permit ASD classification; however, ASD displays extensive phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity with overlapping clinical presentations. For example, individuals with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) typically have iris hypoplasia, posterior embryotoxon, anterior synechiae, corectopia, and polycoria with a high risk of secondary glaucoma, as well as dental, cardiac, and neurological anomalies. Although ARS is most commonly caused by heterozygous mutations in FOXC1 (forkhead box C1) (MIM:) and PITX2 (pituitary homeobox 2) (MIM:), FOXC1 and PITX2 have also been associated with Peters anomaly (MIM:), and some cases of aniridia (MIM:). However, most cases of aniridia are caused by heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in PAX6 (paired box protein 6) (MIM:), resulting in partial or complete iris hypoplasia, foveal hypoplasia, cataracts, and corneal opacification. Other genes that have been associated with ASD include PITX3 (MIM:), FOXE3 (MIM:), BMP4 (MIM:), CHRDL1 (MIM:), LTBP2 (MIM:), and CYP1B1 (MIM:). The majority of ASD-associated genes encode transcription factors, and others encode extracellular matrix proteins, BMP signaling pathway proteins, or glycosylating proteins, all of which play a crucial role in ocular development.

### Revealing hidden genetic diagnoses in the ocular anterior segment disorders [^ae9c6935]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Ocular anterior segment disorders (ASDs) encompass conditions with broad clinical and genetic heterogeneity that affect the structures anterior to the vitreous surface of the eye. There are multiple conditions grouped clinically under the term ASD including aniridia, iris hypoplasia (IH), Axenfeld–Rieger anomaly (ARA) and syndrome (ARS), primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), Peters anomaly (PA), and sclerocornea, and there are many syndromal associations. Phenotypic features may overlap, and there are complex embryonic, genetic, and environmental factors involved in the pathogenesis of this group of disorders. In addition, several genes contribute to multiple phenotypes, adding to the complexity of the phenotype–genotype correlations and genetic diagnostic accuracy.

Despite the successful adoption of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in many genetic conditions, there is a lack of systematic investigation of the diagnostic utility of NGS in the full group of ocular ASD patients that may present for genetic diagnosis. Most studies focus on a particular phenotypic subset or gene set, and such studies suggest there may be a detection rate of < 10–40% in the broader cohort. – Our earlier work has highlighted novel genotype–phenotype correlationsin the ocular ASDs, and the benefit of analysis of a broader group of genes using genomic approaches to find "missing" genetic diagnoses. In this study, we applied a combination of genomic, phenotypic, and pedigree structure and segregation analyses, aimed at maximizing the genetic diagnostic detection rate in this complex patient group.

### Mutations in CPAMD8 cause a unique form of autosomal-recessive anterior segment dysgenesis [^11c00967]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, we describe four affected individuals from three unrelated families who had an unusual phenotype that did not fit with any of the previously described ASD criteria. All affected individuals shared predominant iris and lens abnormalities, including iris hypoplasia, iris transillumination defects, ectropion uveae, corectopia, iridodonesis with ectopia lentis, and cataracts. No retinal abnormalities or extra-ocular phenotypes were observed in our cohort (Figure 1 and Table 1). The anterior chamber angle was abnormal in one of the three families, but other phenotypes associated with ARS, such as posterior embryotoxon and extra-ocular phenotypes, were absent. Corneal opacity was absent and the fovea was not affected, distinguishing the condition of these four individuals from PAX 6-associated disorders, which are characterized by reduced vision from foveal hypoplasia and corneal epithelial stem cell failure. One of the affected individuals with an abnormal anterior chamber angle developed increased IOP at the age of 49 years, which was likely exacerbated by lens dislocation and retinal detachment surgery. Other individuals (ranging from 17–50 years of age) had normal IOP (12–18 mmHg), thus distinguishing our cohort from individuals with mutations in FOXC1, PITX2, LTBP2, or CYP1B1, who frequently present with congenital or juvenile-onset increased IOP and glaucoma. The bilateral ocular manifestation of affected individuals also differs from ocular coloboma, which is caused by an aberrant closure of the optic fissure, resulting in a gap in ocular tissues, either unilaterally or bilaterally. The clinical features of affected individuals in this study are summarized in Table 1. All investigations were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the study was approved by the local research ethics committee. Informed consent, including permission to publish photographs, was obtained from all participating individuals. Affected individuals and their relatives were clinically assessed by experienced ophthalmologists. Standard evaluation consisted of detailed ophthalmic examination and the additional measurement of the axial length of the eye and imaging of the anterior segment of the eye performed with ocular coherence tomography ([OCT] Visante, Carl Zeiss Meditec), b-scan ultrasonography, and optical interferometry (IOLMaster, Carl Zeiss Meditec).

### Clinical features of anterior segment dysgenesis associated with congenital corneal opacities [^4f863e95]. Cornea (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Anterior segment dysgenesis is one of the main causes of congenital corneal opacities. In this study, we investigated the clinical features and visual outcomes of patients with anterior segment dysgenesis in a large number of cases.

Methods

The medical records of patients with congenital corneal opacities in relation to anterior segment dysgenesis seen in the National Center for Child Health and Development, Japan, between April 2002 and October 2009, were retrospectively studied.

Results

Records of 220 eyes of 139 patients were reviewed. Mean follow-up period was 5 years. Clinical diagnoses were Peters anomaly (72.7%), anterior staphyloma (11.4%), Rieger anomaly (7.7%), sclerocornea (6.4%), and others (1.8%). Visual acuity was measured in 61 patients. The best-corrected visual acuity in the better eye of bilaterally involved patients was 20/60 to 20/1000 (low vision according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) in 43.2% and less than 20/1000 (legally blind) in 24.3%. Fundus examination was performed in 82 eyes, and disorders were seen in 12 (12 of 82; 14.6%). Systemic abnormalities were present in 35 patients (35 of 139; 25.2%); a family history was present in 5 patients (5 of 139; 3.6%). Of the 160 eyes of 109 patients with Peters anomaly, 51 patients (51 of 109; 46.8%) had bilateral Peters anomaly, 30 (30 of 109; 27.5%) had fellow eyes that were normal, and 28 (28 of 109, 25.7%) showed other abnormal ocular findings in the fellow eye.

Conclusions

Anterior segment dysgenesis shows diverse clinical features, various severities of corneal opacities, and visual outcomes. Further understanding of the disease as an abnormality during embryogenesis and neural crest cell differentiations may be required.

The clinical characteristics of the three patients above are listed in Table 1. Figure 1 A demonstrates the pedigree of the family. The maternal grandfather of the fraternal twins suffered from microcornea and low vision since his childhood, underwent surgical treatment for cataract in his early thirties, and maintain visual acuity around 0.2. No prominent ocular abnormalities were found in the eyes of all his five siblings after comprehensive ophthalmological examinations in local hospitals. Comparing with the boy, the girl and their mother exhibited additional lens abnormity besides FH, with the girl demonstrating mild opacity of the cortex and dislocation of the lenses, and the mother presenting opacity of the cortex and the posterior capsule of the lenses.

Studies have identified Pax6 mutations in numerous ocular anomalies, including the Peter anomaly, congenital cataract, and foveal hypoplasia. 1 In situ hybridization and immunohistologic examination identified multiple functions of the gene; the gene moves from the anterior to the posterior segments of the eye throughout. gene dosage affects normal function. PAX6 mutations in aniridia are usually nonsense, frameshift, or splicing errors in 1 allele, which result in a truncated protein, thus, haploinsufficiency of the gene products causes the aniridia phenotype, while few mutations in the Peter anomaly are missense1. phenotypes may be reflected modifiers unlinked to the PAX6 gene cascade, cofactors of PAX6, or environmental conditions.

Although aniridia and anterior segment anomalies including the Peter anomaly are distinct clinical entities, in our patient, aniridia resulting from deletion of one copy of PAX6 may be modified.

### Anterior segment dysgenesis associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome: a case report and review of the literature [^d9bddd9e]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) disorders may display a wide variety of developmental conditions affecting the cornea, iris, ciliary body, anterior chamber and lens. The condition could be isolated or related to a systemic disease. A number of genes have been linked to anterior segment morphogenesis, coding the migration of the neural crest cells, but also regulating mesenchymal cell differentiation of the anterior segment tissues. For instance, a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) is associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, iridogoniodysgenesis syndrome, and sporadic cases of Peters' anomaly. A forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) is considered to be a cause for primary congenital glaucoma, autosomal dominant iridogoniodysgenesis anomaly and Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly. A paired box gene 6 (PAX6) leads to ocular tissue arrest, such as in aniridia, and has also been associated with Peters' anomaly.

Hereby, we report the case of a 6-year-old girl with a clinical phenotype of WBS, associated with unilateral anterior segment dysgenesis and bilateral cleft of the soft and hard palate. These phenotypic features have not been linked so far to the haploinsufficiency of genes involved in the WBS 7q11.23 microdeletion in other reports.

### Mutations in CPAMD8 cause a unique form of autosomal-recessive anterior segment dysgenesis [^5c7ed787]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Anterior segment dysgeneses (ASDs) comprise a spectrum of developmental disorders affecting the anterior segment of the eye. Here, we describe three unrelated families affected by a previously unclassified form of ASD. Shared ocular manifestations include bilateral iris hypoplasia, ectopia lentis, corectopia, ectropion uveae, and cataracts. Whole-exome sequencing and targeted Sanger sequencing identified mutations in CPAMD8 (C3 and PZP-like alpha-2-macroglobulin domain-containing protein 8) as the cause of recessive ASD in all three families. A homozygous missense mutation in the evolutionarily conserved alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) domain of CPAMD8, c.4351T > C (p. Ser1451Pro), was identified in family 1. In family 2, compound heterozygous frameshift, c.2352_2353insC (p. Arg785Glnfs ∗ 23), and splice-site, c.4549-1G > A, mutations were identified. Two affected siblings in the third family were compound heterozygous for splice-site mutations c.700+1G > T and c.4002+1G > A. CPAMD8 splice-site mutations caused aberrant pre-mRNA splicing in vivo or in vitro. Intriguingly, our phylogenetic analysis revealed rodent lineage-specific CPAMD8 deletion, precluding a developmental expression study in mice. We therefore investigated the spatiotemporal expression of CPAMD8 in the developing human eye. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization revealed CPAMD8 expression in the lens, iris, cornea, and retina early in development, including strong expression in the distal tips of the retinal neuroepithelium that form the iris and ciliary body, thus correlating CPAMD8 expression with the affected tissues. Our study delineates a unique form of recessive ASD and defines a role for CPAMD8, a protein of unknown function, in anterior segment development, implying another pathway for the pathogenicity of ASD.

### Familial juvenile normal-tension glaucoma with anterior segment dysgenesis: a clinical report of a new phenotype [^bf8650f6]. Journal of Glaucoma (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a new familial syndrome consisting of anterior segment dysgenesis, glaucomatous optic neuropathy, and intraocular pressure (IOP) in the normal range.

Design

Observational case series.

Methods

Subjects were available for examination from a 2-generation pedigree. Ophthalmic examination and photography, visual field examination, and optical coherence tomography of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer were performed. In some subjects, medical work-up was performed.

Results

Eight affected subjects were identified. All had signs of Axenfeld-like anterior segment dysgenesis, ranging from a single fine iris process to diffuse broad iris synechiae extending to a prominent posterior embryotoxon. Four of the 8 subjects had glaucoma-appearing optic nerve heads with corresponding visual field defects; in a fifth subject, glaucoma was suspected on the basis of optic nerve appearance, but the visual field was full. IOP was consistently in the low-teens to mid-teens except in 1 eye in which it was 22 mm Hg, the highest recorded pressure in all examined subjects.

Conclusions

A new phenotype is presented, characterized by IOP in the normal range, glaucomatous-appearing optic nerve cupping, and anterior segment dysgenesis. The suggested mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant with marked intrafamilial variability.

### Anterior segment dysgenesis associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome: a case report and review of the literature [^bef8f1fd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the presented case, the clinical features such as elfin face, muscular hypotonia, patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus, mild mental retardation, as well as the peculiar behavior, suggested the diagnosis of WBS.

The previously reported ocular findings in this patient with WBS included a characteristic stellate pattern of the anterior iris stroma and retinal vascular tortuosity in the left eye. The novel findings were a microphthalmia and an ASD in a form of Peters' anomaly in the right eye. Consistent with WBS, a deletion was found in the 7q11.23 region. It is not clear however, if there is an association between the deletion in the 7q11.23 region and the described unilateral ASD. While so far no genes in the deleted WBS region are known to affect the anterior segment, most genes in the 7q11.23 region are poorly understood, with the exception of ELN. As a result of mutation of one of the ELN alleles, a genetic link between infantile esotropia and WBS has already been hypothesized. Identified to cause connective-tissue and vascular anomalies, the ELN has also been suggested to contribute to extraocular manifestations, such as the elfin face.

### Axenfeld-rieger syndrome: new perspectives [^20312264]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is a genetic disease affecting multiple organ systems. In the eye, this condition manifests with varying degrees of anterior segment dysgenesis and carries a high risk of glaucoma. Other associated systemic issues include cardiovascular outflow tract malformations, craniofacial abnormalities and pituitary abnormalities, which can result in severe endocrinological sequelae. Recent advances in molecular genetics have identified two major genes, PITX2 and FOXC1, demonstrating a wide spectrum of mutations, which aids in the molecular diagnosis of the disease, although evidence exists to implicate other loci in this condition. The management of individuals affected by Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome requires a multidisciplinary approach and would include dedicated surveillance and management of glaucoma, sensorineural hearing loss, and cardiac, endocrinological, craniofacial and orthopaedic abnormalities.

### Novel PXDN biallelic variants in patients with microphthalmia and anterior segment dysgenesis [^030c05d7]. Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and anterior segment dysgenesis are severe ocular developmental defects. There is a wide genetic heterogeneity leading to these ocular malformations. By using whole genome, exome and targeted sequencing in patients with ocular developmental anomalies, six biallelic pathogenic variants (including five novel variants) were identified in the PXDN gene in four families with microphthalmia and anterior segment dysgenesis. Only 11 different mutations (11 families) have been described in this gene to date. The phenotype of these patients is variable in severity, ranging from cataract and developmental glaucoma to complex microphthalmia. Interestingly, two unrelated patients of our series presented with an ocular phenotype including aniridia and microspherophakia. However, despite various phenotypic presentations and types of mutations, no genotype-phenotype correlation could be made. Thus, this work improves our knowledge of the recessive phenotype associated with biallelic variants in this gene and highlights the importance of screening PXDN in patients with anterior segment dysgenesis with or without microphthalmia.

### A novel missense variant expands the phenotype and genotype of PAX6-associated foveal hypoplasia accompanied by various manifestations of anterior segment dysgenesis [^6326fbc6]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

A pair of fraternal twins and their mother visited the consulting room in Beijing Tongren Hospital in August 2021, complaining of bilateral symmetrical corectopia and low vision. Thus, comprehensive ophthalmological and physical examinations were performed for them, and gene detection was conducted in this pedigree since the symptoms exhibited obvious genetic tendency. This study adhered to the Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. Written informed consents were obtained from all the participants or their guardians after exhaustive explanation of the study. The whole protocol was approved by the ethical review committee of Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University.

Clinical evaluation

The birth history and development of the twins were carefully asked and recorded. So did the family history and history of gestation and delivery. The anterior segments of the patients were inspected by slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Other routine examinations included visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and ocular motility. The adults underwent ophthalmic ultrasound, ultrasonic biomicroscopy (UBM), optical coherence tomography (OCT) for the posterior segments, and wide-field fundus imaging. For the pre-school fraternal twins, OCT for the anterior segments was performed instead of the UBM due to lack of coorperation. Gonioscopy and visual field test were also performed on the mother. Since the ophthalmic signs demonstrated obvious genetic tendency, the paternal grandmother, the maternal grandfather and his mother and four siblings were also invited to undergo comprehensive examinations of their eyes in local hospitals.

FH was distinguished into four grades according to morphology by OCT: grade 1 with shallow foveal pit, presence of outer nuclear layer (ONL) widening, presence of outer segment (OS) lengthening; grade 2 as grade 1 but absence of foveal pit; grade 3 as grade 2 but absence of OS lengthening; grade 4 as grade 3 but absence of ONL widening.

### Ophthalmological manifestations of axenfeld-rieger syndrome: current perspectives [^936888ba]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

ARS Genetics and Pathogenesis

ARS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with eye and systemic findings showing complete and incomplete penetrance, respectively. Family-based studies and linkage analysis identified that mutations in two genes, Paired-like Homeodomain 2 (PITX2) and Forehead Box C1 (FOXC1), are causative in approximately half of ARS cases. The PITX2 gene is located on 4q25, while the FOXC1 gene is localized to 6p25, and both genes encode for transcription factors predominantly expressed during embryogenesis. Disease causing mutations in PITX2 and FOXC1 are classified as type I and type III ARS. Type II ARS has been localized to 13q14, and a separate isolated case was associated with 16q24 deletion; however, the specific genes involved have yet to be identified. Further, anterior segment dysgenesis, and in some cases specifically referenced as ARS, has also been associated with mutations in CYP1B1, COL4A1, PAX6, FOXE3, CPAMD8, and PXDN. In addition, genetic testing utilizing targeted gene panels for anterior segment dysgenesis fails to identify gene mutations in many ARS patients indicating that much knowledge is still to be gained regarding the genetics of this disease.

### CPAMD8 loss-of-function underlies non-dominant congenital glaucoma with variable anterior segment dysgenesis and abnormal extracellular matrix [^5694f979]. Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Abnormal development of the ocular anterior segment may lead to a spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) to variable anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). The main objective of this study was to identify the genetic alterations underlying recessive congenital glaucoma with ASD (CG-ASD). Next-generation DNA sequencing identified rare biallelic CPAMD8 variants in four patients with CG-ASD and in one case with PCG. CPAMD8 is a gene of unknown function and recently associated with ASD. Bioinformatic and in vitro functional evaluation of the variants using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and minigene analysis supported a loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism. Optical and electron microscopy of the trabeculectomy specimen from one of the CG-ASD cases revealed an abnormal anterior chamber angle, with altered extracellular matrix, and apoptotic trabecular meshwork cells. The CPAMD8 protein was immunodetected in adult human ocular fluids and anterior segment tissues involved in glaucoma and ASD (i.e., aqueous humor, non-pigmented ciliary epithelium, and iris muscles), as well as in periocular mesenchyme-like cells of zebrafish embryos. CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of this gene in F0 zebrafish embryos (96 hpf) resulted in varying degrees of gross developmental abnormalities, including microphthalmia, pharyngeal maldevelopment, and pericardial and periocular edemas. Optical and electron microscopy examination of these embryos showed iridocorneal angle hypoplasia (characterized by altered iris stroma cells, reduced anterior chamber, and collagen disorganized corneal stroma extracellular matrix), recapitulating some patients' features. Our data support the notion that CPAMD8 loss-of-function underlies a spectrum of recessive CG-ASD phenotypes associated with extracellular matrix disorganization and provide new insights into the normal and disease roles of this gene.

### Variants of anterior segment dysgenesis and cerebral involvement in a large family with a novel COL4A1 mutation [^5f533f55]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the diverse ocular manifestations and identify the causative mutation in a large family with autosomal dominant anterior segment dysgenesis accompanied in some individuals by cerebral vascular disease.

Design

Retrospective observational case series and laboratory investigation.

Methods

Forty-five family members from 4 generations underwent ophthalmic examination. Molecular genetic investigation included analysis with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and DNA sequencing. Whole exome sequencing was performed in 1 individual.

Results

A broad range of ocular manifestations was observed. Typical cases presented with corneal clouding, anterior synechiae, and iris hypoplasia. Posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, and early cataract development were also seen. One obligate carrier and several other family members had minor ocular anomalies, thus confounding the scoring of affected and unaffected individuals. Cerebral hemorrhages had occurred in 4 individuals, in 3 at birth or during the first year of life. Seven patients with corneal clouding were considered "definitely affected" for linkage studies. Haplotype mapping revealed that they shared a 14 cM region in the terminal part of chromosome 13q that included the locus for COL4A1. The affected family members were heterozygous for a novel COL4A1 sequence variant c.4881C > G (p. Asn1627Lys) predicted to be damaging and not found among 185 local blood donors. Exome sequencing showed that this variant was the only one in the candidate region not found in dbSNP.

Conclusion

Among the family members shown to carry the novel COL4A1 mutation, heterogenous presentations of anterior segment dysgenesis was seen. Testing family members for this mutation also made a definite diagnosis possible in patients with a clinical presentation difficult to classify. In families where anterior segment dysgenesis occurs together with cerebral hemorrhages, genetic analysis of COL4A1 should be considered.

### Mutations in the human forkhead transcription factor FOXE3 associated with anterior segment ocular dysgenesis and cataracts [^af06dbd4]. Human Molecular Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

Dysgenesis of the anterior segment of the eye delineates a spectrum of human developmental disorders that show wide phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. It is also frequently associated with cataracts and glaucoma resulting in visual disability in childhood. The recently described forkhead transcription factor gene Foxe3 was shown to be involved in the dysgenetic lens phenotype in mice, which is characterized by small cataractic lens and anterior segment anomalies. Here we report an identification and characterization of the human ortholog of this gene, FOXE3. The gene was found to be expressed in the anterior lens epithelium and to be mutated in patients with ocular disorders. An insertion of G in the coding region of the FOXE3 gene that occurred 15 nucleotides upstream of the stop codon was identified in a family with anterior segment ocular dysgenesis and cataracts. The mutation causes a frameshift that results in an abnormal sequence of five terminal amino acids and an addition of 111 amino acids to the predicted protein. The mutation was present in two affected individuals from this family and was not identified in 180 normal control chromosomes.

### Ophthalmological manifestations of axenfeld-rieger syndrome: current perspectives [^595ecd8b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Axenfeld Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a clinically and genetically heterogenous group of conditions characterized by anterior segment dysgenesis of the eye and varying degrees of systemic congenital abnormalities. The disease was first recognized by Axenfeld in 1920 who reported a patient with anterior displacement of Schwalbe's line (posterior embryotoxon) in combination with corectopia. In 1934, Rieger described two patients with "mesodermal dysgenesis" consisting of iris hypoplasia, pseudopolycoria, and posterior embryotoxon. Due to phenotypic similarities, the cases described by Axenfeld and Rieger were considered as part of the same group of disorders known today as ARS.

ARS occurs in 1 of 100,000–200,000 live births. Further, there is no gender or racial predilection and has been reported in ethnic groups in Europe, Africa, North and South America, Middle East, and Asia. Mutations in the PITX2 and FOXC1 genes, which are crucial for normal embryologic development of the anterior segment and other organs affected in ARS, account for 40–60% of cases. Vision loss is most commonly due to glaucoma, which affects more than 50% of individuals with ARS. Thus, although rare, it is important for eye specialists to recognize ARS in order to monitor for glaucoma and potentially arrange care with other specialists.

### Anterior segment dysgenesis associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome: a case report and review of the literature [^91ae46ac]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS, MIM #194050) is a clinically recognizable and recurrent condition associated with a variably-sized hemizygous deletion within band 11.23 of the long arm of chromosome 7, detectable by FISH.

The clinical phenotype of WBS includes mild mental retardation, specific neurocognitive profile, hypercalcemia during infancy, distinctive facial features and cardiovascular diseases. Facial features include prognathism, mild midfacial hypoplasia, as well as a nose with rounded upward turned tip and forward pointing nostrils, prominent lips and a geographic tongue. Cardiovascular diseases related to the syndrome are aortic hypoplasia, which occurs in almost 75% of patients, supravalvular aortic stenosis and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, atrial and ventricular septal defects.

Ocular features, reported as a hallmark of the WBS, are strabismus (29–78%) with predominance of esotropia (52%), especially the hereditary form of infantile esotropia (59%), dissociated vertical deviation (37%), oblique muscle dysfunction (53%), amblyopia (32%), cataract (1.97%) and ptosis (1.32%). Additional ocular features of the syndrome are a stellate pattern of the anterior iris stroma (62–74%) noted especially in individuals with a light colored iris, as well as retinal vascular tortuosity (22%) and a situs inversus vasorum (15%).

Approximately 28 transcribed genes have been mapped in the deleted 7q11.23 Williams-Beuren region, such as: elastin (ELN), replication factor C (RFC), LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), general transcription factor 2 (GTF21), GTF21 repeat domain 1 (GTF21RD1), FK506 binding protein 6 (FKBP6). The best understood ophthalmic feature within the WBS deleted region is in connection with the hemizygosity of ELN.

### A novel missense variant expands the phenotype and genotype of PAX6-associated foveal hypoplasia accompanied by various manifestations of anterior segment dysgenesis [^426f058b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

According to previous reports, PAX6-associated foveal hypoplasia (FH) could usually be accompanied by various anterior segment anomalies including variable iris changes. This study aims to exhibit unusual phenotypes of a novel missense variant of PAX6 from a Chinese pedigree.

Methods

Ophthalmic examinations including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, gonioscopy, ophthalmic ultrasound, ultrasonic biomicroscopy, optical coherence tomography, wide-field fundus imaging, and visual field test were performed to evaluate the clinical manifestations. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and bioinformatics analysis were conducted in eight members from this pedigree to identify the causative mutation.

Results

WES revealed a novel heterozygous substitution of PAX6 (NM_000280.5:c.157G > A, p.(Val53Met) (chr11:31823309 C > T, hg19)), which cosegregated with the phenotype of this pedigree. All the three patients (a pair of fraternal twins and their mother) exhibited bilateral FH and anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) including microcornea, sclerocornea, obvious symmetrical corectopia, iris stromal dysplasia, goniodysgenesis, and abnormal distribution of fundus blood vessels. The girl of the fraternal twins also demonstrated bilateral temporal deviation of lenses and abnormal tissue membrane connecting anterior chamber angle and lens anterior capsule in the right eye. The mother additionally showed apparent cataract bilaterally and cupping of the optic disc in her left eye.

Conclusion

A novel missense variant in PAX6 gene was detected in a Chinese pedigree demonstrating bilateral FH and ASD. It is really distinctive that the ASD involves almost all parts of the anterior segment, and bilateral symmetrical corectopia is the most perceptible sign. This study expands the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of PAX6-associated ocular diseases, and facilitates the understanding of the crucial role that PAX6 plays in the development of the eye. Meanwhile, PAX6 could be considered as a candidate pathogenic gene of bilateral symmetrical corectopia.

Figure 1
Anterior segment findings in ARS. Six eyes of patients with ARS display characteristic anterior segment findings including pseudopolycoria (A), corectopia (B – D), and posterior embryotoxon with varying degrees of iris bridging strands (arrowheads, B – E). Iris hypoplasia can appear as loss of pigment (A), gray-brown appearance (C and D), and featureless with loss of crypts, furrows, and rings (F). Glaucoma affects over 50% of individuals with ARS and elevated IOP in infants and young children can cause Haab's striae (arrows, C and F). Glaucoma drainage devices (stars, A and D) have been implanted in two of the eyes.

In addition to these classic findings, other ocular structures can show abnormalities. Congenital and early-onset cataracts are common; however, lensectomy can be challenging due to corneal abnormalities, poor pupil dilation and iris floppiness. In rare cases, congenital cataracts in ARS can be associated with persistent fetal vasculature and microphthalmia, which further complicates surgical removal. Corneal involvement can be more extensive as eyes can also show Peters anomaly and sclerocornea. These congenital corneal abnormalities especially when coupled with glaucoma (discussed in next section) can predispose for corneal edema and scarring due to decompensation. Although traditionally considered an anterior segment dysgenesis, optic nerve and retinal abnormalities have also been reported in ARS. Optic nerve colobomas, hypoplasia, and dysplasia (Figure 2A), foveal hypoplasia (Figure 2B) and atrophy, and chorioretinal colobomas have all been reported in patients with ARS. The importance of recognizing these other abnormalities as part of the disease spectrum is emphasized by phenotypic variations causing delayed diagnosis in individuals belonging to families with genetically confirmed ARS.

### Clinical utility of genetic testing in 201 preschool children with inherited eye disorders [^d330e774]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A key property to consider in all genetic tests is clinical utility, the ability of the test to influence patient management and health outcomes. Here we assess the current clinical utility of genetic testing in diverse pediatric inherited eye disorders (IEDs).

Methods

Two hundred one unrelated children (0–5 years old) with IEDs were ascertained through the database of the North West Genomic Laboratory Hub, Manchester, UK. The cohort was collected over a 7-year period (2011–2018) and included 74 children with bilateral cataracts, 8 with bilateral ectopia lentis, 28 with bilateral anterior segment dysgenesis, 32 with albinism, and 59 with inherited retinal disorders. All participants underwent panel-based genetic testing.

Results

The diagnostic yield of genetic testing for the cohort was 64% (ranging from 39% to 91% depending on the condition). The test result led to altered management (including preventing additional investigations or resulting in the introduction of personalized surveillance measures) in 33% of probands (75% for ectopia lentis, 50% for cataracts, 33% for inherited retinal disorders, 7% for anterior segment dysgenesis, 3% for albinism).

Conclusion

Genetic testing helped identify an etiological diagnosis in the majority of preschool children with IEDs. This prevented additional unnecessary testing and provided the opportunity for anticipatory guidance in significant subsets of patients.

### A bird's eye view on the use of whole exome sequencing in rare congenital ophthalmic diseases [^6ecbe415]. Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital ocular malformations may affect any part of the eye and the ocular adnexa. The major early morphological events in the development of the eye can be broadly summarized into four main steps: (i) formation of the optic vesicle, (ii) induction of lens, (iii) organization of early retina, and (iv) fusion of the optic fissure. Developmental defects may occur in isolation or as part of a larger systemic malformation syndrome. A significant number of congenital ocular anomalies indeed involve the anterior segment of the eye.

Congenital anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) refers to a spectrum of congenital disorders involving abnormal development of the anterior segment of the eye, i.e. the cornea, iris, trabecular meshwork, ciliary body, and lens. Approximately 50% of ASD patients will develop glaucoma, typically at a young age. ASD encompasses a variety of conditions, such as Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome (ARS), aniridia, coloboma, congenital glaucoma, Gillespie syndrome, microphthalmia, and Peters anomaly (PA), among others. The main characteristics of these disorders are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

Patients with craniosynostosis with subnormal vision due to papilledema and/or exposure-related corneal decompensation are well documented in the literature; however, there is only a single prior documented case of vision compromise secondary to anterior segment dysgenesis and glaucoma in this patient population. This report highlights a case of syndromic craniosynostosis with advanced corneal decompensation and anterior segment dysgenesis that was masked and ultimately delayed the diagnosis of congenital glaucoma.

### Real-world clinical and molecular management of 50 prospective patients with microphthalmia, anophthalmia and / or ocular coloboma [^7a1a3ac4]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Microphthalmia, anophthalmia and ocular coloboma (MAC) fall within the same phenotypic spectrum of ocular maldevelopment. Anophthalmia is defined as no visible ocular globe, while microphthalmia consists of a small eye (axial length ≥ 2 SD below the normal axial length), both of which are caused by disrupted eye development, resulting in failure to initiate or premature arrest of oculogenesis. Ocular coloboma is a persistent inferonasal tissue defect arising from incomplete fusion of the optic fissure, affecting one or more structures including the iris, ciliary body and retina.MAC may present in one or both eyes (unilateral/bilateral) and can occur in combination (mixed) within the same eye or contralateral eyes. MAC can be simplex, with no additional ocular complications, but frequently manifests with complex associated features including cataracts and anterior segment dysgenesis. Furthermore, between 33% and 95% of patients display extraocular involvement (syndromic).MAC has a combined prevalence of between 1 and 4 live births per 10 000and often results in reduced visual acuity, contributing up to 15% of childhood blindness and severe visual impairment worldwide.

Genetic or environmental factors disturbing eye development from 3 weeks of gestation can cause MAC by altering molecular signalling pathways regulating oculogenesis. Over 100 monogenic associations with MAC have been identified as well as large chromosomal anomalies detected in up to 15% of patients through conventional cytogenetics, although lower rates are reported in non-syndromic cohorts (8%). Clinical heterogeneity in MAC cohorts is partially due to the spectrum of causative genes playing diverse roles in controlling multiorgan/tissue development. Discovering genotype–phenotype correlations can guide patient management and genetic counselling. While a genetic cause can be identified in 80% of bilateral severe microphthalmia and anophthalmia patients, only 10% of unilateral patients typically receive a molecular diagnosis. Improving molecular diagnostic rates through increased genetic testing and identification of novel variants will improve understanding of genotype–phenotype relationships.

This study reports clinical evaluation and genetic testing results of 50 MAC patients referred to Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) NHS Foundation Trust ocular genetics service prospectively over a 29-month period.

### Mutations in CPAMD8 cause a unique form of autosomal-recessive anterior segment dysgenesis [^cd8a991e]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Consistent with the RT-PCR findings, ISH results revealed robust CPAMD8 expression in the developing embryonic neural retina from the seventh to the eighth week, whereas lower expression was detected in the embryonic lens (Figures 4 A and 4B). Notably, ISH revealed strong expression of CPAMD8 in the distal tips of the retinal neuroepithelium that contributes to the development of the iris and ciliary body by the eighth week (Figure 4 D and 4E). Interestingly, ISH did not detect significant embryonic expression of CPAMD8 in the periocular mesenchyme, or in the mesenchyme anterior to the lens, corresponding to the pupillary membrane and developing cornea at CS 23 (Figure 4 E), whereas CPAMD8 expression was readily detected by RT-PCR at later stages in the fetal lens, iris, and cornea. The pupillary membrane contributes to the development of iris stroma and will degenerate during the eighth month of gestation. Thus, the CPAMD8 expression profile in the developing anterior segment of the embryonic and fetal eye correlates with the affected tissues and ocular phenotype, characterized by predominant iris and lens anomalies with the appearance of possible persistent pupillary membrane remnants in one affected individual. Our data imply that impaired CPAMD8 function disrupts the normal development of the lens and iris structures. Signaling from the lens during development has been shown to have an important role in forming the structures of the anterior segment, suggesting that the perturbed CPAMD8 function in the developing lens could be another contributory factor in the maldevelopment of the iris in these individuals.

### Anterior segment dysgenesis in a child with factor VII deficiency [^36015e39]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the first case of anterior segment dysgenesis associated with factor VII congenital deficit (hypoproconvertinemia).

Method

A 2-month-old child with factor VII deficiency was referred to our clinic because of corneal opacities. The child was born to consanguineous parents and severe factor VII deficiency was diagnosed on the third day of life because of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Result

Ocular examination under anesthesia showed bilateral corneal opacities with adherent iris strands and peripheral anterior synechiae. The intra-ocular pressure was normal in both eyes and there were neither signs of cataracts nor glaucomatous optic nerve damage.

Conclusion

This observation provide new information on the possible ocular findings in patients with hypoproconvertinemia. Based on this report, we suggest that careful coagulation screening should be considered in children who possess idiopathic anterior segment dysgenesis aiming at identifying the possible coagulation disorder.

### Genetics of congenital corneal opacification – impact on diagnosis and treatment [^c3c0b0d5]. Cornea (2015). Low credibility.

As our understanding of phenotype has improved with improving anterior segment imaging, it has become increasingly clear that the early genotype-phenotype correlations were largely misled by inaccurate phenotyping. Using a novel classification, congenital or neonatal corneal opacification can be considered to be primary or secondary. Secondary corneal disease may be developmental or acquired. Genetic analysis using this phenotypic classification becomes easier to navigate. Primary corneal disease includes endothelial dystrophies, corneal dermoids, cornea plana, and CYP1B1 cytopathy. Genotyping for all these conditions is reasonably advanced. Secondary developmental corneal disease includes entities that are the least well understood genotypically. These are kerato-irido-lenticular dysgenesis (also known as Peters anomaly, types 1 and 2). The genotyping literature of these conditions is littered with confusion. Iridocorneal adhesions (Peters anomaly 1) are often avascular, whereas keratolenticular adhesions (Peters anomaly 2) are usually vascularized. Children with a known molecular diagnosis can have iridocorneal adhesion in one eye and keratolenticular adhesion in the other eye. This further supports the notion that Peters anomaly 1 or 2 is a sign and not a diagnosis. Further types of kerato-irido-lenticular dysgenesis are those in which the lens fails to form or forms and then degenerates. Genotyping in these cases has been somewhat more fruitful but, as always, not comprehensive. If the lens fails to form or forms partially, the gene involved is FOXE3, which is a lens gene. Not surprisingly, if the lens forms partially or fails to form, this has an effect on the vitreous and the drainage angle. These cases are often associated with severe glaucoma. Other secondary developmental corneal diseases may include Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, Aniridia, and primary congenital glaucoma, all of which have specific genotypic characterization. Other secondary causes are acquired and include infection, trauma, and metabolic disorders.

### Molecular genetics of axenfeld-rieger malformations [^132f2821]. Human Molecular Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

Axenfeld-Rieger (AR) malformations are autosomal dominant developmental defects of the anterior segment of the eye, and often result in glaucomatous blindness. AR malformations are associated with mutations in two transcription factor genes (PITX2 and FOXC1) expressed throughout eye ontogeny. Studies of disease-associated mutant proteins have provided insights into the aetiology of AR malformations, while delineating residues and domains important to DNA binding, transactivation and nuclear localization. The availability of mouse models for both PITX2 and FOXC1 has allowed detailed study of their expression and mutant phenotypes. Dissection of the normal functions and domain structures of these factors will aid in future elucidation of how alterations of the developmental program produce the dysgenic phenotypes seen in AR. There are at least two AR loci still awaiting molecular cloning on chromosomes 13q14 and 16q24. Identification of further genes implicated in aberrations of human ocular development will advance our understanding of the mechanisms whereby pattern is established in the eye, and may be of clinical value in treating the glaucoma that is the most serious consequence of AR malformations.

### Novel mutations in PXDN cause microphthalmia and anterior segment dysgenesis [^407080c7]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

We used exome sequencing to study a non-consanguineous family with two children who had anterior segment dysgenesis, sclerocornea, microphthalmia, hypotonia and developmental delays. Sanger sequencing verified two Peroxidasin (PXDN) mutations in both sibs — a maternally inherited, nonsense mutation, c.1021C > T predicting p.(Arg341*), and a paternally inherited, 23-basepair deletion causing a frameshift and premature protein truncation, c.2375_2397del23, predicting p.(Leu792Hisfs*67). We re-examined exome data from 20 other patients with structural eye defects and identified two additional PXDN mutations in a sporadic male with bilateral microphthalmia, cataracts and anterior segment dysgenesis — a maternally inherited, frameshift mutation, c.1192delT, predicting p.(Tyr398Thrfs*40) and a paternally inherited, missense substitution that was predicted to be deleterious, c.947A > C, predicting p.(Gln316Pro). Mutations in PXDN were previously reported in three families with congenital cataracts, microcornea, sclerocornea and developmental glaucoma. The gene is expressed in corneal epithelium and is secreted into the extracellular matrix. Defective peroxidasin has been shown to impair sulfilimine bond formation in collagen IV, a constituent of the basement membrane, implying that the eye defects result because of loss of basement membrane integrity in the developing eye. Our finding of a broader phenotype than previously appreciated for PXDN mutations is typical for exome-sequencing studies, which have proven to be highly effective for mutation detection in patients with atypical presentations. We conclude that PXDN sequencing should be considered in microphthalmia with anterior segment dysgenesis.

### A novel missense variant expands the phenotype and genotype of PAX6-associated foveal hypoplasia accompanied by various manifestations of anterior segment dysgenesis [^6bcccc9f]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Meanwhile, in addition to iris changes, all the three patients also demonstrated other anterior segment abnormalities including microcornea, sclerocornea and goniodysgenesis (including abnormal tissue membrane in the fraternal twins and dense comb-like iris roots inserting anterior to the Schwalbe line in the mother), and presenile cataract was observed in the lenses of the two females. That is to say, phenotype of this variant could demonstrate bilateral FH and ASD involving almost all parts of the anterior segment including cornea, iris, anterior chamber and lens, which distinguishes this variant from previously reported ones.

Apart from the variant (p.(Val53Met)) identified in this study, Grønskov K and colleagues reported a female with the variant p.(Val53Leu) demonstrated circumpupillary iris aplasia with fine strands crossing the pupillary area; In the study of Cross E et al. a male with the variant p.(Val53Gly) exhibited cataracts and nystagmus. Although these single nucleotide variants above affected the same amino-acid residue, they led to different phonotypic presentations. Further studies may detect a broader clinical spectrum.

Given the symmetrical dislocation of the pupils and lenses present in the twin-girl, we once take the diagnosis of ELP into consideration before gene detection. Typical ELP is characterized by symmetrically displaced pupils and lenses, in which the pupils are generally displaced in a direction opposite to that of the ectopic lenses. Recent years, diagnosis of ELP has been broadened to ectopic lenses, the imperative sign, with pupillary abnormalities such as ectopia pupillae, persistent pupillary membrane, iris transillumination, and poor pupillary dilation, and mutations of the gene ADAMTSL4, which was inherited autosomal-recessively was found responsible for this entity. In our study, only the twin girl presented manifestations of the anterior segments consistent with ELP, the boy and their mother exhibited no ectopic lenses. More importantly, their autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern was contrary to that of ELP. Therefore, the diagnosis of ELP was ruled out after gene detection.

### A review of the role of ultrasound biomicroscopy in glaucoma associated with rare diseases of the anterior segment [^686ef968]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Glaucoma in mesodermal dysgenesis of the neural crest

The migration of neural crest cells leads to the formation of many structural components of the ocular anterior segment, including corneal endothelium, keratocytes, iris stroma, melanocytes, and the trabecular meshwork. Thus, an abnormal maturation of neuroectodermal cells can lead to various syndromes involving the anterior segment. The Axenfeld–Rieger anomaly, Peter's anomaly, iris hypoplasia or aniridia, and congenital glaucoma, can arise due to developmental arrest or an altered migration of neural crest cells at a late stage of pregnancy.

Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome is an autosomal-dominant condition associated with mutations of PITX2, FOXC1 shown with genetic analysis. In this syndrome glaucoma is present in 50% of patients. The pathogenesis is characterized by atypical maturation of neuroectodermal cells but an altered primordial endothelial cell layer causing chamber angle anomalies has also been suggested. Histological sections have revealed malformations of Schlemm's canal and the trabecular meshwork, these alterations coincide with the UBM features of a prominent or anterior positioned Schwalbe's line. Other characteristic UBM features seen in this condition are iridocorneal fiber filaments, high insertion of the iris into the posterior part of the trabecular meshwork, peripheral anterior synechiae, and atrophic iris (Figure 1).

### Clinical and genetic features in autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy in Chinese cohort [^80134de9]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Phenotypic presentations

ARB exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, encompassing a range of unusual features and certain specific similarities in the anterior segments. These include hyperopia, shallow anterior chambers, ciliary pronation, iris bombe, iridoschisis, iris plateau, narrow anterior chamber angles, and reduced axial lengths (AL). The proportion of ARB patients developing angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) due to narrow anterior chamber angles has been reported to be up to 50%, potentially leading to further vision loss. In the present study, 16 of 17 patients (94.11%) had narrow angles, and four patients (26.3%) had ACG with poor visual acuity. While the reasons behind these ocular abnormalities remain unknown, the transcription factors OTX2, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and cone-rod homeobox protein have been shown to modulate ocular developments via BEST1 expression. Notably, OTX2 and MITF have been reported to play a role in the differentiation of anterior segment formation, necessitating preventive LPI for ARB patients with a high risk of ACG.

Authors of this study hypothesized that preventive LPI was performed earlier in patients with ARB than in those with ACG. In this cohort, 14 patients received LPIs because of slightly elevated IOP and ocular abnormalities such as shallow anterior chambers, narrow anterior chamber angles, and reduced AL. However, the results of LPI for lowering IOP may be limited in some ARB patients during long-term follow up due to dysgenesis of the anterior segment, including the dysplastic trabecular meshwork, a shallow anterior chamber, and narrow anterior chamber angles. Of note, Boon et al. suggested that patients with ARB may receive topical antiglaucomatous medication to reduce the IOP further, an approach that was adopted by clinicians for all patients in the present study. Four patients further underwent trabeculectomies and iridotomies to control IOP. The efficacy of early LPI in patients with ARB and the associated effects of various anti-glaucoma surgeries (e.g. trabeculectomy, iridotomy, and glaucoma valve implantation) should be further investigated in additional studies.

### Revealing hidden genetic diagnoses in the ocular anterior segment disorders [^1800c673]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have identified a high diagnostic rate in a cohort of families with ASD, using ES and GS with CNV analysis. These findings add to our understanding of the genetics of ASD, and also highlight the complex heterogeneous nature of this condition, with many syndromal associations and novel genotype–phenotype correlations. This study also has significant implications in recurrence risk counseling for families, and highlights the importance of relying on an accurate genomic diagnosis, rather than pedigree information alone, for genetic counseling. Some of our cohort remain unsolved, and this may be due to additional undiscovered genes, or further variants within known genes such as 5'UTR promoter, cis -regulatory, deep intronic, and other difficult to interpret regions of the genome. These conditions warrant further study to uncover their full genetic basis.

### Mutations in CPAMD8 cause a unique form of autosomal-recessive anterior segment dysgenesis [^916ec29c]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

In family 3, segregation analysis of two heterozygous splice-site variants, c.4002+1G > A and c.700+1G > T, confirmed that both of the affected siblings (II:2 and II:3) are compound heterozygous for the variants, whereas the unaffected mother (I:2) and unaffected granddaughter (III:1) carry the c.700+1G > T variant only (Figure 2 C). Paternal DNA (I:1) was not available for testing. Both c.4002+1G > A and c.700+1G > T variants alter the invariant GT dinucleotide at the splice-donor sites of intron 29 and intron 7, respectively (Figure 3 A), and are predicted to abolish the splice-donor sites. To investigate the effects of these variants on pre-mRNA splicing, RT-PCR (primer sequences are available on request) was performed on RNA extracted from lymphocytes from both affected siblings, which is predicted to produce wild-type and aberrant transcripts given that the affected individuals are compound heterozygous for the splice-site variants. Amplification spanning exons 27–31, encompassing the c.4002+1G > A variant, resulted in two transcripts in both affected siblings. Direct sequencing revealed an abundant aberrant transcript (approximately 470 bp) with exon 29 deleted and a low level of wild-type transcript (Figure 3 D). The mutation therefore rendered the splice donor site inefficient, with only a residual amount of normal splicing. Deletion of exon 29 in the aberrant transcript is predicted to result in an in-frame deletion of 25 aa, (p. Gly1310_Glu1334del), within the highly conserved A2M complement component domain (Figures 3 A and 3D). Amplification of exons 4–10, encompassing the c.700+1G > T variant, revealed several aberrant transcripts and wild-type transcript in both affected siblings. Sequencing revealed a cryptic splice donor site located in intron 7, c.700+142, which is predicted to introduce a premature termination codon 87 bp downstream of exon 7, resulting in a truncated product, p. Gly234Valfs ∗ 30. In addition, two smaller transcripts, corresponding to the skipping of exon 7 alone and both exons 6 and 7, were detected that are predicted to produce truncated products, p. Asp216Alafs ∗ 5 and p. Leu210Alafs ∗ 5, respectively (Figure 3 E). In summary, all splice-site mutations identified in families 2 and 3 caused aberrant pre-mRNA splicing, supporting their likely pathogenicity. Notably, the position of mutations identified in this study implies that only isoforms CPAMD8-1a and/or CPAMD8-1b are important in the pathogenesis of ASD (Figures 3 A and S1).

### Axenfeld-rieger syndrome: more than meets the eye [^130dee23]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Human subjects

DNA was extracted from blood (EDTA tubes) or saliva (OrageneDNA; DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) samples by the Genomic Sciences and Precision Medicine Center or other labs following standard procedures.

Genetic testing was undertaken in our cohort of individuals with anterior segment dysgenesis and early-onset glaucoma phenotypes; 104 of these probands had a clinical diagnosis of ARS prior to genetic analysis. Overall rates of variant detection in ARS were calculated from the 104 probands referred to the study with a clinical diagnosis of ARS. The ARS cohort presented here includes all individuals (and affected family members) with PITX2 (59 individuals from 44 families (19 new individuals/15 new families)) or FOXC1 (69 individuals from 47 families (62 new individuals/41 new families)) variants, regardless of the initial clinical diagnosis. Clinical details were obtained through a combination of notes from referring clinicians, direct interview of participants and/or review of medical records; a standardised clinical history intake form reviewing all relevant systems (eye, craniofacial, hearing, dental, brain, endocrine, abdominal, genitourinary, skeletal, heart, gastrointestinal (GI), pulmonary, other and prenatal history) was completed by referring providers, clinical records review and/or through participant interview in the majority of cases. Counts for each feature were determined based on the number of individuals with specific clinical details available. Primary congenital glaucoma indicates glaucoma diagnosed in the first 2 years of life in the absence of visible anterior segment dysgenesis.MRI images (16 individuals) or reports (2 individuals) were collected and reviewed. Pairwise comparison was performed using χ² analysis in Excel to compare features by gene or type of variant. General population frequencies were obtained from StatPearlsfor rare features (adjusted to X out of 5000 for statistical analysis): Meckel diverticulum, 1/50; imperforate anus, 1/5000; hypospadias, 1/250 men; CHD, 9/1000; hip dysplasia, 5/1000; congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT), 1/500; pectus excavatum, 1/400; and pectus carinatum, 3/5000.

### Anterior segment dysgenesis associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome: a case report and review of the literature [^f15225cd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Anterior segment photograph, left eye. Figure 1 depicts an anterior segment photograph, presenting a central clouding and vascularized microcornea of the right eye; no pathological findings of the left eye were recorded.

On ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), anterior chamber structures of the right eye were difficult to differentiate, showing adhesions from the opacified cornea to the iris with a kerato-irido-lenticular contact to the remnant lens. No iridotrabecular angle could be differentiated. The central corneal defect was hyperechogenic and showed irregularity in deepness with a paracentral crater-like depression of the posterior cornea (Figure 2 A). The contralateral eye showed a normal structure of the anterior segment (Figure 2 B). Thus, the UBM findings pointed toward a unilateral anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) in a form of Peters' anomaly. Ophthalmic examinations, as well as chromosome analyses of the parents, including FISH, evaluated with the same probe as the child, were normal.

### Novel CYP1B1 and known PAX6 mutations in anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) [^4575cac1]. Journal of Glaucoma (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study intended to define the underlying genetic defects for 21 index patients affected with different forms of anterior segment dysgenesis. Sequence analysis for the PAX6, PITX2, FOXC1, and CYP1B1 genes has been implemented for this purpose.

Methods

Ten patients affected with Peters anomaly, 8 with Rieger anomaly, and 3 with aniridia were included in this study. All patients underwent a complete eye examination, including anterior segment evaluation, with slit-lamp microsocopy, fundoscopy, tonography, and gonioscopy. Twenty-one intronic primer pairs were used to amplify the coding exons of the FOXC1, CYP1B1, PITX2, and PAX6 genes for sequence analysis on an automated sequencer (ABI 3730).

Results

We were able to detect mutations in 5 of 21 patients with anterior segment malformations. We found mutations in individuals suffering from Rieger anomaly and aniridia, in CYP1B1 and PAX6, respectively. None of the 10 Peters anomaly patients had causative mutations in any of the 4 genes we screened.

Conclusions

Our results suggest primary congenital glaucoma and the anterior segment dysgenesis disorders may share a common molecular pathophysiology in the CYP1B1 pathway.

### PITX2 and FOXC1 spectrum of mutations in ocular syndromes [^af02fb03]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) encompasses a broad spectrum of developmental conditions affecting anterior ocular structures and associated with an increased risk for glaucoma. Various systemic anomalies are often observed in ASD conditions such as Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) and De Hauwere syndrome. We report DNA sequencing and copy number analysis of PITX2 and FOXC1 in 76 patients with syndromic or isolated ASD and related conditions. PITX2 mutations and deletions were found in 24 patients with dental and/or umbilical anomalies seen in all. Seven PITX2-mutant alleles were novel including c.708_730del, the most C-terminal mutation reported to date. A second case of deletion of the distant upstream but not coding region of PITX2 was identified, highlighting the importance of this recently discovered mechanism for ARS. FOXC1 deletions were observed in four cases, three of which demonstrated hearing and/or heart defects, including a patient with De Hauwere syndrome; no nucleotide mutations in FOXC1 were identified. Review of the literature identified several other patients with 6p25 deletions and features of De Hauwere syndrome. The 1.3-Mb deletion of 6p25 presented here defines the critical region for this phenotype and includes the FOXC1, FOXF2, and FOXQ1 genes. In summary, PITX2 or FOXC1 disruptions explained 63% of ARS and 6% of other ASD in our cohort; all affected patients demonstrated additional systemic defects with PITX2 mutations showing a strong association with dental and/or umbilical anomalies and FOXC1 with heart and hearing defects. FOXC1 deletion was also found to be associated with De Hauwere syndrome.

### Allelic heterogeneity contributes to variability in ocular dysgenesis, myopathy and brain malformations caused by col4a1 and col4a2 mutations [^c3cdca60]. Human Molecular Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Col4a1 and Col4a2 mutations cause highly penetrant anterior and posterior ocular dysgenesis

To investigate if allelic heterogeneity contributes to phenotypic variability, we analyzed an allelic series of Col4a1 and Col4a2 mutant mice comprising a splice site mutation and seven glycine missense mutations within the triple-helix-forming domains (six in COL4A1, one in COL4A2), and one missense mutation in the globular NC1 domain of COL4A1 (Fig. 1 A). We crossed each mutation onto a uniform, C57BL/6J genetic background and evaluated the effects of allelic differences on three organs that are commonly affected in patients with COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations.

Figure 1.
Col4a1 and Col4a2 mutations cause highly penetrant ocular anterior segment dysgenesis. (A) Schematic representation of COL4A1 and COL4A2 domain structure and the positions of the mutations analyzed in this study; green boxes: putative integrin-binding sites. (B – G) Representative images from slit lamp examination of control (Col4a1 +/+) and mutant (Col4a1 +/mut) eyes showing ocular anterior segment dysgenesis in mutant mice, including open pupil (asterisk), enlarged and torturous iris vasculature, cataracts (arrowhead), iridocorneal adhesion (cross) and enlarged anterior chamber (arrows point to the anterior chamber). (H) The frequency of distinct ocular anterior segment dysgenesis phenotypes caused by different Col4a1 and Col4a2 mutations is shown in the table. The overall severity for each eye was ranked as mild (score = 1), moderate (score = 2) and severe (score = 3), and the average score of each strain is indicated. Note that in Col4a1 +/ Δ ex41 mice a severe open pupil phenotype prevented assessment of iris vasculature abnormalities in a subset of eyes. Between 14 and 32 eyes were analyzed per allele.

### Congenital pterygium with anterior segment dysgenesis: rare ocular manifestation in rubinstein-taybi syndrome [^f498e58e]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Pterygium is a benign, wing-shaped fibrovascular overgrowth of subconjunctival tissue that can encroach over the cornea. This condition usually occurs in individuals aged 20–40 years but is rarely seen in children. We report a case of an infant with Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome presenting with nebulo-macular corneal opacity and congenital pterygium. On examination under anaesthesia, bilateral infero-nasal nebulo-macular corneal opacity (6 × 5mm) with a whitish pink tissue originating from nasal bulbar conjunctiva was noticed. The probe test was negative for this tissue. To the best of our knowledge, only two other cases of congenital pterygium have been reported in the literature. The presence of this anomaly supports the hypothesis of genetic factors having a role in the development of pterygium.

### Ophthalmic manifestations of congenital protein C deficiency: a case report and mini review [^dbaff0ed]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Homozygous protein C (PC) deficiency is a potentially fatal disease with ocular blinding presentation or sequela.

Case presentation

A 5 month-old boy was presented for evaluation of leukocoria. He had a history of frequent bruises and PC deficiency, treated with warfarin.

His intraocular pressure was normal. In the left eye leukoma with anterior segment dysgenesis, shallow anterior chamber, and cataract were observed. Fundus was not visible. B-scan revealed a closed funnel retinal detachment. His right eye had a normal anterior segment and a thin retina with anomalous retinal vascular branching at equator and peripheral retina. A fibrovascular tuft on the optic nerve head with induced traction on superior arcade was visible. Total loss of a and b wave of both were appreciated in electroretinography (ERG). Fluorescein angiography (FA) showed very severe leakage at the junction of the vascularized and non-vascularized retina and optic nerve head. Favorable outcome was achieved with lasering of avascular retina in the right eye.

Conclusion

The potential for protein C deficiency should be assessed in all infants with leukocoria, anterior segment dysgenesis, retinal detachment and retinal dysplasia. Early diagnosis could save the child's life and vision.

### TAD boundary deletion causes PITX2-related cardiac electrical and structural defects [^45527d25]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Of note, exonic coding mutations in PITX2 and potentially upstream regions can lead to Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome characterized by anterior segment dysgenesis, retina and dental features. Interestingly, the phenotype limited to cardiac tissue observed in this new clinical entity points to new cardiac tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms mediating tissue-specific dysregulation of PITX2 expression in cardiac compartments and compartment-specific PITX2 target gene expression remodeling underlying the complex phenotype observed in deletion carriers.

We show that the deletion of the conserved boundary region between the Pitx2- containing TAD and adjacent ncRNA-containing TAD specifically disrupts the spatial regulation of Pitx2 expression in DelB mice, resulting in ectopic expression of Pitx2 in the SAN region and reduced expression in the ventricles. Cardiac expression of other coding genes in the genomic vicinity of the deletion was largely unaffected, which is consistent with the notion that Pitx2 is the only coding gene within the fused TADs. Pitx2 expression is strictly spatiotemporally regulated during embryonic development and plays a key role in left-right asymmetry morphogenesis of several organs including the heart, stomach and gut. In the developing heart, Pitx2 is expressed selectively in the left-sided (derived) parts including the left atrium, left sinus venosus and pulmonary vein. Mouse embryos deficient in Pitx2 develop right isomerism of the atria, form a left-sided SAN, and fail to suppress aspects of the SAN-specific genetic program at the left side –. Conversely, here we see the severe disruption of the SAN-specific genetic program in the right-sided DelB SAN region coinciding with the induction of ectopic Pitx2 expression in the SAN. Among the suppressed genes in DelB SAN tissue are genes encoding the key pacemaker transcription factors Tbx3 and Isl1 and ion channels that drive pacemaker function including Hcn4. Both Tbx3 and Isl1 activate and maintain the pacemaker genetic program in the heart, preventing the expression of genes associated with the working atrial myocardium in the SAN domain and their loss compromises SAN development, culminating in SAN dysfunction. Cardiac-specific ablation of Hcn4 expression in mice results in severe and lethal bradycardia. We confirmed the loss of the pacemaker genetic program in the DelB SAN by comparing differentially expressed genes with those enriched in pacemaker cardiomyocytes. We found additional gain of atrium-specific markers in the DelB SAN tissue. The loss of SAN-associated gene expression, as indicated by a marked reduction in Isl1 and Tbx3 expression, in adult DelB mice indicates that Pitx2 is not only necessary, but also sufficient to suppress the SAN genetic program.

### Combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy as an initial procedure in uncomplicated congenital glaucoma… [^8cd75376]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Results Mean preoperative IOP was 31 mm Hg. Average horizontal corneal diameter was 12. 60 mm. Ninety-five eyes had corneal opacification. Twenty-nine eyes had additional anterior segment anomalies, with ectropion uveae, Peters anomaly, and partial aniridia being the most common. Conclusions Primary combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy was a useful initial procedure in uncomplicated congenital glaucoma. This was particularly true where corneal opacification, as in nearly all our eyes, precluded goniotomy; however, where other stigmata of anterior segment dysgenesis coexisted, results were significantly poorer. In general, when mitomycin was not used, it was because inadvertent ocular penetration or exposure of choroid or ciliary body was believed to preclude its use. A paracentesis was routinely performed, and viscoelastic material was instilled into the anterior chamber. Further dissection of the scleral trapdoor anteriorly into clear cornea followed.

A total of 29 eyes had an abnormal anterior chamber, and 63 eyes had a normal anterior chamber consistent with primary congenital glaucoma. In 8 eyes, no documentation of anterior chamber status was available. Patient demographic data are summarized in Table 1. All patients underwent CTT; of these, 87 eyes received mitomycin. In 8 eyes with completely opacified corneas, 5 had successful results. Five of the 11 eyes in which a surgically related hyphema developed had normal anterior chambers, another 5 eyes had anterior segment anomalies, and the status of the anterior chamber was not available in 1 eye. Of these 11 eyes, 6 had a successful operation, whereas surgery failed in 5. Of these latter 5 eyes, 3 eyes had anterior segment abnormalities, anterior chamber in 1 eye was normal, and status was undocumented in 1 eye. It is possible that the very active reparative process in young children retarded or delayed the occurrence of these mitomycin-associated complications.

Follow-up of 1 year is too short to deduce any definitive conclusions on this issue. It is of interest that there were relatively more surgical failures with the higher dose of mitomycin. It is not clear why.

### Mutations of the CYP1B1 gene in congenital anterior staphylomas [^b9f63f12]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Congenital anterior staphyloma is a rare unilateral or bilateral anomaly and may account for about 11% of congenital corneal opacities. The clinical findings include an enlarged, vascularized, ectatic cornea, with thinning and ectasia of the surrounding anterior segment structures. These findings are associated with marked anterior segment anomalies that can include an iris that is adherent to the posterior corneal surface or a partially absent iris. The crystalline lens may be adherent to the posterior corneal surface, similar to Peters anomaly, be subluxed, or show cataractous changes.–The degree of staphylomatous changes can be variable. In our patients, the corneal ectasia was not as conspicuous, with the staphylomatous changes being more prominent in the limbal region. Limbal staphylomas can occur due to stretching and thinning of the globe, as a result of high intraocular pressure in severe congenital glaucoma. The clinical course in such patients is progressive, often requiring multiple surgical interventions. In contrast, our patients presented at birth with severe anterior segment changes that remained stable and mild-to-moderate intraocular pressure elevations that appeared controlled with medications. In the differential diagnosis, the pathologies considered included severe primary congenital glaucoma with anterior segment dysgenesis and Peters anomaly. There seems to be considerable overlap in the clinical features between these clinical conditions. Though the presenting conditions could be considered as a severe form of anterior segment dysgenesis, it was felt that the term was generic since both patients had phenotypic features that were more consistent with those seen in congenital anterior staphylomas. Peters anomaly presents with central corneal opacities with thinning, and with iris adhesions to the posterior surface. Corneal ectasia, staphylomas, and adherence of the crystalline lens have been reported in cases of Peters Plus syndrome with multiple systemic abnormalities. Both patients in this study showed corneal opacification, ectasia, and vascularization. In addition, our first patient had a dislocated crystalline lenses and the second patient had had congenital aphakia, both of which have been described with Peters anomaly and congenital anterior staphylomas.

### Axenfeld-rieger syndrome and spectrum of PITX2 and FOXC1 mutations [^6fda6c22]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, which encompasses a range of congential malformations affecting the anterior segment of the eye. ARS shows genetic heterogeneity and mutations of the two genes, PITX2 and FOXC1, are known to be associated with the pathogenesis. There are several excellent reviews dealing with the complexity of the phenotype and genotype of ARS. In this study, we will attempt to give a brief review of the clinical features and the relevant diagnostic approaches, together with a detailed review of published PITX2 and FOXC1 mutations.

### Ophthalmic manifestations of congenital protein C deficiency: a case report and mini review [^e6bc2830]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Homozygous protein C (PC) deficiency is a potentially fatal disease with ocular blinding presentation or sequela.

Case Presentation

A 5month-old boy was presented for evaluation of leukocoria. He had a history of frequent bruises and PC deficiency, treated with warfarin. His intraocular pressure was normal. In the left eye leukoma with anterior segment dysgenesis, shallow anterior chamber, and cataract were observed. Fundus was not visible. B-scan revealed a closed funnel retinal detachment. His right eye had a normal anterior segment and a thin retina with anomalous retinal vascular branching at equator and peripheral retina. A fibrovascular tuft on the optic nerve head with induced traction on superior arcade was visible. Total loss of a and b wave of both were appreciated in electroretinography (ERG). Fluorescein angiography (FA) showed very severe leakage at the junction of the vascularized and non-vascularized retina and optic nerve head. Favorable outcome was achieved with lasering of avascular retina in the right eye.

Conclusion

The potential for protein C deficiency should be assessed in all infants with leukocoria, anterior segment dysgenesis, retinal detachment and retinal dysplasia. Early diagnosis could save the child's life and vision.

### Anterior segment dysgenesis associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome: a case report and review of the literature [^e2fd167c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The ELN encodes elastin, a component of collagen tissue of the eye that is also present in the iris stoma. Therefore, the stellate pattern of the iris stroma which is seen in almost 50% of WBS could be hypothesized to be linked to the ELN deletion seen in our patient.

Although, an association between the haploinsufficiency of the ELN gene and the modification of corneal elasticity has been proposed, it seems unlikely as a histological observation has not confirmed the presence of elastin fibers in the examined corneas.

In our patient, using UBM, we were able to exclude the initially suspected corneal ectasia and confirm Peters' anomaly instead, as the paracentral crater-like depression involving the corneal endothelium and the Descemet's membrane, showed a kerato-irido-lenticular contact. In ASD disorders, not only the iris, but also the ciliary body, anterior chamber, lens and cornea are involved. Here, even if the ELN deletion seems to be responsible for the stellate pattern, the ELN alone can not fully explain the Peters' anomaly. In developmental phenotypes it is often difficult to rule out whether there are genetic predispositions that can result in unilaterality. Peters' anomaly has not been reported in WBS patients so far. In WBS an association with another ASD, the Axenfeld-Rieger spectrum, has been described previously. In these patients the WBS was also associated with dental anomalies. Although the PITX2c isoform has been identified to cause the right/ left asymmetry development, no PITX2c mutations have been reported in patients with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome so far. Only an association of asymmetric ASD with dental malformation and brain retardation has been linked to the isoform PITXc expression. In our case, although the ASD was associated with dental abnormalities, a search for PITX2c and related genes was not conducted.

### Comparison of anterior segment abnormalities in individuals with FOXC1 and PITX2 variants [^8a081bb9]. Cornea (2022). Medium credibility.

Axenfeld–Rieger syndrome (ARS, MIM 180500) is a developmental disorder that affects the structures of the anterior segment of the eye, including the cornea, iris, anterior chamber angle, and lens, and in some cases has associated systemic features. ARS includes the disorders such as Axenfeld anomaly, Axenfeld syndrome, Rieger anomaly, and Rieger syndrome. Because these 4 disorders have overlapping ocular and systemic manifestations and result from variants in the same genes, they are considered to be part of a clinical spectrum. ARS is typically inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder showing phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, with sequence variants (SVs) or copy number variation in the FOXC1 (MIM 601090) and PITX2 genes (MIM 601542) accounting for 40% to 70% of the cases. – FOXC1 is a member of the fork-head/winged-helix family of transcription factors and is expressed in human tissues, including the eye, brain, and kidney. PITX2 is a member of the family of homeobox genes and is expressed in teeth, abdominal organs, brain, heart, and kidneys.

### Phenotype expansion of heterozygous FOXC1 pathogenic variants toward involvement of congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT) [^3f263e50]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the most common cause of chronic kidney disease in childhood and adolescence. We aim to identify novel monogenic causes of CAKUT.

Methods

Exome sequencing was performed in 550 CAKUT-affected families.

Results

We discovered seven FOXC1 heterozygous likely pathogenic variants within eight CAKUT families. These variants are either never reported, or present in < 5 alleles in the gnomAD database with ~141,456 controls. FOXC1 is a causal gene for Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 3 and anterior segment dysgenesis 3. Pathogenic variants in FOXC1 have not been detected in patients with CAKUT yet. Interestingly, mouse models for Foxc1 show severe CAKUT phenotypes with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. The FOXC1 variants are enriched in the CAKUT cohort compared with the control. Genotype-phenotype correlations showed that Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome or anterior segment dysgenesis can be caused by both truncating and missense pathogenic variants, and the missense variants are located at the forkhead domain. In contrast, for CAKUT, there is no truncating pathogenic variant, and all variants except one are located outside the forkhead domain.

Conclusion

We thereby expanded the phenotype of FOXC1 pathogenic variants toward involvement of CAKUT, which can potentially be explained by allelism.

### Ophthalmological manifestations of axenfeld-rieger syndrome: current perspectives [^ec23ba0e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a rare congenital disease that is primarily characterized by ocular anterior segment anomalies but is also associated with craniofacial, dental, cardiac, and neurologic abnormalities. Over half of cases are linked with autosomal dominant mutations in either FOXC1 or PITX2, which reflects the molecular role of these genes in regulating neural crest cell contributions to the eye, face, and heart. Within the eye, ARS is classically defined as the combination of posterior embryotoxon with iris bridging strands (Axenfeld anomaly) and iris hypoplasia causing corectopia and pseudopolycoria (Rieger anomaly). Glaucoma due to iridogoniodysgenesis is the main source of morbidity and is typically diagnosed during infancy or childhood in over half of affected individuals. Angle bypass surgery, such as glaucoma drainage devices and trabeculectomies, is often needed to obtain intraocular pressure control. A multi-disciplinary approach including glaucoma specialists and pediatric ophthalmologists produces optimal outcomes as vision is dependent on many factors including glaucoma, refractive error, amblyopia and strabismus. Further, since ophthalmologists often make the diagnosis, it is important to refer patients with ARS to other specialists including dentistry, cardiology, and neurology.

In addition, three sporadic cases with severe PA were found with homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants affecting CYP1B1 (patients 29, 30, 38, Table 1. The cyp1b1 deficient mouse model displays marked loss of collagen and degeneration of the trabecular meshwork. This gene was originally identified as a causative disease gene in autosomal recessive PCG, and findings from this study confirm its significant additional contribution to causation in PA.

### A review of the role of ultrasound biomicroscopy in glaucoma associated with rare diseases of the anterior segment [^4eef4736]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

UBM is a valuable imaging technique for the detailed examination of the anatomical features and structures of the anterior segment of the eye, especially in the context of opacity of the anterior structures, which can greatly limit conventional clinical examination.

In the management of glaucoma, UBM is an important tool that greatly assists the ophthalmologist in the identification of the pathologic mechanisms associated with open angle, angle closure and other sub-types of glaucoma. In glaucoma associated with rare diseases of the anterior segment, such as mesodermal dysgenesis of the neural crest, ICE syndrome, phakomatoses, and metabolic disorders, UBM is especially useful as it provides valuable information on the cornea, anterior chamber, chamber angle, iris, ciliary body, zonules, and lens, allowing a complete assessment of the ocular structures.

Anterior segment optical coherence tomography is a quantitative, noncontact tool for in vivo assessment of the anterior chamber angle. Based on AS-OCT results, previous reports on the ZAP trial suggested that smaller angle width, iris curvature, and light-to-dark changes of the iris were associated with an increased 6-year risk of progression from PACS to PAC. 7, 8 However, angle closure diseases are more prevalent in the elderly, 9, 10 and those reports7, 8 also found that aging was a risk factor for progression in PACS eyes.

The procedure was first performed in the dark condition and then in the light condition. per 1-mm Hg increase), shallower central ACD, and shallower limbal ACD at baseline were associated with an increased 14-year risk of progression to PAC. Central ACD is another established risk factor in the development of angle closure disease. As a key factor of the anterior chamber, central ACD reflects the contribution of lens position to angle crowding.

18 In accordance with this finding, previous studies reported that central ACD was negatively associated with the increased incidence of PACS and PAC over 5 to 10 years in the Chinese PACS population. 19, 20 Additionally, the present study found that limbal ACD was also a predictor for the progression from PACS to PAC during the long term.

### Assessment of the anterior segment of patients with primary congenital glaucoma using handheld optical coherence tomography [^92269dcf]. Eye (2019). Medium credibility.

Another possibility could be that the development of iris structures is prevented after birth due to IOP elevation early in life in PCG. However, in premature babies (example shown in Supplementary Figure 1), we have observed already at the 26th gestational week a well-formed iris structure with a tortuous profile of the anterior limiting layer similar to older subjects. Therefore, iris thinning and other abnormal anterior segment changes, such as anterior iris insertion, are likely to be part of a primary maldevelopment of the AS in PCG. Similarly, a large range of anterior chamber phenotypes have been described within families with identical genetic mutations in anterior segment dysgenesis, such as Axenfeld's, Rieger's, Peters' anomalies, aniridia or PCG.

In adult angle-closure glaucoma, Lai et al. described good visualisation of the structures of the angle with swept-source OCT and showed that OCT is useful in assessing the risk of angle closure. In our study on the single horizontal OCT scan, iris insertion was clearly visualised in 98% of patients showing excellent feasibility. Abnormal anterior iris insertion on a single horizontal scan was found in 12% of PCG patients. Hussein et al. reported anterior iris insertion in 56% eyes with PCG using UBM in older children. UBM allows 360° angle assessment likely to explain a higher detection rate.

### Alagille syndrome: pathogenesis, diagnosis and management [^52f9ff18]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Alagille syndrome (ALGS), also known as arteriohepatic dysplasia, is a multisystem disorder due to defects in components of the Notch signalling pathway, most commonly due to mutation in JAG1 (ALGS type 1), but in a small proportion of cases mutation in NOTCH2 (ALGS type 2). The main clinical and pathological features are chronic cholestasis due to paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, minor vertebral segmentation anomalies, characteristic facies, posterior embryotoxon/anterior segment abnormalities, pigmentary retinopathy, and dysplastic kidneys. It follows autosomal dominant inheritance, but reduced penetrance and variable expression are common in this disorder, and somatic/germline mosaicism may also be relatively frequent. This review discusses the clinical features of ALGS, including long-term complications, the clinical and molecular diagnosis, and management.

### Domain disruption and mutation of the bZIP transcription factor, MAF, associated with cataract, ocular anterior segment dysgenesis and coloboma [^0cba4e57]. Human Molecular Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

Human congenital cataract and ocular anterior segment dysgenesis both demonstrate extensive genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. We identified a family where ocular developmental abnormalities (cataract, anterior segment dysgenesis and microphthalmia) co-segregated with a translocation, t(5;16)(p15.3; q23.2), in both balanced and unbalanced forms. We hypothesized that this altered the expression of a gene of developmental significance in the human lens and ocular anterior segment. Cloning the 16q23.2 breakpoint demonstrated that it transected the genomic-control domain of MAF, a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, first identified as an oncogene, which is expressed in vertebrate lens development and regulates the expression of the eye lens crystallins. The homozygous null mutant Maf mouse embryo demonstrates defective lens formation and microphthalmia. Through mutation screening of a panel of patients with hereditary congenital cataract we identified a mutation in MAF in a three-generation family with cataract, microcornea and iris coloboma. The mutation results in the substitution of an evolutionarily highly conserved arginine with a proline at residue 288 (R288P) in the basic region of the DNA-binding domain of MAF. Our findings further implicate MAF/Maf in mammalian lens development and highlight the role of the lens in anterior segment development. The 16q23.2 breakpoint transects the common fragile site, FRA16D, providing a molecular demonstration of a germline break in a common fragile site.

### Comprehensive phenotypic and functional analysis of dominant and recessive FOXE3 alleles in ocular developmental disorders [^8e201d96]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These data confirm the role of recessive FOXE3 pathogenic variants in microphthalmia associated with primary aphakia and sclerocornea, and dominant pathogenic extension variants in cataracts with variable milder anterior segment dysgenesis. Extraocular features were noted in only one family among 16 in our study, and all carriers of recessive alleles were unaffected.

Including the new families reported here, there are now 27 different recessive FOXE3 pathogenic variants identified in 49 unrelated families. While truncating alleles were less common (9/27 unique alleles), they were more likely to occur in multiple families, so 41/98 disease alleles were truncating, while 57/98 were missense (56) or in-frame deletion alleles. Primary aphakia with corneal opacity and microphthalmia is the typical recessive phenotype, but occasional patients with biallelic variants are reported with dominant-like features of cataract without corneal opacity, typically with one of two specific missense alleles [c.307G > A p.(Glu103Lys) and c.351C > G p.(Asn117Lys)]. Underrecognized associations include normal eye size (unilateral or bilateral) in the context of early-onset glaucoma, iris anomalies and optic nerve anomalies. Given dense corneal opacities, full clinical assessment of FOXE3 defects requires alternative imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, optical coherence tomography (OCT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose; thus, the complete spectrum of FOXE3 ocular defects in many affected individuals may not be fully identified. In prior studies, all individuals with primary aphakia undergoing penetrating keratoplasty were found to have atrophic iris tissue, suggesting that the absence of the lens disrupts iris development; however, since no genetic analysis was performed, the causative variant(s) in these cases may directly affect development of both structures. Indeed, mouse models (dysgenic lens, Foxe3 dyl) support a role for Foxe3 in iris development; Foxe3 +/− mice have intact lens epithelia but hypoplastic iris tissue and iridocorneal and iridolenticular adhesions.

### A naturally occurring canine model of syndromic congenital microphthalmia [^d4986c07]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

The phenotypic variability of microphthalmia can be classified into three main groups: (1) isolated microphthalmia, (2) microphthalmia combined with other ocular defects (cataracts, microphakia, retinal dysplasia or folds, glaucoma, ocular dermoids, and others), and (3) a whole multiorgan condition, including nonocular manifestations consistent with syndromic microphthalmia.

In dogs, nonocular manifestations are varied. Ocular manifestations can be found associated with deafness and albinism described in miniature schnauzers alongside neuronal vacuolation-associated polyneuropathy in boxers. Microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, posterior lenticonus, and retinal dysplasia have been observed in Akita and severe bilateral microphthalmos in a Pomeranian. Microphthalmia has also been described in a Doberman Pinscher along with dysgenesis, hyperplastic primary vitreous, and retinal dysplasia. In Portuguese water dogs (PWDs), microphthalmia with multiple anterior segment defects has been reported. The merle gene is a color dilution gene that lightens the coat color; the most severe ocular anomalies occur in homozygous merles with abundant white hair coat involving the head region. The ocular abnormalities that occur with this condition include microphthalmia.

The PWD breed population has gained popularity and grown in numbers. Nonetheless, the breed originates from three major founding events involving two different kennels. Such limited genetic diversity initially prompted genetic studies of GM1 gangliosidosis and thus the identification of the canine ß-galactosidase gene and its genetic variant followed shortly thereafter by identification of the PRCD gene variant as causally associated with a prevalent form of inherited blindness. More recent studies include Addison's disease in the current breed population, and retinal degeneration caused by a genetic variant in CCDC66.

Shaw and colleagues characterized histologic findings of microphthalmia in PWDs, describing lens abnormality and often multiple additional anterior segment defects. Other histologic lesions were present in a plurality of cases, such as the lack of both the ciliary cleft and trabecular meshwork (47%) and abnormal relationship of anterior segment structures (also 47%). Many of the lesions Shaw and colleagues described were similar to those reported in anterior segment dysgenesis in humans. Two PWDs presented other problems: one had lissencephaly and one had chondrodysplasia.

### Posterior polar cataract is the predominant consequence of a recurrent mutation in the PITX3 gene [^08c36ca8]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The authors recently identified three large genetically unrelated families with an identical 17 base pair duplication mutation in exon 4 of the PITX3 gene. Here, they report the detailed clinical phenotype.

Methods

Affected and unaffected individuals in the three families with autosomal dominant posterior polar cataract underwent full clinical examination and donated blood samples for DNA extraction and molecular genetic studies.

Results

In all three families, an identical 17 base pair duplication mutation in PITX3 was identified which co-segregated with disease status in the family. All affected individuals had bilateral progressive posterior polar cataracts. In one family, posterior polar cataract was the only clinical abnormality but in the other two families, one of 10 affected individuals and four of 11 affected individuals also had anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis (ASMD).

Conclusion

Mutations in the PITX3 gene in humans result in posterior polar cataract and variable ASMD. The gene encodes a transcription factor which has a key role in lens and anterior segment development. The mechanism by which the mutant protein gives rise to such a regional pattern of lens opacity remains to be elucidated.

### Comparison of anterior segment abnormalities in individuals with FOXC1 and PITX2 variants [^b5c45594]. Cornea (2022). Medium credibility.

ARS is associated with both ocular and systemic manifestations. Ocular features are the main manifestation of ARS and include posterior embryotoxon, iris stromal hypoplasia, corectopia, pseudopolycoria, and iris processes. Posterior embryotoxon is frequently seen in ARS but has been reported to occur as a very mild manifestation in up to 8 to 12% of the normal population. Glaucoma is the most serious ocular consequence of ARS and develops in up to 50% of the patients. ARS-associated glaucoma is believed to occur because of reduced facility of aqueous outflow caused by maldevelopment of the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm canal. In addition to glaucoma, amblyopia and strabismus have also been reported. Systemic manifestations of ARS include craniofacial abnormalities (hypertelorism, telecanthus, maxillary hypoplasia, and prognathism), dental abnormalities (microdontia, hypodontia, and oligodontia), cardiac defects (mitral and tricuspid valve disease, atrial septal defects, and tetralogy of Fallot), – skeletal abnormalities (short stature, club feet, and joint abnormalities), hearing loss, redundant periumbilical skin, umbilical hernia, anal stenosis, and hypospadias. Variants in FOXC1 are more commonly associated with isolated ocular abnormalities, but some reports have described associated heart or hearing defects. Variants in PITX2 have been shown to be associated with ocular, dental, and umbilical abnormalities. Corneal abnormalities are commonly reported in Peter anomaly (corneal opacity, iridocorneal synechiae, and an absence of Descemet membrane and corneal endothelium) but are not a common manifestation in ARS. This study aimed to compare detailed anterior segment phenotypes in individuals with ARS caused by FOXC1 and PITX2 variants.

### A review of the role of ultrasound biomicroscopy in glaucoma associated with rare diseases of the anterior segment [^d3e48487]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy is a non-invasive imaging technique, which allows high-resolution evaluation of the anatomical features of the anterior segment of the eye regardless of optical media transparency. This technique provides diagnostically significant information in vivo for the cornea, anterior chamber, chamber angle, iris, posterior chamber, zonules, ciliary body, and lens, and is of great value in assessment of the mechanisms of glaucoma onset. The purpose of this paper is to review the use of ultrasound biomicroscopy in the diagnosis and management of rare diseases of the anterior segment such as mesodermal dysgenesis of the neural crest, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome, phakomatoses, and metabolic disorders.

### Axenfeld-rieger syndrome: a novel histopathologic finding associated with corneal abnormalities [^0f1672f1]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a rare kind of anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). The most common ocular features of ARS are posterior embryotoxon and iris hypoplasia, while some patients may manifest as corneal opacity and edema. However, the current understanding of how ARS affects the cornea is still incomplete. This study reports a novel histopathological finding of ARS, complicating corneal abnormalities, including congenital corneal opacity and irreversible endothelial decompensation.

Methods

This retrospective study included 6 eyes of 3 ARS patients, 5 of which underwent keratoplasty for irreversible endothelial decompensation from May 2016 to January 2019. No eye had a history of surgery. We reviewed the data of epidemiology, clinical manifestations and histopathologic examinations.

Results

Five eyes developed irreversible endothelial decompensation, among which 4 were born with corneal opacity. One eye exhibited transparent cornea but showed a continuous loss of endothelial cells in the absence of surgery and elevated intraocular pressure thereafter. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography photographs showed that anterior synechia existed in the area with corneal opacities, where we found the interlayer splitting of the Descemet membrane inserted by hypoplastic iris and a basement membrane-like structure under a light microscope.

Conclusion

Anterior synechia might be associated with corneal abnormalities in ARS patients. The novel histopathologic finding revealed the internal relation between anterior segment dysgenesis and would help explore the inner mechanism of corneal abnormalities in ARS.

### A novel histopathologic finding in the descemet's membrane of a patient with peters anomaly: a case-report and literature review [^9c273eee]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

In Peters anomaly, the corneal opacity is either central or paracentral and it usually does not exhibit vascularization. Histopathology is often diagnostic. Previous histopathologic findings of Peters anomaly described the defects and absence in the endothelium, Descemet's membrane, posterior stroma and the Bowman's membrane of the cornea, which are consistent with our pathologic findings of this patient. However, the "multiple-layer" structure of the Descemet's membrane has not been reported as in association with abnormalities of the cornea tissues in Peters anomaly. The cause of this unusual structure, which may be due to genetic factors, environmental factors, or both, has not been clearly identified in pathologic studies so far.

Peters anomaly is a genetic disease affecting multiple anterior segments, which is known to be sporadic, but sometimes inherited. Several genetic mutations act in concert to specify a population of mesenchymal progenitor cells, as they migrate anteriorly around the embryonic optic cup. Waring demonstrated various developmental mechanisms for Peters anomaly, including faulty separation of the lens vesicle from the surface ectoderm, primary abnormal migration of neural crest cells into the cornea, and intrauterine corneal inflammation. Development of the ocular anterior segment depends largely on periocular mesenchyme cells, which are derived predominantly from neural crest cells (NCC). Specific and differential cell adhesion is expected to be instrumental in induction, migration, and differentiation of NCC. Tian et al demonstrated that NCC-specific inactivation of p120 catenin mice perturbs the proper development of certain eye structures and causes anterior segment dysgenesis, including adhesion of the iris to the cornea, hypoplasia of iris and ciliary body, and dysgenesis of cornea, trabecular meshwork, and Schlemm's canal.

Peters anomaly shows diverse clinical/pathologic features and visual outcomes. Consistent with previous findings, our case has discovered diverse histopathologic features of the cornea layers, especially in the Descemet's membrane. However, little is known of the development of the abnormal Descemet's membrane in patients with Peters anomaly. Although this observation does not imply causation and there still are many "unknown areas" in the pathological diagnosis of this special structure, such pathological findings need to be reported to enhance further characterization and it may be of interest to others who have observed similar associations. Further study of the disease may be required.

### Revealing hidden genetic diagnoses in the ocular anterior segment disorders [^89566947]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications for genetic information for patients and families, and genomic workflow in ASD

Few studies have been performed utilizing NGS in the area of ocular ASD with large cohorts consisting of patients with the variety of ASD clinical diagnoses that present to the clinic. A study using ES in PAfound a genetic diagnosis in only a small proportion, and previous studies utilizing conventional sequencing of cohorts with a high proportion of phenotypically defined ARS casesled to a diagnosis rate of around 40% by examining PITX2/FOXC1. In ASD patients with a variety of ASD phenotypic subtypes that present for clinical genetic information, whether familial or sporadic, our work highlights the important role of ES/GS and SV analysis, as this leads to a high overall rate of diagnosis (22/41; 54%). Using this approach the highest yields of testing were in ARS (2/3; 67%), ARA (5/9; 56%), and PA (7/11; 64%) (Table 1).

Of clinical utility and importance for families, this approach led to a revision of the mode of inheritance in 8/19 (42%) of referred sporadic cases where a responsible variant was found, and in 1/4 (25%) of referred autosomal dominant cases (Fig. 1b). Finding a de novo autosomal dominant pathogenic variant may provide reproductive confidence for families. However, finding an autosomal recessive variant in a supposedly sporadic case means 25% recurrence risk for parents, which happened in six families (cases 9, 21, 28, 29, 30, 38; Fig. 1b). In one of these families (patient 28) with autosomal recessive CPAMD8 variants, subsequent detailed clinical review revealed subtle ASD features in the father, and without our genetic diagnostic findings, this could have been interpreted as an autosomal dominant family with variable expression. Also, two cases presenting as sporadic, and therefore low recurrence risk, were found to be familial autosomal dominant cases with 50% recurrence risk. This was after genotype and careful phenotype review revealed an affected parent (families 10 and 26). The parental features were milder, raising the possibility of somatic mosaicism. However, we could find no evidence of this on careful review of the genomic coverage, allele frequency data, and the Sanger sequencing traces.

### First observation of secondary childhood glaucoma in coffin-siris syndrome: a case report and literature review [^54ad580c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Secondary childhood glaucoma develops as a result of reduced aqueous outflow due to a congenital or acquired ocular or systemic disease. Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) is a frequent feature of secondary childhood glaucoma and includes the subtypes Peters anomaly, aniridia, and Axenfeld-Rieger malformation.

The Coffin-Siris syndromes (CSS) are a genetically heterogeneous group of congenital disorders characterized by intellectual disability, coarse facial features, hypoplastic or absent fifth fingernails or toenails, and multiple other anomalies including ocular features. The various forms of Coffin-Siris syndrome have been shown to be caused by mutations in 11 different genes encoding subunits of a chromatin remodelling factor, the SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) complex.

This is the first report of secondary childhood glaucoma in Coffin-Siris syndrome. Molecular analysis revealed a likely pathogenic de novo heterozygous variant in the SOX11 gene, indicating a diagnosis of Coffin-Siris syndrome 9 (CSS9). The glaucoma was caused by anterior segment dysgenesis of Peters type iridocorneal dysgenesis and aniridia.

Aniridia is a rare congenital disorder in which there is a variable degree of hypoplasia or the absence of iris tissue associated with multiple other ocular changes, some present from birth and some arising progressively over time. Most cases are associated with dominantly inherited mutations or deletions of the PAX6 gene. This article will review the clinical manifestations, the molecular basis including genotype-phenotype correlations, diagnostic approaches and management of aniridia.

### Axenfeld-rieger syndrome: a novel histopathologic finding associated with corneal abnormalities [^0a31c7fb]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a rare kind of anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 newborn babies. The main pathogenesis of ARS is abnormal migration and differentiation of neural crest cells (NCCs) during the embryonic period, leading to multiple phenotypes of ARS. ARS is the general term for a contiguous clinical spectrum of developmental disorders. In the past, ARS was classified into four categories: Axenfeld anomaly (AA), Axenfeld syndrome (AS), Rieger anomaly (RA), and Rieger syndrome (RS). Patients with posterior embryotoxon (caused by anteriorly displaced Schwalbe's line) and peripheral anterior adhesions were diagnosed as AA, while those with the addition of iris hypoplasia (especially corectopia and polycoria) were diagnosed as RA. Moreover, patients with accompanying systemic defects, including mild midface abnormalities, redundant umbilical skin, dental and cardiovascular abnormalities, were diagnosed as AS and RS respectively. However, as the four categories have overlapping combinations of ocular and systemic abnormalities, and can result from mutations of the same genes, it is not necessary to have a separate term for ARS.

Corneal abnormalities, such as corneal opacity and edema, are considered the atypical features of ARS, which are caused by glaucoma or intraocular surgery in most reported cases. Congenital corneal opacity (CCO) is rarely observed in ARS, while the exact mechanism remains unknown. A study reported that CCO seen in ARS and other ASD (especially Peters anomaly, PA) could stem from a similar underlying mechanism. Besides, some patients with unexplained corneal endothelial abnormalities have been reported, but all of them were adults. It is challenging to explore the real cause of those abnormalities. Therefore, our current understanding of how ARS may affect the cornea is incomplete.

The characteristic histopathologic features of ARS are prominent, anteriorly displaced Schwalbe's line and tissue strands connecting peripheral iris and corneal limbus. Moreover, it was observed that the abnormal Schwalbe's line was composed of dense collagen and ground substance covered by a layer that resembled the Descemet membrane (DM). However, due to the small number of patients, there are lack histopathological observations focusing on the corneal opacity that primarily occurs in ARS.

### Classifications of anterior segment structure of congenital corneal opacity in infants and toddlers by ultrasound biomicroscopy and slit-lamp microscopic photographs: an observational study [^a466e436]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Vascularization density was associated with UBM classifications (P = 0.014) and anterior segment developmental abnormality (P = 0.047). In addition, eyes with more severe intraocular lesions (P = 0.001 for UBM classifications, P = 0.008 for dysgenesis, and P = 0.003 for angle closure extent) appeared to have a larger range of vascularization. One possible reason was that vascularization in CCO eyes was caused mainly by combined dysgenesis of corneal limbal stem cells. All eyes with dysgenesis in our classification had concomitant iris hypoplasia. Pax6, the major gene controlling ophthalmology development, was found to be responsible for limbal cell deficiency in congenital aniridia eyes. In addition, anterior synechia was observed in eyes with mutations in PITX2, FOXC1, and FOXC2, which are required for anterior segment development and angiogenic privilege. Therefore, abnormal findings in superficial and intraocular examinations may be a corresponding expression of the same pathogen.

Moreover, eyes with bilateral CCO seemed to have more severe intraocular anomalies (P = 0.019 for UBM classifications, P = 0.012 for dysgenesis, and P = 0.009 for angle closure). These results support the hypothesis that abnormalities that are present in the process of eye development play a crucial role in the intraocular anomalies of CCO. Compared to causes of unilateral CCO such as trauma and dermoid, abnormal development are likely to cause bilateral CCO, as well as abnormalities in other system. Besides, our data were from a tertiary hospital, and most of the patients had a strong willingness for surgery, so the patient population may have complex bilateral CCO. However, the severity of vascularization was not related to bilateral keratopathy, which indicated that the severity of ocular surface lesions was more susceptible to the severity of intraocular anomalies.

### Norrie disease: cochlear enhancement and cerebellar signal abnormalities [^efe47360]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Norrie disease is a rare X-linked condition characterized by early childhood blindness and later onset sensorineural hearing loss. We report two male infants with genetically confirmed Norrie disease and characteristic ocular abnormalities consisting of bilateral funnel retinal detachments, anterior segment dysgenesis, and/or buphthalmos and microphthalmia. MRI demonstrated enhancement of the cranial nerves, cochleae, and cerebellum with cerebellar restricted diffusion. Intracranial findings mimicked meningitis, labyrinthitis, and cerebellitis. Neither infant showed clinical signs of infection. Labyrinthine and cerebellar signal abnormalities have not been previously reported in the context of Norrie disease. Clinicians should consider Norrie disease when encountering such findings and be aware that the described intracranial features of Norrie disease do not necessarily indicate CNS infection.

### A restricted repertoire of De novo mutations in ITPR1 cause gillespie syndrome with evidence for dominant-negative effect [^0b6686b7]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The best-studied malformation of the iris is complete aniridia (MIM:), with more than 90% of cases caused by heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the paired- and homeo-domain containing transcription factor PAX6 (MIM:). PAX6 -associated aniridia is, however, a pan-ocular disease typified by foveal hypoplasia, cataracts, and progressive corneal opacification in addition to the iris anomaly. Extraocular disease is rare in PAX6 -associated aniridia although structural brain anomalies and other sensory impairments have been identified. Apparently isolated aniridia has also been reported in association with heterozygous LOF mutations in FOXC1 (MIM:), and PITX2 (MIM:), although these loci are more commonly associated with anterior segment dysgenesis (MIM:). Syndromic forms of aniridia have been described, the best known of which is WAGR (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genital malformations, intellectual disability [retardation] [MIM:]) resulting from a contiguous gene defect encompassing PAX6 and WT1 (MIM:). The other well-known syndromic form of aniridia is Gillespie syndrome (MIM:). Aniridia is, however, an incorrect description of iris malformation in Gillespie syndrome, which is a characteristic form of iris hypoplasia with "scalloping" of the pupillary edge. Gillespie syndrome typically presents as fixed dilated pupils in affected infants. Iridolenticular strands can be seen at regular intervals (Figure 1 B) as can other remnants of the pupillary membrane. From the description of the embryology given above, the iris defect in Gillespie syndrome would thus be consistent with a failure of development or maintenance of the sphincter musculature and the associated stroma. The eye in Gillespie syndrome can be further distinguished from PAX6 -related disease by the absence of foveal hypoplasia and corneal opacification. The key extra-ocular features of Gillespie syndrome are congenital hypotonia, non-progressive cerebellar hypoplasia, and ataxia (Figures 1 B–1D) and variable, usually mild, neurocognitive impairment. The inheritance of Gillespie syndrome has been considered heterogeneous with both autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive inheritance being postulated on the basis of convincing patterns in individual families. The clinical features of 13 affected individuals with a confident clinical diagnosis of Gillespie syndrome who were used in the molecular studies reported below are summarized in Table 1. We reviewed the available neuroimaging of each case subject, which showed that the cerebellar vermis atrophy is present early and is progressive particularly in the first 5 years of life (Figures 1 B–1D). The atrophy mainly affected the superior vermis progressing to involve the superior cerebellar hemispheres more than the inferior aspects. Abnormal periventricular increased T2/FLAIR white matter signal was seen adjacent to the frontal horns on all examinations and older individuals also had scattered foci of increased T2/FLAIR signal in the white matter, mainly frontally. Until now the molecular basis of Gillespie syndrome was not known, with causative mutations in PAX6, FOXC1, and PITX2 having been excluded in many reported cases.

### Surgical outcomes of glaucoma associated with axenfeld-rieger syndrome [^8c0a946d]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome (ARS), a rare congenital disease that affects approximately 1 in 200,000 live births, is characterized by eye and craniofacial defects. Within the eye there is a specific set of anterior segment anomalies: 1) Anterior displacement of Schwalbe's line (posterior embryotoxon), 2) Adherent iris strands to the posterior embryotoxon (Axenfeld Anomaly), and 3) Iris hypoplasia that results in corectopia and/or pseudopolycoria (Rieger Anomaly). While these entities can be isolated findings or individually associated with other eye conditions, the combination of them constitute ARS.

The anterior segment dysgenesis and craniofacial abnormalities (telecanthus, maxillary hypoplasia, microdontia, and oligodontia) in ARS are commonly a result of genetic disruption of neural crest cell migration and differentiation due to autosomal dominant mutations within the PITX2 or FOXC1 genes. Various studies have demonstrated that mutations in either gene are associated with early-onset glaucoma.

Glaucoma is reported to complicate approximately 50% of ARS cases and is the main cause of vision loss The elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in ARS is due to inherent iridogoniodysgenesis and iris strands that bridge the angle structures. This secondary glaucoma is often refractory to medications requiring surgery to obtain IOP control. However, due to the rarity of ARS, there are few reports in the literature regarding the surgical management of this form of glaucoma. Further, there is disagreement amongst the few reports as to the effectiveness of angle surgery in ARS. In the current study, we review our 45-year experience with ARS-associated glaucoma and specifically focus on the success of surgical management in order to obtain IOP control.

### Comparison of anterior segment abnormalities in individuals with FOXC1 and PITX2 variants [^9a73001f]. Cornea (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study characterizes the detailed corneal phenotypes of individuals with ARS-associated FOXC1 and PITX2 variants. Within the spectrum of anterior segment dysgenesis, corneal abnormalities such as congenital corneal opacities, microcornea, and iridocorneal adhesions are common in Peter anomaly but are uncommon in ARS. Posterior embryotoxon is the only peripheral corneal change that has been frequently reported in ARS; the absence of megalocornea and congenital corneal opacity are often useful criteria to distinguish ARS from other anterior segment disorders. Others have previously reported that ARS is not associated with corneal abnormalities, whereas Fuchs dystrophy/cornea guttatae can coexist in individuals with ARS-associated PITX2 variants. In this study, we further extended the phenotypic characterization to assess differences in corneal findings and management in FOXC1 and PITX2 carriers. We reported that more than one-third of individuals had corneal abnormalities, with megalocornea the most common. Moreover, we found that corneal abnormalities were more common in individuals with FOXC1 variants than in those with PITX2 variants, with only 16% of individuals with PITX2 variants having corneal abnormalities compared with 50% of those with FOXC1 variants. We identified that iris abnormalities, including iris stromal hypoplasia and pseudopolycoria, were more common in people with PITX2 than FOXC1 variants. Corectopia has been reported to be common in PITX2 variants, but our study is the first to show that iris hypoplasia and pseudopolycoria were common in individuals with PITX2 variants. The absence of pseudopolycoria in individuals with FOXC1 variants is consistent with previous smaller case series.

### Functional interactions between FOXC1 and PITX2 underlie the sensitivity to FOXC1 gene dose in axenfeld-rieger syndrome and anterior segment dysgenesis [^f1cd6615]. Human Molecular Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Axenfeld-Rieger ocular dysgenesis is associated with mutations of the human PITX2 and FOXC1 genes, which encode transcription factors of the homeodomain and forkhead types, respectively. We have identified a functional link between FOXC1 and PITX2 which we propose underpins the similar Axenfeld-Rieger phenotype caused by mutations of these genes. FOXC1 and PITX2A physically interact, and this interaction requires crucial functional domains on both proteins: the C-terminal activation domain of FOXC1 and the homeodomain of PITX2. Immunofluorescence further shows PITX2A and FOXC1 to be colocalized within a common nuclear subcompartment. Furthermore, PITX2A can function as a negative regulator of FOXC1 transactivity. This work ties both proteins into a common pathway and offers an explanation of why increased FOXC1 gene dosage produces a phenotype resembling that of PITX2 deletions and mutations. Ocular phenotypes arise despite the deregulated expression of FOXC1-target genes through mutations in FOXC1 or PITX2. Ultimately, PITX2 loss of function mutations have a compound effect: the reduced expression of PITX2-target genes coupled with the extensive activation of FOXC1-regulated targets. Our findings indicate that the functional interaction between FOXC1 and PITX2A underlies the sensitivity to FOXC1 gene dosage in Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and related anterior segment dysgeneses.

### Comparison of anterior segment abnormalities in individuals with FOXC1 and PITX2 variants [^33f14c6f]. Cornea (2022). Medium credibility.

ARS is generally diagnosed by ophthalmologists, and the diagnosis is primarily clinical. Phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity and overlap of clinical presentations can make diagnosing ARS very challenging, especially in young children who may require an examination under anesthesia to assess angle abnormalities. ARS can present with subtle iris and corneal features and sometimes can be misdiagnosed as primary congenital glaucomaor primary open-angle glaucomawhen ARS ocular features are subtle. Although some would argue that the presence of posterior embryotoxon is essential to make a diagnosis of ARS, our study showed that posterior embryotoxon was not always identified with FOXC1 and PITX2 developmental abnormalities. As a result, genotype–phenotype correlations and the presence of systemic features can assist clinicians in making a correct diagnosis and disease classification. In this study, systemic features were present in more than half of the patients with FOXC1 variants, but in all individuals with PITX2 variants, and this has been reported on an overlapping set of ANZRAG patients in the past. It has been previously reported that while the systemic features are variably expressed between both genes, the ocular features are believed to be similar between both genes. Tumer et al, Strungaru et al, and D'Haene et al previously reported phenotypic differences between the FOXC1 and PITX2 variants, both associated with ARS. Patients with ARS have a 50% to 60% lifetime risk of developing glaucoma, which can occur anytime during infancy, childhood, early adulthood, or middle age. Therefore, patients with ARS should be examined annually for the changes in IOP and the optic nerve head. Patients with ARS with corneal abnormalities and those who have undergone surgical interventions are at risk of developing corneal decompensation. Cataract in ARS could either be developmental or acquired after intervention such as glaucoma drainage surgery. Therefore, these patients should be followed regularly with repeated corneal ECD, corneal morphology, and assessment for cataract.
