## Question

Consider polynomial functions $ax^2 -bx +c$ with integer coefficients which have two distinct zeros in the open interval $(0,1).$ Exhibit with proof the least positive integer value of $a$ for which such a polynomial exists.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the least positive integer value of a such that the quadratic polynomial ax² − bx + c with integer coefficients has two distinct zeros in the open interval (0, 1). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the algebraic conditions that force two distinct roots in (0, 1). Then, I should translate those into inequalities involving a, b, and c. Next, I will try small positive integer values of a and check whether integer b and c exist that satisfy all constraints. Finally, I will verify minimality by showing that no smaller positive a works, and I will double-check the construction I propose to ensure correctness.

> Let me first confirm the root conditions. For ax² − bx + c to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive, so b² > 4ac. For both roots to lie strictly between 0 and 1, the quadratic must be positive at 0 and 1, and the vertex must lie between 0 and 1; that gives c > 0, a − b + c > 0, and 0 < b/(2a) < 1, which simplifies to 0 < b < 2a. I should also ensure the roots are distinct, so I need to keep b² > 4ac in mind as I proceed [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the vertex condition. The x-coordinate of the vertex is indeed b/(2a), so 0 < b/(2a) < 1 implies 0 < b < 2a, which is exactly the constraint I wrote. I initially thought I might need to check the derivative, but for a quadratic the vertex condition is sufficient to place the axis of symmetry inside (0, 1), which is necessary though not sufficient for both roots to be in (0, 1); the sign conditions at 0 and 1 complete the requirement, so I should keep all three together [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the inequality chain that ties a, b, and c together. From c > 0 and a − b + c > 0, I get c > 0 and c > b − a. Combining with the discriminant, I need b² > 4ac, and since c must exceed both 0 and b − a, the tightest lower bound on c that still satisfies the discriminant is c ≥ max(1, b − a + 1) because c must be an integer. Substituting this into b² > 4ac yields b² > 4a · max(1, b − a + 1), which is the key inequality I will test for small a [^notfound].

> I will now examine small positive integer values of a, starting with a = 1. For a = 1, the vertex constraint gives 0 < b < 2, so b = 1. Then c must satisfy c > 0 and c > b − a = 0, so c ≥ 1. But the discriminant requires b² > 4ac, which becomes 1 > 4c, and since c ≥ 1, this is impossible. Thus, a = 1 does not work [^notfound].

> Let me consider a = 2. The vertex constraint gives 0 < b < 4, so b ∈ {1, 2, 3}. If b = 1, then c ≥ max(1, 1 − 2 + 1) = 1, and the discriminant requires 1 > 8c, which is impossible. If b = 2, then c ≥ max(1, 2 − 2 + 1) = 1, and 4 > 8c is impossible. If b = 3, then c ≥ max(1, 3 − 2 + 1) = 2, and 9 > 8c implies c < 9/8, so c = 1 is the only candidate, but c must be at least 2; contradiction. Thus, a = 2 does not work either [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify a = 3. The vertex constraint gives 0 < b < 6, so b ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Let me check b = 4: c ≥ max(1, 4 − 3 + 1) = 2, and the discriminant requires 16 > 12c, so c < 4/3. Since c must be at least 2, there is no integer c satisfying both. For b = 5: c ≥ max(1, 5 − 3 + 1) = 3, and 25 > 12c implies c < 25/12 ≈ 2.08, so again no integer c works. For b = 3: c ≥ 1 and 9 > 12c implies c < 3/4, impossible. For b = 2: c ≥ 1 and 4 > 12c, impossible. For b = 1: c ≥ 1 and 1 > 12c, impossible. So a = 3 fails as well [^notfound].

> I will now examine a = 4. The vertex constraint gives 0 < b < 8. Let me try b = 5: c ≥ max(1, 5 − 4 + 1) = 2, and the discriminant requires 25 > 16c, so c < 25/16 ≈ 1.56. Since c must be at least 2, this is impossible. Try b = 6: c ≥ max(1, 6 − 4 + 1) = 3, and 36 > 16c implies c < 9/4 = 2.25, so c = 2 is the only candidate, but c must be at least 3; contradiction. Try b = 7: c ≥ max(1, 7 − 4 + 1) = 4, and 49 > 16c implies c < 49/16 ≈ 3.06, so c ≤ 3, but c must be at least 4; again no solution. Thus, a = 4 does not work [^notfound].

> Let me think about a = 5. The vertex constraint gives 0 < b < 10. I should double-check b = 5: c ≥ max(1, 5 − 5 + 1) = 1, and 25 > 20c implies c < 1.25, so c = 1 is the only candidate. Now, I need to check whether c = 1 satisfies the boundary conditions: c > 0 is true, and a − b + c = 5 − 5 + 1 = 1 > 0 is true. The discriminant is 25 − 20 = 5 > 0, so there are two distinct real roots. Let me verify the roots are in (0, 1): the quadratic is 5x² − 5x + 1 = 0, so the roots are (5 ± √5)/10, which are approximately 0.276 and 0.724, both strictly between 0 and 1. Thus, a = 5 with b = 5 and c = 1 works [^notfound].

> But wait, what if a smaller a could work and I missed a case? I should confirm minimality. I already checked a = 1, 2, 3, and 4 exhaustively and found no integer b, c satisfying all constraints, so 5 is indeed the least positive integer value of a. I should also note that while a = 5, b = 5, c = 1 is the simplest example, other solutions exist for a = 5 (for instance, b = 6 with c = 2 also satisfies the inequalities), but they do not change the minimality claim [^notfound].

The least positive integer value of (a) for which (ax^2 - bx + c) has two distinct zeros in ((0,1)) is **5**. This is achieved by (5x^2–5x + 1), whose roots are (\\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{10} \\approx 0.276) and (0.724), both in ((0,1)). For (a \\leq 4), no integer (b, c) satisfy the necessary conditions: discriminant (b^2–4ac > 0), vertex in ((0,1)), and positive values at (x = 0) and (x = 1).

---

## Conditions for two distinct zeros in (0,1)

For (f(x) = ax^2 - bx + c) to have two distinct zeros in ((0,1)), the following must hold:

- **Discriminant**: (b^2–4ac > 0) (two distinct real roots).
- **Vertex**: (0 < \\frac{b}{2a} < 1) (axis of symmetry in (0,1)).
- **Boundary conditions**: (f(0) = c > 0) and (f(1) = a - b + c > 0).

These ensure the parabola opens upward with roots straddling the vertex and lying strictly between 0 and 1.

---

## Analysis for small values of (a)

We test small positive integers for (a) to find the smallest valid case.

| **(A)** | **Possible (b)** | **Conditions checked** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | 1 | - (b^2–4ac = 1–4c > 0 \\Rightarrow c < 1/4) <br/> - But (c \\geq 1) (integer) | No solution |
| 2 | 1, 2, 3 | - For (b = 3), (9–8c > 0 \\Rightarrow c < 9/8) <br/> - Need (c \\geq 1) and (c > b - a = 1), so (c \\geq 2) | No solution |
| 3 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | - For (b = 5), (25–12c > 0 \\Rightarrow c < 25/12 \\approx 2.08) <br/> - Need (c \\geq 1) and (c > b - a = 2), so (c \\geq 3) | No solution |
| 4 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 | - For (b = 7), (49–16c > 0 \\Rightarrow c < 49/16 \\approx 3.06) <br/> - Need (c \\geq 1) and (c > b - a = 3), so (c \\geq 4) | No solution |
| 5 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | - For (b = 5), (25–20c > 0 \\Rightarrow c < 1.25) <br/> - Need (c \\geq 1) and (c > b - a = 0), so (c \\geq 1) | Solution: (c = 1) |

---

Thus, the smallest (a) is **5**, with (b = 5) and (c = 1).

---

## Verification of the solution

For (f(x) = 5x^2–5x + 1):

- **Discriminant**: (25–20 = 5 > 0) (two distinct real roots).
- **Vertex**: (\\frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \\in (0,1)).
- **Boundary conditions**: (f(0) = 1 > 0) and (f(1) = 5–5 + 1 = 1 > 0).

The roots are (\\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{10} \\approx 0.276) and (0.724), both in ((0,1)).

---

## Conclusion

The least positive integer (a) is **5**, realized by (5x^2–5x + 1). For (a \\leq 4), no integer (b, c) satisfy the required conditions.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^7e0b2d1d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap," where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

Lower limit of normal (LLN) and fixed cutoffs — percent predicted values should not be used to define abnormality because the true LLN is age- and/or height-dependent and varies among individuals; fixed cutoffs such as 80% predicted for forced vital capacity (FVC) or 0.70 for the FEV1/FVC ratio are based on middle-aged adults, can yield erroneous decisions in children and in older or shorter adults, and introduce sex bias. The LLN does not necessarily need to be the fifth percentile and can be adjusted with outcome data; caution is warranted near dichotomous boundaries, especially with results from a single occasion. In clinical testing where disease is suspected, the pretest probability is higher and the false positive rate is much lower than the lowest 5% implied by percentile thresholds.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^ec006ee8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^221445c7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary function reporting conclusions — The ATS PFT Committee believes that wide adoption of the formats presented above and their underlying principles by equipment manufacturers and pulmonary function laboratories can improve the interpretation, communication, and understanding of test results. Limiting the number of parameters reported and showing the LLN next to the measured value should improve interpretive accuracy, particularly for those less experienced, and reserving the word percent to percent predicted value should reduce errors. Showing the measured values relative to the normal distribution in a simple linear graphic (with or without reporting a z-score) can enhance understanding of the result. Quality review of PFTs needs to move beyond "did, or did not, meet ATS standards," but a grading system is most helpful if the grades have a common meaning; therefore adoption of a uniform system is desirable.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^d6563994]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Quantitative imaging (QI) — challenges and sources of error emphasize that advances in QI are crucially dependent on technology and computational power, with massive data sets run through "black box" algorithms and distilled into selected "biomarkers" to evaluate their ability to detect, stratify, and monitor lung disease. Numerous imaging modalities, manufacturers, platforms, and algorithms may not integrate smoothly, and emergent QI metrics vary among centers in the methods of acquisition, quantification, interpretation, and extrapolation; technological advances contribute to difficulty in standardization. Systematic errors may arise at each step of image acquisition, processing, and analysis, including 1) technical issues (e.g., depth of inspiration, acquisition protocol, signal-to-noise ratio, resolution), 2) nonrepresentative sampling of parts of interest (e.g., comparing regions, lobes, or airways), and 3) lack of a well-defined reference space, as well as 4) inaccurate landmark coregistration for evaluating paired images obtained at different lung volumes and 5) failure to consider basic physiology and/or biological or spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^bf529881]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Applying imaging metrics in computational modeling to predict lung function highlights that modeling supports the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of images and provides data to aid the development and refinement of physiological models. Because imaging modalities offer complementary information and no single method captures all measures simultaneously, the goal is to integrate multimodal image data with physiological measurements to characterize how structure determines function, and quantitative linking of lung structure and function can be done only through computational modeling based on the laws of physics. Given the complexity and multifactorial nature of respiratory diseases, structure-based models that include interactions among tissue, airway, and circulation can facilitate analysis and interpretation of how intersubject differences, imaging protocols, and normal or abnormal physiology contribute to imaging-based metrics, and carefully constructed models can examine contributions of different factors and provide mechanistic understanding beyond statistical methods. General principles state that biophysical computational models can be used for forward simulations of function or inverse identification of system structure and parameters; forward models are useful for sensitivity analyses and can predict emergent behavior in response to parameter changes, whereas inverse models can derive information that cannot be measured directly.

General principles of biophysical computational models — biophysical computational models can be used for forward simulations of function or inverse identification of system structure and parameters. Forward models are described as useful for sensitivity analyses to evaluate the contribution of normal subject variability to imaging metrics to define a threshold for abnormal and can also predict emergent behavior after parameter changes at the cellular or tissue level. Inverse models are described as useful for deriving information that cannot be measured directly, including distributions of airway or vascular obstruction that produce specific V˙A/Q˙ patterns. Both forward and inverse models can be used to analyze, interpret, and predict.
