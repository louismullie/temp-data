## Question

Acute stroke with severe anemia could be from what

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what could cause acute stroke in the setting of severe anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions, including what constitutes "severe anemia" and the stroke subtypes. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies, starting with sickle cell disease as a leading cause in children and many adults. Next, I will examine non-sickle mechanisms, including acute blood loss with borderzone infarction, iron deficiency anemia with venous sinus thrombosis or moyamoya, and other hematologic causes. After that, I need to consider how anemia itself worsens stroke pathophysiology. Finally, I should integrate management implications and synthesize a prioritized differential diagnosis with supporting evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't jump to conclusions. Severe anemia is typically defined as hemoglobin less than about 8 g/dL, and acute stroke includes ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes; in children, sickle cell disease is the most common cause of ischemic stroke, whereas in adults, traditional atherothrombotic and cardioembolic etiologies predominate, though anemia still worsens outcomes and may be causal in specific scenarios [^notfound] [^ce782aca] [^97261ca5].

> I will now examine sickle cell disease as the leading cause in the right demographic, because I need to ensure I prioritize the highest-yield diagnosis. In children and many adults with SCD, stroke is typically due to large-vessel vasculopathy of the intracranial internal carotid and proximal middle cerebral arteries, with contributions from endothelial activation, hypercoagulability, and impaired vasomotor tone; acute anemia lowers oxygen delivery and can precipitate ischemia in this vulnerable milieu, and guidelines mandate urgent transfusion without delay when stroke is suspected in SCD [^ce782aca] [^c13e48dd] [^4dc34846].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for transfusion in SCD-related stroke. The STOP randomized trial showed a 92% relative risk reduction in first stroke with chronic transfusion to keep hemoglobin S under 30%, and contemporary guidelines extend this principle to acute events, recommending immediate transfusion within 2 hours and exchange transfusion when indicated; this is strong, direct evidence supporting SCD as a key etiology and transfusion as foundational therapy in this setting [^31fb225c] [^c13e48dd] [^b9088fb1].

> Next, I should review non-sickle mechanisms, starting with acute blood loss causing borderzone infarction. Hold on, I should verify the hemodynamic threshold and imaging pattern. Case series show that profound anemia from massive gastrointestinal bleeding can produce bilateral borderzone infarctions even without systemic hypotension, likely via reduced oxygen-carrying capacity and compromised perfusion at watershed territories; mean hemoglobin around 5.8 g/dL has been reported in such cases, reinforcing the concept that extreme anemia can be directly causal in select patients [^1df26d13].

> I need to check iron deficiency anemia as a distinct pathway, especially in children. Severe iron deficiency anemia has been linked to venous sinus thrombosis and arterial ischemic stroke in young children, with proposed mechanisms including hypercoagulability, endothelial dysfunction, and possibly moyamoya-like vasculopathy; case series document strokes in toddlers with marked IDA, and rare reports describe moyamoya syndrome in the setting of severe iron deficiency, suggesting a causal relationship in susceptible brains [^34a20a5a] [^f689ce05].

> Let me consider other hematologic causes that can present with anemia and stroke, because I should not anchor prematurely. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and immune thrombocytopenia can all cause anemia and thrombosis; in younger patients with ischemic stroke, these diagnoses should be actively considered and managed with disease-specific strategies, often in coordination with hematology [^00f0289b] [^64b9a8d6].

> I should double-check how anemia itself modifies stroke pathophysiology irrespective of etiology, since this affects both risk and outcomes. Low hemoglobin reduces arterial oxygen content, impairs cerebrovascular autoregulation, and can worsen ischemia in penumbral regions; anemia is also associated with larger infarct growth, higher mortality, and worse functional outcomes in observational cohorts and meta-analyses, supporting a biologically plausible and clinically meaningful contribution of anemia to stroke severity and prognosis [^16c83241] [^97261ca5] [^18a16ec5].

> But wait, what if the anemia is a marker rather than a mediator? I need to ensure I acknowledge confounding. Anemic patients often have higher comorbidity burdens and may receive differential acute care, including less antithrombotic therapy, which could inflate mortality associations; nonetheless, multiple studies report independent associations after adjustment, and the dose-response U-shaped relationship between hemoglobin and outcomes strengthens the case for a pathophysiologic contribution beyond mere confounding [^16c83241] [^97261ca5] [^429255d5].

> Next, I should review management implications briefly, because identifying the cause changes treatment. In suspected SCD stroke, do not delay transfusion for imaging or thrombolysis; initiate exchange transfusion when indicated and coordinate with hematology, while considering IV thrombolysis in eligible adults using shared decision-making so that transfusion is not delayed. In non-SCD severe anemia with ischemic stroke, urgent correction of anemia may be reasonable in select cases, but evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized; in hemorrhagic stroke, anemia correlates with larger hematoma volumes and worse outcomes, so careful transfusion thresholds and neurocritical care are essential [^c13e48dd] [^f9686ea1] [^5ba0fe8d] [^ebcf7f84].

> Let me synthesize the differential so it's clinically actionable. In a patient with acute stroke and severe anemia, the most likely causes are sickle cell disease with large-vessel vasculopathy, acute blood loss causing borderzone infarction, and iron deficiency anemia with venous thrombosis or moyamoya physiology; other hematologic etiologies such as antiphospholipid syndrome and myeloproliferative disease should be considered, particularly in younger patients or when the stroke phenotype is atypical. Anemia itself exacerbates ischemic injury and worsens outcomes, which underscores the urgency of identifying and treating the underlying cause while stabilizing oxygen delivery [^ce782aca] [^1df26d13] [^34a20a5a] [^00f0289b] [^16c83241].

---

Acute stroke with severe anemia most often reflects **sickle cell disease (SCD)** [^ce782aca] with vaso-occlusion and large-vessel vasculopathy [^4c29cc38], or **acute blood loss** [^1df26d13] causing hypoperfusion and borderzone infarction. Other causes include iron deficiency anemia with hypercoagulability [^34a20a5a], anemia of chronic disease with endothelial dysfunction [^16c83241], and hemolytic anemia with hemolysis-related nitric oxide depletion and vasoconstriction [^ce782aca]. Severe anemia worsens cerebral hypoxia, impairs autoregulation, and increases infarct volume, so **urgent transfusion** [^c13e48dd] and etiologic therapy are critical [^d050e774].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking severe anemia to acute stroke

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** explain how severe anemia precipitates acute stroke:

- **Reduced oxygen-carrying capacity**: Low hemoglobin decreases arterial oxygen content, worsening cerebral hypoxia and ischemia, especially in the penumbra [^16c83241].

- **Impaired cerebral autoregulation**: Anemia disrupts autoregulation, causing perfusion-dependent ischemia when blood pressure drops [^16c83241].

- **Hyperdynamic circulation**: Anemia increases cardiac output and shear stress, promoting endothelial injury and thrombosis [^16c83241].

- **Hypercoagulability**: Certain anemias (e.g. iron deficiency, SCD) create a prothrombotic state, increasing thromboembolic risk [^ce782aca].

- **Vasculopathy**: SCD causes large-vessel stenosis and moyamoya, predisposing to ischemic stroke [^ce782aca].

## Specific etiologies of acute stroke in severe anemia

| **Etiology** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Sickle cell disease | - Vaso-occlusion <br/> - Large-vessel vasculopathy <br/> - Moyamoya | - Childhood onset <br/> - Recurrent strokes <br/> - Silent infarcts [^fb75c529] |
| Acute blood loss | - Hypoperfusion <br/> - Borderzone infarction | - Gastrointestinal bleeding <br/> - Postoperative anemia <br/> - Bilateral borderzone infarcts [^1df26d13] |
| Iron deficiency anemia | - Hypercoagulability <br/> - Venous sinus thrombosis | - Young children <br/> - Venous infarcts <br/> - Developmental delay [^34a20a5a] |
| Anemia of chronic disease | - Endothelial dysfunction <br/> - Inflammation | - Elderly <br/> - Chronic illness <br/> - Mild anemia [^notfound] |
| Hemolytic anemia | - Hemolysis <br/> - Nitric oxide depletion <br/> - Vasoconstriction | - Jaundice <br/> - Dark urine <br/> - Gallstones [^notfound] |

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies and guidelines affirm the link between severe anemia and stroke:

- **Meta-analysis**: Anemia on admission independently increases mortality in ischemic (OR 1.97) and hemorrhagic stroke (OR 1.46) [^97261ca5].

- **U-shaped relationship**: Both low and high hemoglobin associate with worse outcomes, indicating optimal hemoglobin ranges for cerebral perfusion [^429255d5].

- **SCD-specific data**: SCD is a leading cause of childhood stroke; transfusion reduces stroke risk by ~90% in high-risk children [^31fb225c].

- **Acute blood loss**: Case series show borderzone infarcts after massive bleeding with mean hemoglobin ~5.8 g/dL [^1df26d13].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing anemia-related stroke changes acute management:

- **Urgent transfusion**: Immediate transfusion is recommended in SCD stroke to reduce sickle hemoglobin and improve oxygen delivery [^c13e48dd] [^4dc34846].

- **Exchange transfusion**: Preferred in SCD to rapidly lower hemoglobin S and avoid hyperviscosity [^6f5a602f].

- **Treat underlying anemia**: Correct iron deficiency, stop hemorrhage, and manage chronic disease to prevent recurrence [^notfound].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinate hematology, neurology, and critical care for optimal outcomes [^64b9a8d6].

---

Acute stroke with severe anemia arises from **multiple mechanisms**, with SCD and acute blood loss being the most common. Severe anemia worsens cerebral hypoxia and autoregulatory failure, so **prompt transfusion** and etiologic therapy are essential to reduce infarct volume and improve outcomes [^16c83241].

### Cerebrovascular disease in sickle cell disease [^4c29cc38]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common type of hereditary anaemia and genetic disorder worldwide. Cerebrovascular disease is one of its most devastating complications, with consequent increased morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines suggest that children and adults with SCD who develop acute ischaemic stroke should be transfused without delay. Those with acute ischaemic stroke aged over 18 years who present within 4.5hours of symptom onset should be considered for intravenous thrombolysis; older patients with conventional vascular risk factors are the most likely to benefit. Endovascular thrombectomy should be considered carefully in adults with SCD as there are few data to guide how the prevalence of cerebral vasculopathy may confound the expected benefits or risks of intervention. We present a practical approach to cerebrovascular disease in sickle cell patients based on the available evidence and our experience.

### How I treat and manage strokes in sickle cell disease [^ce6b9c00]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Neurologic complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD). In children with sickle cell anemia, routine use of transcranial Doppler screening, coupled with regular blood transfusion therapy, has decreased the prevalence of overt stroke from ∼11% to 1%. Limited evidence is available to guide acute and chronic management of individuals with SCD and strokes. Current management strategies are based primarily on single arm clinical trials and observational studies, coupled with principles of neurology and hematology. Initial management of a focal neurologic deficit includes evaluation by a multidisciplinary team (a hematologist, neurologist, neuroradiologist, and transfusion medicine specialist); prompt neuro-imaging and an initial blood transfusion (simple followed immediately by an exchange transfusion or only exchange transfusion) is recommended if the hemoglobin is > 4 gm/dL and < 10 gm/dL. Standard therapy for secondary prevention of strokes and silent cerebral infarcts includes regular blood transfusion therapy and in selected cases, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A critical component of the medical care following an infarct is cognitive and physical rehabilitation. We will discuss our strategy of acute and long-term management of strokes in SCD.

Infrequent causes of stroke are likely to be encountered by emergency physicians. Infrequent causes of stroke can be recalled using the ABC-IT mnemonic. Of the many infrequent causes, the five conditions more likely to be encountered are sickle cell anemia, migrainous stroke, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, arterial dissection, and cocaine-related stroke. Consideration of the use of thrombolytic therapy in a patient with stroke from any cause lies at the forefront of treatment strategy in the emergency department.

### Prioritizing sickle cell disease… [^65d35fd7]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

1 Abnormal hemoglobin produced in SCD causes red blood cells to sickle, clogging blood flow and leading to vasoocclusive crises and potential impacts on every organ system. Persons with SCD experience numerous complications, including recurrent episodes of severe pain, pneumonia and acute chest syndrome, stroke, and organ damage. Estimated life expectancy of those with SCD in the United States is > 20 years shorter than the average expected, and the deficit in quality-adjusted life expectancy is particularly stark.
2. Poor Guideline Implementation The 2014 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute evidence-based guidelines. 3 included several recommendations specific to children with sickle cell anemia, the most severe SCD subtypes. The panel recommended children aged 2 to 16 years with SCA have annual transcranial Doppler ultrasound screenings to identify those at increased risk for stroke.

They also recommended that children aged 9 months and older with SCA be offered hydroxyurea therapy, which prevents RBC sickling and, thus, prevents or reduces the severity of complications. In the current issue of Vital Signs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examines rates of TCD screening and hydroxyurea use among children with SCA who were continuously enrolled in Medicaid in 2019. 4 Despite modest improvements in uptake of both interventions since the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute panel's 2014 report, the findings highlight that health care for children with SCA remains suboptimal. The CDC study also reported that only 38% and 53% of children with SCA aged 2–9 and 10–16 years, respectively, used hydroxyurea. 4 These findings extend previous studies in private physician practice 2015 to 2017 that reported low hydroxyurea use among children with SCD.

Negative consequences of systemic racism must also be addressed. According to the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine, despite cystic fibrosis having about one-third of the prevalence of SCD, the funding for cystic fibrosis clinical research far surpasses that for SCD. 1 Both conditions are progressive with life-threatening complications and reduced life expectancy and, thus, have high-priority needs for further treatment development.

Introduction

Anemia is common in patients presenting with acute stroke. Hospital‐based studies have reported prevalence up to ≈30%. 1, 2 Although anemia has been independently associated with increased mortality in a variety of conditions including chronic kidney disease, 3 heart failure, 4 and acute coronary syndromes, 5 observational studies investigating the association between anemia and mortality in stroke have shown conflicting results. Early studies found no association between anemia and stroke outcomes 6, 7; however, others have found both low and high hemoglobin levels to be associated with increased mortality, 8, 9, 10 suggesting a U‐shaped relationship. Guidelines have been unable to specify the optimal treatment options for acute stroke patients with anemia. 11

Previous studies were limited by small sample sizes, and a majority did not report outcomes by stroke subtype. In addition, no previous study stratified analysis by sex‐specific hemoglobin levels. This is particularly important because of the natural variance in the normal hemoglobin ranges between sexes. The literature describes various plausible mechanisms that explain how anemia could directly contribute to poor outcomes. 12 There is a paucity of information, however, investigating the impact of an important clinical factor: whether stroke patients with anemia receive fewer preventative medications pertinent to stroke, such as antiplatelets and anticoagulants (antithrombotics). In addition, there is a lack of data regarding the comorbidity burden in anemic stroke patients and inadequate control for this in statistical analyses.

The current study aimed to clarify these important questions by assessing the impact of admission hemoglobin levels and anemia on stroke mortality at different time points up to 1‐year follow‐up. A systematic review and meta‐analysis were also carried out to further quantify the impact of admission hemoglobin and anemia on stroke mortality outcomes.

### Association between admission haematocrit and mortality among men with acute ischaemic stroke [^087a2c97]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The strengths of our study include the large sample size and the ability to control for several important medical conditions, stroke severity and admission vital sign data. Limitations include an entirely male (veteran) population, and the results may not be generalisable to women. Of note, prior studies have found that the prevalence of anaemia is similar between men and women, but higher haematocrit levels were associated with mortality only among women. Second, we cannot comment on the aetiology of anaemia and how causes of anaemia may influence outcomes. Few of our patients (0.5% of the entire sample) had gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding; it is therefore likely that most of the anaemia in this cohort was not secondary to acute blood loss. Third, we can only examine the relationship between admission haematocrit and mortality, and not trends in haematocrit observed during hospitalisation or after discharge. Studies have reported that anaemia acquired during an acute ischaemic stroke hospitalisation was more predictive of poorer outcomes than baseline haematocrit. Fourth, we are unable to ascertain the cause of death in our cohort, although sepsis, acute organ failure and cancer would be expected to account for a higher proportion of death among patients with severe anaemia compared with more normal haematocrit values. In previous work examining death certificate data, we reported that most poststroke mortality among patients with and without anaemia was attributable to the incident stroke, rather than to concomitant medical comorbidities. Finally, we cannot comment on stroke subtype. One study reported no association between elevated haematocrit and large-vessel stroke, whereas others found an association between intracranial atherosclerosis and stroke.

Recognising the presence and importance of a non-linear, U-shaped association between admission haematocrit and all-cause poststroke mortality may have implications at both the patient level, regarding evaluation and management, as well as at the facility level, when understanding risk-adjusted outcomes at discrete time points. Additional work is required to understand whether intervening on anaemia via haemoglobin augmentation strategies (eg, blood transfusion) and polycythaemia improves poststroke trajectories of care.

Background

The impact of hemoglobin levels and anemia on stroke mortality remains controversial. We aimed to systematically assess this association and quantify the evidence.

Methods and Results

We analyzed data from a cohort of 8013 stroke patients (mean ±, 77.81 ± 11.83 years) consecutively admitted over 11 years (January 2003 to May 2015) using aRegional Stroke Register. The impact of hemoglobin levels and anemia on mortality was assessed by sex‐specific values at different time points (7 and 14 days; 1, 3, and 6 months; 1 year) using multiple regression models controlling for confounders. Anemia was present in 24.5% of the cohort on admission and was associated with increased odds of mortality at most of the time points examined up to 1 year following stroke. The association was less consistent for men with hemorrhagic stroke. Elevated hemoglobin was also associated with increased mortality, mainly within the first month. We then conducted a systematic review using the Embase and Medline databases. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. When combined with the cohort from the current study, the pooled population had 29 943 patients with stroke. The evidence base was quantified in a meta‐analysis. Anemia on admission was found to be associated with an increased risk of mortality in both ischemic stroke (8 studies; odds ratio 1.97 [95% CI 1.57–2.47]) and hemorrhagic stroke (4 studies; odds ratio 1.46 [95%1.23–1.74]).

Conclusions

Strong evidence suggests that patients with anemia have increased mortality with stroke. Targeted interventions in this patient population may improve outcomes and require further evaluation.

### Anemia management after acute brain injury [^7b69d521]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia is a frequent condition among critically ill patients and appears early during their hospital course. In a European, multicenter study on 3534 patients, 63% of those newly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) had hemoglobin (Hb) levels below 12 g/dl on admission; in particular, 29% of them had Hb values below 10 g/dl. Overall, 37% of these 3534 patients received at least one red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) during their ICU stay. Interestingly, during the first 28 days, Hb levels tended to reach 10 g/dl on average regardless of the initial Hb value or the occurrence of bleeding events. In another study on 4892 ICU patients in which 44% received at least one RBCT after a median of 3 days, an Hb level below 9 g/dl was associated with poorer outcomes whereas the amount of RBCT transfused was also associated with increased ICU length of stay and mortality.

The pathophysiology of anemia in critically ill patients remains multifactorial and has been compared to the so-called "anemia of chronic illness"; as such, apart from evident causes such as primary blood losses (e.g. trauma, surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding), multiple other etiologies contribute and often coexist in the same patient. These include, amongst others, blood losses related to minor procedures or phlebotomy, hemodilution secondary to fluid resuscitation, altered red blood cell (RBC) production, and reduced RBC half-life.

Although it is associated with poor outcome, whether anemia exerts deleterious consequences on brain function in various pathological conditions remains a matter of debate. In neurological circumstances such as severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) or stroke, Hb level is a primary determinant of brain oxygenation and, in a recent study, anemia was an independent predictor of mortality among patients suffering from an acute ischemic stroke.

In this article, we summarize the literature evaluating the effects of anemia and RBCT in patients with an acute neurological condition as well as potential strategies to optimize Hb management in such patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with sickle cell disease (primary prevention), AHA/ASA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering hydroxyurea or bone marrow transplantation in pediatric patients aged 2–16 years with sickle cell disease at high risk for stroke (transcranial Doppler mean flow velocities ≥ 200 cm/s) but without intracranial stenosis unable to continue or cannot be treated with periodic red cell transfusion to prevent stroke.

### Impact of hemoglobin levels and anemia on mortality in acute stroke: analysis of UK regional registry data, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^3abff128]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In addition to the pathophysiological mechanisms described, there is also a plausible clinical explanation for the excess mortality risk in stroke patients with anemia. It may be the case that anemic patients were less likely to be prescribed antithrombotics because of the increased risk of bleeding. This was suggested by a finding shown in Table 4 in which fewer anemic women who had a positive vascular indication were on prior antithrombotics compared with those without anemia. This finding potentially supports the well‐documented differential management of cardiovascular risk factors between sexes. The reverse trends were observed for those without vascular indications, supporting previous observations that inappropriate prescribing may be more prevalent for women.

The association between anemia and mortality suggests that interventions may improve outcomes. Although previous studies have shown that packed red blood cell transfusions reduce mortality at 30‐days in anemic patients with myocardial infarction, 39 a recent systematic review and meta‐analysis found that blood transfusion after percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with adverse outcomes, 40 casting doubt on the potential benefits of packed red blood cell transfusions in anemic stroke patients. Observational studies reporting the association between mortality and transfusion in anemic patients with hemorrhagic stroke have had varied results, with one finding a reduction in mortality 41 and another finding no change. 18 To the knowledge of the authors, no studies assessing the impact of packed red blood cell transfusion on anemic ischemic stroke patients have been conducted. Because of the paucity of evidence, guidelines have been unable to specify hemoglobin targets or optimal management options. 11 A randomized controlled trial is required to gauge the impact of transfusions and to establish optimum hemoglobin ranges in patients with acute stroke.

### Overt and incomplete (silent) cerebral infarction in sickle cell anemia: diagnosis and management [^fb75c529]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Regional complete infarctions in children with sickle cell anemia (HbSS) are often associated with stenosis of the large intracranial arteries and result in lifetime disability. Incomplete infarction occurs more frequently than previously recognized and has far-reaching effects on neurocognitive development and the risk for overt secondary strokes into adulthood. Clinical and neuroimaging modalities have been highlighted in an algorithmic approach, with the studies giving the highest yield in results and most likely to be available listed in sequential order. The recognition of an emerging "second peak" incidence in the third decade of life is worrisome and warrants more intense scrutiny and diagnosis of subtle findings of stroke in this young adult population.

### Impact of anaemia on acute stroke outcomes depends on the type of anaemia: evidence from a UK stroke register [^72b1a0cf]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research has demonstrated an association between anaemia and poor outcomes in acute stroke. This study aimed to assess the impact of anaemia on stroke by anaemia subtype.

Methods

Data from a prospective UK Regional Stroke Register were used to assess the association between hypochromic microcytic and normochromic normocytic anaemia on inpatient-mortality, length of stay (LOS) and discharge modified Rankin scale (mRS). Analysis was stratified by stroke subtypes and multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders, was used to quantify this association. Patients who were not anaemic were the reference category.

Results

A total of 8167 stroke patients (admitted between 2003 and 2015) were included, mean age (SD) 77.39 ± 11.90years. Of these, 3.4% (n = 281) had hypochromic microcytic anaemia and 15.5% (n = 1262) had normochromic normocytic anaemia on admission. Normochromic normocytic anaemia was associated with increased odds of in-patient mortality OR 1.48 (1.24–1.77), 90-day mortality OR 1.63 (1.38–1.92), longer LOS OR 1.21 (1.06–1.40), defined as > 7days, and severe disability defined as discharge mRS ≥ 3 OR 1.31 (1.06–1.63), in patients with ischaemic stroke. Hypochromic microcytic anaemia was associated with 90-day mortality OR 1.90 (1.40–2.58) and a longer LOS OR 1.57 (1.20–2.05) in patients with ischaemic stroke.

Conclusions

Hypochromic microcytic and normochromic normocytic anaemia are associated with differing outcomes in terms of inpatient mortality and post stroke disability. While it is unclear if anaemia per se or another underlying cause is responsible for adverse outcomes, subtype of anaemia appears to be relevant in stroke prognosis.

Discussion

Our study examined the association between anemia and hemoglobin levels and mortality in acute stroke in a large unselected stroke patient population and sought to quantify this association using systematic review and meta‐analysis. At 24.5%, prevalence of anemia was high in the cohort analyzed in the current study. Low hemoglobin levels were associated with older age, increased stroke severity, higher prestroke disability, and the increased comorbidity burden. This suggested that outcomes were mediated by the impact of confounders; however, we found anemia to be independently associated with mortality subsequent to making the appropriate adjustments. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of the literature confirmed our findings. In addition, we found elevated hemoglobin to be associated with poorer outcomes in acute stroke, suggesting a U‐shaped relationship between hemoglobin levels and stroke mortality.

The literature has described several pathological mechanisms that can plausibly explain the independent association between anemia and increased mortality risk in stroke. First, by lowering the oxygen‐carrying capacity of blood, anemia may intensify ischemia and thus hypoxia within the penumbral lesions in patients with ischemic stroke. 29, 30 Second, anemia can compromise cerebrovascular autoregulation, leading to fluctuations in cerebral perfusion; this alters the delivery of oxygen to the brain, 31, 32 thereby exacerbating damage caused by ischemia or hemorrhage. Third, augmentation of cerebral blood flow can create turbulence, which can trigger the migration of an existing thrombus and lead to a thromboembolism. 33 Fourth, anemia may lead to hyperdynamic circulation, which has been shown to modulate the expression of adhesion molecules on vascular endothelial cells by upregulating their production. This may trigger an inflammatory response that leads to thrombus formation in a process similar to atherosclerosis. 34, 35 Fifth, anemia may worsen outcomes in stroke because of its relationship with inflammatory mediators; it can upregulate the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase and CXC chemokine receptor 4, 36 both of which have been associated with brain damage during ischemia. 37, 38

### Anemia is an independent prognostic factor in intracerebral hemorrhage: an observational cohort study [^5ba0fe8d]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study we analyzed associations of anemia with hemorrhage volume and its impact on functional outcome in patients with spontaneous ICH. Overall, the presence of anemia is high and affects almost one-quarter of these patients. Anemia was associated with larger baseline hemorrhage volumes and worse outcome as compared to patients without. However, anemia revealed independent effects on functional outcome beyond the - at first glance trivial - association with hematoma volume. Especially, in patients with minor-volume ICH with an increased likelihood of favorable functional recovery, anemia impacted outcome independently and to a larger degree than established parameters. Several aspects deserve attention.

Prevalence and general aspects

The prevalence of anemia in the community-dwelling population of patients aged > 65 years is > 10%, increases profoundly with age and is often multifactorial. Nutritional deficiency anemia, anemia of inflammation, and anemia of unknown causes are the most frequent sub-types. Anemia, in general, is known through large population-based studies to contribute to a higher likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and increased mortality. Focussing on ICH patients who are severely diseased with a high mortality rate and poor prognosis per se, it seems rational that the hemorrhage itself attracts much of the medical attention. However, in light of almost 25% of ICH patients presenting with anemia and given its independent impact on outcome, as reported here, it seems necessary to improve recognition and treatment of anemia on stroke and neurocritical care units.

### 2018 guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^5f607b48]. Stroke (2018). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association 2018 acute ischemic stroke guideline — IV alteplase with prior bleeding and menstruation: Reported literature details a low bleeding risk with IV alteplase in the setting of past gastrointestinal/genitourinary bleeding, and administration may be reasonable; however, alteplase administration within 21 d of a gastrointestinal bleeding event is not recommended. IV alteplase is probably indicated in menstruating women without a history of menorrhagia, with counseling that treatment could increase menstrual flow; because benefits probably outweigh serious bleeding risks in patients with recent or active hemorrhage without clinically significant anemia or hypotension, IV alteplase may be considered, and when recent or active vaginal bleeding causes clinically significant anemia, emergency gynecology consultation is probably indicated before deciding on IV alteplase.

### Pathophysiology and treatment of stroke in sickle-cell disease: present and future [^ce782aca]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Sickle-cell anaemia is the most common cause of stroke in children, and stroke is one of the most devastating complications of sickle-cell disease. Overt strokes are typically due to large-artery vasculopathy affecting the intracranial internal carotid arteries and proximal middle cerebral arteries, whereas silent strokes typically occur in the territory of penetrating arteries. The sickled red blood cell can contribute to the pathogenesis of stroke via abnormal adherence to the vascular endothelium and by haemolysis, which results in endothelial cell activation, a hypercoaguable state, and alterations in vasomotor tone. Red-blood-cell transfusion, the most common preventive measure for stroke in sickle-cell disease, is associated with iron overload in chronic disease. Therefore, interventions directed towards the potential mechanisms that promote vasculopathy and occlusion in sickle-cell anaemia should be investigated. Here we review the epidemiology, clinical spectrum, and pathophysiology of stroke in sickle-cell disease to identify potential therapeutic targets.

Recommendation 7 — remarks on sequencing and adjuncts: Evidence does not exist as to which treatment option should be provided first (tPA or blood transfusion), and prioritization of treatment should be informed by underlying stroke etiology though this may not be clear in the hyperacute setting; given the increased overall survival of adults with SCD and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, offering emergent treatment with tPA to older adults with SCD presenting with an acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset is advised with no absolute age cutoff defined; in some cases tPA may be given before SCD is recognized, and blood transfusion should be considered as soon as possible after SCD is identified; data for endovascular thrombectomy specific to SCD are lacking, so its utility should be carefully evaluated due to cerebral vasculopathy and moyamoya syndrome.

### Sickle cell disease and stroke [^cd8a4542]. Pediatric Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cerebral infarction is a common complication of sickle cell disease and may manifest as overt stroke or cognitive impairment associated with "silent" cerebral infarction on magnetic resonance imaging. Vasculopathy may be diagnosed on transcranial Doppler or magnetic resonance angiography. The risk factors in sickle cell disease for cognitive impairment, overt ischemic stroke, silent cerebral infarction, overt hemorrhagic stroke, and vasculopathy defined by transcranial Doppler or magnetic resonance angiography overlap, with severe acute and chronic anemia, acute chest crisis, reticulocytosis, and low oxygen saturation reported with the majority. However, there are differences reported in different cohorts, which may reflect age, geographic location, or neuroimaging techniques, for example, magnetic resonance imaging field strength. Regular blood transfusion reduces, but does not abolish, the risk of neurological complications in children with sickle cell disease and either previous overt stroke or silent cerebral infarction or abnormal transcranial Doppler. There are relatively few data on the use of hydroxyurea or other management strategies. Early assessment of the risk of neurocognitive complications is likely to become increasingly important in the management of sickle cell disease.

Acute focal neurological deficit in sickle cell disease — red blood cell transfusion and imaging considerations are outlined: for children and adults with SCD presenting with a focal neurological deficit, the panel recommends increasing the hemoglobin level with a red blood cell transfusion to achieve the goal of improving oxygen delivery to the brain; given the challenge of distinguishing between MRI diffusion-weighted negative ischemic strokes and TIAs, the clinical decision to manage a suspected ischemic infarct should not be based solely on the results of the MRI but rather be a bedside decision where the risks and benefits of transfusion must be considered; in most cases, the benefit of transfusing a child or adult with SCD and with acute focal neurologic deficits will outweigh the risks, and the AHA/ASA statement provides guidance for initial management and primary and secondary stroke prevention with regular blood transfusion, with recommendations similar to the ASH CNS panel recommendation.

### Intensive vs conventional blood pressure lowering after endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke… [^40fbba95]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The mRS shift analysis also showed that the intensive management group had worse scores than the conventional management group. Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to receive intensive BP management or conventional management for 24 hours after enrollment. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was functional independence at 3 months. The primary safety outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage within 36 hours and death related to the index stroke within 3 months. The mRS shift analysis also showed that the intensive management group had significantly worse scores than the conventional management group. The adjusted OR for a favorable shift in mRS score was 0.
65.

The intensive management group had a significantly higher rate of malignant cerebral edema. This trial showed that intensive BP management was associated with worse functional outcomes than conventional BP management in patients with acute ischemic stroke who achieved successful reperfusion after EVT. Rates of symptomatic ICH and death related to the index stroke were similar between groups, whereas rates of malignant cerebral edema were higher in patients in the intensive BP management group. The main findings are consistent with those of ENCHANTED2/MT, which showed that death or disability at 3 months occurred more frequently in the more intensive treatment group than in the less intensive treatment group. 15 In previous observational studies and meta-analyses, elevated BP was associated with increased risks of ICH and worse outcomes in patients with successful reperfusion after EVT.

Although the occluded artery was recanalized, some areas in the ischemic brain may have already been damaged or were in an oligemic state within an ischemic penumbra zone. Cerebral vessels in these areas may not have a sufficient autoregulatory function to compensate for sudden decreases in BP. We found that median infarction volumes did not differ between the 2 treatment groups, but malignant cerebral edema occurred more often in the intensive management group. Intensive BP lowering might have further decreased blood flow to the oligemic area and exacerbated ischemic injury.

Ischemic stroke is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The majority of affected individuals are older, with clear cardiovascular or embolic risk factors; however, up to a fifth of cases may occur in patients under the age of 50 years. In this review, we discuss some common hematological causes of ischemic stroke in this age range, with a focus on antiphospholipid syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasms, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and sickle cell disease. We review the etiology of stroke associated with these conditions and explore important management considerations that may be unique to these settings. These include the choice of antithrombotic agents, cytoreduction in myeloproliferative neoplasms, management of thrombocytopenia in immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and treatment of sickle cell disease.

### Cerebral infarction in acute anemia [^1df26d13]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

There are few previous studies on the relationship between cerebral infarction and acute anemia. This study presents patients with cerebral infarction in acute anemia due to marked blood loss and aims to clarify the stroke nature and possible mechanism. Patients with acute cerebral infarction and anemia following marked blood loss without systemic hypotension were recruited from 2001 to 2009. Clinical characteristics, particularly hemoglobin level, and neuroimaging findings were reviewed in detail to analyze the stroke nature and verify the possible pathogenesis. Twelve patients (males 8; mean age 74.9 years) were included. Eleven patients had cerebral infarction after acute massive gastrointestinal bleeding, and one had cerebral infarction following postoperative extensive hematoma during hospitalization. In all patients, borderzone infarction was the most characteristic finding: six had unilateral and six had bilateral borderzone infarction. Mean hemoglobin at infarction after acute blood loss was 5.8 g/dl, with 46% reduction from baseline. Of nine patients receiving detailed extracranial and intracranial vascular studies, none had severe carotid stenosis and six had intracranial stenosis. The arterial borderzones are the most vulnerable regions to a fall in cerebral perfusion. Acute anemia may produce cerebral blood flow insufficiency, reduce oxygen-carrying capacity, and result in distal-field tissue ischemic injury when hemoglobin level decreases below a critical level, especially in patients with intracranial stenosis.

### Blood transfusion for preventing stroke in people with sickle cell disease [^31fb225c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is a common inherited haemoglobin disorder. The abnormal haemoglobin causes distortion of red blood cells, anaemia, vaso-occlusion and dysfunction in virtually any organ system in the body. Stroke occurs in around 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia, and recurrences after a first stroke are likely. Chronic blood transfusion regimes are often used in an attempt to dilute the sickled red blood cells, thus reducing the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke. However, the side-effects of such regimens can be severe.

Objectives

To assess the relative risks and benefits of chronic blood transfusion regimes in patients with sickle cell disease to prevent a first stroke or further strokes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group specialist register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and handsearching abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search of the Group's specialised register: July 2001

Selection Criteria

All those randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials in which blood transfusion as a preventative measure for stroke in patients with sickle cell disease are compared to an alternative treatment or to no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from the study included.

Main Results

One trial was identified by the initial search and this met the inclusion criteria for the review. The trial compared a chronic transfusion regime to maintain sickle haemoglobin at less than 30% with standard care in 130 children with sickle cell disease who were judged to be at high risk of a first stroke through transcranial doppler ultrasonography. Eleven children in the standard care group suffered a stroke during the trial, compared to only one in the transfusion group. Because of this 92% relative risk reduction, the trial was terminated 16 months early. It had been planned that all patients would be treated for 30 months, but median follow-up only 21.1 months. However, a high rate of complications such as iron overload, alloimmunisation and transfusion reactions were seen in the children who were receiving transfusions. No randomised controlled trials were identified which investigated use of transfusion for preventing recurrence of stroke.

Reviewer's Conclusions

While the included study demonstrated a significantly reduced risk of stroke in patients receiving regular blood transfusions, the degree of risk must be balanced against the burden of a chronic transfusion regime. Further research is required to establish the use of transfusion in preventing secondary stroke, the age, or length of time after an event, at which transfusion can safely be stopped, and to further define risk factors for stroke in order to reduce the chance of unnecessarily putting children onto a chronic transfusion regime.

### Anemia management after acute brain injury [^aecf05d2]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Anemia is common among brain-injured patients and associated with worse outcome. RBC transfusions may rapidly increase Hb levels in such patients but are also associated with poor outcome and complications. Few clinical studies on the optimal transfusion strategy have been performed in this setting and are biased by significant confounders. A restrictive RBCT policy should be implemented in such patients, in particular if they are awake and conscious, unless poor tolerance to anemia (e.g. ischemic heart disease) are present. An individualized transfusion strategy is warranted in poor-grade patients, using different tools to detect global/cerebral hypoxia, although the reliability of such approach need to be adequately validated.

### Hemoglobin concentration and clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^18a16ec5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in low‐income and middle‐income countries. It was estimated that China had the highest age‐standardized incidence of stroke (226 per 100 000) worldwide in 2017. Although the age‐standardized disability‐adjusted life‐years lost caused by stroke decreased by 33.1% from 1990 to 2017, the absolute number of all‐age disability‐adjusted life‐years increased by 46.8% in China. Identifying modifiable risk factors is of paramount importance to reduce stroke burden. Previous studies have indicated that abnormal hemoglobin concentration can increase the incidence of stroke. In addition, low hemoglobin has an effect on enlarging the infarct volume and accelerating the velocity of infarct growth. Anemia is common in patients with stroke, with a prevalence of 15% to 29%. Whether hemoglobin concentration is associated with the outcomes in patients with stroke remains to be studied. A recent meta‐analysis suggested that patients with anemia had a higher risk of mortality after stroke. However, most of the studies are focused on the effect of low hemoglobin, and the influence of high hemoglobin on mortality after stroke is still controversial. Some studies found higher hemoglobin increased the risk of mortality, but othersreported null association. Moreover, the impact of hemoglobin concentration on functional outcome and recurrence after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is not yet sufficiently elucidated.

In this study, we aimed to estimate the association between hemoglobin concentration and clinical outcomes after AIS or transient ischemic attack (TIA), including all‐cause mortality, poor functional outcome, stroke recurrence, and composite vascular events at 1 year.

### Sickle cell disease: a review… [^b1bc1b1d]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Observations SCD is diagnosed through newborn screening programs, where available, or when patients present with unexplained severe atraumatic pain or normocytic anemia. In SCD, sickling and hemolysis of red blood cells result in vaso-occlusion with associated ischemia. SCD is characterized by repeated episodes of severe acute pain and acute chest syndrome, and by other complications including stroke, chronic pain, nephropathy, retinopathy, avascular necrosis, priapism, and leg ulcers. In the US, nearly all children with SCD survive to adulthood, but average life expectancy remains 20 years less than the general population, with higher mortality as individuals transition from pediatric to adult-focused health care systems. Until 2017, hydroxyurea, which increases fetal hemoglobin and reduces red blood cell sickling, was the only disease-modifying therapy available for SCD and remains first-line therapy for most individuals with SCD.

Three additional therapies, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, have been approved as adjunctive or second-line agents. In clinical trials, L-glutamine reduced hospitalization rates by 33% and mean length of stay from 11 to 7 days compared with placebo. Crizanlizumab reduced pain crises from 2. 98 to

1. 63 per year compared with placebo. Voxelotor increased hemoglobin by at least 1 g/dL, significantly more than placebo. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy, but it is limited by donor availability, with best results seen in children with a matched sibling donor. While SCD is characterized by acute and chronic pain, patients are not more likely to develop addiction to pain medications than the general population.

Conclusions and Relevance In the US, approximately 100 000 people have SCD, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, acute and chronic pain, acute chest syndrome; increased incidence of stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy; and a life span that is 20 years shorter than the general population. While hydroxyurea is first-line therapy for SCD, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor have been approved in the US since 2017 as adjunctive or second-line treatments, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant with a matched sibling donor is now standard care for severe disease.

### Impact of hemoglobin levels and anemia on mortality in acute stroke: analysis of UK regional registry data, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^df96381b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Our study has a number of strengths. The stroke cases were prospectively identified, and the cohort had almost complete follow‐up using validated methods. Because a large sample population was used, it was possible to conduct a rigorous analysis by sex and stroke type, enabling us to provide new insights. We were also able to control for a diverse array of confounders, thereby mitigating the effects of residual confounding. The meta‐analysis included patients from a wide array of countries, increasing the generalizability of our findings. The inclusion of a large number of participants in the meta‐analysis provided sufficient statistical power to obtain results for both stroke subtypes. Finally, all studies included in the meta‐analysis were of high methodological quality.

This study has some limitations. The small sample number of patients with hemorrhagic stroke may have contributed to the nonsignificant P values. Some of the models used did not fit the data well. Hosmer–Lemeshow tests were significant for ischemic stroke in men at 3 and 6 months and 1 year (Table 2). Although this result does not alter the associations found, it indicates that for this subgroup, there may be other factors or interactions that might help better predict mortality outcome at these time points. It is possible that we were not able to control for unknown factors. In this registry‐based study, we were not able to fully adjust for treatment effect (eg, blood transfusion, use of iron supplements and erythropoietin‐stimulating agents). Nonetheless, transfusion for mild to moderate anemia in stroke is not a routine practice, and the likelihood of such confounding is minimal. We were unable to consider the duration of anemia or to assess the impact of abnormal hemoglobin levels subsequent to a stroke; therefore, the independent association between anemia and excess mortality in stroke cannot be described as a causal relationship. The studies in the meta‐analysis had high heterogeneity for ischemic stroke (I 2 > 50%). Finally, the possibility of underrepresentation of studies that reported no significant harm in the relationship between anemia and stroke mortality raises the issue of selective reporting. Consequently, our meta‐analysis may have overinflated estimates of the association between anemia and excess mortality risk.

In conclusion, we showed that a significant proportion of stroke patients have anemia at the time of stroke onset and that this is associated with increased mortality up to 1 year. The optimal treatment option in this patient group is unclear. Studies are required to examine the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of interventions in this patient population in an acute stroke setting.

### Defining stroke risk in children with sickle cell anaemia [^4b14a6f6]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is the most common cause of childhood stroke, occurring with the highest frequency before the age of 6 years. Despite the relative frequency of stroke in SCA, few predictors of risk exist. Anaemia, leucocytosis, hypertension, silent infarction, and history of acute chest syndrome are well-documented risk factors for ischaemic stroke in SCA. Recent data suggest that other environmental and genetic factors, many unrelated to SCA, influence the development of cerebrovascular disease. Non-invasive assessment of individual stroke risk using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography has provided a means of selecting and prophylactically treating SCA children at highest risk. With the ultimate goal of preventing stroke, the information gained from the studies reviewed here may lead to improved prediction of stroke so that clinical trials to assess risk-based therapy may be carried out on selected children with SCA.

### Association between admission haematocrit and mortality among men with acute ischaemic stroke [^efd293ae]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Based on the current results and the extant literature, it seems prudent to evaluate patients with stroke for treatable causes of anaemia, and to minimise hospital-acquired anaemia during an acute ischaemia stroke admission. From the available data, haemoglobin augmentation strategies cannot be advocated for poststroke patients at this time. While haemoglobin augmentation strategies have been associated with favourable outcomes in patients with MI and CHF, in patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetes and anaemia, darbepoetin alfa administration was associated with increased stroke risk (5.0% vs 2.6%, HR: 1.92; 95% CI 1.38 to 2.68, p < 0.001). Mathematical modelling data support a transfusion threshold of haematocrit < 30% among patients with acute ischaemic stroke. When applying this transfusion threshold to our cohort, 180 (4.8%) patients would have received a blood transfusion. However, receipt of blood transfusion during a hospitalisation for acute ischaemic stroke was neither correlated with improved in-hospital nor 90-day mortality. As there were such pronounced differences between patients with anaemia who did and did not receive blood transfusion, a stable propensity model could not be generated. Additional work is required to evaluate whether interventions that treat anaemia or polycythaemia reduce poststroke mortality.

### Stroke in sickle cell anemia: alternative etiologies [^81f56030]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Stroke is common in children with sickle cell anemia, but is rarely attributed to the traditional causes of stroke identified in other children. An 11-year-old girl with sickle cell anemia presented with severe headache and was found to have recurrent bilateral multifocal strokes in a cardioembolic pattern. Evaluation revealed the presence of a patent foramen ovale, antiphospholipid antibodies, and elevations in factor VIII and lipoprotein(a). Sickle cell anemia is itself a hypercoagulable state with potential for increased right heart pressures, both of which predispose to paradoxical embolization via right-to-left intracardiac shunting of emboli, thus causing stroke. The present case suggests that the more traditional etiologies for pediatric stroke may also cause stroke in children with sickle cell anemia.

### Anemia and hematoma volume in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^ebcf7f84]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Anemia increases risk of bleeding complications in the critically ill. In primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most fatal type of stroke, outcome is largely dependent on the volume of hemorrhage into the brain. We investigated the relationship between anemia and clinical course of acute ICH.

Methods

Six hundred ninety-four consecutive subjects were identified from an ongoing single-center prospective cohort study of nontraumatic ICH during a 6-year period. Anemia was defined according to World Health Organization criteria. Study end points were ICH volume, as measured on the baseline computed tomography scan, and 30-day mortality.

Results

Anemia was present in 177 (25.8%) patients on admission. Patients with anemia were older (p = 0.005) and more likely to have coronary artery disease (p < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, anemia (p = 0.009), lobar location of ICH (p < 0.001), white blood cell count (p < 0.001), and admission diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.001) were associated with larger ICH volume. Although after accounting for ICH volume, none of these variables was a significant predictor of 30-day mortality in multivariable analysis, the size of the marginal reduction in the odds ratio for anemia suggests that it may have a small effect on mortality through mechanisms in addition to ICH volume.

Conclusions

Anemia is common in acute ICH and its presence at admission is an independent predictor of larger volume of ICH. Given the central role of ICH volume in outcome, clarification of the mechanisms underlying this relationship may offer novel therapeutic targets for reducing ICH morbidity and mortality.

### Cerebrovascular manifestations in hematological diseases: an update [^64b9a8d6]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

Hematological diseases are a rare cause of stroke, but cerebrovascular complications are frequent in patients with hematological diseases. Cerebrovascular disease has a negative impact on their prognosis. The complex management of stroke in the context of the different hematological diseases requires close cooperation between hematologists, neurologists, neuroradiologists, and sometimes neurosurgeons. Acute stroke treatment is often a dual emergency, as the patient needs both immediate treatment for the neurovascular disturbance and for the underlying hematological condition. The evidence supporting decisions in stroke acute treatment and secondary prevention varies in quality from high (e.g. randomized-controlled trials of transfusions and of hydroxyurea in sickle-cell disease, where recurrent stroke was the primary outcome) to very low (e.g. thrombectomy in acute stroke in sickle-cell disease or in CVT associated with ALL). Due to the low frequency of some diseases (e.g. POEMS, PNH, and TTP) or association of conditions (e.g. stroke and multiple myeloma), it is unlikely that randomized trials will be performed to answer specifically questions on the optimal acute stroke treatment or secondary stroke prevention. New evidence will probably come from subgroup/secondary analysis of trials looking at treatment or prevention of all thrombotic complications of the individual hematological diseases. Descriptive analysis of "big" administrative data will also be very useful to inform on outcome of prespecified interventions for stroke in uncommon scenarios. New chemo and immune therapies for hematological diseases in the future will have to be monitored for potential associations with stroke, as well as other neurological complications such as PRES and ICANS.

### Association between admission haematocrit and mortality among men with acute ischaemic stroke [^f2510fdc]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

After adjusting for relevant medical conditions, measures of acute severity of disease and burden of chronic medical comorbidities, and stroke severity, mild and moderate anaemia were only associated with increased 6-month and 1-year mortality among men. Severe anaemia was associated with increased mortality from hospital admission throughout the first year post stroke. Furthermore, severe anaemia at admission was associated with 1-year mortality to a similar degree as stroke severity and to a greater degree than a history of either heart disease or cancer. Polycythaemia was associated only with in-hospital mortality, confirming a U-shaped relationship between measures of red blood cell volume and postischaemic stroke outcomes.

The prevalence of anaemia and the association between haematocrit and mortality (all-cause and non-cardiovascular) have been described among those with non-stroke conditions. Increased in-hospital and 30-day postacute MI mortality has been reported with worsening degrees of anaemia. Similarly, among patients ≥ 65 years of age admitted with CHF, haematocrit ≤ 27% was associated with increased 1-year mortality (HR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.92); this association was largely attributed to the burden of medical comorbidities, suggesting that anaemia may be a marker, rather than a prime driver, of increased mortality in this population.

### Why would a child have a stroke? [^df4f701f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Identifying the etiology of childhood arterial ischemic stroke helps prevent stroke recurrence. In addition, stroke may herald a serious underlying condition requiring treatment, such as acquired heart disease, malignancy, or autoimmune disorder. Evidence-based guidelines exist for adults to identify and treat common risk factors for primary and secondary stroke, including hypertension, diabetes, elevated lipids, atrial fibrillation, and sleep apnea, which are rarely relevant in children. However, guidelines do not exist in pediatrics. Identifying the cause of childhood stroke may be straightforward or may require extensive clinical and neuroimaging expertise, serial evaluations, and reassessment based on the evolving clinical picture. Risk factors may be present but not necessarily causative, or not causative until a triggering event such as infection or anemia occurs. Herein, we describe strategies to determine stroke etiology, including challenges and potential pitfalls.

Acute ischemic stroke in sickle cell disease (SCD) with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA): Major risks of tPA include symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in 3% to 6% and life-threatening systemic hemorrhage; use of thrombolytics for acute stroke may also delay prompt blood transfusion, and the timing of tPA and acute blood transfusion therapy should be individually based. The acceptability and feasibility of the panel's recommendation not to delay transfusion are limited by prehospital emergency medical systems that direct patients with suspected stroke to certified stroke centers, where stroke teams are trained to reduce door-to-needle times for treatment with IV tPA; conversely, stroke protocols typically suggest placement of 2 large-bore IV lines on arrival, which could facilitate more rapid simple transfusion and possibly exchange transfusion. Joint protocols including both IV tPA and exchange transfusion may permit prompt transfusion for young adults with SCD presenting with acute ischemic stroke, and a proxy with power of attorney is often beneficial for shared decision-making in the emergency setting. Research needs include rigorous studies of the safety of tPA use in individuals confirmed to have SCD and acute ischemic stroke, systematic data collection in adults with SCD receiving IV tPA that includes stroke risk factors, presumed stroke etiology after workup, and outcomes, and implementation science studies designed to identify optimal clinical practice for administering both tPA and acute blood transfusion therapy to adults with SCD presenting to the emergency department with acute ischemic strokes.

### Neurological PRESentations in sickle cell patients are not always stroke: a review of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in sickle cell disease [^fb41c417]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Acute neurological changes in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients often raise the suspicion for stroke. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) can mimic stroke in its clinical presentation. We aimed to (i) review the PRES literature in SCD patients including clinical presentation, risk factors, pathophysiology, and management and (ii) elucidate the distinction between PRES and stroke in SCD. The exact pathophysiology of PRES in SCD remains elusive but is likely multifactorial and related to sickling, ischemia, and chronic anemia predisposing to vasogenic edema. PRES and stroke in SCD are distinguishable conditions. Our review may help elucidate a clinical approach to this distinction.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^0ea6c3e3]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease — antithrombotic therapy for secondary stroke prevention is limited and should be applied cautiously. Progressive narrowing of arteries at the base of the brain can lead to cerebral vasculopathy or moyamoya syndrome, which can predispose a patient to both ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage. There are no randomized trials for antithrombotics for secondary stroke prevention in SCD, and caution is advised when considering antithrombotics for secondary stroke prevention in patients with SCD because the stroke mechanism is less certain and patients with SCD are also at higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke. If there is evidence for other stroke mechanisms in a patient with SCD (ie, atherosclerosis), then it would be reasonable to administer antithrombotics as supported elsewhere in this guideline.

Table 4 depicts prior antithrombotic use by anemia status and vascular indication. In women with a positive vascular indication, those with anemia were less likely to be on prior antithrombotics compared with those without anemia (P = 0.032). Conversely, in men with a negative vascular indication, those with anemia were more likely to be on prior antithrombotics than those without anemia (P < 0.001). In addition, anemia was associated with increased comorbidity burden in both sexes (Figures 2 and 3).

### Anemia management after acute brain injury [^d5516dcc]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Other forms of brain injury

Anemia on admission has been found to be among the most significant predictors of short- and long-term poor outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In young patients suffering from acute stroke due to cervical artery dissection (n = 1206), anemia (defined as Hb < 12 g/dl) was found in 7% of them on admission and was associated with the severity of stroke and unfavorable neurological outcome. In another study, anemia on admission (identified as an hematocrit value less than 30%) was associated with poor outcome in patients with less severe stroke, defined as a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of < 10. Nevertheless, mild anemia could worsen patients' functional status also when occurring in the sub-acute phase of stroke. Also, decreasing Hb levels after admission could independently predict infarct growth in stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. In contrast, in a recent retrospective study, Hb concentrations higher than the normal limits on admission were also associated with greater disability at discharge and 30-day mortality, even after adjustment for major potential confounders, after ischemic stroke.

In one retrospective study, anemia on admission was identified in 19% of patients with a non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and was found to be an independent predictor of long-term mortality. Also, lower Hb levels (< 12 g/dl) were found in 23% of 2406 ICH patients during their hospital stay, including 4% with Hb < 10 g/dl. Patients with anemia were more likely to have severe neurological deficits on admission, in particular when ICH was not associated with the use of anticoagulants. Hb below 10 g/dl was also associated with poor outcome and increased 1-year mortality. Similar results were also found in other studies. Interestingly, anemia was also a predictor of larger hematoma volumes in these patients.

Among patients suffering from post-anoxic brain injury, Ameloot et al. found a strong linear relationship between Hb and cerebral brain oxygen saturation (StO 2), assessed by non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy. Moreover, Hb levels below 10 g/dl generally resulted in low StO 2 values, while Hb values above 12.3 g/dl were associated with better outcome, particularly in patients with StO 2 values < 62%.

### Impact of hemoglobin levels and anemia on mortality in acute stroke: analysis of UK regional registry data, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^6bc00c91]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Meta‐analyses of pooled results showed that anemia is associated with an increased risk of mortality in ischemic stroke (pooled OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.57–2.47) (Figure 5). We also found a significant association for the evaluation of anemia and mortality in hemorrhagic stroke, albeit at a lower magnitude of association (OR 1.46, 95% 1.23–1.74) (Figure 6). The number of studies providing ORs for the relationship between elevated hemoglobin and stroke mortality was insufficient for a meta‐analysis to be conducted. Although available data suggest that elevated hemoglobin predicts short‐term mortality in ischemic stroke, findings are less consistent for hemorrhagic stroke (Table 7). The funnel plot depicting ORs for mortality in anemic ischemic stroke patients shows asymmetry (Figure 7), with an underrepresentation of studies on the left side that we would typically expect to consist of those reporting no significant harm in the relationship between anemia and stroke mortality. We encountered 5 such studies that reported no significant association in our systematic review that we could not incorporate into the meta‐analysis because ORs were not given, causing asymmetry in the funnel plot.

### Association between admission haematocrit and mortality among men with acute ischaemic stroke [^6e762b4a]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Anaemia is associated with higher mortality among patients with non-stroke cardiovascular conditions; less is known regarding the relationship between anaemia and mortality among patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

Methods

Medical records were abstracted for n = 3965 veterans from 131 Veterans Health Administration facilities who were admitted with ischaemic stroke in fiscal year 2007. Haematocrit values within 24 hours of admission were classified as ≤ 27%, 28%–32%, 33%–37%, 38%–42%, 43%–47% or ≥ 48%. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between anaemia and in-hospital, 30-day, 6-month and 1-year mortality, adjusting for age, medical comorbidities, modified Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-III and stroke severity. Impact factors were calculated to standardise comparisons between haematocrit tier and other covariates.

Results

Among n = 3750 patients included in the analysis, the haematocrit values were ≤ 27% in 2.1% (n = 78), 28%–32% in 6.2% (n = 234), 33%–37% in 17.9% (n = 670), 38%–42% in 36.4% (n = 1366), 43%–47% in 28.2% (n = 1059) and ≥ 48% in 9.1% (n = 343). Patients with haematocrit ≤ 27%, compared with patients in the 38%–42% range, were more likely to have died across all follow-up intervals, with statistically significant adjusted ORs (aORs) ranging from 2.5 to 3.5. Patients with polycythaemia (ie, haematocrit ≥ 48%) were at increased risk of in-hospital mortality (aOR = 2.9; 95% CI 1.4 to 6.0), compared with patients with mid-range admission haematocrits. Pronounced differences between patients receiving and not receiving blood transfusion limited our ability to perform a propensity analysis. Impact factors in the 1-year mortality model were 0.46 (severe anaemia), 0.06 (cancer) and 0.018 (heart disease).

Conclusions

Anaemia is independently associated with an increased risk of death throughout the first year post stroke; high haematocrit is associated with early poststroke mortality. Severe anaemia is associated with 1-year mortality to a greater degree than cancer or heart disease. These data cannot address the question of whether interventions targeting anaemia might improve patient outcomes.

### Prevention and management of stroke in sickle cell anemia [^9b13e4d3]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

As the overall health of patients with sickle cell anemia (SS) improves and diagnostic techniques become more sensitive, physicians are seeing patients with an increasingly wide range of subtle and not-so-subtle brain injury. The major breakthrough in the field of sickle-related brain injury has been the unprecedented success of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) to identify asymptomatic patients at high risk of stroke, coupled with chronic transfusion therapy to prevent it. The evidence for TCD screening and preventive treatment is strong and compelling, but there are still important unanswered questions regarding the implications of "silent infarcts" found in the magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of asymptomatic individuals, and the growing awareness of the burden of neuropsychiatric dysfunction in otherwise apparently healthy individuals.

### Prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends in anaemia burden by severity and cause, 1990–2021: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^d54d101a]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Several fundamental unknowns remain in our collective understanding of anaemia; many researchers worldwide are working on these problems and that focus must be sustained. First and foremost, we do not truly know what the ideal definition of anaemia should be. Although many health conditions are defined on the basis of empirical assessments of increased rates of poor health outcomes (eg, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and chronic kidney disease) or statistical deviations in representative populations (eg, childhood growth standards), WHO anaemia definitions do not have a similar rigorous clinical basis. Evidence-based definitions of anaemia according to health loss associated with low haemoglobin concentrations are urgently needed to guide updated burden assessments, clinical standards, and subsequent prioritisation of this public health problem. Work from the BRINDA team suggests that existing formulae for altitude adjustment could lead to underestimation of anaemia at lower altitudes (< 2000 m) and overestimation at higher altitudes (> 3000 m), with differences in total anaemia prevalence ranging from three to 22 percentage points in the locations studied. Second, methods of haemoglobin sampling (eg, whole vs capillary blood) and analysis (eg, laboratory vs point-of-care testing) vary considerably; the effect of this heterogeneity on estimates of anaemia burden and trends requires further exploration, as some evaluations have suggested up to a 28% variation between sampling methods. Third, although we assess the direct disability burden of anaemia in the form of YLDs, this measure probably represents only a small part of the full health effects of low haemoglobin concentrations. In addition to anaemia-related risks of preterm labour, low birthweight, short gestation, stillbirth, and impaired motor and cognitive development, anaemia has been associated with increased risk of several conditions including stroke, cardiovascular disease, dementia, vision problems, low bone mineral density, and increased all-cause mortality after surgeryand in older adults. A rigorous assessment of the evidence for low haemoglobin concentrations as an upstream risk factor for morbidity and mortality is necessary to close this knowledge gap. Similarly, although acute and chronic anaemia are common comorbidities in the hours and days preceding death, and blood transfusion is universally regarded as a life-saving intervention, there has been no comprehensive accounting for anaemia-associated mortality during this period. Furthermore, disability weights and YLDs do not account for changes in health loss associated with adaptation and chronicity of illness. As such, these and similar analyses capture disease burden before longer-term compensatory changes.

### Anemia management after acute brain injury [^cb13be59]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is frequent among brain-injured patients, where it has been associated with an increased risk of poor outcome. The pathophysiology of anemia in this patient population remains multifactorial; moreover, whether anemia merely reflects a higher severity of the underlying disease or is a significant determinant of the neurological recovery of such patients remains unclear. Interestingly, the effects of red blood cell transfusions (RBCT) in moderately anemic patients remain controversial; although hemoglobin levels are increased, different studies observed only a modest and inconsistent improvement in cerebral oxygenation after RBCT and raised serious concerns about the risk of increased complications. Thus, considering this "blood transfusion anemia paradox", the optimal hemoglobin level to trigger RBCT in brain-injured patients has not been defined yet; also, there is insufficient evidence to provide strong recommendations regarding which hemoglobin level to target and which associated transfusion strategy (restrictive versus liberal) to select in this patient population. We summarize in this review article the more relevant studies evaluating the effects of anemia and RBCT in patients with an acute neurological condition; also, we propose some potential strategies to optimize transfusion management in such patients.

Table 3
Effect of Anemia and Elevated Hemoglobin on Stroke Outcomes at Different Time Points (Logistic Regression)

The associations between hemoglobin levels and age, sex, prestroke modified Rankin Scale score, stroke type, OCSP classification, comorbidities, prior antithrombotic use, and inpatient mortality were assessed using the chi‐square test. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess the impact of hemoglobin levels (by quintiles) and anemia on odds of death. Univariate and multivariate models were used to calculate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs). Sex‐ and stroke type–specific analyses were performed controlling for age, OCSP classification, prestroke modified Rankin Scale score, comorbidities, and prior antithrombotic usage.

To better understand the potential mediating factors for the observed associations, we examined the distribution of selected chronic comorbidities between patients with anemia and no anemia and assessed the differences in proportions of patients receiving antithrombotic medications by a vascular indication (defined as presence of previous stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation). The analysis was performed using the SPSS version 23.0 (IBM Corp).

### Hemoglobin concentration and clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^429255d5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia or low hemoglobin can increase the risk of stroke. However, the association between hemoglobin and outcomes after stroke is uncertain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between hemoglobin and clinical outcomes, including mortality, poor functional outcome, stroke recurrence, and composite vascular events at 1 year.

Methods and Results

We included the patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack from the Third China National Stroke Registry. We used the Cox model for mortality, stroke recurrence, and composite vascular events and the logistic model for the poor functional outcome to examine the relationship between hemoglobin and clinical outcomes. In addition, we used the restricted cubic spline to evaluate the nonlinear relationship. This study included 14 159 patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. After adjusted for potential cofounders, both anemia and high hemoglobin were associated with the higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% CI, 1.39–2.15; HR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.95–3.76) and poor functional outcome (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; 95% CI, 1.18–1.57; OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07–1.87). High hemoglobin, but not anemia, increased the risk of stroke recurrence (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05–1.79) and composite vascular events (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.08–1.83). There was a U‐shaped relationship between hemoglobin and mortality and poor functional outcome.

Conclusions

Abnormal hemoglobin was associated with a higher risk of all‐cause mortality, poor functional outcome, stroke recurrence, and composite vascular events. More well‐designed clinical studies are needed to confirm the relationship between hemoglobin and clinical outcomes after stroke.

Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis

We selected full journal articles reporting on studies that evaluated the association between baseline hemoglobin or anemia and subsequent mortality in patients diagnosed with stroke. PubMed and Embase were searched from inception until December 2014 using the following search terms with no language restriction: stroke OR intracranial‐hemorrhage OR intracerebral‐hemorrhage AND haemoglobin OR hemoglobin OR anaemia OR anemia AND mortality OR fatal* OR survival OR death NOT rivaroxaban OR dabigatran OR apixaban OR sickle OR surgery OR glycated OR glycosylated OR HbA1C or erythropoie*. In addition, we checked the bibliographies of relevant articles for any studies that met our selection criteria.

Two reviewers (R.B. and K.H.) independently screened abstracts and titles. Potentially relevant studies were reviewed to confirm their eligibility. The selection and data extraction of included studies were performed by R.B. and K.H. and checked by a senior reviewer (Y.K.L.). To assess study validity, included studies were assessed for the methods used for diagnosing stroke, determination of hemoglobin levels and anemia, ascertainment of mortality or outcome subsequent to the stroke, and the analytic procedures aimed at minimizing the risk of bias from confounders. We pooled the reported associations (adjusted OR if available) using the inverse variance method and random‐effects model in RevMan 5.3 software (Nordic Cochrane Center). The comparisons of interest were for categories of anemia versus no anemia in patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke versus the referent "normal" category. We evaluated heterogeneity by calculating the I 2 statistic, for which a value > 50% was indicative of substantial heterogeneity. We also aimed to check for publication bias through a funnel plot if there were > 10 eligible studies in our systematic review.

### Blood transfusion for preventing primary and secondary stroke in people with sickle cell disease [^3c54a220]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In sickle cell disease, a common inherited haemoglobin disorder, abnormal haemoglobin distorts red blood cells, causing anaemia, vaso-occlusion and dysfunction in most body organs. Without intervention, stroke affects around 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) and recurrence is likely. Chronic blood transfusion dilutes the sickled red blood cells, reducing the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke. However, side effects can be severe.

Objectives

To assess risks and benefits of chronic blood transfusion regimens in people with sickle cell disease to prevent first stroke or recurrences.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings. Date of the latest search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 28 January 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing blood transfusion as prophylaxis for stroke in people with sickle cell disease to alternative or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included trials and extracted data.

Main Results

Searches identified three eligible randomised trials (n = 342). The first two trials addressed the use of chronic transfusion to prevent primary stroke; the third utilized the drug hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) and phlebotomy to prevent both recurrent (secondary) stroke and iron overload in patients who had already experienced an initial stroke. In the first trial (STOP) a chronic transfusion regimen for maintaining sickle haemoglobin lower than 30% was compared with standard care in 130 children with sickle cell disease judged (through transcranial Doppler ultrasonography) as high-risk for first stroke. During the trial, 11 children in the standard care group suffered a stroke compared to one in the transfusion group, odds ratio 0.08 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.66). This meant the trial was terminated early. The transfusion group had a high complications rate, including iron overload, alloimmunisation, and transfusion reactions. The second trial (STOP II) investigated risk of stroke when transfusion was stopped after at least 30 months in this population. The trial closed early due to a significant difference in risk of stroke between participants who stopped transfusion and those who continued as measured by reoccurrence of abnormal velocities on Doppler examination or the occurrence of overt stroke in the group that stopped transfusion. The third trial (SWiTCH) was a non-inferiority trial comparing transfusion and iron chelation (standard management) with hydroxyurea and phlebotomy (alternative treatment) with the combination endpoint of prevention of stroke recurrence and reduction of iron overload. This trial was stopped early after enrolment and follow up of 133 children because of analysis showing futility in reaching the composite primary endpoint. The stroke rate (seven strokes on hydroxyurea and phlebotomy, none on transfusion and chelation, odds ratio 16.49 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 294.84)) was within the non-inferiority margin, but the liver iron content was not better in the alternative arm.

Authors' Conclusions

The STOP trial demonstrated a significantly reduced risk of stroke in participants with abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasonography velocities receiving regular blood transfusions. The follow-up trial (STOP 2) indicated that individuals may revert to former risk status if transfusion is discontinued. The degree of risk must be balanced against the burden of chronic transfusions. The combination of hydroxyurea and phlebotomy is not as effective as "standard" transfusion and chelation in preventing secondary stroke and iron overload. Ongoing multicentre trials are investigating the use of chronic transfusion to prevent silent infarcts, the use of hydroxyurea as an alternative to transfusion in children with abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasonography velocities, and the use of hydroxyurea to prevent conversion of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography velocities from conditional (borderline) to abnormal values.

Results were displayed selectively in Tables 2 and 3, and data for the 7‐ and 14‐day time points were not included because of the similarity in results and to ensure brevity. Only confirmed cases of stroke were included. Stroke was diagnosed using evidence from clinical features and neuroimaging (typically computed tomography and, in some cases, magnetic resonance imaging). Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization criteria of hemoglobin < 12.0 g/dL in women and < 13.0 g/dL in men, and elevated hemoglobin was defined as > 15.5 g/dL in women and > 17.0 g/dL in men. 15

DISCUSSION

In this large cohort of AIS and TIA, we found that compared with normal hemoglobin, both the lower hemoglobin and the higher hemoglobin had increased risk of all‐cause mortality and poor functional outcome at 1 year. However, interesting, only the higher hemoglobin was associated with recurrent stroke and composite vascular events, and no evidence was found on the lower hemoglobin. The dose–response plots indicated that the association between hemoglobin and mortality and poor functional outcome at 1 year was U shaped.

Some studies have revealed that anemia at admission is related to mortality in patients with stroke. A recent meta‐analysis, including 8 studies, suggested that anemia was associated with a higher risk of mortality in ischemic stroke (the pooled OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.57–2.47). Our study was consistent with this result. However, the association between the high level of hemoglobin and mortality in ischemic stroke is contradictory. From a UK Regional Stroke Register, the patients with ischemic stroke were divided into 3 groups by hemoglobin concentration, including anemia, normal, and elevated hemoglobin groups, and no association was found between the elevated hemoglobin and higher mortality at 1 year both in men and women. Tanne et alstudied of a cohort of 859 patients with stroke and reported that both lower and higher levels of hemoglobin were associated with higher mortality. Our study found the concordant result that both ends of hemoglobin concentrations were associated with higher mortality at 1 year.

Similarly, we found that both anemia and high hemoglobin were also related to a higher risk of poor functional outcome. The association between hemoglobin and poor functional outcome has been reported in some studies. However, the results were inconclusive. A study consisting of 536 patients with ischemic stroke did not find the predicted value of hemoglobin on functional outcome. Another study of a prospective stroke registry from Korea indicated that lower hemoglobin, but not higher hemoglobin, was associated with an increased risk of poor functional outcome. The different results may partly be attributed to the methods of study, and the previous 2 studies used 3‐month functional outcomes. Interestingly, we found that among the minor stroke (NIHSS scores < 6), but not severe stroke, both the anemia and high hemoglobin groups were associated with an increased risk of poor functional outcome compared with the normal hemoglobin group (Figure 5), which suggested that patients with minor stroke were more likely to be affected by hemoglobin level. More studies are needed to estimate the relationship between different levels of hemoglobin on functional outcomes.

### Acute silent cerebral ischemia and infarction during acute anemia in children with and without sickle cell disease [^d52f7bad]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the silent cerebral infarcts (SCI), which affect up to 40% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD), could occur in the setting of acute anemic events. In a prospective observational study of children with and without SCD hospitalized for an illness associated with acute anemia, we identified acute silent cerebral ischemic events (ASCIE) in 4 (18.2%) of 22 with SCD and in 2 (6.7%) of 30 without SCD, using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Children with ASCIE had lower hemoglobin concentration than those without (median 3.1 vs 4.4 g/dL, P = 0.003). The unique temporal features of stroke on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging permit estimation of incidence rates for ASCIE of 421 (95% confidence interval, 155–920) per 100 patient-years during acute anemic events for all patients. For children with SCD, the estimated incidence was 663 (95% confidence interval, 182–1707) which is much higher than previously reported. Acute anemic events are common in children with SCD and prevalence could partially account for the high SCI. Some ASCIE (1 of 4 in our study) may be reversible. Alterations in management may be warranted for children with severe anemia to identify unrecognized ischemic brain injury that may have permanent neurocognitive sequelae.

### Cerebral vasculopathy in patients with sickle cell disease and stroke: now you see it, now you don't [^36e317b9]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Strokes are one of the most devastating complications of sickle cell disease (SCD). Until recently SCD was the main cause of ischemic strokes in children in the USA and many other countries. After the development of an ischemic stroke children have to be placed on chronic transfusions to prevent a recurrence although the risk may be lower if the stroke occurred during another acute event. The incidence of ischemic strokes was significantly reduced after the advent of transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening and the institution of transfusion therapy for primary prevention in children found to be at high risk. More recently hydroxyurea treatment was shown to be equally effective in primary stroke prevention in children with abnormal TCD both in the setting of high-income countries as well as in low income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Stem cell transplantation is also effective in secondary prevention in children who have already had a stroke as well as primary prevention in children with abnormal TCD. The epidemiology of ischemic strokes was defined in a seminal study of a large number of patients which showed that ischemic strokes were more prevalent in the first decade of life and the vast majority of patients had either homozygous sickle cell anemia (HbSS) or heterozygous HbSβ 0 thalassemia, with few, if any, strokes occurring in patients with HbSC. As a result, most studies have since focused on the first two genotypes, and little is published about strokes in other genotypes. The pathophysiology of cerebral ischemic strokes remains somewhat of a mystery. Originally thought to be caused by small vessel vasculopathy these events were demonstrated to be due to large arterial vasculopathy in the anterior cerebral circulation and the vessels of the circle of Willis by Stockman et al.and others. It remains unknown why the posterior circulation is relatively spared and what are the etiological drivers for stroke risk. Furthermore, recent studies, using techniques such as magnetic resonance angiography demonstrate that 30–40% of children with ischemic strokes do not have demonstrable cerebral arterial stenosis.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) has a peak prevalence of 4–8% in children aged 1–3 years of age and is known to be associated with developmental delay, lethargy, irritability and cognitive problems. Rarely, IDA has also been reported as a risk factor for stroke in otherwise healthy children. We report a series of four young children aged 14 months to 48 months with significant IDA. Three children had venous sinus thrombosis and one had arterial ischaemic stroke, without other risk factors. We discuss the potential underlying mechanisms and review the relevant literature. This report further consolidates the evidence for a strong association between IDA and childhood stroke and highlights an easily treatable (and preventable) risk factor.

### Hemoglobin concentration and clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^09c540a4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In the current study, we found that the higher hemoglobin may increase the risk of stroke recurrence or composite vascular event. However, a recent study suggested that the higher hemoglobin was associated with a lower risk of stroke recurrence. The contradictory results may be partly attributed to the difference in the categorization of hemoglobin. In the current study, we defined the high level of hemoglobin as > 17 g/dL for men and > 15.5 g/dL for women, and the number of patients with a high level of hemoglobin was small, and further studies with large sample size are needed to confirm our results. Considering all effects of high hemoglobin on other outcomes after stroke, the results were reasonable.

Although the specific mechanism of hemoglobin on clinical outcomes after stroke is not entirely clear, there are several potential mechanisms proposed. Low hemoglobin or anemia decreases the oxygen supply and energy to the brain. Especially in patients with stroke, low hemoglobin or anemia can reduce the oxygen carrying to the ischemic penumbral regionsand impair cerebral vascular regulation. Furthermore, anemia of inflammation is another cause of anemia, which is mediated by inflammatory cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor α, are associated with prognosis in patients with stroke. High hemoglobin or hematocrit, which is associated with increased viscosity, can decrease cerebral blood flow. Consequently, patients with high hematocrit are at a higher risk of thrombotic events. Hemodilution was expected to be used to improve survival or functional outcome for those with a high level of hemoglobin or hematocrit. However, no evidence was found on the effectiveness of hemodilution therapy in improving the outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke.

There were several limitations in this study. First, this was a retrospective analysis and potential unmeasured confounders may exist. Although many covariates were adjusted in the study, some preexisting medical conditions that may affect hemoglobin level cannot be adjusted. We cannot conclude the casual relationship between hemoglobin and clinical outcomes. Second, we did not address the specific type of anemia, including anemia of iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, anemia of malnutrition, and so on, which may have different effects on the outcome after stroke. More studies designed to explore the relationship between a specific type of anemia and outcomes after stroke are needed in the future, and this may help to understand the mechanisms of hemoglobin on outcomes. Third, we cannot identify the patients with abnormal hemoglobin that emerged during hospitalization. Fourth, the number of patients with high hemoglobin was small in the study. The result should be explained with caution.

Results

Database Study

Of the 11 886 episodes recorded in the registry, 3873 were excluded for various reasons (Figure 1. Overall, 2659 of these episodes were excluded because of missing data, and 991 were excluded because they were related to secondary entry into the register due to subsequent stroke. The sample included in the current study consisted of 8013 patients with acute stroke admitted consecutively between January 2003 and May 2015. The mean age in the cohort was 77.81 ± 11.83 years, 52.4% were women, and 86.7% had ischemic stroke. The most common OCSP stroke classification was partial anterior circulation stroke (33.1%), and the majority of patients (62.6%) had a prestroke modified Rankin Scale score of 0. Inpatient mortality was 21.3%, and 1 in 4 patients (24.5%) had anemia on admission.

Table 1 shows sex‐specific sample characteristics by anemia status. Increasing age, higher prestroke disability, increased stroke severity, inpatient mortality, and all comorbidities (with the exception of hyperlipidemia in women) were associated with anemia (Figures 2 and 3). Prior antithrombotic use in men and ischemic stroke in women were also associated with anemia.

### Incident stroke in pediatric sickle cell anemia despite overall improved transcranial Doppler velocity in a Ugandan hydroxyurea trial: antecedent and ongoing risks [^cb688c68]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) screening for primary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) was established in higher-resource regions, targeting interventions for highest velocity ("abnormal"). We sought to identify additional stroke risk factors in Uganda.

Methods

We conducted a 30-month open-label single-arm Ugandan hydroxyurea trial, dose-escalated to maximum-tolerated dose, aimed to test brain protection for children aged 3–9 years with SCA. Study procedures included history, clinical stroke examination, and prospective TCD and laboratory assessments.

Results

Overall, 264 children received study HU, mean age 5.6 ± 1.7, hemoglobin 7.8 ± 1.2 g/dL, fetal hemoglobin (HbF) 11.9% ± 8.1%, enrolment TCD mean TAMV 148.4 ± 29.3 cm/sec; 15 (5.7%) had abnormal TCD. The mean TAMV at trial completion was 131.9 ± SD 25.7 cm/sec. Four participants without abnormal enrolment TCD developed acute stroke within the initial 16 months (incidence 0.62 per 100 person-years): two had enrolment HbF ≤ 3.1%, two had low oxygen saturation (90%), and one had recurring severe anemia necessitating multiple transfusions. Apparent stroke precipitants were severe malaria, acute chest syndrome, recent pain crisis, or uncertain cause. At trial completion, eight additional participants had a higher risk TCD category than at enrolment.

Conclusion

The effectiveness of TCD screening for stroke prevention may vary by region, as no participant with an incident stroke was at the highest risk. Antecedent and/or ongoing SCA-related risks of anemia, low HbF, hypoxemia, infections, and/or disease complications likely contributed to stroke despite trial HU. Results suggest that TCD alone may not fully identify the highest stroke risk in the region, and there is a need for primary stroke prevention from early childhood and continuous hydroxyurea therapy.

Ischemic stroke

Because of the known inverse relation between hematocrit and CBF, there has long been interest in the clinical use of hemodilution in the management of acute ischemic stroke. Some studies have suggested that relatively high Hb concentrations may predispose to the development of strokes, as well as contribute to worse outcomes when cerebral ischemia occurs. It is conceivable that increased viscosity could have a particularly deleterious effect on microvascular flow through the ischemic penumbra. Consistent with this notion, Allport and colleagues performed serial MRI scans in 64 stroke patients and found that a higher baseline hematocrit was independently associated with infarct growth and less chance of successful reperfusion.

The deleterious association with a higher hematocrit has, however, been inconsistent and largely observed at levels in excess of 45% (Table 6). Indeed, several studies have shown a U-shaped relation where low hematocrit levels are also associated with larger infarct size and worse outcomes. The lowest risk of stroke and the best outcomes have generally been observed with mid-range hematocrit levels of about 42 to 45%. This range was also supported by a study using 133 Xe to assess CBF in stroke patients, with the finding that cerebral O 2 delivery was optimized at a hematocrit level of 40 to 45%. Conversely, several animal studies have suggested that cerebral O 2 delivery and neuroprotection are optimized at slightly lower hematocrit or Hb values, in the range of 30 to 36% and 10 to 12 g/dl, respectively. Greater degrees of hemodilution consistently appear to be deleterious. Some case reports have even described patients with relatively stenotic cerebral vessels who may have developed ischemic strokes directly attributable to anemia.

Several RCTs and a meta-analysis have not shown any clear benefit to using hemodilution as a therapeutic strategy in acute ischemic stroke. However, there was a great deal of heterogeneity in the methodology of these studies (timing of treatment, specific type and dose of plasma expander, target hematocrit). Although each study deliberately produced reductions in hematocrit with the use of colloids and/or phlebotomy, the reductions were relatively modest, generally not beyond 37 to 38%.

Table 2 depicts the impact of hemoglobin levels on stroke mortality by quintiles of sex‐specific admission hemoglobin levels, presented separately for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Quintile 1 contains those with the lowest values, and quintile 5 has the highest. The cutoff points were 12.40, 13.80, 14.64, and 15.60 g/dL for men and 11.70, 12.80, 13.60, and 14.50 g/dL for women. In men with ischemic stroke, low hemoglobin (quintile 1) was significantly associated with increased mortality at all time points measured compared with those with normal hemoglobin levels (quintile 3). High hemoglobin (quintile 5) was also associated with increased odds of mortality at 4 time points; inpatient, 7 and 14 days, and 1 month. This suggested a U‐shaped relationship between hemoglobin levels and short‐term mortality in men with ischemic stroke. In women with ischemic stroke, low hemoglobin levels were significantly associated with mortality at 5 time points; inpatient; 1, 3, and 6 months; and 1 year. In women with hemorrhagic stroke, low hemoglobin levels were associated with increased mortality at all time points.

Table 3 shows the impact of anemia and elevated hemoglobin levels on mortality. In men with ischemic stroke, anemia was associated with higher odds of death at all time points assessed, and elevated hemoglobin was associated with increased odds of death at 3 time points; inpatient, 1 month, and 3 months. In men with hemorrhagic stroke, anemia was associated with increased mortality at 1 year, and elevated hemoglobin was associated with increased mortality at 4 time points; inpatient, 7 and 14 days, and 1 month. In women with ischemic stroke, anemia was associated with increased mortality at 1, 3, and 6 months and 1 year, whereas elevated hemoglobin was associated with increased mortality at 7 and 14 days and 1 month. In women with hemorrhagic stroke, anemia was associated with increased mortality at all time points assessed, whereas elevated hemoglobin was associated with increased mortality at 3 time points; inpatient, 6 months, and 1 year.

Sickle cell disease — acute management of suspected stroke in children emphasizes urgent imaging and transfusion parameters: Children with SCD presenting with focal neurological deficits or first-time seizure should prompt a neurological consult and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and if an acute infarct is present, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV) should be considered; to avoid undertreatment, simple blood transfusion therapy should occur within several hours of presentation and as soon as possible even before MRI if the hemoglobin is < 10 g/dL, but hemoglobin should not be increased to > 11 g/dL, with an expected rise of ≈2.5 to 3.0 g for every 10 cm3/kg transfused and a check within 2 hours to avoid hyperviscosity; if baseline hemoglobin is > 10 g/dL, an initial exchange transfusion should decrease hemoglobin to < 10 g/dL, and after a simple transfusion within a 5-hour window an exchange transfusion is recommended to lower hemoglobin S to ≤ 15%; there is no absolute threshold for withholding exchange after stroke or transient ischemic attack, and if diffusion-weighted MRI is negative, repeating MRI ≈2 to 4 weeks after presentation should be considered.

### Cerebrovascular manifestations in hematological diseases: an update [^6f5a602f]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Concerning the treatment of an acute cerebrovascular event (stroke or TIA) in an adult with HbSS, emergent CT and CTA should be performed, oxygen supplementation is recommended, and exchange blood transfusion should be started immediately upon recognition of symptoms (ideally within 2 h of acute neurological symptom onset) if the Hb is under 8.5 g/dL aiming for a target Hb > 10 g/dL. Exchange transfusion is preferable vs simple transfusion, aiming to reach HbS level < 15–20%. If Hb is > 8.5 g/dL, exchange transfusion is suggested to decrease the possibility of a hyperviscosity syndrome. Intravenous alteplase (rtPA) in adults with HbSS presenting within < 4.5 h of onset of stroke symptoms can be used, as for patients without SCA. In fact, from 2,016,652 stroke patients admitted to Get With The Guidelines-Stroke sites in the US, a study comparing 832 SCA and 3328 non-SCA controls found no differences in admission variables, on the % use of thrombolytic therapy (8.2% for SCA vs 9.4% non-SCA) or in a prespecified set of outcome measures. These results indicate that coexistent SCA had no significant impact on the safety or outcome of thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, IV rtPA should not delay exchange blood transfusion. If ischemic stroke is judged to be provoked by a cause other than SCA (e.g. cardiac or arterial emboli), rtPA can be provided first. If, in an adult HbSS acute stroke patient, CTA identifies a large vessel occlusion and excludes Moyamoya, endovascular thrombectomy may be performed as for non-HbSS patients, although the accumulated experience of thrombectomy in HbSS patients is still very limited.

For secondary stroke prevention, adults with HbSS should receive stroke-modifiable risk factor control, antiplatelets, and statins such as that recommended for non-HbSS stroke patients, together with regular simple blood transfusions. Hydroxyurea has been demonstrated to be inferior to transfusions for this indication. Patients refractory to these treatments, may be considered for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients with Moyamoya arteriopathy may benefit from revascularization neurosurgery. Patients with silent cerebral infarcts should be managed similarly to those who had suffered a clinically apparent stroke, namely with regular blood transfusions. Periodic (12–24 months) neurological and cognitive assessments and brain MRI are also recommended.

### Stroke in sickle cell anemia patients: a need for multidisciplinary approaches [^8fd4ff0f]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder, with Mendelian inheritance pattern, caused by a missense mutation in the β-polypeptide chain of the hemoglobin B. SCA preferentially affects populations in countries where malaria was/is present (e.g. Africa, USA, Brazil). Thereby, in USA, the incidence of SCA is relatively high, around 1/500, and the prevalence is about 1/1000. In Brazil, SCA represents a major public health problem with an incidence ranging from 1/2000 to 1/600 depending on the regions. Homozygotic patients present more severe medical conditions and reduced life expectancy than heterozygous individuals who generally are asymptomatic. Eventually, this life-threatening disease displays a complex etiology owing to heterogeneous phenotypes and clinical outcomes, subsequently affecting the management of the patients. One of the most critical complications associated with SCA is stroke, a leading neurologic cause of death and disability. About 24% of SCA patients have a stroke by the age of 45 and 11% by the age of 20. From the general population, twin and familial aggregation studies as well as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), mostly in pediatric populations with ischemic stroke, showed that the risk of stroke has a substantial genetic component. Nevertheless, to fully characterize genomic contributors of stroke and permit reliable personalized medicine, multidisciplinary studies incorporating knowledge from clinical medicine, epidemiology, genetics, and molecular biology, are required. In this manuscript, stroke in SCA patients is extensively reviewed with emphasis to the US and Brazilian populations. Recent advances in genomics analysis of stroke in SCA patients are highlighted.

### Blood transfusion for preventing primary and secondary stroke in people with sickle cell disease [^0537604b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. Sickle cell disease can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Stroke affects around 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS). Chronic blood transfusions may reduce the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke by diluting the proportion of sickled cells in the circulation. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and last updated in 2017.

Objectives

To assess risks and benefits of chronic blood transfusion regimens in people with sickle cell disease for primary and secondary stroke prevention (excluding silent cerebral infarcts).

Search Methods

We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 8 October 2019. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 19 September 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing red blood cell transfusions as prophylaxis for stroke in people with sickle cell disease to alternative or standard treatment. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

We included five trials (660 participants) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of these trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb)SS form of sickle cell disease. Three trials compared regular red cell transfusions to standard care in primary prevention of stroke: two in children with no previous long-term transfusions; and one in children and adolescents on long-term transfusion. Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children); and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents). The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, indirectness and imprecise outcome estimates. Red cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term transfusions Long-term transfusions probably reduce the incidence of clinical stroke in children with a higher risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler velocities or previous history of silent cerebral infarct), risk ratio 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.49) (two trials, 326 participants), moderate quality evidence. Long-term transfusions may: reduce the incidence of other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48)) (two trials, 326 participants); increase quality of life (difference estimate -0.54, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.17) (one trial, 166 participants); but make little or no difference to IQ scores (least square mean: 1.7, standard error 95% confidence interval -1.1 to 4.4) (one trial, 166 participants), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether long-term transfusions: reduce the risk of transient ischaemic attacks, Peto odds ratio 0.13 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 2.11) (two trials, 323 participants); have any effect on all-cause mortality, no deaths reported (two trials, 326 participants); or increase the risk of alloimmunisation, risk ratio 3.16 (95% confidence interval 0.18 to 57.17) (one trial, 121 participants), very low quality evidence. Children and adolescents with previous long-term transfusions (one trial, 79 participants) We are very uncertain whether continuing long-term transfusions reduces the incidence of: stroke, risk ratio 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 4.35); or all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 8.00 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 404.12), very low quality evidence. Several review outcomes were only reported in one trial arm (sickle cell disease-related complications, alloimmunisation, transient ischaemic attacks). The trial did not report neurological impairment, or quality of life. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus red cell transfusions and chelation Neither trial reported on neurological impairment, alloimmunisation, or quality of life. Primary prevention, children (one trial, 121 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may have little or no effect on liver iron concentrations, mean difference -1.80 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (95% confidence interval -5.16 to 1.56), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: risk of stroke (no strokes); all-cause mortality (no deaths); transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 4.84); or other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 2.03 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 10.69)), very low quality evidence. Secondary prevention, children and adolescents (one trial, 133 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may: increase the risk of sickle cell disease-related serious adverse events, risk ratio 3.10 (95% confidence interval 1.42 to 6.75); but have little or no effect on median liver iron concentrations (hydroxyurea, 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 10.0 to 30.6)); transfusion 17.3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 8.8 to 30.7), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy: increases the risk of stroke, risk ratio 14.78 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 253.66); or has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 15.92); or transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.74), very low quality evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence for managing adults, or children who do not have HbSS sickle cell disease. In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, there is moderate quality evidence that long-term red cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke, and low quality evidence they also reduce the risk of other sickle cell disease-related complications. In primary and secondary prevention of stroke there is low quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy has little or no effect on the liver iron concentration. In secondary prevention of stroke there is low-quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy increases the risk of sickle cell disease-related events. All other evidence in this review is of very low quality.

Hemoglobin control in large hemispheric infarction (LHI): Anemia is associated with worse outcome in ischemic stroke, both in the acute and subacute phases, yet currently, no evidence exists on the effect of anemia on LHI patients in particular. Hence, the physiological benefits of RBC transfusion suggested in neuromonitoring studies in TBI and SAH patients may be assumed for LHI patients as well.

Sickle cell disease — avoiding hyperviscosity syndrome states that in children and adults with SCD, a rapid rise in hemoglobin to > 10 g/dL may result in hyperviscosity syndrome and devastating neurological sequelae. When the hemoglobin is > 12 g/dL, then phlebotomy should be done promptly to decrease the hemoglobin to less than ≈10 g/dL.

Conclusion

This study has confirmed the deleterious effect of renal deficiency and anemia on survival in patients who sustained a first stroke. We have shown that anemia is independently associated with a lower one-year survival. Thus, it might be useful to treat patients with kidney disease and anemia as early as possible in order to reduce the complications and co-morbidities that result from these diseases. Indeed, CKD is very often under diagnosed and under-treated. Appropriate trials should be conducted to examine if early interventions to detect and treat systematically renal insufficiency and anemia in patients experiencing a first stroke may improve survival and quality of life. However, the solution may not be easy. Indeed, a trial of darbepoetin alfa in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, not undergoing dialysis, (TREAT study) has indicated an increased risk of stroke.
