## Question

A 38-year-old man presents to your clinic with a 3-month history of low back pain. He describes the pain as aching and located over the buttocks, sometimes radiating to the posterior thighs but not below the knees. He has no history of trauma. On examination, there is tenderness over the sacroiliac joints bilaterally, but no neurological deficits. Laboratory tests, including inflammatory markers, are within normal limits. MRI of the pelvis shows no evidence of sacroiliitis or other inflammatory changes. He has tried NSAIDs for several weeks with minimal relief. He asks if a sacroiliac joint corticosteroid injection would help his pain.

Based on current ACOEM guidelines, should you offer a sacroiliac joint corticosteroid injection to this patient? Justify your answer.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a sacroiliac joint corticosteroid injection should be offered to a 38-year-old man with chronic non-specific low back pain and no evidence of inflammatory sacroiliitis, based on current ACOEM guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether it fits non-specific low back pain versus inflammatory sacroiliitis. Then, I should verify what ACOEM 2021 actually recommends for SI joint injections in these two categories. Next, I will review the strength of evidence and any exceptions. Finally, I will consider alternative next steps and confirm the bottom-line recommendation with citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification. The patient has chronic low back pain localized to the buttocks with radiation to the posterior thighs but not below the knees, bilateral SI joint tenderness, no neurologic deficits, normal inflammatory markers, and an MRI showing no sacroiliitis or other inflammatory changes. This pattern is consistent with non-specific low back pain rather than inflammatory sacroiliitis, and the absence of MRI evidence of sacroiliitis argues against spondyloarthritis in this case.

> Now, I should verify the ACOEM 2021 position. ACOEM explicitly recommends offering SI joint corticosteroid injections for patients with a specific known cause of sacroiliitis due to proven rheumatologic inflammatory arthritis (for example, ankylosing spondylitis or rheumatoid arthritis involving the SI joints) after at least 1–2 months of symptoms and a trial of NSAIDs, and it advises against SI joint injections for acute, subacute, or chronic non-specific low back pain, including pain attributed to the SI joints but without evidence of inflammatory sacroiliitis or radicular pain syndromes [^350063b0] [^70c72de2] [^296bed73].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence and any nuances. ACOEM rates the recommendation to use SI injections in proven inflammatory sacroiliitis as a C recommendation with low confidence, and it rates the recommendation against SI injections in non-specific low back pain as a D recommendation with low confidence, reflecting limited high-quality evidence and the lack of demonstrated long-term benefit in non-specific cases [^296bed73]. I initially thought there might be a carve-out for diagnostic purposes in non-specific pain, but hold on, I should double-check: ACOEM's "do not perform" stance applies to therapeutic SI injections in non-specific low back pain, and while diagnostic blocks can be considered in some pathways, that is not the same as recommending therapeutic steroid injections in this population, so I should not conflate the two [^70c72de2] [^296bed73].

> Next, I should review what to do instead. For chronic non-specific low back pain, ACOEM emphasizes conservative management, activity, and selective imaging or referral when red flags are absent. Interventional procedures like SI joint injections are not recommended in the absence of inflammatory sacroiliitis, so the next steps should focus on optimizing noninvasive care rather than pursuing a steroid injection that is unlikely to confer durable benefit in this scenario [^70c72de2] [^296bed73].

> But wait, what if other guidelines disagree? NASS suggests intra-articular steroid injections may be considered in suspected SI joint pain, yet that is a Grade C recommendation and does not override ACOEM's more restrictive stance in occupational medicine contexts, especially when there is no evidence of inflammatory sacroiliitis. Thus, in a workers' compensation or occupational health framework, ACOEM's directive to avoid SI steroid injections for non-specific low back pain remains the most applicable and defensible position here [^1c1ed20b] [^70c72de2].

> Final answer: No, I should not offer a sacroiliac joint corticosteroid injection to this patient. According to ACOEM 2021, SI joint corticosteroid injections are not recommended for chronic non-specific low back pain without evidence of inflammatory sacroiliitis, whereas they may be considered only when there is proven inflammatory sacroiliitis from rheumatologic disease after NSAID therapy, which this patient does not have [^70c72de2] [^296bed73] [^350063b0].

---

Based on current ACOEM guidelines, **SI joint corticosteroid injection is not recommended** for this patient because he has chronic non-specific low back pain without evidence of inflammatory sacroiliitis or radicular pain [^70c72de2]. ACOEM advises against SI injections in non-specific LBP, and reserves them for patients with proven inflammatory sacroiliitis (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis) who have failed NSAIDs [^350063b0]. The evidence for benefit in non-specific SI pain is limited and inconsistent, so conservative care should continue [^7983a530].

---

## ACOEM guidelines on sacroiliac joint injections

ACOEM provides **clear guidance** on SI joint injections:

- **Indications**: SI joint injections are recommended for patients with a specific known cause of sacroiliitis (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis) who have persistent symptoms despite NSAIDs [^350063b0].

- **Contraindications**: SI joint injections are not recommended for acute, subacute, or chronic non-specific low back pain, including pain attributed to the SI joints without evidence of inflammatory sacroiliitis or radicular pain syndromes [^70c72de2].

- **Evidence level**: The recommendation for SI joint injections in inflammatory sacroiliitis is graded as low confidence (Grade C), while the recommendation against injections in non-specific low back pain is graded as low confidence (Grade D) [^296bed73].

---

## Patient scenario analysis

The patient presents with chronic low back pain localized to the buttocks, occasionally radiating to the posterior thighs, but not below the knees. There is no history of trauma, neurological deficits, or inflammatory markers. MRI shows no evidence of sacroiliitis or inflammatory changes. He has tried NSAIDs with minimal relief. This clinical picture is consistent with **non-specific low back pain**, and there is no evidence of inflammatory sacroiliitis or radicular pain syndromes.

---

## Application of ACOEM guidelines to the patient

Applying ACOEM guidelines, the patient does not meet the criteria for SI joint corticosteroid injection because:

- **Lack of inflammatory sacroiliitis**: There is no evidence of inflammatory sacroiliitis on MRI or laboratory tests.

- **Non-specific low back pain**: The patient's symptoms are consistent with non-specific low back pain, for which SI joint injections are not recommended [^70c72de2].

- **Insufficient evidence**: There is limited and inconsistent evidence supporting the effectiveness of SI joint injections in non-specific low back pain [^7983a530].

---

## Alternative evidence and guidelines

Other guidelines and studies provide additional context:

- **NASS guidelines**: Intra-articular steroid injections may be considered in patients with suspected SI joint pain, but the evidence is limited and the recommendation is weak (Grade C) [^1c1ed20b].

- **VA/DoD guidelines**: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against SI joint injections in patients with low back pain [^6645944b].

- **Systematic reviews**: Evidence for SI joint injections in non-specific low back pain is limited, with short-term benefits reported in some studies but no consistent long-term improvement [^7983a530].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given the current evidence and guidelines, **the following clinical recommendations are appropriate**:

- **Conservative management**: Continue conservative treatment, including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and lifestyle modifications.

- **Diagnostic evaluation**: Consider further diagnostic evaluation to identify other potential sources of pain, such as facet joint pain or lumbar radiculopathy.

- **Patient education**: Educate the patient about the limited evidence for SI joint injections in non-specific low back pain and the potential risks associated with invasive procedures.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on current ACOEM guidelines, **SI joint corticosteroid injection is not recommended** for this patient with chronic non-specific low back pain without evidence of inflammatory sacroiliitis. The evidence supporting SI joint injections in this context is limited and inconsistent, and conservative management should continue. If symptoms persist, consider alternative diagnostic evaluations and treatment options.

### Emergency department intraarticular corticosteroid injection for sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^b80f74c5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction is a common but underrecognized source of low back pain (LBP). With provocative testing, emergency physicians can diagnose SIJ dysfunction and begin appropriate treatment in the emergency department (ED).

Discussion

For patients with significant pain from SIJ dysfunction, ultrasound-guided SIJ injection of anesthetic and corticosteroid can reduce patients' pain considerably.

Conclusions

For patients who are good candidates for SIJ injection, emergency physicians can begin treatment in the ED, before the patient follows up with a specialist.

Best Practice Statement on Imaging of the SIJ

The clinician should obtain appropriate imaging and rule out other pathologies such as fracture, malignancy, and spinal disease. If planning surgical treatment, advanced imaging such as CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed within 12 months or with any change in symptomatology.

Diagnostic Intra-Articular Injections

While injections into the SIJ can prove therapeutic, they can additionally provide valuable diagnostic utility. Injectates with anesthetic only will be expected to provide rapid analgesic benefit that persists for only hours, depending on the anesthetic type used. Steroid injections will be expected to provide pain relief that is delayed 2–5 days and can be sustained for weeks to months. Close follow-up with the patient following the procedure and incorporation of a pain diary will help characterize the diagnostic utility of intra-articular injections. The pain diary will ideally include recordings of the patient's pain severity along with functional measures. Evidence does not suggest that degree of pain relief over 50% corresponds with improved outcomes when considering surgical fusion. See Table 3 for a summary of SIJ pain diagnosis methods.

Table 3
Diagnosis of SIJ Pain

Best Practice Statement on Diagnostic Intra-Articular Injection of the SIJ

The patient should experience greater than 50% relief when an appropriately performed local anesthetic only injection is completed that is consistent with duration of the local anesthetic utilized. A second confirmatory local anesthetic injection can be considered, but not mandatory, when using diagnostic injections to determine candidacy for surgical treatment.

### Association between corticosteroid dose and pain reduction after sacroiliac joint injections [^257a0991]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sacroiliac joint-mediated back pain has proven therapeutic benefit from fluoroscopically guided sacroiliac joint corticosteroid injections. We examined corticosteroid dose and pain relief after fluoroscopically guided sacroiliac joint injections to better understand their relationship.

Design

This is a retrospective observational cohort analysis of electronic health record data on 661 patients who received unilateral fluoroscopically guided sacroiliac joint intraarticular corticosteroid injection with 40 mg versus 80 mg of methylprednisolone from 2012 and 2019. Patients were injected by fellowship trained proceduralists after diagnosis by board-certified physiatrists in an academic physiatry practice. Absolute change in pain scores (postprocedure and first follow-up) was modeled using linear regression of methylprednisolone dosage (40 mg vs. 80 mg) controlling for age, sex, body mass index, baseline pain scores, and follow-up time.

Results

Linear regression indicated that dosage of methylprednisolone, age, and body mass index were not statistically significantly associated with change in pain scores. Sex approached significance (P = 0.0501) indicating that females may have a lower degree of pain resolution than males.

Conclusions

Practitioners should consider corticosteroid dose when performing these beneficial procedures. This could reduce cost and potential side effects associated with larger doses, while still providing therapeutic benefit. This pilot study can guide future research and dosing guidelines for fluoroscopic spine injections.

Evidence Summary

For sacroiliac joint literature, there was sufficient evidence in the form of 2 RCTs and several observational studies (Table 11), for the committee to make recommendations. Table 12 summarizes those recommendations. SIJ dysfunction is a complex pain process with numerous proposed therapy options ranging from physical therapy to invasive surgery on the procedural continuum, SIJ injections are usually the first line in both diagnostic and therapeutic care.

### Review of occupational medicine practice guidelines for interventional pain management and potential implications [^d562c516]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

In the modern day environment, workers' compensation costs continue to be a challenge, with a need to balance costs, benefits, and quality of medical care. The cost of workers' compensation care affects all stakeholders including workers, employers, providers, regulators, legislators, and insurers. Consequently, a continued commitment to quality, accessibility to care, and cost containment will help ensure that workers are afforded accessible, high quality, and cost-effective care. In 2004, workers' compensation programs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and federal programs in the United States combined received an income of $87.4 billion while paying out only $56 billion in medical and cash benefits with $31.4 billion or 37% in administrative expenses and profit. Occupational diseases represented only 8% of the workers' compensation claims and 29% of the cost. The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) has published several guidelines; though widely adopted by WCPs, these guidelines evaluate the practice of medicine of multiple specialties without adequate expertise and expert input from the concerned specialties, including interventional pain management. An assessment of the ACOEM guidelines utilizing Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) criteria, the criteria developed by the American Medical Association (AMA), the Institute of Medicine (IOM), and other significantly accepted criteria, consistently showed very low scores (< 30%) in most aspects of the these guidelines. The ACOEM recommendations do not appear to have been based on a careful review of the literature, overall quality of evidence, standard of care, or expert consensus. Based on the evaluation utilizing appropriate and current evidence-based medicine (EBM) principles, the evidence ratings for diagnostic techniques of lumbar discography; cervical, thoracic, and lumbar facet joint nerve blocks and sacroiliac joint nerve blocks; therapeutic cervical and lumbar medial branch blocks and radiofrequency neurolysis; cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections, caudal epidural steroid injections, and lumbar transforaminal epidural injections; caudal percutaneous adhesiolysis; abd spinal cord stimulation were found to be moderate with strong recommendation applying for most patients in most circumstances. The evidence ratings for intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET), an automated percutaneous disc decompression and also deserve further scrutiny and analysis. In conclusion, these ACOEM guidelines for interventional pain management have no applicability in modern patient care due to lack of expertise by the developing organization (ACOEM), lack of utilization of appropriate and current EBM principles, and lack of significant involvement of experts in these techniques resulting in a lack of clinical relevance. Thus, they may result in reduced medical quality of care; may severely hinder access to appropriate, medically needed and essential medical care; and finally, they may increase costs for injured workers, third party payors, and the government by transferring the injured worker into a non-productive disability system.

### Sacroiliac joint and lumbar zygapophysial joint corticosteroid injections [^836e43b6]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The sacroiliac joint and the lumbar zygapophysial joints are both known pain generators with demonstrated pain-referral patterns. They are both amenable to image-guided intraarticular injection of corticosteroids, a procedure that is commonly performed for pain. The literature on the efficacy of intraarticular corticosteroid injections for these joints is currently limited. This article covers the diagnostic dilemmas associated with these joints, the utility of anesthetic blocks, and the literature on the efficacy of intraarticular corticosteroid injections.

### Responsible, safe, and effective use of biologics in the management of low back pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines [^b4846e2a]. Pain Physician (2019). High credibility.

ASIPP guidelines — guidance for responsible, safe, and effective use of biologics for lumbar spine care indicates that the evidence base is limited and heterogeneous, with study follow-up ranging from 6 weeks to 3 years. Lack of methodological standardization is noted as a barrier to reproducibility and to declarative recommendations. In regard to cost and current practice, corticosteroid injections are cheaper than platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and are the current standard of care for chronic joint degeneration; accordingly, PRP is considered in patients after corticosteroids fail or are deemed no longer appropriate. Based on the available literature, interventional treatments for lumbar discs, facet and sacroiliac joints are performed in conjunction with a definitive diagnosis, and after failed conservative therapy. Published studies report single‑injection biologic use on chronic pathology with short‑term relief, and PRP has been the most commonly utilized biologic within the lumbar spine. Continued clinical use is said to depend on standardization, consistent outcomes, and documentation of an overall decrease in healthcare costs.

Diagnostic and Therapeutic Injections

An analgesic response to an SI joint injection is the most accurate means to diagnose a painful SI joint complex. The specificity of a subjective response to a low volume of local anesthetic (generally accepted volume based on the joint space) has always been in question. Multiple studies have looked at the therapeutic effect of SIJ injections – a few have demonstrated significant benefit but being small powered studies the authors were not able to demonstrate statistically significant differences in medication usage or functionality between the treatment and control groups. Of the ones which evaluated periarticular injections with corticosteroids, patients continued to have good pain relief at 6 months demonstrating decreased spontaneous pain, provoked pain, and tenderness. A recent review of 15 publications related to spondylarthritis showed that a good response was reported in more than 80% of the cases, with a mean duration of improvement over 8 months. Eighty-five percent of the subjects reviewed from other observational studies also obtained significant pain relief lasting for an average of 10 months. Diagnostic or therapeutic injections should be performed using the aid of fluoroscopy, as studies have shown that only 22% of non-radiologically guided SI injections extended into the joint space.

Sacroiliac Joint Arthritis

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is the principal weight-bearing diarthrodial synovial axial joint. Innervation of the SIJ stems consistently from the dorsal rami of L5, alongside the lateral branches of S1 and S2. Osteoarthritic degeneration commonly underlies SIJ-mediated pain. Traditional interventional approaches for managing such pain include intra-articular or periarticular injections, as well as neurolysis of nerves innervating the SIJ.

Few studies describe the use of PRP treatment for SIJ pain. The existing literature comprises prospective cohort studies, non-randomized trials, and RCTs with sample sizes ranging from 40 to 186 patients. Follow-up periods varied from 3 to 12 months. Saunders et aladministered PRP into and around the dorsal interosseous ligament, whereas, in other studies, PRP was injected into the synovial portion of the joint. Across all studies, PRP treatment yielded significantly improved pain scores compared to steroid injections. A systematic review comparing the outcomes of patients treated with PRP or corticosteroids for lumbar spondylosis and SIJ arthropathy encompassed five studies (three RCTs and two non-randomized trials) comprising 242 chronic low back pain patients. Three studies reported a significant improvement in pain scores among the PRP cohorts. The study concluded that both PRP and corticosteroid injections are safe and effective options, however, there is some indication suggesting that PRP injections may offer superior efficacy over CSI during long-term follow-up. It is pertinent to note that the scope of the study was limited by the inclusion of studies analyzing diverse spine pathologies. To date, no human studies have been published to our knowledge on the use of MSCs in SIJ pain and this remains an area for future research.

Consensus Point 23. The current evidence generally supports that intra-articular sacroiliac joint injection with PRP may be associated with superior analgesia compared to intra-articular corticosteroid injection for sacroiliac joint pain (Level I, Grade B).

Sacroiliac joint provocative tests and pain patterns — diagnostic selection: Even though pain patterns may help identify candidates for diagnostic injections, they are not pathognomic. Multiple studies indicate that 6 commonly performed provocative tests may be useful to select patients for further study provided 3 or more are positive, and the evidence is fair for provocative testing.

### Commonly used interventional procedures for non-cancer chronic spine pain: a clinical practice guideline [^7983a530]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the comparative effectiveness and safety of commonly used interventional procedures (such as spinal injections and ablation procedures) for chronic axial and radicular spine pain that is not associated with cancer or inflammatory arthropathy?

Current Practice

Chronic spine pain is a common, potentially disabling complaint, for which clinicians often administer interventional procedures. However, clinical practice guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations for their use.

Recommendations

For people living with chronic axial spine pain (≥ 3 months), the guideline panel issued strong recommendations against: joint radiofrequency ablation with or without joint targeted injection of local anaesthetic plus steroid; epidural injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; joint-targeted injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; and intramuscular injection of local anaesthetic with or without steroids. For people living with chronic radicular spine pain (≥ 3 months), the guideline panel issued strong recommendations against: dorsal root ganglion radiofrequency with or without epidural injection of local anaesthetic or local anaesthetic plus steroids; and epidural injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international guideline development panel including four people living with chronic spine pain, 10 clinicians with experience managing chronic spine pain, and eight methodologists, produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation provided methodological support. The guideline panel applied an individual patient perspective when formulating recommendations.

The Evidence

These recommendations are informed by a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials and a systematic review of observational studies, summarising the current body of evidence for benefits and harms of common interventional procedures for axial and radicular, chronic, non-cancer spine pain. Specifically, injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination into the cervical or lumbar facet joint or sacroiliac joint; epidural injections of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; radiofrequency of dorsal root ganglion; radiofrequency denervation of cervical or lumbar facet joints or the sacroiliac joint; and paravertebral intramuscular injections of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination.

Understanding The Recommendations

These recommendations apply to people living with chronic spine pain (≥ 3 months duration) that is not associated with cancer or inflammatory arthropathy and do not apply to the management of acute spine pain. Further research is warranted and may alter recommendations in the future: in particular, whether there are differences in treatment effects based on subtypes of chronic spine pain, establishing the effectiveness of interventional procedures currently supported by low or very low certainty evidence, and effects on poorly reported patient-important outcomes (such as opioid use, return to work, and sleep quality).

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^5935e275]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Fluoroscopically guided sacroiliac (SI) joint injections — In a retrospective study, patients with low back pain (LBP) who failed to improve after at least 4 weeks of physical therapy and had a positive response to a fluoroscopically guided diagnostic SI joint injection were included. Participants received up to four therapeutic SI joint injections consisting of 2.0 mL of betamethasone sodium phosphate and acetate suspension, 6 mg/ml and 0.5 mL 2% lidocaine hydrochloride. Pain, disability, work status, and medication usage were recorded at baseline and an average of 9.4 weeks after the last injection, and there were statistically significant improvements in disability, pain and work status over time. The authors concluded that fluoroscopically guided SI joint injections are clinically effective for the treatment of SI joint syndrome. This study provides Level IV evidence that patients with LBP and reduced function due to sacroiliac joint dysfunction having an 80% improvement from a diagnostic sacroiliac joint injection followed by an intra-articular steroid joint injection experienced a clinically and statistically significant reduction in pain and disability scores. The average number of injections was 2.1.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^ceffe185]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline — non-surgical invasive therapy recommendations state: For patients with chronic low back pain, we suggest lumbar medial branch and/or sacral lateral branch radiofrequency ablation. For patients with low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against sacroiliac joint injections. For patients with low back pain, we suggest against the injection of corticosteroids for intra-articular facet joint injections and therapeutic medial branch blocks with steroid. For patients with chronic low back pain, we suggest acupuncture. For patients with acute low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against acupuncture. For patients with low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against ortho-biologics (e.g., platelet-rich plasma, stem cells). For patients with low back pain, with radicular symptoms, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against epidural steroid injections. For patients with low back pain, we suggest against spinal cord stimulation.

### Use and safety of corticosteroid injections in joints and musculoskeletal soft tissue: guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^ae37d4a3]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injection and peri-articular corticosteroid injection are commonly used to treat musculoskeletal conditions. Results vary by musculoskeletal region, but most studies report short-term benefit with mixed results on long-term relief. Publications showed adverse events from single corticosteroid injections. Recommended effective doses were lower than those currently used by clinicians.

Methods

Development of the practice guideline for joint injections was approved by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the participating societies. A Corticosteroid Safety Work Group coordinated the development of three guidelines: peripheral nerve blocks and trigger points; joints; and neuraxial, facet, and sacroiliac joint injections. The topics included safety of the technique in relation to landmark-guided, ultrasound-guided, or radiology-aided injections; effect of the addition of the corticosteroid on the efficacy of the injectate; and adverse events related to the injection. Experts on the topics were assigned to extensively review the literature and initially develop consensus statements and recommendations. A modified version of the US Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence and strength of recommendation was followed. A modified Delphi process was adhered to in arriving at a consensus.

Results

This guideline focuses on the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid joint injections for managing joint chronic pain in adults. The joints that were addressed included the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet. All the statements and recommendations were approved by all participants and the Board of Directors of the participating societies after four rounds of discussion. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain. A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for both shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections. The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone. Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. Overall, IACS injections result in short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months. The adverse events include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection.

Conclusions

In this practice guideline, we provided specific recommendations on the role of corticosteroids in joint, bursa, and peritendon injections for musculoskeletal pain.

### Sacroiliac joint pain and dysfunction [^5fcf862d]. Pain Physician (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this current opinion on sacroiliac joint pain and dysfunction is to assist interventional pain physicians to apply appropriate treatment decisions and rationale to their patients in pain. Discussion of relevant scientific data and controversial positions will be provided. This review is intended to help characterize the sacroiliac joint as a pain generator, and explore its contribution to the differential diagnosis of low back pain. Historical, technical, and current treatment practice will be characterized against current evidence. Discussion will provoke support or criticism of the relevant scientific data, and general recommendations for interventional pain management physicians should be considered within the context of the individual practitioners skill and practice patterns. Current Opinion is not intended to provide a standard of care.

### Image guided sacroiliac joint corticosteroid injections in children: an 18-year single-center retrospective study [^c78d89ad]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Similar to the benefits of injections in other joints, corticosteroids relieved the symptoms (especially pain) with SI joint inflammation in the majority of the patients. This was assessed in two ways: clinically by patient history/physical exam, and on imaging by assessing and scoring MRIs before and after the procedure. Most of the patients with a decrease of inflammation on post injection MRI also reported symptomatic improvement and met the MCID in the SPARCC SIS of 2.5. An interesting finding is that a group of patients despite the imaging improvement had worsening of symptoms. The reason why this happens is currently unclear to us and warrants further studies.

Clinical improvements were not sustained in the majority of patients who received joint injections. Within 2 years, only two patients achieved remission and one patient a reduction in treatment. The remainder stayed on the same management plan or escalated to a higher level of medical therapy (eg. biologic agents) within a year. More than half of the patients who transitioned to biological agents had exclusively SI joint involvement.

There are several limitations with this retrospective study. Disease severity may have been underestimated as patient history and complaints were limited to those recorded in the rheumatology clinic notes. Radiological reports may not have captured all procedural details or difficulties encounter during SI joint injections, resulting in an underestimate. Some patients were transferred to adult facilities once they came of age or were simply lost to follow-up. Follow-up MRIs were not consistently performed on a protocol basis, but variably depending on clinical indication. Due to the complexity of the management of sacroiliitis in JIA patients, a comparison of monotherapy with corticosteroid injections to medical management alone was not possible.

Best Practice Statement on Intra-Articular Corticosteroid Injections for SIJ Pain

Image-guided, intra-articular corticosteroid injections are recommended for persistent SIJ pain that has persisted despite conservative measures for 4 weeks. Fluoroscopic and CT guided injections are the preferred imaging modality of choice, although ultrasound guidance can be considered in situations where radiation exposure may be problematic.

Neuroablative Treatment of SIJ Pain

After an appropriate trial of conservative care, and appropriate response to diagnostic blockade, neuroablative techniques can be considered in patients with SIJ pain and dysfunction. The most common neuroablative approach involves radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the lateral branches of the S1-S3 dorsal rami along with medial branches of L5 dorsal rami and possibly L4. 20 However, rarer modalities of ablation, such as intra-articular chemical neurolysis as well as cryoablation, have also been offered with low-quality evidence supporting mild efficacy and limitations due to adverse effect profile.

Lateral Branch Blocks

Soto et al describe a multi-site, multi-depth 16-injection technique under fluoroscopy where the sacral foramina are compared to a clock face with the lateral margin being the center of the face. On the right side, at the S1 and S2 levels, the needles are placed at the 2:30, 4:00, and 5:30 positions. At the same levels on the left, needles are placed at 9:30, 8:00, and 6:30 positions. At the S3 level, needles are placed at 2:30 and 4:00 on the right and 9:30 and 8:00 on the left. Each of these targets are then injected with 0.2 mL of 0.75% bupivacaine, pulled back approximately 3 mm, and injected with another 0.2 mL of bupivacaine. The goal of this technique is to capture all the lateral branches that do not run in a constant plane nor do they emerge from the posterior sacral foramina at a consistent location.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^c3265c9e]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Sacroiliac joint pain — periarticular injections were examined in randomized and observational studies: a randomized trial reported that a periarticular injection of botulinum toxin was effective in a significant proportion of patients at 3 month follow-up; a retrospective comparison found patients receiving intraarticular and periarticular injections fared better than intraarticular alone but only 31.25% of patients who received the combination of injections experienced relief at 3 months; two randomized trials showed periarticular injection of local anesthetic with steroids to be superior, though only in a short-term follow-up; overall, based on the limited results, there is limited evidence for periarticular injections of local anesthetic and steroid or botulinum toxin.

### Evidence-based practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain [^7cc14940]. Pain Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Evidence-based practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain are systematically developed and professionally derived statements and recommendations that assist both physicians and patients in making decisions about appropriate health care in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic or persistent pain. The guidelines were developed utilizing an evidence-based approach to increase patient access to treatment, to improve outcomes and appropriateness of care, and to optimize cost-effectiveness. All types of relevant and published evidence and consensus were utilized. The guidelines include a discussion of their purpose, rationale, and importance, including descriptions of the patient population served, the methodology, and the pathophysiologic basis for intervention. Multiple diagnostic and therapeutic interventional techniques are included in this document. Strong evidence was shown for diagnostic facet joint blocks for the diagnosis of facet joint pain, and lumbar provocative discography for discogenic pain. Moderate evidence was shown for sacroiliac joint blocks in the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain, and for transforaminal epidural injections in the preoperative evaluation of patients with negative or inconclusive imaging studies, but with clinical findings of nerve root irritation. Moderate to strong evidence was shown for multiple therapeutic interventional techniques including medial branch blocks and medial branch neurotomy; caudal epidural steroid injections and transforaminal epidural steroid injections; lumbar percutaneous adhesiolysis; and implantable therapies. These guidelines do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations. It is expected that a provider will establish a plan of care on a case-by-case basis, taking into account an individual patient's medical condition, personal needs, and preferences, and the physician's experience. Based on an individual patient's needs, treatment different from that outlined here could be warranted. These guidelines do not represent "standard of care".

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^ecd04e59]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Intraarticular injections — evidence assessment for sacroiliac joint pain states that intraarticular injections are commonly used but evidence remains limited, as 4 systematic reviews have shown a lack of significant evidence in chronic sacroiliac joint pain without spondyloarthropathy and no additional studies were identified since the prior review. As per the systematic review by Hansen et al, there were a total of 4 studies evaluating intraarticular injections, with only one randomized active-control trial; in that trial by Kim et al comparing prolotherapy to steroid injections, the authors found no significant differences at 3 months, but prolotherapy was more effective on a long-term basis. Other reports included positive results in a large retrospective series with fluoroscopy-guided intraarticular injections, short-term effectiveness of intraarticular steroid injections, and a comparison of intraarticular versus combined intra- and periarticular injections where results were suboptimal with both techniques but somewhat better for the combined group; excluded studies showed positive results in spondyloarthropathy and short-term superiority of periarticular over intraarticular injections.

### Use of corticosteroids for adult chronic pain interventions: sympathetic and peripheral nerve blocks, trigger point injections-guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^f3aa872b]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is potential for adverse events from corticosteroid injections, including increase in blood glucose, decrease in bone mineral density and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Published studies note that doses lower than those commonly injected provide similar benefit.

Methods

Development of the practice guideline was approved by the Board of Directors of American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine with several other societies agreeing to participate. The scope of guidelines was agreed on to include safety of the injection technique (landmark-guided, ultrasound or radiology-aided injections); effect of the addition of the corticosteroid on the efficacy of the injectate (local anesthetic or saline); and adverse events related to the injection. Based on preliminary discussions, it was decided to structure the topics into three separate guidelines as follows: (1) sympathetic, peripheral nerve blocks and trigger point injections; (2) joints; and (3) neuraxial, facet, sacroiliac joints and related topics (vaccine and anticoagulants). Experts were assigned topics to perform a comprehensive review of the literature and to draft statements and recommendations, which were refined and voted for consensus (≥ 75% agreement) using a modified Delphi process. The United States Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence and strength of recommendation was followed.

Results

This guideline deals with the use and safety of corticosteroid injections for sympathetic, peripheral nerve blocks and trigger point injections for adult chronic pain conditions. All the statements and recommendations were approved by all participants after four rounds of discussion. The Practice Guidelines Committees and Board of Directors of the participating societies also approved all the statements and recommendations. The safety of some procedures, including stellate blocks, lower extremity peripheral nerve blocks and some sites of trigger point injections, is improved by imaging guidance. The addition of non-particulate corticosteroid to the local anesthetic is beneficial in cluster headaches but not in other types of headaches. Corticosteroid may provide additional benefit in transverse abdominal plane blocks and ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve blocks in postherniorrhaphy pain but there is no evidence for pudendal nerve blocks. There is minimal benefit for the use of corticosteroids in trigger point injections.

Conclusions

In this practice guideline, we provided recommendations on the use of corticosteroids in sympathetic blocks, peripheral nerve blocks, and trigger point injections to assist clinicians in making informed decisions.

### Efficacy of lateral view needle placement for sacroiliac joint injections [^18fc0261]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain is becoming an increasingly recognized pathology in patients with lower back pain, with current estimates suggesting that 15–30% of lower back pain may be attributed to SIJ pathology. The SIJ connects the sacrum to the bilateral ilium bones and is the largest axial synovial joint in the body by surface area. The SIJ is relatively inflexible due to the wide surface area of the joint, which is reinforced with irregular bony elevations and depressions that interlock the two bones in a "C" shape as well as thick, redundant ligaments exterior to the synovium. The SIJ has a very narrow joint space, ranging from 0.5 to 4mm leading to approximate ranges of motion of 3 degrees in flexion and extension, 1.5 degrees in axial rotation, and 0.8 degrees in lateral bending.

Sacroiliac pain may be caused by exterior shearing forces, hypo- or hyper-mobility, micro- or macro-fractures, soft tissue injury, inflammation, pregnancy causing laxity in the supporting ligaments, leg length discrepancy, and prior lumbar fusion, among others. The proximity of the joint to the hip joint and lumbar spine often leads to a variety of presenting symptoms, which has led to SIJ pain being referred to as the great "mimicker" of different pain pathologies. The innervation of the SIJ is complex and, despite some conflicting information in the literature, most clinicians agree that the sensory fibers stem from the lateral branches of the posterior rami of L5-S4, which are the pain sensors of the joint.

Because the differential diagnosis for SIJ pain is broad, misdiagnosis is common. The diagnosis of SIJ pain begins with a thorough history and physical examination. If a patient has a positive response to 3 or more SIJ provocative tests, the pain is likely due to pathology in the SIJ and may result in a positive diagnostic SIJ block. The SIJ block consists of intraarticular injection of corticosteroids and local anesthetics to reduce inflammation and pain, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Current standards suggest that a 75% pain improvement after two separate injections is considered a positive diagnosis of sacroiliitis.

### Serial therapeutic sacroiliac joint injections: a practice audit [^5d73048b]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the long-term response to serial sacroiliac joint (SIJ) corticosteroid injections. Design. Retrospective practice audit.

Setting and Patients

Tertiary care spine center. Review of charts of all patients in a single practice who underwent diagnostic and therapeutic fluoroscopically guided SIJ injections with combined local anesthetic, long-acting corticosteroid, and contrast.

Measures

Response was evaluated at 1 hour and again at follow-up clinic visits. Response to injection was graded as positive if there was ≥ 50% relief of the targeted pain during the local anesthetic phase and at least 2 weeks of ≥ 50% relief afterward. If pain recurred, patients had to have been sufficiently satisfied with the relief to request repeat injection.

Results

There were 164 patients; 5 had incomplete records, 4 had < 2 year follow-up. Of the 155 patients, 120 (77%) were positive responders; 45 were men and 75 were women; and the mean age was 48 (27–91) years. Sixty-nine had prior lumbar surgery. Mean duration of follow-up was 44 months (26–101). Two were lost to follow-up. The 118 positive responders received a mean of 2.7 injections per patient. Forty patients required 1 injection only, 29 required two, 22 required three, and 27 required four or more. The mean duration of response for those receiving > 1 injection was 9.3 months per injection (1–58). There were no adverse events.

Conclusions

SIJ corticosteroid injections appear to be an effective palliative treatment for selected patients with SIJ pain. Most patients whose pain is responsive to SIJ steroid injections improved sufficiently and remained well after 1 to 3 injections, but some required frequent injections on a long-term basis.

Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of peer-reviewed published data pertaining to regenerative medicine injections for SIJ-related pain, and there is no evidence to suggest that one regenerative medicine injectate is superior to another. There has been one RCTand two prospective observational studies on this topic. In 2015, Navani and Gupta performed a prospective case series on 10 adult patients with SIJ pain of greater than six months duration and had failed conservative treatments. All patients underwent a single SIJ injection with 4 cc of PRP utilizing fluoroscopic guidance. All patients experienced at least a 50% reduction in the VAS score and improved function at 12 months post-injection. None of the patients required additional treatments after the PRP injection during the 12-month study follow-up. In 2017, Ko et al reported a prospective case series of four patients that underwent ultrasound guided SIJ PRP injection. At 12-months post-injection all patients reported a statistically significant reduction in pain and improvement in quality of life. Also in 2017, Singla et al performed a prospective RCT studying the efficacy and safety of PRP versus methylprednisolone in ultrasound guided SIJ injections. They enrolled 40 patients with chronic low back pain and a diagnosis of SIJ pathology, and subjects were randomly assigned to either Group S (1.5 mL of methylprednisolone (60 mg), 1.5 mL of 2% lidocaine, and 0.5 mL of saline) or Group P (3 mL of leukocyte-free PRP and 0.5 mL of calcium chloride). Subjects were evaluated at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months. Group P had higher improvements in pain relief, disability, and quality of life at 3 months compared to Group S. In a systematic review, Sanapati et al described the evidence grade for regenerative medicine as Level IV (scale Level I to V), based on the studies above. They reported that there is a lack of high-quality RCTs, but that the published evidence suggests that regenerative medicine may be effective in managing SIJ pain.

Best Practice Statement on the Use of Regenerative Medicine Techniques for SIJ Pain

The use of regenerative medicine is an evolving therapy with developing evidence. The current use of these therapies should be used based on current literature, and application of these treatments should be considered on an individualized basis when other more validated treatments fail to provide benefit or are contraindicated.

### American Society of Pain and Neuroscience best practice (ASPN) guideline for the treatment of sacroiliac disorders [^67983c7c]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The treatment of SID is a complex and important matter in the management of patients with back, buttock and leg pain. The best practice of treating this disorder involves 1) An understanding of anatomy; 2) Proper history taking of factors suggesting this pathology; 3) An understanding of comorbid pathologies that can cause similar complaints; 4) An understanding of imaging and ruling out other significant disease processes; 5) An understanding of physical examination for SID; 6) An understanding of diagnostic injections and evaluation of response; 7) An understanding of the proper use and methods of neuroablative procedures; and 8) An understanding of the risk to benefit assessment of various methods of minimally invasive and surgical methods of SID treatment.

When each of these goals are met using best practices, the patient has the most likely chance of an optimal outcome with improvements in both safety and efficacy.

Introduction

The sacroiliac (SI) joint (SIJ) has been a major source of pain in many patients as either a primary problem or an issue secondary to gait disorders, spinal pathology, or certain risk factors. Despite the high prevalence of this disorder, it is underdiagnosed and may go untreated, poorly treated, or treated with highly invasive methods. The goal of this paper is to better define the anatomy, diagnosis, and best practices for treatment of this common and often poorly misunderstood pathology. These guidelines should be utilized by all clinicians involved in the care of patients suffering from SI disorders (SID) to improve clinical outcomes and safety.

### Radiofrequency vs steroid injections for spinal facet and sacroiliac joint pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5b216bda]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Pain management for spinal facet joint (SFJ) and sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain is challenging, often requiring interventions like radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or corticosteroid injections (CI). This study aims to assess and compare the effectiveness of CI and RFA in treating SFJ and SIJ pain. We combine these treatments due to their shared pathophysiology, similar therapeutic interventions, and the necessity for an integrated approach to spinal pain management.

Patients and Methods

Literature search from PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL and Google Scholar for published studies upto 31 st December 2023, and reporting data of patients who were treated using CI of RFA for SFJ and SIJ pain. Pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was calculated.

Results

Our meta-analysis incorporated thirteen studies. Overall, patients, treated with CI had a higher pain intensity score compared to patients treated with RFA (SMD = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.19 to 1.65) at 3 months, and at 6 months (SMD = 1.53; 95% CI: 0.66 to 2.40) after the treatment. No significant association was reported at 12 months (SMD = 1.47; 95% CI: -0.03 to 2.97). Subgroup analysis based on joint types revealed increased pain intensity scores in patients who were treated with CI for SIJ (SMD = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.39 to 2.11) and SFJ (SMD = 1.33; 95% CI: 0.09 to 2.57) pain. A negative but not significant effect was detected in patients, treated with CI for cervical joint pain (SMD = -0.40; 95% CI: -0.90 to 0.10). Patients treated with CI exhibited higher functional disability score compared to patients treated with RFA at 3 months (SMD = 1.28; 95% CI: 0.20 to 2.35) post-treatment.

Conclusion

This study suggests that RFA may offer superior pain relief with longer duration compared to steroid injections for spinal facet and sacroiliac joint pain. Decision regarding specific interventions should be individualized and consider patient preferences, clinical context, and potential risks.

### Radiofrequency vs steroid injections for spinal facet and sacroiliac joint pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3b2c0b10]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and corticosteroid injections (CI) have emerged as prominent therapeutic modalities in pain management of such patients. The primary interventions for both conditions, RFA and CI, work by reducing inflammation and disrupting pain signals, supporting a combined therapeutic strategy. Injection with corticosteroids have shown promise in managing SFJ-related lower back pain. Additionally, the application of RFA in patients with SFJ pain has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing pain scores and enhancing overall quality of life. Current treatment options for patients with SIJ pain include pharmacotherapy, chiropractic manipulation, CI injections, and surgical fixation. Recently, RFA has gained popularity for SIJ pain management, with studies reporting promising results.

However, due to variability in methodologies, including differences in techniques and selection criteria, the comparative effectiveness of RFA and CI in pain management of patients with SFJ and SIJ problem is still unclear. Given the significant impact of chronic spinal pain on quality of life, physical function, and healthcare resources, identifying the optimal treatment modality is essential. Insurance coverage for these procedures often varies, with some insurers being more inclined to cover steroid injections over RFA or vice versa. This variability can affect patients' access to the most effective treatments. By providing a systematic comparison of the efficacy of these interventions, our study offers valuable insights that can inform insurance policy decisions. This meta-analysis aims to comparing the efficiency of CI and RFA in managing pain associated with SFJ and SIJ. Our results may provide valuable insights into the optimal approach for pain management of these conditions, guiding clinicians in making informed decisions for the benefit of their patients, reducing reliance on opioids, and enhancing overall management strategies for spinal pain.

### Image guided sacroiliac joint corticosteroid injections in children: an 18-year single-center retrospective study [^e3e872eb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sacroiliitis is commonly seen in enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Sacroiliitis is characterized by the inflammation of the sacroiliac (SI) joints (+/− adjacent tissues). The treatment options include systemic therapy with or without corticosteroid SI joint injections. Image guided SI joint injections are frequently requested in pediatric patients with sacroiliitis.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of SI joint injections in children with sacroiliitis.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients referred to Interventional Radiology (IR) for SI joint corticosteroid injections (2000–2018). Clinical information was collected from Electronic Patient Charts and procedural details from PACS. Efficacy was determined clinically, by MRI, or both when available.

Results

50 patients (13.8 years; M:F = 35:15) underwent image-guided SI joint corticosteroid injections. Most common indications were JIA (84%) and inflammatory bowel disease (14%). 80% had bilateral injections. 80% were performed under general anesthesia and 20% under sedation. The corticosteroid of choice was triamcinolone hexacetonide in 98% of patients. Needle guidance and confirmation was performed using CT and fluoroscopy (54%), Cone Beam CT (CBCT, 46%), with initial ultrasound assistance in 34%. All procedures were technically successful without any complications. 32/50 patients had long-term follow-up (2 years); 21/32 (66%) had clinical improvement within 3-months. Of 15 patients who had both pre- and post-procedure MRIs, 93% showed short-term improvement. At 2 years, 6% of patients were in remission, 44% continued the same treatment and 47% escalated treatment.

Conclusion

Image-guided SI joint injections are safe and technically feasible in children. Imaging modalities for guidance have evolved, with CBCT being the current first choice. Most patients showed short-term clinical and imaging improvement, requiring long-term maintenance or escalation of medical treatment.

Discussion

Sacroiliitis is a prominent clinical manifestation of the ERA sub-type of JIA and is frequently associated with HLA B27 positivity. It can be treated medically or by SI corticosteroid joint injections. The management of patients with JIA requires a multidisciplinary approach as shown in this study in which rheumatology, diagnostic imaging and interventional radiology worked together to provide diagnosis, treatment and follow up. Prior to image guided techniques, corticosteroid injections were performed by palpation of anatomical landmarks. However, this technique lacked specificity or efficiency due to the complexity of the sacroiliac joint anatomy. With evolving imaging technology, image guided techniques have become increasingly available. Historically, fluoroscopy was employed. With the advent of cross sectional imaging, conventional CT or cone beam CT has been used to guide needle placement and ensure successful intra-articular injections. US has also been utilized for needle guidance, on its own or combined with cross sectional imaging. More recently there are reports of MRI guided injections. The use of three needles has been reported in the literature, in the inferior, middle and superior aspects of the joint, however currently only one needle in the inferior or middle synovial portion of the joint is preferred. Although two different cross sectional imaging modalities were used in this study, all cases were successfully completed without any peri- or post-procedure complication. US assisted in approximately one third of the SI joint injections. From 2000 to 2009, CT fluoroscopy were the only cross sectional imaging option available in this IR practice. In 2010, Cone Beam CT became available and provided satisfactory image guidance for the procedure. It eventually replaced CT fluoroscopy in 2016 due to its adequate performance, ease of use and recognized radiation dose reduction, as has been demonstrated in the literature. The corticosteroid currently used is triamcinolone hexacetonide as studies have shown that it is more effective than hydrocortisone succinate and triamcinolone acetonide in reducing pain and joint inflammation.

### Efficacy of lateral view needle placement for sacroiliac joint injections [^eebbb342]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Data Collection

Data from 38 patients who underwent fluoroscopy guided SIJ injection was retrospectively reviewed, for which IRB approval was granted by the MetroWest Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Preoperatively collected patient data included demographics (age, sex, BMI), patient reported outcome scores from the numerical rating scale (NRS), and initial needle location. Post-operative NRS scores were collected at 1–2-week follow-up for each patient.

Patient Assessment

Patients were assessed for positive clinical history and a physical examination positive for three or more SIJ provocative maneuvers. After failing more conservative measures first (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, alternate modalities, etc.), patients elected for SIJ steroid injections on the affected side. Patients who had previous SIJ surgery were excluded from receiving SIJ injections and were thus unable to participate in the study. All patients were assessed pre-operatively and post-operatively using the NRS patient reported outcome measure. The NRS is a 10-point scale used to assess pain where patients self-report symptoms on a continuous 10 cm scale indicating "no pain" at the 0 cm line and "worst pain" on the 10 cm line. Patient pain is interpreted as the point selected on the scale.

Procedure

Our procedure was performed under standard protocols and conditions according to current International Spine Intervention Society (ISIS) guidelines, with the addition of a lateral view to confirm placement in the SIJ. All procedures were done by the same physician and team at the same location and with the same equipment, mitigating any potential confounding variables. Patients were placed in the prone position on the operative table. The superficial SIJ region was first numbed with local anesthetic. Using fluoroscopy, the C-arm was initially placed in the AP view to visualize the affected SIJ, and further adjustments to a contralateral oblique view were made to view the inferior portions of the confluence of the anterior and posterior portions of the SIJ. A 22-gauge, 3.5-inch spinal needle was then advanced toward the inferomedial aspect of the SIJ in question. Once the needle was presumed to be in the intraarticular space via tactile sensation, 0.3–0.5 mL of contrast was injected, and this arthrogram was stored. The C-arm was then rotated to a lateral view to confirm accurate placement within the joint. Finally, the combination of anti-inflammatory steroids and local anesthetics were injected into the joint space, and the needle was removed.

### Image guided sacroiliac joint corticosteroid injections in children: an 18-year single-center retrospective study [^4872b322]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple medications are used to treat patients with JIA, specifically those with ERA, including nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), corticosteroids and biologic agents including anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNFα) inhibitors. There are insufficient comparison studies on the efficacy of different treatment plans for the management of sacroiliitis in the pediatric population. NSAIDs are found to be effective in the short term, for direct symptomatic relief and are particularly effective for enthesitis in children. Continuous use of NSAIDs in adults has been shown to achieve improvement radiologically, and to slow disease progression, however, their efficacy has not been determined in children. An emerging trend is the use of anti-TNFα inhibitors, specifically etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab. They have shown exceptional clinical results and can be used as first line treatment for JIA patients with axial involvement. Precautions with anti-TNFα inhibitors are required given the associated risk of infections, hypersensitivity reactions, psoriasis, demyelination and malignancy.

Another therapeutic option for arthritis in children is intra-articular (IA) corticosteroid injections, providing rapid improvement and with minimal systemic risks in comparison with systemic corticosteroids. Potential risks of IA injections include infection, bleeding, skin atrophy, hypopigmentation, chemical irritation and calcium deposits and focal demineralization. IA injections are often used in conjunction with systemic therapy at presentation or during the course of treatment. Corticosteroid injections (IA and tendon sheath) are performed by many paediatric interventional radiology (IR) practices using image guidance. Image guided SI joint injections have been performed in our center for more than 15 years. In the context of new systemic therapies, the current role of IA injections in the treatment of pediatric patients with sacroiliitis is still to be determined. The aim of this retrospective study was to review the feasibility and efficacy of image guided corticosteroid SI joint injections in children.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: therapeutic approaches for non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis [^264d74d3]. Arthritis Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop treatment recommendations for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis manifesting as non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, or enthesitis.

Methods

The Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) questions were developed and refined by members of the guideline development teams. A systematic review was conducted to compile evidence for the benefits and harms associated with treatments for these conditions. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence. A group consensus process was conducted among the Voting Panel to generate the final recommendations and grade their strength. A Parent and Patient Panel used a similar consensus approach to provide patient/caregiver preferences for key questions.

Results

Thirty-nine recommendations were developed (8 strong and 31 conditional). The quality of supporting evidence was very low or low for 90% of the recommendations. Recommendations are provided for the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, biologics, and intraarticular and oral glucocorticoids. Recommendations for the use of physical and occupational therapy are also provided. Specific recommendations for polyarthritis address general medication use, initial and subsequent treatment, and adjunctive therapies. Good disease control, with therapeutic escalation to achieve low disease activity, was recommended. The sacroiliitis and enthesitis recommendations primarily address initial therapy and adjunctive therapies.

Conclusion

This guideline provides direction for clinicians, caregivers, and patients making treatment decisions. Clinicians, caregivers, and patients should use a shared decision-making process that accounts for patients' values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.

### Interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain: evidence-based practice guidelines [^69204be0]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The lifetime prevalence of spinal pain has been reported as 54% to 80%, with as many as 60% of patients continuing to have chronic pain five years or longer after the initial episode. Spinal pain is associated with significant economic, societal, and health impact. Available evidence documents a wide degree of variance in the definition and the practice of interventional pain management.

Objective

To develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain, with utilization of all types of evidence, applying an evidence-based approach, with broad representation of specialists from academic and clinical practices.

Design

A systematic review of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions applied in managing chronic spinal pain by a policy committee. Design consisted of formulation of essentials of guidelines and a series of potential evidence linkages representing conclusions, and statements about relationships between clinical interventions and outcomes.

Methods

The elements of the guideline preparation process included literature searches, literature synthesis, systematic review, consensus evaluation, open forum presentation, formal endorsement by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP), and blinded peer review. Methodologic quality evaluation criteria utilized included AHRQ criteria, QUADAS criteria, and Cochrane review criteria. The designation of levels of evidence was from Level I (conclusive), Level II (strong), Level III (moderate), Level IV (limited), to Level V (indeterminate).

Results

The accuracy of facet joint nerve blocks was strong in the diagnosis of lumbar and cervical facet joint pain, whereas, it was moderate in the diagnosis of thoracic facet joint pain. The evidence was strong for lumbar discography, whereas, the evidence was limited for cervical and thoracic discography. The evidence was moderate for transforaminal epidural injections or selective nerve root blocks in the preoperative evaluation of patients with negative or inconclusive imaging studies. The evidence was moderate for sacroiliac joint injections in the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain. The evidence for therapeutic lumbar intraarticular facet injections of local anesthetics and steroids was moderate for short-term improvement and limited for long-term improvement, whereas, it was negative for cervical facet joint injections. The evidence for lumbar and cervical medial branch blocks was moderate. The evidence for medial branch neurotomy was moderate to strong for relief of chronic low back and neck pain. The evidence for caudal epidural steroid injections was strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief in managing chronic low back and radicular pain, and limited in managing pain of postlumbar laminectomy syndrome. The evidence for interlaminar epidural steroid injections was strong for short-term relief and limited for long-term relief in managing lumbar radiculopathy, whereas, for cervical radiculopathy the evidence was moderate. The evidence for transforaminal epidural steroid injections was strong for short-term and moderate for long-term improvement in managing lumbar nerve root pain, whereas, it was moderate for cervical nerve root pain and limited for lumbar post laminectomy syndrome and spinal stenosis. The evidence for percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis was strong. For spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis, the evidence was strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief. For sacroiliac intraarticular injections, the evidence was moderate for short-term relief and limited for long-term relief. The evidence for radiofrequency neurotomy for sacroiliac joint pain was indeterminate. The evidence for intradiscal electrothermal therapy was strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief in managing chronic discogenic low back pain, whereas, for nucleoplasty, the evidence was limited. The evidence for spinal cord stimulation in failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome was strong for short-term relief and moderate for long-term relief. The evidence for implantable intrathecal infusion systems was moderate to strong.

Conclusion

These guidelines included the evaluation of evidence for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in managing chronic spinal pain and recommendations for managing spinal pain. However, these guidelines do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations. These guidelines do not represent "a standard of care".

SIJ Injections

SIJ injections can be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes using various imaging techniques including but not limited to CT, fluoroscopy, and ultrasound. Absolute contraindications to injections include local malignancy and infection. Relative contraindications include coagulopathy, pregnancy (depending on the imaging type), systemic infection or osteomyelitis. All procedures should be performed under sterile conditions as a standard of care.

According to Pulisetti et al, the most precise method of confirmatory diagnostic injections of the SIJ is with CT guidance. The most common complications are vasovagal reactions. The majority of SIJ injections are typically performed under fluoroscopic guidance in an ambulatory setting. With the patient prone on the table, the image intensifier is positioned in a contralateral oblique fashion from 10 to 20 degrees to help visualize the joint space. Joint access may be confirmed with the administration of contrast in anteroposterior, oblique and lateral views under fluoroscopy. Once location is confirmed, an injectate of an average of 3–5 cc is administered intra-articular. Both Khuba et al and Chauhan found that the oblique angulation may be unnecessary and that one might enter the lower part of the posterior joint in an anterior-posterior image alone allowing for access to the joint with lower fluoroscopy times.

Complications from SIJ injections can range from noneto increased pain in approximately 15–30% of patients. Transient perineal anesthesia or a temporary sciatica-like syndrome post injection have also been reported. Although rare, complications of septic arthritis can occur in patients with increased risk factors including diabetes mellitus, presence of prosthetic material, localized infections, in the elderly, and patients on immunosuppressive medications.

Under ultrasound, the SIJ is a hypoechoic cleft area between the 2 echogenic lines of the sacrum and iliac bone as described by Hartung. Saunders et al modified Hartung's technique by targeting the synovial portion of the joint with the goal of injecting into and around the dorsal interosseous ligament while avoiding the synovial part of the joint. Commonly, the location of the dorsal interosseous ligament is at the S1/S2 level.

Serious complications of ultrasound guided intra-articular injections like advancement of the needle into the retro-pelvic area are uncommon. Under ultrasound, accuracy of the placement is less likely intraarticular. For most, the duration of procedure time is much greater with ultrasound than other modalities but this is likely related to other variables.

### American Society of Pain and Neuroscience best practice (ASPN) guideline for the treatment of sacroiliac disorders [^b6c7bf25]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical management of sacroiliac disease has proven challenging from both diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives. Although it is widely regarded as a common source of low back pain, little consensus exists on the appropriate clinical management of sacroiliac joint pain and dysfunction. Understanding the biomechanics, innervation, and function of this complex load bearing joint is critical to formulating appropriate treatment algorithms for SI joint disorders. ASPN has developed this comprehensive practice guideline to serve as a foundational reference on the appropriate management of SI joint disorders utilizing the best available evidence and serve as a foundational guide for the treatment of adult patients in the United States and globally.

Management of Conflict of Interest

All authors were required to disclose conflicts of interest prior to assignment of topics. The senior authors determined the extent of the conflict of interest ensuring balanced inquiry and evaluation for each manuscript section. One of the co-primary authors without conflict were identified for each section and was the adjudication determination official for any issues of potential conflict. All authors were asked to recuse themselves on any recommendation potentially affected by a disclosed conflict. Additionally, authors without conflict vetted all recommendations for bias.

Literature Search, Evidence Ranking

The world literature in English was searched using Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, BioMed Central, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, Current Contents Connect, Meeting Abstracts, and Scopus to identify and compile the evidence for sacroiliac joint treatments (per section as listed in the manuscript) for the treatment of pain. Manuscripts from 2000-present were included in the search process. Search words were selected based upon the section represented. Identified peer-reviewed literature was critiqued using the USPSTF criteria for quality of evidence, with modifications for interventional pain studies (Table 1). After USPSTF letter grading was assigned, the working subgroup then assigned the "level of certainty regarding benefit" as described in Table 2.

Table 2
Level of Certainty Regarding Benefit

For each major section or topic, ASPN formulated consensus points. Consensus points should not be confused with recommendations based on consensus alone (Evidence Level II), which were rendered as clinical guidance in the situations where, due to the lack of evidence-based literature (such as randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), prospective observational studies, and retrospective cohort/case series) the best available guidance is expert opinion.

### Sacroiliac joint injections performed with sonographic guidance [^5f73e9d9]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of sonographic guidance for therapeutic intra-articular sacroiliac joint injections in patients with sacroiliitis.

Methods

Thirty-four consecutive patients with sacroiliitis were enrolled in this study. The synovial portions of 60 sacroiliac joints received injections under sonographic guidance. For treatment, a mixture of a corticosteroid and a local anesthetic was injected intra-articularly. Fluoroscopic spot images were obtained to assess the accuracy of the sonographically guided technique.

Results

Of the 60 sonographically guided injections, 46 (76.7%) were successful (i.e., intra-articular), and 14 (23.3%) were missed. The successful intra-articular injection rate was 60% in the first 30 injections, and it gradually improved, reaching 93.5% in the last 30 injections. The mean procedure time was 9 minutes.

Conclusions

Our initial experience suggests that sonographically guided therapeutic injections to sacroiliac joints could be valuable alternatives to other guidance modalities in patients with sacroiliitis. In the hands of experienced radiologists, this technique is safe, rapid, and reproducible.

### A review and survey of policies utilized for interventional pain procedures: a need for consensus [^282475de]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Driver policy

There are no current guidelines for driver policy to help physicians practice evidence-based care. In our survey, a vast majority of physicians agreed on having a driver policy for procedures involving sedation. The response to procedures that were not done under sedation was varied, with as many as 40% physicians not requiring a driver after a procedure without sedation. These policies did not appear to differentiate between procedures that could be associated with hypotension or motor blockade in any meaningful fashion. The only procedure that stood out was trigger point injections, with the minority of respondents requiring a designated driver. While having a designated driver is often inconvenient to the patient and the driver and can be expensive due to lost work or accrued childcare expense, all procedures we surveyed carry risks that could incapacitate a patient. While there is no guideline regarding designated drivers for pain procedures, anesthesia guidelines for monitored anesthesia exist. Policies exist for other procedures involving sedation including colonoscopy. Having a driver policy is of utmost importance as certain pain procedures such as epidural steroid injection with local anesthetic and sacroiliac joint injections in patients with congenital sacral nonunions can cause inadvertent numbness and weakness in the leg, which obviously interferes with the ability to ambulate and drive safely. Sedation puts the patient at risk of driving under the influence, depending on the drugs used, and the time after administration to discharge. The wide variation in protocol, and the attendant risks associated with a lack of clear guidelines, raises concerns of patient safety as well as potential provider liability and medicolegal issues. This lack of consensus on various policies regarding periprocedural care is potentially dangerous and can lead to adverse events. This also reflects the varied perception of risk related to various components of procedural care. Until guidelines specific to the outpatient pain population are available, adherence to the anesthesia guidelines likely offers the safest, most defensible practice.

Recommendation 5 — physical exam maneuvers for diagnosing facet or sacroiliac joint pain or lumbar/lumbo-sacral radiculopathy in low back pain states there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against specific physical exam maneuvers (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). Low quality and inconsistent evidence suggests performing relevant provocative tests may assist diagnosis, but there is high variability in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In a systematic review with diagnostic facet joint block as the reference standard, non-centralization of low back pain had sensitivity (100%) with specificity (11% – 17%); traumatic onset of pain had sensitivity (48% – 54%) and specificity (47% – 50%); and Revel's criteria individually had sensitivity (15% – 100%) and specificity (13% – 86%), whereas combined Revel's criteria had specificity (66% – 91%). A prospective diagnostic cohort used a diagnostic sacroiliac joint injection as a reference standard.

Diagnostic sacroiliac joint blocks — evidence thresholds and recommendation: Evidence for diagnostic intraarticular sacroiliac joint injections is good with 75% to 100% pain relief as the criterion standard with controlled local anesthetic or placebo blocks, and fair due to the limitation of the number of studies with 50% to 74% relief with a dual block; controlled sacroiliac joint blocks with placebo or controlled comparative local anesthetic blocks are recommended when indications are satisfied with suspicion of sacroiliac joint pain.

Lateral Sacral Branch Radiofrequency Neurotomy

Early studies brought attention to the sacroiliac joint as a pain generator through reproduction of symptoms by way of provocative maneuvers and diagnostic/therapeutic injections into the sacroiliac joint (SIJ). Laslett et al found provocative maneuvers to be helpful but lacked sensitivity. There is no evidence to support any provocative SIJ maneuver as pathognomonic for SIJ pain; hence, the use of diagnostic SIJ blocks utilizing local anesthetics with or without steroids has evolved as the current standard. Although, initially, such injections were done blindly, image-guidance has substantially improved the accuracy of this procedure. However, therapeutic intra-articular injections only provide temporary relief for most patients. Recalcitrant cases led to the advent of other treatment options for SIJ dysfunction. RFN emerged as the most viable choice given its known evidence and effectiveness in treating facet-mediated pain.

Histological analysis of the sacroiliac joint has verified the presence of nerve fibers within the joint capsule and adjoining ligaments. The sacroiliac joint is thought to receive its innervation from the ventral rami of L4 and L5, the dorsal rami of L5, S1, S2, and S3, as well as the superior gluteal nerve. There is an additional ventral innervation of the sacroiliac joint that is inaccessible for denervation.

Sacral lateral branch neurotomy addresses the posterior sacroiliac structures, which includes both the posterior joint and ligaments. Therefore, the response to intra-articular sacroiliac joint injections, per se, does not necessarily correlate to radiofrequency success. However, blocking the innervation lateral to the foramen at different depths has been shown to be more effective. However, there are no placebo-controlled trials for lateral sacral nerve blocks to confirm this thought process. This is a treatment gap in appropriately selecting patients for sacral lateral branch neurotomy.

Current Available Evidence of Lateral Sacral Branch Radiofrequency Neurotomy

Two controlled and two pragmatic RFN studies of the lateral sacral branch are described in Table 6 with the remaining lateral sacral branch radiofrequency neurotomy studies being observational.

### Use and safety of corticosteroid injections in joints and musculoskeletal soft tissue: guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^28ab6fe5]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Hip intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injections — statements and recommendations: IACS hip injections are commonly performed for diagnosis in hip osteoarthritis and for short-term (4–12 weeks) pain relief (Level of certainty: high). Potential adverse effects may include accelerated cartilage loss, subchondral insufficiency fractures, osteonecrosis, and rarely rapid joint destruction (Level of certainty: moderate). Pre-injection/screening X-ray of the hip joint may help to verify baseline pathology that would preclude corticosteroid injection (Level of certainty: moderate). Education and exercise used with IACS result in better global improvement than IACS alone at 1 year, with similar pain relief (Level of certainty: low). Safety and accuracy of greater trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections are similar across landmarks, fluoroscopy, or ultrasound (Grade B). Caution should be taken with high-dose and multiple injections; consider using the lowest effective corticosteroid dose for hip IACS while extending the interval between repeat CSI (Grade B). Consider using a 40 mg dose of triamcinolone or a comparable corticosteroid dose for IACS hip injection (Grade B). Pre-injection/screening X-ray should be performed prior to IACS hip injection to verify baseline pathology including osteonecrosis (Grade B). Patient education and physiotherapy exercises should be offered in conjunction with or prior to CSI for greater trochanteric pain syndrome (Grade B). Hip trochanteric bursa injections can be performed using landmark guidance (Grade B).

### Spine epidural and sacroiliac joints injections – when and how to perform [^cf23a29c]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the state-of-the-art of image-guided techniques used to treat painful syndromes of the lower back, their indications, how they should be performed, their related risks and the expected results.

Methods

We describe the actual standards about image-guided infiltrative therapies both on spine and on sacroiliac joints.

Results

Both spinal epidural and sacroiliac injections appear useful in a large percentage of treated patients to get control of the perceived pain. Performing these therapies under CT or fluoroscopic guidance is the best and safest way to obtain satisfactory results because it is possible to target the use of drugs directly to the involved painful structures.

Conclusions

Image-guided injections of the epidural space and of the sacroiliac joints are effective techniques for the treatment of pain; their effectiveness is sometimes not lasting for long periods of time but considering the low associated risk when performed by trained personnel, they can be easily repeated.

Facet and sacroiliac joint interventional procedures — In Medicare populations, comparative analysis from 2000 to 2010 and 2010 to 2019 showed a differential annual use of 14.4 vs. 2.2% for interventional procedures, and there were also significant decreases in the use of facet joint injections and nerve blocks as compared to facet joint neurolytic procedures. Sacroiliac joint utilization from 2019 to 2020 changed heterogeneously: sacroiliac joint intraarticular injections decreased 19.2%, sacroiliac joint arthrodesis increased 23.3%, and sacroiliac joint fusions decreased 5.3%. Longer-term trends show sacroiliac joint intraarticular injections had an overall annual increase of 0.9% per 100,000 Medicare population patients from 2000 to 2019, while sacroiliac joint arthrodesis and fusion increased 29% and 13.3% respectively per 100,000 Medicare population patients from 2010 to 2020.

### Overview of available treatments and their limitations for hypertrophic facet joints – A systematic review of the literature [^5b7bc0c5]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Physicians worldwide face the challenging task of improving patient satisfaction by reducing pain in injured patients. Currently, available therapeutic approaches provide only short-term relief of symptoms without addressing long-term satisfaction. This has led to exploring regenerative treatment options that can deliver better outcomes. One such promising option is platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, which are gaining popularity as an alternative to standard steroid injections.

Objectives:

This study examines the therapeutic effects of PRP injections in adult patients with stress or traumatic injuries.

Methods:

The systematic literature review yielded 60,301 articles, books, and websites verified and removed from the final project. The final studies used in the report comprised randomized trials, observational studies, and case reports on injecting biologics into the epidural space, facet joints, or sacroiliac joints. In total, 15 reviews and 13 studies were included in this review.

Results:

In the Wu et al study, 46 participants were randomly divided into group A (0.5 mL PRP injection) and group B (1.5 mL methylprednisolone injection). Although group B initially showed a notable pain reduction at one week, it diminished over 6 months, with group A consistently improving, reaching an 80.96% success rate and higher patient satisfaction. In the study by Singla et al comparing PRP (group P) and corticosteroid (group S) in 40 participants, PRP demonstrated a markedly greater reduction in VAS Scale at 6 weeks and 3 months, with a 90% effectiveness compared with 75% for steroids.

Conclusion:

PRP injections offer greater pain alleviation, disability reduction, and overall patient satisfaction improvements due to their effect on the immune response to promote the growth and proliferation of damaged tissue. It has also been shown to offer a safer alternative that carries fewer risks than that of transforaminal steroid injections due to promising clinical trials and scientific investigation outcomes. Several of the steroid injection studies proved to have mixed results and efficacy because patients reporting having similar pain relief with placebo groups that used saline injections. Further studies will be needed to evaluate PRP's long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness for practical patient use in the future.

1. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis

The dose for intra-articular administration depends upon the size of the joint and varies with the severity of the condition in the individual patient. In chronic cases, injections may be repeated at intervals ranging from one to five or more weeks, depending upon the degree of relief obtained from the initial injection. The doses in the following table are given as a general guide:

Procedure

It is recommended that the anatomy of the joint involved be reviewed before attempting intra-articular injection. In order to obtain the full anti-inflammatory effect, it is important that the injection be made into the synovial space. Employing the same sterile technique as for a lumbar puncture, a sterile 20 to 24 gauge needle (on a dry syringe) is quickly inserted into the synovial cavity. Procaine infiltration is elective. The aspiration of only a few drops of joint fluid proves the joint space has been entered by the needle. The injection site for each joint is determined by that location where the synovial cavity is most superficial and most free of large vessels and nerves. With the needle in place, the aspirating syringe is removed and replaced by a second syringe containing the desired amount of DEPO-MEDROL. The plunger is then pulled outward slightly to aspirate synovial fluid and to make sure the needle is still in the synovial space. After injection, the joint is moved gently a few times to aid mixing of the synovial fluid and the suspension. The site is covered with a small sterile dressing.

Suitable sites for intra-articular injection are the knee, ankle, wrist, elbow, shoulder, phalangeal, and hip joints. Since difficulty is not infrequently encountered in entering the hip joint, precautions should be taken to avoid any large blood vessels in the area. Joints not suitable for injection are those that are anatomically inaccessible such as the spinal joints and those like the sacroiliac joints that are devoid of synovial space. Treatment failures are most frequently the result of failure to enter the joint space. Little or no benefit follows injection into surrounding tissue. If failures occur when injections into the synovial spaces are certain, as determined by aspiration of fluid, repeated injections are usually futile.

If a local anesthetic is used prior to injection of DEPO-MEDROL, the anesthetic package insert should be read carefully and all the precautions observed.

### Deep gluteal pain in orthopaedics: a challenging diagnosis [^c26b1e7c]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Identifying the specific source of gluteal pain can elude the most seasoned orthopaedic diagnosticians. Patients will often present with a protracted course of symptoms, and failure to successfully identify and treat the underlying etiology leads to frustration for both patient and clinician. Pain deep in the buttocks can arise from compression, inflammation, or injury of one or more of the structures in this anatomically dense area. Although sacroiliitis, hip arthritis, and trochanteric bursitis may also masquerade as gluteal pain, sciatic nerve irritation in its various presentations causes a substantial percentage of cases. Deep gluteal syndrome, hamstring syndrome, and ischiofemoral impingement can have overlapping presentations but can be differentiated by clinical examination and judiciously placed diagnostic corticosteroid injections. Although nonsurgical management, including physical therapy, relative rest, and injections represent the mainstay of treatment, open and endoscopic surgical approaches have yielded encouraging success rates in refractory cases.

Diagnosis & Treatment of Low Back Pain — diagnostic questions: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against obtaining laboratory tests to assess for inflammatory disease in patients with sacroiliac joint pain (Grade of Recommendation: I). For pain diagram findings, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address these questions, and for assessment tools or questionnaires to identify the cause of acute, subacute or chronic low back pain, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question. For whether certain history and physical examination findings would warrant obtaining advanced imaging studies, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question; however, the Work Group Consensus Statement notes that in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group's opinion that, in patients with severe and intractable pain syndromes who have failed medical/interventional treatment, advanced imaging may be indicated, and that subgroups have shown higher or lower incidences of radiographic abnormalities based on acuity, tenderness to palpation and provocation maneuvers, but the utility of these findings in guiding treatment is not clear.

### Best practices for postoperative management of posterior sacroiliac joint fusion [^903d9515]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain is a common cause of low back pain. Traditionally, treatment for SIJ joint pain and dysfunction has consisted of physical therapy, medication management, SIJ injections, and SIJ ablations. Improved recognition of the SIJ as an etiology for back pain has led to advances in treatment options. Radiofrequency of the lateral sacral branches has been shown to be effective, though evidence is fraught with inconsistent patient selection, study design and procedural technique. It also does not directly address the mechanical dysfunction of the SIJ. In order to create a more enduring approach SIJ fusion has become an attractive option to reduce pain and to improve function. This method of SI joint treatment requires guidance in the perioperative phase of care from both the physicians and advanced practice providers (APP). In order to improve care and outcomes of those undergoing posterior SI joint fusion the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience appointed an expert panel of physicians and advanced practice providers to create a best practice for the post operative care of this approach. As with any best practice, the panel considered current peer reviewed literature and clinical expertise to create guidance today. This is intended to be a living document with modifications as additional evidence comes to light in data publication. The goals of this paper are to focus on (1) wound care, (2) medication use, (3) physical activity and (4) therapeutic exercises.

### American Society of Pain and Neuroscience best practice (ASPN) guideline for the treatment of sacroiliac disorders [response to letter] [^a49cef7b]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear editor

On behalf of the authorship of the ASPN Best Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Sacroiliac Disorders, we appreciate the interest in our recently published manuscript. We, however, disagree with Dr. Dall's assertions regarding the ASPN Guideline and his commentary on the referenced Calodney et al paper. The reasons for study withdrawal were clearly detailed in the paper (Table 2, page 1213). It is recognized that the "lost-to-follow-up" rate was relatively elevated; however, this was explained in the manuscript. The study was conducted amid the COVID pandemic, with limitations on patient retention due to mandatory lockdown across all the study sites. Published data illustrate a decrease in non-COVID related study enrollment as high as 59% during the peak of the covid pandemic. This was a likely large contributor to the subjects lost to follow up. The COVID pandemic should have impacted all subjects equally, therefore would not be biased unilaterally toward subjects with positive vs negative outcomes. It would also be expected that if any subject had severe AEs requiring revision, or very negative outcomes, that they would have been more likely to follow up, as the study PIs were each subject's treating physician. The statistical analysis is accurate based on the data available for subjects who continued in the study.

Regarding Dr. Dall's comments on the methodology for developing the ASPN Guideline, we vehemently oppose the suggestion to remove the section on minimally invasive posterior SI fusion with allograft based on the singular loss of follow-up % of one study on an entire category of sacroiliac treatment. Posterior allograft sacroiliac joint treatment has emerged as a common treatment modality for those suffering from sacroiliac dysfunction and appropriate educational resources like the ASPN SI joint guideline were developed to ensure the safe and effective utilization of this treatment category.

On a more global level, the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience has a transparent methodology on guideline development utilizing well validated and published criteria. The current guideline in question included 20 international content experts from multiple disciplines including surgical, interventional, and radiological specialties. All conflicts of interest are disclosed, and conflicted authors must abstain from clinical grading on any clinical recommendation if a conflict exists, which minimizes any bias in the development of ASPN guidelines.

Development Process

The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN), through its mission to increase evidence-based access to treatment, has commissioned a systematic guideline process to outline the current state of the art in treatment of sacroiliac joint disease. Members of the consensus group were selected from among experts across a broad spectrum of specialties interested in the treatment of sacroiliac joint disease within both ASPN and other societies. Specialists from anesthesiology, neurosurgery, pain medicine, physiatry, primary care, and radiology participated in the formulation of these guidelines. The current guidelines will examine the evidence and current treatment options. The consensus work group was convened and at regular intervals, members have evaluated the level of current evidence in the peer-reviewed literature for topics that have been identified as critical for treatment. The purpose and scope of this guideline is to serve as reference for the appropriate treatment of adults with sacroiliac disease for both clinicians and payors.

Work groups convened to conduct literature searches and examine the evidence for the topics developed by lead authors in outline form. After the literature search was completed, each author was asked to provide cited references, and evidence rank. The section leaders then formulated the recommendation grades, based on the evidence, which were reviewed by at least three different, nonconflicted working group members. If conflicts of interest were identified, recusal was required as outlined below. ASPN utilizes the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) format with slight modification for interventional pain treatment. This process has been established in previous ASPN publications. Once literature was reviewed, consensus statements were created and graded based upon the ASPN-USPSTF criteria listed in Table 1. The process by which section leaders then created consensus points included in-person meetings, teleconference, or other electronic or audio-video communications to define the consensus; agreement by at least 80% of the contributing authors was considered a quorum. Consensus strength was defined, as described in previous ASPN guidelines. If a recommendation was proposed with < 50% consensus, based on assigned evidence rank and recommendation grade, then no consensus was achieved.

Table 1
ASPN Criteria for Quality of Evidence

This consensus guideline gives guidance to clinicians concerning sacroiliac treatment and evidence-based practice and outcome optimization. However, these recommendations should not be construed as a standard of care, but instead represent best practices. This guidance is based on several factors and peer-reviewed evidence, and regardless of the strength of evidence, requires interpretation for clinical application.

Surgical Techniques (Open)

Traditionally, SIJ fusions were conducted with the use of an open technique. One of the first techniques for an open SIJ fusion is the lateral open transiliac subgluteal approach initially described by Smith-Petersen et al in 1921. In this procedure, the surgical incision is made in the posterior aspect of the iliac crest to access the lateral aspect of ilium. During the incision, the direction of the incision is from the posterior superior spine toward the direction of the gluteus maximus for 3–4 inches until the junction of the ilium and sacrum is accessed. After the incision has been made, the flap is retracted, and the posterior-lateral surface of the ilium is exposed. Additionally, cartilaginous tissue at the SI junction is removed to allow for access to the joint. After access has been obtained, the joint is fixed with joints and screws and the aforementioned flap is sutured in place. Over the course of years, various other methods and variations of the Smith–Petersen method have been described. For example, another technique by Gaenslen et al describes a posterior approach to avoid excessive gluteal dissection described in the original Smith-Petersen et al procedure. Additionally, in recent years, another procedure by Khurana et al describes the use of demineralized bone matrix in a screw accessing the SIJ. Despite many years of use of the open technique, one of the first procedures to shift towards a minimally invasive approach was described by Wise et al that used a percutaneously inserted fusion cage and initiated the shift towards minimally invasive techniques for SIJ arthrodesis.

Best Practice Statement on Surgical Treatment for SIJ Pain

Minimally invasive surgical treatment can be considered when patients have failed 6 months of conservative treatment and the diagnosis has been confirmed via history, physical exam, and greater than 50% pain relief after a diagnostic, image guided, SIJ injection. Currently, there is no comparative evidence to claim superiority of one minimally invasive technique over another. The recommendation is to choose the safest approach with the greatest chance of clinical success. Approach and implants used should have peer reviewed prospective clinical evidence which demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety.

Radiofrequency Ablation

Prior to performing radiofrequency ablation (RFA), a diagnostic block of the lateral sacral branches (S1-3) and L5 dorsal rami is recommended, even if the patient has previously received intra-articular SIJ injections. Although many older studies have utilized intra-articular SIJ injection as the standard for selecting candidates for lateral branch RFA, this strategy does not account for extra-articular sources of pain such as the posterior sacral ligaments as well as posterior joint complex that are targeted by lateral branch RFA. A cutoff of 50% pain relief or higher from lateral branch diagnostic block may be implemented prior to offering RFA. Furthermore, a multi-site, multi-depth lateral branch block approach is recommended as an important tool that may prognosticate if lateral branch RFA may assist with extra-articular SIJ pain. Contraindications to offering neuroablative modalities for SIJ pain include sacral fracture, malignancy, infection, and coagulation.

Best Practice Statement on Diagnostic Blockade Prior to Neuroablative Procedures of the SIJ

Dual diagnostic blockade of the L5 primary dorsal ramus and sacral lateral branches (S1-3) with 50% improvement in pain and function is the preferred strategy prior to neuroablative procedures of the SIJ.

Historically, a leapfrogging RFA technique (see Figure 2) has been utilized sequentially within the SIJ, but only 36% of patients experienced over 50% pain relief at six months Figure 2. This was attributed to only partial denervation of the SIJ. Currently, the lateral sacral branches (S1-3) and L5 dorsal rami are the preferred targets for RFA to treat SIJ joint, with sustained relief for at least six months reported in over 60% of participants.

### Overview of available treatments and their limitations for hypertrophic facet joints – A systematic review of the literature [^71c7d6c2]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Physicians worldwide face the challenging task of improving patient satisfaction by reducing pain in injured patients. Currently, available therapeutic approaches provide only short-term relief of symptoms without addressing long-term satisfaction. This has led to exploring regenerative treatment options that can deliver better outcomes. One such promising option is platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, which are gaining popularity as an alternative to standard steroid injections.

Objectives

This study examines the therapeutic effects of PRP injections in adult patients with stress or traumatic injuries.

Methods

The systematic literature review yielded 60,301 articles, books, and websites verified and removed from the final project. The final studies used in the report comprised randomized trials, observational studies, and case reports on injecting biologics into the epidural space, facet joints, or sacroiliac joints. In total, 15 reviews and 13 studies were included in this review.

Results

In the Wu et al study, 46 participants were randomly divided into group A (0.5 mL PRP injection) and group B (1.5 mL methylprednisolone injection). Although group B initially showed a notable pain reduction at one week, it diminished over 6 months, with group A consistently improving, reaching an 80.96% success rate and higher patient satisfaction. In the study by Singla et al comparing PRP (group P) and corticosteroid (group S) in 40 participants, PRP demonstrated a markedly greater reduction in VAS Scale at 6 weeks and 3 months, with a 90% effectiveness compared with 75% for steroids.

Conclusion

PRP injections offer greater pain alleviation, disability reduction, and overall patient satisfaction improvements due to their effect on the immune response to promote the growth and proliferation of damaged tissue. It has also been shown to offer a safer alternative that carries fewer risks than that of transforaminal steroid injections due to promising clinical trials and scientific investigation outcomes. Several of the steroid injection studies proved to have mixed results and efficacy because patients reporting having similar pain relief with placebo groups that used saline injections. Further studies will be needed to evaluate PRP's long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness for practical patient use in the future.

### Acute bacterial sacroiliitis in an adult: a case report and review of the literature [^c432f6fd]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Bacterial septic sacroiliitis is an uncommon diagnosis that occurs most frequently in children and young adults. Nonspecific physical examination findings often make it difficult to diagnose the condition, thus delaying appropriate treatment. We review the case of middle-aged woman with sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain after a torsional injury. Radiographic films showed the pelvis and left lower extremity to be normal. Despite anti-inflammatory medications, analgesics, a corticosteroid injection, and physical therapy, her pain persisted. Laboratory data showed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein; otherwise, tests were normal, including negative blood cultures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a left posteroinferior SIJ effusion and computed tomography (CT) showed an effusion and irregularity in the left SIJ. An SIJ biopsy revealed inflammation suggestive of osteomyelitis. After a course of intravenous antibiotics, the symptoms completely resolved, thus supporting our diagnosis of bacterial sacroiliitis. Repeat MRI and CT confirmed the complete resolution of the sacroiliitis.

### Computed tomography findings in patients with sacroiliac pain [^010c1fac]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

This retrospective study evaluated the diagnostic value of computed tomography in patients with sacroiliac pain. Computed tomography scans of the sacroiliac joints of 62 patients with sacroiliac joint pain were reviewed. The criteria to include the patient in the current study were pain relief after a local injection in the sacroiliac joint under computed tomography guidance, a physical examination consistent with a sacroiliac origin of the pain, and negative magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine. A control group consisted of 50 patients of matched age who had computed tomography scans of the pelvis for a reason other than pelvic or back pain. Computed tomography scans showed one or more findings in 57.5% and 31% of the sacroiliac joints in the symptomatic and the control groups, respectively. The computed tomography scans were negative in 37 (42.5%) symptomatic sacroiliac joints with a positive sacroiliac joint injection test. The sensitivity of computed tomography was 57.5% and its specificity was 69%. The finding of the current study suggests limited diagnostic value of computed tomography in sacroiliac joint disease because of its low sensitivity and specificity. With clinical suspicion of a sacroiliac origin of pain, intraarticular injection is currently the only means to confirm that diagnosis.

Systematic review-based prevalence and evidentiary grading — using at least 50% relief as the criterion standard, the estimated prevalence of sacroiliac joint pain ranges between 10% and 62% depending on setting; the majority of analyzed studies suggest a point prevalence of around 25%, with a false-positive rate of uncontrolled blocks of approximately 20%. The review showed good evidence for diagnostic sacroiliac joint pain utilizing controlled comparative local anesthetic blocks, fair evidence for provocative testing, and limited evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of imaging, and no additional studies were found since that review.
