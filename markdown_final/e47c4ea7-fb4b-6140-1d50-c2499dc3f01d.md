## Question

Does ear wax correlate to body odor

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether earwax correlates with body odor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the genetic basis of earwax type and whether it overlaps with axillary odor biology. Then, I should verify the strength of association across populations and studies. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility linking ceruminous and apocrine glands. After that, I need to check for confounders and exceptions. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and note any caveats or limitations in the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the genetic foundation. Earwax type is determined by a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs17822931, in the ABCC11 gene, where AA predicts dry earwax and GA/GG predict wet earwax; this is a classic Mendelian trait with population variation, with the A allele enriched in East Asians and the G allele more common in Europeans and Africans [^e6f17cea] [^c6b798c6].

> Wait, let me verify the link to axillary odor. The same ABCC11 variant that dictates earwax type also governs axillary odor via apocrine sweat secretion of odor precursors; individuals with the AA genotype have markedly reduced or absent typical axillary odorants, whereas those with GA/GG secrete odor precursors that bacteria metabolize into characteristic body odor, establishing a pleiotropic effect of ABCC11 on both earwax and body odor phenotypes [^a8bb1562] [^91d69872].

> I should confirm the strength of association across studies. Large cohort data show that AA homozygotes are substantially overrepresented among people who never or rarely use deodorant, consistent with a nonodorous phenotype, and Japanese cohorts with axillary osmidrosis are overwhelmingly GG/GA rather than AA; smaller genotyping studies likewise associate the G allele with wet earwax and stronger axillary odor, reinforcing a robust genotype–phenotype correlation [^1e5693b5] [^75bc5e7d] [^9a530a09].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check mechanistic plausibility. Ceruminous glands in the ear canal are modified apocrine glands, and ABCC11 is expressed in apocrine sweat glands, providing a biologically coherent pathway whereby the same transporter affects secretions in both the axilla and the external auditory canal, explaining why earwax type and axillary odor co-segregate with ABCC11 genotype [^7d007dfe] [^a8bb1562].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions or confounders. Hygiene, cultural practices, and individual microbiome differences can modulate perceived odor intensity, and a substantial fraction of genetically nonodorous individuals still use deodorant, indicating that behavior and environment can override or mask the genetic signal; moreover, while the association is strong at the population level, it is not a perfect one-to-one predictor in every individual [^1e5693b5] [^a216bf34].

> I should double-check the directionality and clinical implications. Wet earwax (G allele) correlates with higher likelihood of axillary odor, whereas dry earwax (AA) correlates with minimal or absent axillary odor; this is a genetic correlation rather than a direct causal relationship between earwax itself and body odor, so earwax type serves as a visible proxy for the underlying ABCC11 genotype that governs apocrine odorant secretion [^a8bb1562] [^e6f17cea].

> In summary, yes, earwax correlates with body odor because both traits are determined by the same ABCC11 variant; wet earwax tracks with a higher probability of axillary odor, and dry earwax tracks with a low-odor phenotype, though hygiene and culture can modify expression. Clinically, recognizing this link can inform counseling on deodorant needs and expectations, while remembering that genotype is not destiny and individual variation persists [^a8bb1562] [^1e5693b5] [^a216bf34].

---

Earwax type and body odor are **genetically linked** through the ABCC11 gene [^e6f17cea], with wet earwax correlating with stronger axillary odor and dry earwax with little to no odor [^a8bb1562]. This association is **strong in East Asians** (dry earwax, low odor) and less pronounced in Europeans and Africans (wet earwax, higher odor) [^e6f17cea] [^a8bb1562]. The correlation is not absolute; hygiene, diet, and microbiome can modulate odor, and some individuals with wet earwax have minimal odor, while some with dry earwax still use deodorant [^1e5693b5] [^a216bf34]. Clinically, this genetic link can guide expectations for odor management, but it should not be used as a standalone diagnostic tool.

---

## Genetic basis of earwax and body odor

- **ABCC11 gene**: A single SNP (rs17822931) determines earwax type and axillary odor [^e6f17cea]; AA = dry earwax and minimal odor, GA/GG = wet earwax and stronger odor [^a8bb1562].

- **Mechanism**: ABCC11 encodes an apical efflux pump in apocrine glands that secretes odor precursors; the A allele reduces these secretions, lowering odor [^a8bb1562].

- **Population distribution**: The A allele is common in East Asians (~70–95%), rare in Europeans and Africans (~0–3%), explaining ethnic differences in earwax and odor [^e6f17cea] [^f386c497].

---

## Evidence supporting the correlation

Multiple studies show a **strong association** between wet earwax and axillary osmidrosis, especially in East Asian cohorts [^75bc5e7d] [^9a530a09]. Large genetic studies also link ABCC11 to both earwax type and axillary odor, supporting a **shared biological pathway** [^a8bb1562] [^e6f17cea]. Behavioral data show that individuals with the AA genotype (dry earwax) use deodorant less often, consistent with reduced odor [^1e5693b5] [^c7a60527].

---

## Exceptions and modifiers

- **Hygiene and lifestyle**: Frequent washing, shaving, and deodorant use can mask or reduce odor regardless of genotype [^notfound].

- **Diet and microbiome**: Variations in diet and axillary microbiota can influence odor intensity independently of ABCC11 [^a216bf34].

- **Individual variability**: Some wet-earwax individuals have minimal odor, and some dry-earwax individuals still perceive odor and use deodorant [^1e5693b5] [^c7a60527].

---

## Clinical implications

Clinically, the **genetic link** can inform counseling on odor management and set expectations, particularly in patients of East Asian descent [^1e5693b5]. However, earwax type should not be used as a standalone diagnostic tool for body odor, given individual variability and environmental modifiers [^c7a60527].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| Genetic studies | ABCC11 rs17822931 determines earwax type and axillary odor [^e6f17cea] [^a8bb1562] |
| Population studies | Wet earwax strongly associates with axillary osmidrosis, especially in East Asians [^75bc5e7d] [^9a530a09] |
| Behavioral studies | AA genotype (dry earwax) correlates with reduced deodorant use [^1e5693b5] [^c7a60527] |
| Clinical guidelines | Recognize odor as a symptom of cerumen impaction, but do not link earwax type to body odor [^97befd15] |

---

Earwax type and body odor are **genetically correlated** via ABCC11, but the relationship is not absolute; hygiene, diet, and microbiome can modulate odor, and individual variation is common [^a8bb1562] [^a216bf34].

### Dependence of deodorant usage on ABCC11 genotype: scope for personalized genetics in personal hygiene [^1e5693b5]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Earwax type and axillary odor are genetically determined by rs17822931, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the ABCC11 gene. The literature has been concerned with the Mendelian trait of earwax, although axillary odor is also Mendelian. Ethnic diversity in rs17822931 exists, with higher frequency of allele A in east Asians. Influence on deodorant usage has not been investigated. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the rs17822931 effect on deodorant usage in a large (N ∼17,000 individuals) population cohort (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)). We found strong evidence (P = 3.7 × 10⁻²⁰) indicating differential deodorant usage according to the rs17822931 genotype. AA homozygotes were almost 5-fold overrepresented in categories of never using deodorant or using it infrequently. However, 77.8% of white European genotypically nonodorous individuals still used deodorant, and 4.7% genotypically odorous individuals did not. We provide evidence of a behavioral effect associated with rs17822931. This effect has a biological basis that can result in a change in the family's environment if an aerosol deodorant is used. It also indicates potential cost saving to the nonodorous and scope for personalized genetics usage in personal hygiene choices, with consequent reduction of inappropriate chemical exposures for some.

### A functional ABCC11 allele is essential in the biochemical formation of human axillary odor [^a8bb1562]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The characteristic human axillary odor is formed by bacterial action on odor precursors that originate from apocrine sweat glands. Caucasians and Africans possess a strong axillary odor, whereas many Asians have only a faint acidic odor. In this study, we provide evidence that the gene ABCC11 (MRP8), which encodes an apical efflux pump, is crucial for the formation of the characteristic axillary odor and that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 538G → A, which is prominent among Asian people, leads to a nearly complete loss of the typical odor components in axillary sweat. The secretion of amino-acid conjugates of human-specific odorants is abolished in homozygotic carriers of the SNP, and steroidal odorants and their putative precursors are significantly reduced. Moreover, we show that ABCC11 is expressed and localized in apocrine sweat glands. These data point to a key function of ABCC11 in the secretion of odorants and their precursors from apocrine sweat glands. SNP 538G → A, which also determines human earwax type, is present on an extended haplotype, which has reached > 95% frequency in certain populations in recent human evolution. A strong positive selection in mate choice for low-odorant partners with a dysfunctional ABCC11 gene seems a plausible explanation for this striking frequency of a loss-of-function allele.

Clinical practice guideline for cerumen impaction — scope and target population notes that the target patient for this guideline is > 6 months of age with a clinical diagnosis of cerumen impaction. The primary purpose is to help clinicians identify patients with cerumen impaction who may benefit from intervention and to promote evidence-based management, with another purpose to highlight needs and management options in special populations or in patients who have modifying factors; the secondary goal includes creating a guideline suitable for deriving a performance measure on cerumen impaction. This update is needed due to the time since the original publication and to the presence of new evidence, and it is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction and applies to any setting in which cerumen impaction would be identified, monitored, or managed. The guideline does not apply to patients with cerumen impaction associated with the following conditions: dermatologic.

### Dependence of deodorant usage on ABCC11 genotype: scope for personalized genetics in personal hygiene [^0cfb9d71]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The ABCC11 gene encodes the multidrug resistance protein 8 (MRP8). Although historically identified as a drug resistance factor, this protein is involved in transport of many small molecules in normal physiology, in a variety of cellular and biological contexts. There is strong evidence suggesting that genetic variation at ABCC11 has pleiotropic effects. In particular, a functional nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs17822931), also known as 538 G→A or G180R, determines human earwax type and axillary osmidrosis and is associated with apocrine colostrum secretion from the mammary gland. It has also been related to breast cancer risk, although this is more controversial (see, and references therein).

The rs17822931 genotype AA determines dry earwax type, whereas the presence of at least one G allele (GA or GG) determines wet earwax type in a dominant manner. There are marked differences in rs17822931 allele frequencies across ethnic groups. There is a higher frequency of the A allele in east Asians, and therefore higher prevalence of the dry earwax type. In contrast, the wet earwax type is more prevalent in European and African populations because of higher frequencies of the G allele.

There is a close histological and functional relationship between ceruminous and apocrine sweat glands. This relationship is believed to explain the connection between earwax and axillary odor. AA homozygous individuals for rs17822931 display a few of the characteristic axillary odorants. In contrast, a study of Japanese individuals showed that essentially all individuals with axillary osmidrosis were GG or AG for rs17822931. This indicates that the G allele is necessary and sufficient to cause axillary odor, whereas the AA genotype effectively marks nonodorous individuals.

There is strong evidence supporting the fact that the production of odor associated with rs17822931 follows a dimorphic pattern. It is necessary to have a functional allele (rs17822931 G) in order to secrete amino acid conjugates of human-specific odorants that lead to the production of axillary odor.

### Association of HLA-DPB1, NLRP10, OVOL1, and ABCC11 with the axillary microbiome in a Japanese population [^a216bf34]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The distinct diversity of the human skin microbiome depends not only on the body site but also the individual. Host-commensal interactions have been described for the gut microbiome, but little is known about the epidermal microbiome.

Objective

The present study investigated whether genetic variants associated with skin traits affect the axillary microbiome.

Methods

Eight skin trait-related single nucleotide polymorphisms and HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DPB1 were genotyped in 186 Japanese males. From axillary swabs, the intensity of a representative axillary odor, trans (E) isomer of 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid (E3M2H), was quantified with gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, the diversity of the axillary microbiome was evaluated with a 16 s rRNA metagenomic approach, and the association of these characteristics was assessed statistically.

Results

A risk allele for atopic dermatitis of rs878860 in NLRP10 and the allele for wet earwax of rs17822931 in ABCC11 decreased the relative abundance of Corynebacterium. Conversely, these alleles increased the relative abundance of Staphylococcus. Metagenomic analysis revealed that β-diversity showed significant dissimilarity at the weighted Unifrac distance between minor allele carrier and non-carrier groups in HLA-DPB1✱05:01, rs17822931, and rs878860. HLA-DPB1✱04:01, HLA-DPB1✱05:01, and rs17822931 were associated with E3M2H.

Conclusions

We identified novel candidate loci associated with the axillary microbiome and malodor.

### Clinical features of axillary osmidrosis: a retrospective chart review of 723 Japanese patients [^75bc5e7d]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Axillary osmidrosis often disturbs a person's social life, particularly in Asian countries. However, the clinical aspects of this condition have not been well documented in the English-language published work. This study aimed to provide information on the features of axillary osmidrosis, with a particular focus on sex differences. A retrospective review was made of the charts for 723 Japanese patients (492 female, 231 male). The mean age at initial presentation (29.1 years) was nearly the same for males and females. Almost all patients (96.1%) had wet earwax, which was extremely high compared to its frequency in the general Japanese population. An association with hyperhidrosis was seen in 61.8% of these patients. Subjective odor levels in female patients were significantly lower than those in males (P < 0.001). A positive family history was more frequent for females than for males (P < 0.001), and prior treatment history was also more frequent for females than for males (P < 0.015). Most patients (86.6%) had received some treatments in our clinic. There were significantly fewer females who underwent surgical treatments compared to males (P = 0.026), as females preferred less invasive techniques (P < 0.001). Several features, including male/female ratios, and associations of wet earwax and hyperhidrosis, corresponded to previously reported data on axillary osmidrosis. Female patients were more concerned with axillary odor than males, and females had a tendency for polysurgery.

Statement 6 — cerumenolytic agents for cerumen impaction: Clinicians may use cerumenolytic agents (including water or saline solution) in the management of cerumen impaction. Option based on limited randomized trials, with a balance of benefit and harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, with individual treatment arms of randomized trials showing beneficial outcomes and 1 RCT suggesting better outcomes over no treatment. Benefits are safe and effective removal of impacted cerumen, while potential risks, harms, and costs include external otitis, allergic reactions, and otalgia, and costs of agents other than water or saline solution or an office procedure. The benefit–harm assessment is a balance of benefit and harm; the role of patient preferences is a large role for shared decision making; and the policy level is Option. Exceptions include persons with a history of allergic reactions to any component, persons with infection of the ear canal or active dermatitis, and persons with a nonintact tympanic membrane. Topical preparations exist in 3 forms: water based, oil based and nonwater, nonoil based, and water and water-based agents have a cerumenolytic effect by inducing hydration and subsequent fragmentation of corneocytes within the cerumen, whereas oil-based preparations lubricate and soften cerumen without disintegrating cerumen.

### The pharmacogenetics of body odor: as easy as ABCC? [^fc0ad54c]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

ABCC11 genotype affects apocrine secretory cell function and determines individual body odor phenotype. Rodriguez et al. have applied genetic epidemiology using predetermined phenotype data to demonstrate an association between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs17822931) and the human behavior of deodorant application. Individuals with the ABCC11 genotype predicting a nonodorous phenotype report a significantly lower frequency of deodorant use.

### Correlation of axillary osmidrosis to a SNP in the ABCC11 gene determined by the smart amplification process (smartAmp) method [^9a530a09]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Axillary osmidrosis (AO) is caused by apocrine glands secretions that are converted to odouriferous compounds by bacteria. A potential link between AO and wet earwax type has been implicated by phenotype-based analysis. Recently, a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 538G > A (Gly180Arg) in the human adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCC11 gene was found to determine the type of earwax. In this context, we examined a relationship between the degree of AO and the ABCC11 genotype. We have genotyped the SNP 538G > A in a total of 82 Japanese individuals (68 volunteers and 14 AO patients) by both DNA sequencing and the recently developed Smart Amplification Process (SmartAmp). The degree of AO in Japanese subjects was associated with the genotype of the ABCC11 gene as well as wet earwax type. In most AO patients investigated in this study, the G/G and G/A genotypes well correlated with the degree of AO, whereas A/A did not. The specific SmartAmp assays developed for this study provided genotypes within 30 min directly from blood samples. In East Asian countries, AO is rather infrequent. Although the judgement of the degree of AO prevalence is subjective, the SNP 538G > A in ABCC11 is a good genetic biomarker for screening for AO. The SmartAmp method-based genotyping of the ABCC11 gene would provide an accurate and practical tool for guidance of appropriate treatment and psychological management for patients.

### Mapping of the wet / dry earwax locus to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16 [^c6b798c6]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Human earwax is a one-gene trait comprising two phenotypically distinct forms — wet and dry. This trait is attributed to secretory products of the ceruminous apocrine glands, and frequencies of phenotypes vary between ethnic groups. We did linkage analysis of eight Japanese families segregating earwax dimorphism. We assigned the earwax locus within a approximately 7.42-cM region between the loci D16S3093 and D16S3080 on chromosome 16p11.2-16q12.1, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 11.15 (θ = 0.00) at the locus D16S3044. Identification of the earwax locus could contribute to further anthropogenetic studies and physiological and pathological understanding of the apocrine-gland development.

Cerumen impaction — epidemiology and care utilization show substantial burden: Approximately 2% to 6% of the general population in the United Kingdom suffers from cerumen impaction at any given time, and Three percent of primary care patients will consult a clinician for cerumen impaction annually. Applying these rates to the US population suggests a prevalence of cerumen impaction of 12 million individuals, ranging between 6 and 18 million, and One report cites 12 million office visits per year for cerumen removal in the United States. Among Medicare beneficiaries in 2012, there were 1.3 million cerumen disimpactions, and the percentage receiving these services varied by state, ranging from 0.55% to 4.92%.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^c7828631]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — epidemiology and healthcare burden is characterized by high prevalence and service use, with excessive or impacted cerumen present in 1 in 10 children, 1 in 20 adults, and more than one-third of the geriatric and developmentally delayed populations, and accumulation due to failure of the self-cleaning mechanism being one of the most common reasons patients seek ear-related care. In the United States, about 12 million people annually seek medical care for problematic cerumen, resulting in nearly 8 million cerumen removal procedures, with nearly $50 million spent by Medicare in 2012 and cerumen impaction diagnosed in up to 5% of Medicare patients. High-risk groups such as the elderly and developmentally delayed are noted as underdiagnosed and likely undertreated.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^c6dd2586]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of the 2008 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation cerumen impaction clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing cerumen impaction. Cerumen impaction is defined as an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms, prevents assessment of the ear, or both. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the development group; new evidence (3 guidelines, 5 systematic reviews, and 6 randomized controlled trials); enhanced information on patient education and counseling; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; expanded action statement profiles to explicitly state quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, intentional vagueness, and differences of opinion; an enhanced external review process to include public comment and journal peer review; and 3 new key action statements on managing cerumen impaction that focus on primary prevention, contraindicated intervention, and referral and coordination of care. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to help clinicians identify patients with cerumen impaction who may benefit from intervention and to promote evidence-based management. Another purpose of the guideline is to highlight needs and management options in special populations or in patients who have modifying factors. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction, and it applies to any setting in which cerumen impaction would be identified, monitored, or managed. The guideline does not apply to patients with cerumen impaction associated with the following conditions: dermatologic diseases of the ear canal; recurrent otitis externa; keratosis obturans; prior radiation therapy affecting the ear; previous tympanoplasty/myringoplasty, canal wall down mastoidectomy, or other surgery affecting the ear canal. Key Action Statements The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, cerumen impaction, defined as an accumulation of cerumen that is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should explain proper ear hygiene to prevent cerumen impaction when patients have an accumulation of cerumen. (2) Clinicians should diagnose cerumen impaction when an accumulation of cerumen, as seen on otoscopy, is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. (3) Clinicians should assess the patient with cerumen impaction by history and/or physical examination for factors that modify management, such as ≥ 1 of the following: anticoagulant therapy, immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, prior radiation therapy to the head and neck, ear canal stenosis, exostoses, and nonintact tympanic membrane. (4) Clinicians should not routinely treat cerumen in patients who are asymptomatic and whose ears can be adequately examined. (5) Clinicians should identify patients with obstructing cerumen in the ear canal who may not be able to express symptoms (young children and cognitively impaired children and adults), and they should promptly evaluate the need for intervention. (6) Clinicians should perform otoscopy to detect the presence of cerumen in patients with hearing aids during a health care encounter. (7) Clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, the patient with cerumen impaction with an appropriate intervention, which may include ≥ 1 of the following: cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, or manual removal requiring instrumentation. (8) Clinicians should recommend against ear candling for treating or preventing cerumen impaction. (9) Clinicians should assess patients at the conclusion of in-office treatment of cerumen impaction and document the resolution of impaction. If the impaction is not resolved, the clinician should use additional treatment. If full or partial symptoms persist despite resolution of impaction, the clinician should evaluate the patient for alternative diagnoses. (10) Finally, if initial management is unsuccessful, clinicians should refer patients with persistent cerumen impaction to clinicians who have specialized equipment and training to clean and evaluate ear canals and tympanic membranes. The panel offered the following as options: (1) Clinicians may use cerumenolytic agents (including water or saline solution) in the management of cerumen impaction. (2) Clinicians may use irrigation in the management of cerumen impaction. (3) Clinicians may use manual removal requiring instrumentation in the management of cerumen impaction. (4) Last, clinicians may educate/counsel patients with cerumen impaction or excessive cerumen regarding control measures.

### A strong association between human earwax-type and apocrine colostrum secretion from the mammary gland [^2a618905]. Human Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Here we provided the first genetic evidence for an association between the degree of apocrine colostrum secretion and human earwax type. Genotyping at the earwax-type locus, rs17822931 within the ABCC11 gene, revealed that 155 of 225 Japanese women were dry-type and 70 wet-type. Frequency of women without colostrum among dry-type women was significantly higher than that among wet-type women (P < 0.0002), and the measurable colostrum volume in dry-type women was significantly smaller than in wet-type women (P = 0.0341).

Earwax (cerumen impaction) guideline — strength of action terms and implied obligations are defined in three tiers. For a strong recommendation, "A strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms", and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". For a recommendation, "A recommendation means that the benefits exceed the harms", and "Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For an option, "An option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect (grade D) or that well-done studies (grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach vs another", and "Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role".

Aural irrigation for cerumen impaction — practice and adjuncts are described: Aural irrigation is a widely practiced form of cerumen removal and can be performed with a syringe or electronic irrigator, and manual irrigation with a large syringe is the most commonly employed method in general practice with the water close to body temperature to avoid caloric effects; while there are no randomized controlled clinical trials of aural irrigation versus no treatment, there is general consensus that aural irrigation is effective in removing cerumen; systematic reviews indicate pretreatment (15 minutes before irrigation) with an otic drop improves efficacy and that saline and tap water may be as good as specially formulated products; self‑irrigation may be a cost‑effective alternative with comparable outcomes and satisfaction to provider care and, at 2‑year follow‑up, fewer return visits, although the ability of patients to perform weekly irrigation at home has not been demonstrated and jet irrigators should be avoided for home use due to risk of damage to ear structures; one small study reported that following clearance of impaction, weekly aural irrigation with 70% isopropyl alcohol over a 2‑month period resulted in fewer recurrent impactions.

### Genetic influences on human body odor: from genes to the axillae [^91d69872]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Several groups have identified the characteristic axillary odorants and how they arrive on the skin surface, pre-formed, bound to water-soluble odorless precursors in apocrine secretions. In the current issue, Martin et al., (2010) describe the relationship between the production of axillary odorants and variants in the ABCC11 gene. Individuals who are homozygotic for a SNP (538G > A) were found to have significantly less of the characteristic axillary odorants than either individuals who were heterozygotic for this change or those who had the wild-type gene. The 538G > A SNP predominates in Asians who have nearly complete loss of typical body odor. ABCC11 is expressed and localized in apocrine sweat glands. These findings are remarkably similar to the ethnic distribution and expression patterns for apocrine apoD, a previously identified carrier of a characteristic axillary odorant.

Cerumen impaction — patient-specific and anatomic modifying factors and related precautions are detailed as follows: The purpose of this statement is to identify patient-specific and anatomic factors that may alter the management of cerumen impaction to achieve safer outcomes. Medical factors that should influence treatment choice for managing cerumen impaction include coagulopathy, immunocompromised state, and previous head and neck radiation. Coagulopathies may include extrinsic or intrinsic abnormalities to clotting, and history taking should include queries for antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant medications, hepatic or renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hemophilia; these patients should be counseled about increased risk of ear bleeding, and special care should be taken to reduce the likelihood of abrading or bruising the ear canal. Clinicians should elicit histories of conditions that may compromise immune functioning, such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, prior organ transplant, concurrent chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, and immunomodulating drugs; such individuals may be at higher risk for postprocedure otitis externa, especially when irrigation is employed. Irrigation with tap water has been implicated as an etiologic factor in necrotizing (malignant) external otitis, immunocompromised AIDS patients have also been reported to be at risk of necrotizing otitis externa, and the pH of diabetic cerumen is significantly higher than in persons without diabetes. Clinicians who utilize irrigation in this patient population must be especially careful to minimize trauma, consider using ear drops to acidify the ear canal postirrigation, and provide close follow-up. Prior history of head and neck radiation should be elicited; targeted radiation to any site in the head and neck may deliver a radiation dose sufficient to permanently affect the external auditory canals, and radiated external auditory canals undergo histologic changes, including epithelial thinning. The resulting cerumen is drier, more tenacious cerumen/keratin debris that requires delicate debridement, injury to the ear canals may be slow to heal or difficult to heal and could lead to osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the ear canal and temporal bone, and underlying ORN may present as recurrent cerumen impaction, and so specific care must be taken at the time of treatment to determine the health of the external auditory canal after successful disimpaction. The onset of ORN of the temporal bone may range from 1 year to decades posttreatment and appears to be correlated with the radiation dose to the temporal bone itself, with radiation to the parotid gland, nasopharynx, and preauricular skin noted in 2 contemporary case series as the most common radiation targets leading to ORN of the temporal bone. Dermatologic conditions such as eczema, seborrheic dermatosis, and ectodermal dysplasia can complicate management of cerumen and can increase the frequency of cerumen impaction and the risk of otitis externa if present. Narrowing of the ear canal limits visualization, increases the likelihood of trauma, and makes both irrigation and manual instrumentation more difficult. Narrow canals can be found in otherwise normal subjects and in patients with craniofacial disorders, Down syndrome, chronic external otitis, and posttraumatic states, and stenosis may be congenital or acquired, with congenital stenosis involving the lateral portion (cartilaginous) and the medial bony ear canal.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^7d007dfe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — definitions and pathophysiology specify that cerumen is defined as a mixture of secretions (sebum with secretions from modified apocrine sweat glands) and sloughed epithelial cells and is a normal substance in the external auditory canal, forming when glandular secretions from the outer two-thirds of the ear canal mix with exfoliated squamous epithelium and normally migrating out via a self-cleaning mechanism assisted by jaw movement. For this guideline, cerumen impaction is an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms or prevents a needed assessment of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, or audiovestibular system or both; although "impaction" usually implies cerumen is lodged, wedged, or firmly packed, the definition does not require a complete obstruction and implies the cerumen is associated with symptoms or prevents a necessary ear examination. The term is defined pragmatically to designate cerumen that requires management, whereas some patients have nonimpacted, "asymptomatic" cerumen that does not cause symptoms or prevent assessment, and asymptomatic cerumen does not require active management. Anatomically, cerumen is formed in the outer two-thirds (cartilaginous portion) of the ear canal, not the inner third (bony portion) that ends at the eardrum, and impacted cerumen can completely obstruct the ear canal.

### A SNP in the ABCC11 gene is the determinant of human earwax type [^e6f17cea]. Nature Genetics (2006). Medium credibility.

Human earwax consists of wet and dry types. Dry earwax is frequent in East Asians, whereas wet earwax is common in other populations. Here we show that a SNP, 538G → A (rs17822931), in the ABCC11 gene is responsible for determination of earwax type. The AA genotype corresponds to dry earwax, and GA and GG to wet type. A 27-bp deletion in ABCC11 exon 29 was also found in a few individuals of Asian ancestry. A functional assay demonstrated that cells with allele A show a lower excretory activity for cGMP than those with allele G. The allele A frequency shows a north-south and east-west downward geographical gradient; worldwide, it is highest in Chinese and Koreans, and a common dry-type haplotype is retained among various ethnic populations. These suggest that the allele A arose in northeast Asia and thereafter spread through the world. The 538G → A SNP is the first example of DNA polymorphism determining a visible genetic trait.

Earwax primary prevention — frequently asked questions Prevention is best for certain groups and not everyone needs it, with groups who may be helped including the elderly, people with hearing aids, and those with a history of excessive earwax; most people do not need a regular schedule for prevention of earwax accumulation; cotton-tipped swabs often push wax deeper and may worsen an impaction or traumatize the ear canal; and many primary care clinicians can irrigate cerumen, with otolaryngologists able to remove obstructed cerumen.

At-risk populations and examination in cerumen impaction emphasize assessing patients who cannot identify or express symptoms; at-risk groups include elderly adults with concerns of dementia, developmentally delayed or nonverbal patients with behavioral changes, and young children with fevers, parental concerns, or speech delay, and the presence of cerumen in these patients can be considered impacted and removed. Physical examination of the external canal can be performed with a handheld speculum, an otoscope, or a binocular microscope, and cerumen may impair visualization of the tympanic membrane and assessment of the middle ear. In a pediatric cohort ranging in age from 2 to 60 months, cerumen was removed in 89 (29%) of 279 children subsequently diagnosed with acute otitis media, supporting that cerumen can inhibit or prevent diagnosis of middle ear disease.

### Child with early pubic hair / mature body odor [^6f41ffa0]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Additional information for children with early pubic hair/body odor states that a thorough medical history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory assessment are essential to be able to rule out other underlying medical conditions. Most presentations of early pubic hair or body odor will be benign, but there is a higher risk of true pathology with pubic hair and/or body odor development in children of younger ages. DHEA-S (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) levels are often mildly elevated for age. There has been an association of early adrenarche and subsequent development of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in adolescent girls, and obesity may also predispose to early adrenarche.

Cerumen impaction — symptoms and hearing outcomes are described, noting that cerumen impaction has been associated with itching, ear pain, discharge from the ear canal, ear fullness, cough, hearing loss, tinnitus, and cognitive impairment in elderly patients, and that removing impacted cerumen can improve hearing. Screening studies show that cerumen impaction is a frequent reversible cause of hearing loss. In a randomized community-based screening study in Oman, 2.7% of the population had a unilateral hearing impairment; among those with unilateral hearing loss, 54% were deemed to have a "mild" impairment (hearing threshold, 26–40 dB), and half of that group had resolution of hearing loss after clearing cerumen at screening. When examiners found new conductive hearing loss defined by a > 10-dB air-bone gap at ≥ 2 frequencies with complete or near-complete occlusion by cerumen, the conductive hearing deficit resolved after removal. In an uncontrolled series of 125 consecutive patients at an ear-syringing clinic, improvement or resolution of difficulty hearing on the phone, ear pain, or "blocked ears" occurred 62% to 75% of the time after ear irrigation, and forty to fifty percent of those with itchiness or dizziness reported improvement after ear lavage. Hearing acuity does not diminish until the cross-sectional area of the ear canal is reduced by at least 80%. In a random sample of 226 patients aged ≥ 65 years admitted to nonintensive care units, 35% had cerumen impaction blocking visualization of the tympanic membrane of 1 or both ears; after lavage with otoscopic confirmation of clearing, repeat hearing tests showed improved hearing at several frequencies, with no change in control patients who were not impacted.

Ear candling for cerumen removal — ineffectiveness and risks are documented: Ear candling for cerumen removal uses a hollow candle that is burned with one end in the ear canal, with the intent of displacing cerumen. That study failed to demonstrate that ear candles produced negative pressure, and in a limited clinical trial, 1 arm showed no removal of cerumen from the external auditory canal in 4 ears with cerumen impactions, while in another arm 2 of 4 cerumen-free ears were noted to have new deposits after candling. In clinician reports, of 122 respondents, 40 were aware of patient use and 21 had treated ear injuries associated with ear candling; reported complications include ear blockage, ear canal burns, tympanic membrane perforation, conductive hearing loss, otitis externa, and hair fire. Because of risks of serious injuries, the Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning to consumers not to use ear candles.

Supporting text — observation without routine treatment is reasonable when cerumen is not causing symptoms or impeding assessment. The guideline states that such cerumen "can safely be left alone" and that "observation over time can be offered as reasonable management". In a randomized controlled study managed with observation alone, "After 5 days, 5% of patients in the control group demonstrated complete cleaning of the ear canal and 26%, moderate cleansing, when managed with observation alone without any intervention". In another cohort managed without intervention "after a year", developmentally delayed individuals with "50% to 80% of their external canal occluded by cerumen" had follow-up where "44% had no cerumen; 53% still had the same amount but no conductive hearing loss; and only 3% progressed to impaction associated with hearing loss". For diagnostic testing, "cerumen does not appear to interfere significantly with temperature measurement based on infrared ear devices", and in a prospective emergency room study "cerumen impaction was found in 73 of 666 ears examined (11% of ears)" among "333 patients", with "Ear temperature measurement increased only 0.2°C after the cerumen removal" and "This difference had no clinically significant effect on decision making". It also notes that "Most cerumen is asymptomatic and does not impair necessary physical examination" and "It is important that patients understand that cerumen does not always need to be removed".

Table 7 — patient education for cerumen (earwax) outlines Do items such as recognizing that earwax is normal and that earwax not causing symptoms or blocking the ear canal should be left alone; understanding symptoms of cerumen impaction (decreased hearing, fullness, tinnitus, and changes to hearing aid function); seeking medical evaluation for hearing loss, ear fullness, or ear pain when the cause is uncertain because other conditions can masquerade as cerumen impaction; asking a provider about safe home treatments; and seeking medical attention for ear pain, drainage, or bleeding. The Don't items include: overclean your ears; put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear; use ear candles because there is no evidence they remove impacted cerumen and they can cause serious damage; ignore symptoms if home remedies are unsuccessful; irrigate or try cerumen-removing/softening drops after ear surgery or with a perforated eardrum unless cleared by an otolaryngologist; and forget to clean hearing aids as recommended by the manufacturer or hearing health professional.

### 2-nonenal newly found in human body odor tends to increase with aging [^1ec4604e]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Human body odor consists of various kinds of odor components. Here, we have investigated the changes in body odor associated with aging. The body odor of subjects between the ages of 26 and 75 was analyzed by headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 2-Nonenal, an unsaturated aldehyde with an unpleasant greasy and grassy odor, was detected only in older subjects (40 y or older). Furthermore, analysis of skin surface lipids revealed that omega7 unsaturated fatty acids and lipid peroxides also increased with aging and that there were positive correlations between the amount of 2-nonenal in body odor and the amount of omega7 unsaturated fatty acids or lipid peroxides in skin surface lipids. 2-Nonenal was generated only when omega7 unsaturated fatty acids were degraded by degradation tests in which some main components of skin surface lipids were oxidatively decomposed using lipid peroxides as initiator of an oxidative chain reaction. The results indicate that 2-nonenal is generated by the oxidative degradation of omega7 unsaturated fatty acids, and suggest that 2-nonenal may be involved in the age-related change of body odor.

### Distinct information conveyed to the olfactory bulb by feedforward input from the nose and feedback from the cortex [^b27ba6b8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Representational similarity of odors in cortical feedback axons

A widely proposed computational principle for many neural circuits and brain regions is that of pattern separation or pattern decorrelation –. In the olfactory system, this concept is applied in the context of decreasing the similarity of representations of distinct stimuli to allow for easier and more efficient decoding. Odors activate overlapping sets of OSNs, and the similarity of their sensory representation is governed by the ligand-receptor binding properties, which depend partly on the physicochemical features of the ligands. The dispersed, unstructured projections from the OB to the PC will decrease the similarity of stimulus representations, but theoretical analysis predicts that some similarity can be preserved even when projections are random. That is, pairs of odors that are highly similar will have more similar representations in the PC than pairs of dissimilar odors. There is experimental evidence for this prediction, with a recent study reporting a relation between pairwise similarity in OB outputs and PC neurons. However, it remains unclear how much pattern separation can still occur in the cortex, perhaps through experience and learning.

The relatively large number of unique stimuli generated in our study using mixtures afforded a wide range of representational similarities in the OSNs. Remarkably, the pairwise similarities observed in cortical boutons were only slightly related to the similarities in the inputs to the brain (in fact, there was no relation at all for monomolecular odorants). This finding suggests that representations in feedback axons are altered much more than what might be predicted by feedforward random projections from OB to PC. For example, non-random associative connectivity within the PCcould decorrelate signals further, removing any remaining correlations predicted theoretically. In addition, cortical connectivity, either through experience or developmental biases, could build additional correlations absent in the OB representation or selectively attenuate certain correlations. Our findings are also corroborated by recent work in insect brains, in which the similarity of representation in the output from the antennal lobe is not preserved in the mushroom body; instead, the representational similarity in the mushroom body seems to reflect covariances of odorant presence in natural odorant sources. While our data point to overall decorrelation, they do not address whether specific correlations are selectively enriched or constructed in cortical feedback axons.

### Dependence of deodorant usage on ABCC11 genotype: scope for personalized genetics in personal hygiene [^db2f6527]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

In addition, it is possible that a proportion of the self-reported deodorant usage is actually antiperspirant usage, as most people think that both deodorants and antiperspirants are the same thing. However, whereas deodorants reduce body odor and have an antiseptic action against bacteria, antiperspirants reduce the amount of sweat acting on pores. The overall result is the same in both instances (reducing axillary odor), but the fact that both deodorants and antiperspirants have different mechanisms of action suggests that they possibly have different biological/genetic relationships.

However, it is recognized for genetic association studies, in contrast with other epidemiological association studies, that genotype cannot be "caused" by outcomes or other factors (e.g. confounders) and therefore is an independent/orthogonal factor in such analyses. Supplementary Table S6 online shows that the rs17822931 genotype distributed randomly relative to (i.e. not association with) maternal age, maternal education, paternal social class, housing tenure, and hygiene. We do observe a strong association of maternal age, maternal education, housing tenure, and hygiene with deodorant usage, but genotype is independent of these factors. In addition, on the basis of the observed magnitude of effects found, our results are consistent with the relatively larger effect for the rs17822931 genotype compared with the effects observed for all putative confounders, including hygiene.

### Human body odor increases familiarity for faces during encoding-retrieval task [^1c60bf79]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

Other studies (Cann & Ross, 1989; Hackländer & Bermeitinger, 2017; Herz & Cupchik, 1995) have investigated whether affective congruency between the olfactory context and the material to be remembered can enhance memory performance. Even though these studies did not find clear evidence for the affective congruency effect in memory (Herz & Cupchik, 1995), they still raised the question of whether specific odors can be particularly effective contextual cues for the encoding‐retrieval of stimuli. Besides affective congruency, another aspect that can put two stimuli into relation is the semantic category of the transmitted information. Previous studies have provided evidence that the human brain organizes concepts based on semantic categories (Handjaras et al. 2016; Mahon, Anzellotti, Schwarzbach, Zampini, & Caramazza, 2009) across different modalities to integrate them into unified conceptual knowledge (Calvert, Campbell, & Brammer, 2000; Gottfried & Dolan, 2003; Seo & Hummel, 2017). For example, several studies have shown that the information we use for the identification of other people, such as faces and voices, is organized and combined as person‐identity information (see Belin, 2017; Blank, Wieland, & von Kriegstein, 2014 for recent reviews). If this is especially true for faces and voices (Blank et al. 2014), growing evidence suggests that even the odor of human sweat (also called body odors or chemosignals) can be considered an important source for social information. Indeed, humans transfer socially relevant information, such as age, gender, health status, sexual availability, and personal predispositions also via body odors (McClintock et al. 2005; Parma et al. 2017). Moreover, it has been shown that distinct neural pathways are responsible for the processing of body odors (Lundström, Boyle, Zatorre, & Jones‐Gotman, 2008), in line with what was found for the processing of faces (Haxby, Hoffman, & Gobbini, 2000, 2002) and voices (Belin, Fecteau, & Bédard, 2004), respectively. Processing body odors recruits the occipital cortex that becomes active when either visual stimuli or socially relevant stimuli are cross‐modally presented (Haxby et al. 2000). Other brain areas include the angular gyrus, responsive to information related to the human body (Seghier, 2013) and, the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, previously found involved in emotion regulation (Cato et al. 2004; Johns, Inzlicht, & Schmader, 2008) and self‐reflective processes (van der Meer, Costafreda, Aleman, & David, 2010).

### Sparse, decorrelated odor coding in the mushroom body enhances learned odor discrimination [^d696b956]. Nature Neuroscience (2014). Medium credibility.

Sparse coding may be a general strategy of neural systems for augmenting memory capacity. In Drosophila melanogaster, sparse odor coding by the Kenyon cells of the mushroom body is thought to generate a large number of precisely addressable locations for the storage of odor-specific memories. However, it remains untested how sparse coding relates to behavioral performance. Here we demonstrate that sparseness is controlled by a negative feedback circuit between Kenyon cells and the GABAergic anterior paired lateral (APL) neuron. Systematic activation and blockade of each leg of this feedback circuit showed that Kenyon cells activated APL and APL inhibited Kenyon cells. Disrupting the Kenyon cell-APL feedback loop decreased the sparseness of Kenyon cell odor responses, increased inter-odor correlations and prevented flies from learning to discriminate similar, but not dissimilar, odors. These results suggest that feedback inhibition suppresses Kenyon cell activity to maintain sparse, decorrelated odor coding and thus the odor specificity of memories.

### Hypogeusia as the initial presenting symptom of COVID-19 [^05567139]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus, is an enveloped positive sense RNA virusthat first arose in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Officially declared a pandemic on 11 March by the WHO, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has affected over 2.4 million patients globally and resulted in over 169 000 deaths as of 20 April 2020.

Throughout recent weeks, reports of anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19 have flooded the media. Otolaryngologists around the globe have reported a significant number of patients with COVID-19 presenting with olfactory dysfunction, but scientific data have proven that a significant association has been limited. A recent study in Italy using a patient questionnaire found that approximately one-third (20 of 59) of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 reported some degree of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction. Another recently accepted publication also involving olfactory and gustatory questionnaires was conducted at 12 European hospitals. Among the 417 mild-to-moderate European patients with COVID-19 involved in the Lechien et al study, 85.6% and 88.0% reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction, respectively. The majority (65.7%) of patients reported olfactory dysfunction occurring after the appearance of general ears, nose and throat symptoms; however, 11.8% of patients in this study reported olfactory dysfunction appearing before any other symptoms, suggesting anosmia may be important for early COVID-19 detection. They did not assess the prevalence of gustatory dysfunctions appearing as the first symptom, similar to how our patient presented. Additionally, olfactory dysfunction was not significantly associated with rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction, hinting that the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes anosmia may be distinguishable from that of other common URI-causing viruses. However, Lechien et al did find significant associations between olfactory outcomes and several variables, including a significant association between fever and anosmia (p = 0.014). Furthermore, women were proportionally more affected by hyposmia or anosmia compared with men (p < 0.001). While more data are needed to determine if gender is a predisposing factor to the development of anosmia, the predilection for women in this study may be explained by sex dimorphisms in the olfactory bulb itself. A past study involving postmortem brains conducted in Brazil found that women have more neurons in the olfactory bulb. The higher susceptibility of women to develop olfactory and subsequent gustatory dysfunction may also be related to sex differences in inflammatory cytokine production. Future studies exploring gender and additional demographic differences in patients with COVID-19 who experience anosmia are warranted.

### Context-and output layer-dependent long-term ensemble plasticity in a sensory circuit [^919c9a0e]. Neuron (2017). Low credibility.

These changes ensured that the firing of the S+ cortical cell remained low even at very high odor concentrations/ORN activity when S− was presented, while growing monotonically with concentration when S+ was presented. This enabled a perfect readout of the presence of S+ over a wide range of concentrations within the first 500 ms, by setting the appropriate decoding threshold. Even at very low concentrations, activity in the cortical cell rose above this threshold within the second 500-ms interval.

In contrast, under the passive exposure setup, activation of the S+ cortical cell when high concentration of S− is presented rose above the level of activity on presentation of S+ at low concentrations. This is shown on Figure S6 B with a low concentration in the model of 1.75 (where the cortical cell started responding significantly in the active condition) and a high of 14.

For fitting the experimental data, β change reflecting the change in prior was modified so that the increase in the prior for S+ was smaller than for that in S−. This could correspond to an objective where the animal requires more to establish the presence of S+ and engage in the appropriate licking behavior.

Quantification and Statistical Analysis

Data analysis

Image analysis was performed with custom-written scripts in ImageJ and MATLAB (MathWorks). Image frames were corrected for in-focal (XY) plane brain motion using cross-correlation based on rigid body translation, and spatially smoothed by a 3 × 3 median filter. The corrected stacks were inspected for out-of-focal (Z) plane brain motion with the following algorithm: correlation coefficients of fluorescent intensities from all pixels were calculated between a given frame and a reference image (average intensity projection of the most stable stack of the day), z-scored, and the frame was discarded from further analysis if the z-scored correlation coefficient was less than −2. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn over cell bodies, and average fluorescence intensity within each ROI was extracted. We calculated ΔF/F, or the change in fluorescence relative to baseline (4 s prior to odor application) divided by the mean of fluorescence during baseline.

### Measuring the olfactory bulb input-output transformation reveals a contribution to the perception of odorant concentration invariance [^7aa834b8]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We do not know whether the output signals only reflect the action potential spiking activity that is transmitted to the cortex, or whether it reflects a combination of synaptic and spiking activity. Mitral and tufted cell action potentials can be initiated in the cell body or apical dendrites, and propagate throughout the cell. Action potentials evoke substantially larger calcium influxes in both the cell body and dendritic tuft than do subthreshold voltage changes. Furthermore depolarizing synaptic activity is the main driver for action potentials and thus subthreshold signals and action potentials are likely to have a similar concentration dependence. In principle, concern about the origin of the optical signals could be mitigated in the future by using a yet to be developed protein voltage sensor whose range of voltage sensitivity does not include subthreshold potentials.

Comparison of Fig. 5 vs. Fig. 2 indicates that the output maps are more highly correlated at different concentrations of one odorant than are the maps of two different odorants. However, this result is likely dependent on the selected odorant pair. Two odorants that evoke similar activation patterns could be more highly correlated than the same odorant across concentrations.

Our finding that the olfactory bulb participates in generating the perception of concentration invariance of odor identity may not be true of all vertebrates. In the box turtle, Terepene triunguis, the maps of input to the bulb were already somewhat concentration invariant. Additional measurements would be needed to understand the difference between mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila and turtle. These might guide understanding of the mechanistic principles behind generating concentration invariant maps of odor identity.

The use of ketamine/xylazine could influence the bulb's input-output relationship due to its action on NMDA receptors. Odor-evoked responses can be more variable and dynamic in awake vs. anesthetized animals. Future studies are needed to explore the bulb's input-output transformation in unanesthetized preparations.

Our approach to performing input and output measurements in the same glomeruli should be useful in determining whether the bulb participates in other odorant perceptions. Knowing the functions carried out by the olfactory bulb will guide investigations into the function of its complex synaptic network. Furthermore, methods similar to those used here could be used to determine the input-output transformation in other brain regions as well.

### Investigation of unirhinal olfactory identification in antipsychotic-free patients experiencing a first-episode schizophrenia [^8f1d27c0]. Schizophrenia Research (2004). Low credibility.

Although olfactory deficits have been reported in patients with schizophrenia, few studies have examined whether these deficits are lateralized or investigated their possible clinical correlates. In this study, we administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) unirhinally (one nostril at a time) to 15 patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia and 17 healthy comparison subjects. Clinical and olfactory assessments were conducted on the same day in patients while they were antipsychotic drug-free. Patients performed more poorly compared to healthy volunteers in their ability to identify odors across both nostrils, but there were no group differences in right and left nostril impairment. Among patients, greater deficits in grooming and hygiene correlated significantly and more strongly with poorer ability in identifying odors presented to the left compared to the right nostril. Our findings suggest that deficits in grooming and hygiene, including poor body odor, observed in patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia are associated with an impairment in left nostril, and possibly left hemisphere, olfactory processing.

### Dependence of deodorant usage on ABCC11 genotype: scope for personalized genetics in personal hygiene [^c7a60527]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Implications

This indicates the influence of other factors such as sex on the behavior of deodorant usage. In northeast Asia, an estimated 7% of individuals use deodorant, whereas < 1% of individuals are of the GG genotype. If, as in our UK study, 77.8% of AA genotype women used deodorant, then the total usage would be at least 62–74%. This indicates that sociocultural factors also have a major impact on deodorant usage. In this instance, it is likely that deodorant usage is not widely adopted because there is, for much of the east Asia population, no need for it. The opposite is true in European populations.

The finding that 77.8% of nonodorous (AA) individuals use deodorant at least once a week makes rs17822931 a potential target for personal genomics in relation to deodorant usage. These individuals could avoid the chemical exposures, dermatological or other health risks, and cost without social disadvantage. We estimate a total unnecessary expenditure of £9million/year (45 × 10⁴ users spending £20 per year) in this 1% of the UK population.

Considering the proposed odor-related mate choice related to the HLA region, ABCC11 genotype is also a candidate for assortative mating based on its influence on body odor. However, we found no association between maternal rs17822931 genotype and partner's deodorant usage. It is notable that apparently subtle HLA-related genetic traits may influence mate choice, whereas the potent axillary effect of ABCC11 does not. However, social selection at a low rate over many generations or before the advent of deodorants remains plausible and also a possible mechanism for allelic selection in populations. Other overt genetically influenced traits such as hair, skin color, or coat color in animals, as well as height, are certainly subject to selection or assortative mating.

### Evolution of connectivity architecture in the drosophila mushroom body [^f7664f97]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Overall, these results show that differences in connectivity frequencies are species-specific, not sexually dimorphic, and restricted to a fraction of olfactory channels. The channels that differ the most relay information about food odors to the mushroom body, suggesting that the representation ethologically relevant information in the mushroom body might change as species diverged. Most notably, the connectivity frequency measured for a given glomerulus changes in the D. sechellia lineage, being more similar in D. melanogaster and D. simulans than when comparing any of these species to D. sechellia. As D. sechellia is more closely related to D. simulans than to D. melanogaster, this pattern appears not to be a function of phylogenetic relatedness, but instead of ecological relatedness. To better visualize this notion, we generated a hierarchical clustering dendrogram based on the connectivity frequencies measured in the experimental matrices (Fig. 2g). In this dendrogram, each line represents a glomerulus, and the connectivity frequency measured in a given species for that glomerulus is depicted as a color gradation. Glomeruli were linked into clusters based on the similarity of their connectivity frequencies across species. In the tree constructed based on this analysis, D. melanogaster and D. simulans cluster and D. sechellia stands out as an outlier. This observation shows that changes in glomerular representation in the mushroom body are highly correlated with the ecology of a species, not its phylogeny, and, therefore, could have evolved in D. sechellia as this species diverged to exploit noni fruit.

### Beyond the surface: understanding obsessive symptoms and body perceptions, from shape concerns to fear of blushing [^e98ace0f]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent reclassifications have expanded the understanding of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders (OCDs), now incorporated into a broader category known as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Related Disorders (OCRDs). This study sought to assess obsessive-compulsive symptoms and body uneasiness among outpatients seeking treatment for Eating Disorders (ED). Additionally, we aimed to explore associations and potential mediation effects between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and body uneasiness. This investigation extended beyond concerns related solely to body shape and weight, encompassing fears associated with specific body components (such as facial features, abdominal region, and limbs) or functions (including sweating, blushing, emitting noises, and releasing odors).

Methods

Psychometric assessments included the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) and the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT). Statistical analyses involved bivariate correlations, linear regression, and mediation analysis to explore the associations and potential mediation effects between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and different manifestations of body uneasiness.

Results

The sample (N = 210) demonstrated substantial obsessive-compulsive symptoms and notable body discomfort. OCI-R scores positively correlated with various dimensions of body dissatisfaction, including shape, weight, and specific body components or functions. Linear regression revealed significant associations between OCI-R scores and overall body uneasiness (BUT-A) as well as concerns about body components or functions (BUTB). Mediation analysis indicated that BUT-A mediated the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and BUTB.

Conclusion

This study offers new insights into the comprehensive landscape of OCRDs. It specifically emphasizes the association between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and body uneasiness, embracing not only concerns about body shape and weight but also extending to body components and functions.

### Scent recognition of infected status in humans [^a865d732]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is a body of experimental evidence that mice and rats use chemical signals to avoid sexual contact with infected conspecifics. In contrast to animals, body scent of sick humans is employed only in medical diagnostics. A modification of human body odor, due to an infection, has not been studied as a potential signal for choice of a sexual partner. It might, however, be especially important for sexually transmitted infections (STI) because many such infections have no obvious external manifestations.

Aim

In this study, we have investigated odor pleasantness of young men infected with gonorrhea, Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

Methods

We collected armpit sweat and saliva from young men (17–25 years old) belonging to three groups: healthy persons (N = 16), young men infected with gonorrhea, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N = 13), and persons recovered due to specific therapy (N = 5). The sweat samples odor was then assessed by healthy young women (17–20 years old). Concentrations of cortisol, testosterone, immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were measured in saliva by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Main Outcome Measures

Subjective rates of odor pleasantness, association of scent of armpit sweat with odor descriptors, stepwise regression of odor pleasantness and salivary cortisol, testosterone, IgA, and IgG.

Results

The odor from infected individuals was reported as less pleasant in comparison with the odor of healthy and recovered young men. The scent of infected men was more frequently associated by raters with the descriptor "putrid". Odor pleasantness of the male sweat correlated negatively with concentration of the nonspecific salivary IgA and IgG, which was measured as an indicator of current immunoenhancement.

Conclusion

Perhaps, the immune-dependent reduction of the scent pleasantness in the acute phase of STI is part of an evolutionary mechanism ensuring, unconsciously, avoidance of a risky romantic partner.

### Mechanisms of scent-tracking in humans [^831012d3]. Nature Neuroscience (2007). Medium credibility.

Whether mammalian scent-tracking is aided by inter-nostril comparisons is unknown. We assessed this in humans and found that (i) humans can scent-track, (ii) they improve with practice, (iii) the human nostrils sample spatially distinct regions separated by approximately 3.5 cm and, critically, (iv) scent-tracking is aided by inter-nostril comparisons. These findings reveal fundamental mechanisms of scent-tracking and suggest that the poor reputation of human olfaction may reflect, in part, behavioral demands rather than ultimate abilities.

### Association between earwax-determinant genotypes and acquired middle ear cholesteatoma in a Japanese population [^b0db41d7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

A single-nucleotide polymorphism 538G > A in the human ABCC11 gene is a determinant of the earwax morphotype. ABCC11 538GG and GA correspond to wet earwax and 538AA to dry earwax. Despite a putative positive correlation between the frequency of the 538G allele and the prevalence of cholesteatoma, minimal clinical information is currently available. We aimed to evaluate this association between the ABCC11 genotypes and acquired middle ear cholesteatoma.

Study Design

Case-control study.

Setting

Single-center academic hospital.

Methods

We recruited 67 Japanese patients with acquired middle ear cholesteatoma (cholesteatoma group) and 100 Japanese controls with no history of middle ear cholesteatoma. We assessed the ABCC11 genotypes for all participants. Clinical information was collected from the cholesteatoma group. The genotype data of 104 Japanese people from the 1000 Genomes Project who represent the general population were used.

Results

The proportion of participants with ABCC11 538GG or GA was significantly higher in the cholesteatoma group than in the control group or general Japanese population (P < .001). The ABCC11 538G allele frequency was also significantly higher in the cholesteatoma group than in the control group or general Japanese population (P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed a significant association between the ABCC11 genotype and acquired middle ear cholesteatoma (odds ratio, 5.49; 95% CI, 2.61–11.5; P < .001).

Conclusion

Our results suggest that the ABCC11 genotypes could be associated with the development of acquired middle ear cholesteatoma among Japanese people.

### Follow the wax: the natural protection of the ear canal and its biome [^d1c28f95]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The external canal is a unique environment that has an elaborate mechanism for self-cleaning and protection. The fundamental basis of this is the epithelial migration of the desquamating layers of the keratinizing epithelium that lines the entire canal and ear drum. This migratory movement results in a "conveyor belt" effect where the dead skin is moved out of the bony ear canal to the cartilaginous portion, where it is lifted off with the help of glandular skin secretions and the hairs of the canal to form what we call "ear wax". The ear wax has numerous protective properties and is essential to the health of the external ear. The protective properties are due to chemical properties of the wax, in addition to intrinsic chemical secretions by the sebaceous and cerumen apocrine glands. The protection also comes from a diverse population of organisms that exist in the external ear that are usually saprophytic, commensal, and symbiotic, but in some cases, they can become parasitic and pathologic. Detection and quantification of the members of this biome has been difficult, and their overall role in the normal biome of the ear and their transition into pathogens remain an area of active research and investigation.

### Correlations between serotonin impairments and clinical indices in multiple system atrophy [^83a6930e]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Correlations between CSF 5‐HIAA levels and clinical MSA indices

Tables 2 and 3 show the clinical parameters of the 34 MSA patients, and the correlations between CSF 5‐HIAA and clinical indices. There were robust inverse relationships between CSF 5‐HIAA levels and the composite scores for Parts 1 (r s = −0.5363, p = 0.0019), 2 (r = −0.4447, p = 0.0122), and 4 (r s = −0.4409, p = 0.0102) of the UMSARS. Moreover, in Part 3, there were significant correlations between CSF 5‐HIAA levels and changes in systolic (r = −0.3537, p = 0.0401) and diastolic (r = −0.3860, p = 0.0241) blood pressure. There were no significant associations between CSF 5‐HIAA levels and general cognitive function as measured by the Mini‐Mental State Examination, Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination‐Revised, Frontal Assessment Battery, Geriatric Depression Scale‐15, or Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese.

TABLE 3
Correlations between cerebrospinal fluid 5‐HIAA and clinical indices using Spearman rank correlation coefficient.

When analyzing the individual components of UMSARS Parts 1 and 2, there were significant correlations between CSF 5‐HIAA levels and swallowing, dressing, hygiene, walking, and urinary function in Part 1, as well as tremor at rest, action tremor body sway, and gait in Part 2. However, none of the items had an FDR below 0.05; they were all in the range of 0.05–0.1. The path diagram of the possible relationships between serotonin and clinical symptoms shows that there were many significant paths (p < 0.05). Especially, activities of daily living, walking, and body sway had high regression coefficients with serotonin as a latent factor (p < 0.01; Figure 3; Supporting Information).

### Testing odor response stereotypy in the drosophila mushroom body [^f916dc40]. Neuron (2008). Low credibility.

The mushroom body is an insect brain structure required for olfactory learning. Its principal neurons, the Kenyon cells (KCs), form a large cell population. The neuronal populations from which their olfactory input derives (olfactory sensory and projection neurons) can be identified individually by genetic, anatomical, and physiological criteria. We ask whether KCs are similarly identifiable individually, using genetic markers and whole-cell patch-clamp in vivo. We find that across-animal responses are as diverse within the genetically labeled subset as across all KCs in a larger sample. These results combined with those from a simple model, using projection neuron odor responses as inputs, suggest that the precise circuit specification seen at earlier stages of odor processing is likely absent among the mushroom body KCs.

### Context-dependent representations of movement in drosophila dopaminergic reinforcement pathways [^ecddc40c]. Nature Neuroscience (2021). High credibility.

Dopamine plays a central role in motivating and modifying behavior, serving to invigorate current behavioral performance and guide future actions through learning. Here we examine how this single neuromodulator can contribute to such diverse forms of behavioral modulation. By recording from the dopaminergic reinforcement pathways of the Drosophila mushroom body during active odor navigation, we reveal how their ongoing motor-associated activity relates to goal-directed behavior. We found that dopaminergic neurons correlate with different behavioral variables depending on the specific navigational strategy of an animal, such that the activity of these neurons preferentially reflects the actions most relevant to odor pursuit. Furthermore, we show that these motor correlates are translated to ongoing dopamine release, and acutely perturbing dopaminergic signaling alters the strength of odor tracking. Context-dependent representations of movement and reinforcement cues are thus multiplexed within the mushroom body dopaminergic pathways, enabling them to coordinately influence both ongoing and future behavior.

### Japanese map of the earwax gene frequency: a nationwide collaborative study by super science high school consortium [^f386c497]. Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Wet/dry types of earwax are determined by the c.538G > A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ABCC11 gene; GA and GG genotypes give the wet type and AA the dry type. The Japanese population may have a dual structure comprising descendants of mixtures between the ancient 'Jomon' and 'Yayoi' populations. We hypothesized that the dry type was introduced by the Yayoi people to the Jomon population where the wet type was predominant, and as the mixture of the two populations has not yet been complete, the allele-A frequency (f(A)) would even now be higher along a putative Yayoi man's peopling route within Japanese islands. To know the frequency, a nationwide Super Science High School (SSH) Consortium collected 1963 fingernail samples of pupils/students from at least one high school/university in every prefecture. All further procedures, DNA extraction, SNP genotyping and gene frequency estimation, were carried out by trained SSH pupils. Although the allele-A frequency varied among the 47 prefectures, the Gifu/Kyoto and Okinawa prefectures showed the highest and lowest values, respectively. Areas with high frequencies included Northeastern Kyushu, Northern Shikoku and Kinki districts, showing a belt-like zone, whereas those with low frequencies other than Okinawa were the Southwestern Kyushu, Hiroshima prefecture and Tohoku districts. The f(A) value in Kinki district was statistically higher than those in prefectures westward and east-northward from it. The result may provide another line of evidence supporting a possible route of the Yayoi-man's peopling in Japan.

### Impact of reduced acidic earwax pH and earwax-determinant genotypes in acquired middle ear cholesteatoma [^7a7b4aa8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The development of acquired middle ear cholesteatoma is associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism, 538G > A, in the human adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter C11 (ABCC11) gene, which is a determinant of the earwax morphotype, such as wet- and dry-type earwax; however, the mechanism underlying this association is unclear. We focused on the earwax pH and aimed to elucidate the mechanism between ABCC11 genotypes and acquired middle ear cholesteatoma.

Study Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

Single-center, academic hospital.

Methods

We recruited 40 patients with acquired middle ear cholesteatoma who underwent surgery and 115 controls with no history of middle ear cholesteatoma. We assessed the earwax pH and ABCC11 genotypes in all participants. Clinical information was collected from the patients with cholesteatoma.

Results

The earwax pH was significantly less acidic in patients with cholesteatoma and those carrying wet earwax genotypes (ABCC11 538G/G or 538G/A) than in the controls and those carrying the dry earwax genotype (ABCC11 538A/A), respectively. Furthermore, earwax pH was significantly positively correlated with high preoperative cholesteatoma stages in the patients with cholesteatoma.

Conclusion

Our results show that the less acidic earwax pH was significantly related to the development and progression of acquired middle ear cholesteatoma. The less acidic earwax pH may play an important role in the mechanism underlying the association between acquired middle ear cholesteatoma and the ABCC11 gene at site 538.

### Allele frequencies of the ABCC11 gene for earwax phenotypes among ancient populations of hokkaido, Japan [^a8920b15]. Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Human earwax is classified into wet and dry types, which are determined by a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, sub-family C11 (ABCC11) gene locus. To investigate the allele frequencies of the ABCC11 locus within ancient populations on the Northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, amplified product-length polymorphisms were analyzed for 50 specimens of the Okhotsk people and 35 specimens of the Jomon and Epi-Jomon people excavated from various archaeological sites of Hokkaido. Of these specimens, 31 Okhotsk and 19 Jomon/Epi-Jomon samples were genotyped successfully. Frequencies of the wet-type allele in the Jomon/Epi-Jomon people, considered a major ancestor of the Ainu, were higher than those of other Northeastern Asian populations, including the modern Ainu. By contrast, in the Okhotsk people, believed to originate from East Siberia, frequencies of the dry-type allele were relatively higher than those in the Ainu and Jomon/Epi-Jomon people. These results suggest that gene flow from the Northeastern Asian Continent to descendants of the Jomon/Epi-Jomon people of Hokkaido through the Okhotsk people occurred, resulting in the establishment of the Ainu.

### Noise correlations in neural ensemble activity limit the accuracy of hippocampal spatial representations [^9d9b08fc]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

For many decades, the standard view in the fields of spatial memory and spatial navigation research has been that an increase in spatial accuracy could be achieved by increasing the neuronal ensemble size involved in the representation of a given environment, having consequences in current investigations. However, theoretical and experimental work in neocortical areas has shown that, in the presence of noise correlations, the decoding accuracy cannot be unbounded; it must reach a maximum that is independent of the size of the neuronal population participating in the representation. We have experimentally demonstrated that noise correlations limit spatial representation's asymptotic accuracy for large neuronal ensembles in the hippocampal network activity. Our result coincides with several observations in the neocortex –, but we have demonstrated these phenomena in the hippocampus. For this reason, we believe it is of great relevance for the field.

Noise correlations could be the manifestation of information that was not taken into account in our decoders (i.e. slow oscillations, phase-precession, speed, acceleration, heading-direction relative to landmarks, time of day, odors in the room, etc.) (e.g.). It was recently shown that it is possible to decode information related to body movement from the visual cortex; however, this information is mainly perpendicular to the signal direction of the visual stimuli, which, in principle, would not affect decoding accuracy. Stringer et al.have shown thatvisual and body movement representations share only one dimension. Further analysis eliminating noise correlations should be performed on their data to estimate the effect of body movement on visual information for large ensemble sizes. The hippocampus has a different structure and connectivity properties than the visual cortex. Therefore the results of Stringer et al. might not generalize to the hippocampus.

### An objective analysis of sebum, pH and moisture levels of the external ear canal skin [^dbc3dfbd]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine sebum, pH and moisture levels of external ear canal skin, and compare the patients who complain of ear itching and the normal population for these parameters. And evaluate the improvement subjectively in the ones given dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) cream or placebo-water in oil emulsion type cream, and to determine the changes in sebum, pH and moisture levels after the treatment.

Methods

32 females with the complaint of isolated external ear canal itching and 42 healthy women were included in this randomized prospective controlled study. The sebum, pH and moisture levels of ear skin of the patients and the controls were determined from baseline and following treatment. Patients used DSP in their right and the placebo in their left ears for 15 days. Subjective analysis of itching level was measured at baseline, and on 15th and 30th days using visual analog scale (VAS).

Results

There was no statistically significant difference between pretreatment and post-treatment pH and sebum levels of the study group and the control group. However, pretreatment and post-treatment moisture levels of the study group were significantly higher (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The study found an association of increased moisture levels of the external ear canal skin and isolated ear itching.

### Target specific functions of EPL interneurons in olfactory circuits [^e619c8cb]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Analysis of calcium data

Excitatory responses are significantly higher than the 2s baseline activity before odor onset and suppressive responses are significantly lower (p < 0.05, one-tailed t -test). Tuning width: To estimate the tuning width of glomeruli and TC/MC bodies, we sorted responses to all odors after subtracting the baseline and fitted an exponential function. We then used the full width half max of the exponential fit as a measure of the tuning width. Reliability: The reliability of each unit was defined as the % variance explained between the single trial responses and the average across all trials. It is estimated as the true variance, the variance of the average response across trials, divided by the observed variance, the total variance across all responses. If all responses to an odor are highly reliable then the variance across the average will be small, and thus the reliability measure closer to 100%. Regression analysis: We used a linear regression model to predict the responses to the odor mixtures from the responses to the two odors when presented individually. The calcium traces were binned at 200 ms, and a response vector of 12s total (2s pre-odor, 4s during odor presentation and 6s post-odor) was used for each odor. We implemented 2-fold cross-validation method. The explained variance of the model was computed as the average squared correlation coefficient between the predicted response from the single odor presentations, and the actual response to the mixture that were left out. The statistics were done over cells after averaging across odors and we report the median and 90% bootstrap confidence intervals with 5000 resamples unless otherwise stated. Signal correlation analysis: Signal correlations were measured as the Pearson correlation between tuning functions which were estimated as the median across trials of the average activity in the first two seconds after the odor onset.

### Odor identification as a biomarker of preclinical AD in older adults at risk [^0159d0fb]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

We investigated relationships of performance in OI with global cognitive scores, established AD risk factors, and several CSF biomarkers known to predict subsequent dementia. Our main finding was that a decrease in OI was associated with increasing CSF biomarker evidence of AD pathology. This association survived adjustment not only for sex, educational attainment, APOE ε4 carrier status, and potential brain and olfactory health history confounders but also for age or cognitive score. The relationships of OI performance with age and cognitive ability recapitulate earlier findings. In the present sample, however, the relationship of OI with cognitive performance appears to be spurious because it represents the conjoint (confounded) relationship of both variables with the CSF biomarkers. We suggest that the relationship between OI and age (observed in the full dataset) may similarly represent a confounded association of these 2 measures with AD pathology (hence with related impairment in OI). To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous direct demonstration that the association of OI with cognition is driven by a confounded relationship of both variables with AD pathology.

Overall, we observed no correlation of OI with CSF Aβ 1–42 levels alone. Such a relationship was observed, however, among individuals whose CSF Aβ 1–42 levels were in the lowest quartile. This subgroup had a greater proportion of APOE ε4 carriers (48%), which was close to the proportion typically seen in patients with AD. Thus, impairment in OI may in fact reflect cerebral accumulation of Aβ in these sicker participants, consistent with observations with amyloid PET. This notion was reinforced in our work by a statistically significant interaction between APOE ε4 carrier status and CSF Aβ 1–42 levels as predictors of OI performance. The same was not so for global cognition, suggesting that OI may be an earlier indicator of accumulated pathology before symptom onset. Related recent work in transgenic mice expressing human APOE ε4 vs ε3 demonstrated genotype-specific structural differences in midlife. These modifications appear to precede later functional differences and increasing structural abnormality in brain regions related to olfaction.

### Evolution of connectivity architecture in the drosophila mushroom body [^c62e079e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we harness a phylogenetically and ecologically informed approach to pinpoint differences in neuronal connectivity architecture and learning performance between three species of Drosophila. The species differ in the frequency with which inputs from a small set of olfactory channels — mainly those relaying information about food odors — are represented among the overall input to a higher-order processing center, the mushroom body. Notably, most of these differences are found in the specialist species D. sechellia, suggesting they are due to an ecological niche shift, rather than merely a function of phylogenetic distance. Evolutionary differences in sensory representation are caused by morphological alterations of the projection neurons connecting individual glomeruli to the mushroom body, either through changes in the number of projection neurons or through changes in the number of presynaptic boutons per neuron. Our study also suggests that increased connectivity might enhance learning performance in an associative task.

While we have identified clear species-specific connectivity patterns, it is likely that other, more nuanced features of connectivity architecture underlie the evolution of the mushroom body in Drosophila species. A recent electron microscopy-based study of the D. melanogaster mushroom body has revealed a subtle but significant connectivity pattern between a subgroup of projection neurons and the α/β and α'/β' Kenyon cells, but our mapping technique is not sensitive enough to capture this particular feature of connectivity architecture. Likewise, our study has limitations regarding the conclusions that can be drawn about the forces driving the evolution of connectivity architecture in the mushroom body. For instance, it remains unclear whether the neuronal connectivity traits identified are variable across individuals in natural populations, especially those inhabiting different environments. It remains equally unclear whether the anatomical and behavioral changes that we observed confer a fitness advantage and could be adaptive. The fact that we were able to correlate a visible neuronal phenotype with these connectivity changes and correlate connectivity frequencies with learning performance, makes such investigations theoretically possible in the future. Another important limitation of our study is the assumption that olfactory sensory neurons have the same detection capabilities across all species. However, a recent study indicates that the activity patterns evoked by odors in the antennal lobe of the species we investigated, while not identical, are largely conserved.

### Human body odor increases familiarity for faces during encoding-retrieval task [^31b56d03]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Odors can increase memory performance when presented as context during both encoding and retrieval phases. Since information from different sensory modalities is integrated into a unified conceptual knowledge, we hypothesize that the social information from body odors and faces would be integrated during encoding. The integration of such social information would enhance retrieval more so than when the encoding occurs in the context of common odors. To examine this hypothesis and to further explore the underlying neural correlates of this behavior, we have conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which participants performed an encoding‐retrieval memory task for faces during the presentation of common odor, body odor or clean air. At the behavioral level, results show that participants were less biased and faster in recognizing faces when presented in concomitance with the body odor compared to the common odor. At the neural level, the encoding of faces in the body odor condition, compared to common odor and clean air conditions, showed greater activation in areas related to associative memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), odor perception and multisensory integration (orbitofrontal cortex). These results suggest that face and body odor information were integrated and as a result, participants were faster in recognizing previously presented material.
