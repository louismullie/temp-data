## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how TMS compares with medication for obsessive-compulsive disorder, focusing on efficacy, where each fits in the treatment pathway, and how to make decisions in treatment-resistant OCD cases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the established first-line treatments and typical response rates. Then, I should verify high-quality data on TMS efficacy, including dTMS and rTMS protocols and the role of symptom provocation. Next, I will compare outcomes in SSRI-resistant populations, consider mechanisms and practicalities, and finally synthesize a decision framework with safety and patient-centered factors in mind, while double-checking for any inconsistencies in effect-size interpretation or protocol details along the way [^115txCWf] [^11774HFX].

> Let me first confirm the standard of care so I do not jump to conclusions about TMS prematurely. SSRIs and clomipramine remain the pharmacologic first-line for OCD and have robust evidence for acute response, maintenance, and relapse prevention, typically used alongside CBT with exposure and response prevention, and yet approximately 40–60% of patients have inadequate response, which defines the population in whom neuromodulation is often considered [^115txCWf] [^11774HFX].

> I should verify medication strategies after initial SSRI failure to set the correct benchmark. When first-line SSRI trials are ineffective, evidence supports dose escalation, switching to another SSRI or clomipramine, and augmentation with antipsychotics, although a substantial proportion remains symptomatic, underscoring the unmet need that motivates interest in TMS for treatment-resistant OCD and justifying comparison against these augmentation strategies rather than against first-line monotherapy [^115txCWf].

> Next, I will examine the strongest dTMS data because this modality has FDA clearance specific to OCD. In the pivotal multicenter RCT targeting dorsal mPFC/ACC with individualized symptom provocation, dTMS produced a greater mean Y-BOCS reduction than sham (6.0 vs 3.3 points) and higher response rates post-treatment (38.1% vs 11.1%) with a 1‑month response of 45.2% in the active arm, which I should keep in mind as a realistic effect size in practice [^1137cZKu] [^111km4oA].

> Hold on, I should verify whether these results generalize across studies. A 2024 meta-analysis of 4 RCTs in 252 treatment-resistant patients found active dTMS significantly outperformed sham both at end of treatment and 1-month follow-up, with risk ratios for response around 3.7 and 2.6 respectively, and subgroup analysis suggested H-coil protocols were consistently effective without serious adverse events reported, which reassures me about reproducibility and safety in the short term [^115LkrHn].

> Let me consider real-world effectiveness, but I need to be cautious about potential biases. Post-marketing data across 22 clinics reported about 58% response after 29 sessions and first response after approximately 18.5 sessions, with sustained one-month response near 52%, which is encouraging but should be interpreted with care given observational design and lower evidential certainty compared with RCTs [^112EPL3b].

> Now I will examine conventional rTMS, especially low-frequency SMA or pre-SMA targeting, because multiple trials suggest this may be a promising focal approach. In a randomized, sham-controlled trial with individualized connectivity-informed pre-SMA targeting, 45% of patients responded to real rTMS and network-level changes in ideal target connectivity predicted clinical improvement, which supports both efficacy and a plausible network mechanism of benefit [^111A39D2] [^115ddy5z].

> Wait, let me double-check effect size conventions before I misstate them. A high-credibility meta-analysis reported a medium-sized overall benefit for rTMS with Hedge's g around −0.47 versus sham, and I initially thought the sign implied a negative result, but of course in symptom scales a negative standardized mean difference indicates symptom reduction, so this reflects a clinically meaningful effect that persisted in SSRI-resistant subgroups as well, which is directly relevant to treatment-resistant OCD comparisons [^115mSL9x].

> I need to check less established protocols like cTBS or OFC targeting to avoid overgeneralization. Trials of TBS have yielded mixed or inconclusive results in small samples, and an intensive OFC cTBS study found signal in anxiety and global severity but not consistently in OCD-specific outcomes after confounder adjustment, so I should not overstate these approaches until larger confirmatory trials are available [^1161Y8yj] [^111uWu9p].

> Next, I will scrutinize mechanistic plausibility to ensure the targets align with OCD pathophysiology. OCD involves hyperactivity within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits including orbitofrontal cortex, ACC, and striatum, and low-frequency rTMS generally reduces cortical excitability at targeted nodes, with pre-SMA and mPFC/ACC modulation supported by imaging and connectivity analyses as mechanisms linked to symptom improvement, which is coherent with observed clinical benefits in rTMS and dTMS trials [^11774HFX] [^111A39D2] [^115ddy5z].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I recall one review describing "slow 5 Hz" as a common pattern, but I should correct that because standard low-frequency inhibitory rTMS is typically defined as 1 Hz or below, whereas 5–20 Hz is considered excitatory, and this distinction matters when interpreting SMA protocols designed to dampen hyperactive circuits [^112R6G68] [^112Xtj1u].

> I will now examine the role of symptom provocation because FDA-cleared OCD dTMS protocols include it by design. State-dependent effects of TMS suggest pre-stimulation activation can enhance plasticity, and in OCD trials, structured provocation before each session is part of the cleared protocol, with meta-analytic work modeling provocation effects across OCD and nicotine indications; although some analyses support benefit and others find non-significant differences, the pivotal dTMS RCT used provocation and achieved clinically meaningful response, so I should keep provocation as a practical element when using FDA-cleared protocols [^111km4oA] [^112q47Ck] [^113RyjNU].

> Let me think about onset, durability, delivery logistics, and tolerability to align expectations with clinical practice. Medications typically require 4–6 weeks to full effect and need daily adherence with systemic side effects, whereas TMS usually shows first response around weeks 3–4 with daily in-clinic sessions over 4–6 weeks and demonstrates favorable tolerability profiles without serious AEs in controlled trials, which informs shared decision-making about burden versus benefits [^115txCWf] [^112EPL3b] [^1137cZKu].

> Hold on, I should directly compare TMS against medication augmentation in resistant patients, even though head-to-head RCTs are lacking. In SSRI-resistant subgroups, rTMS maintains medium effect sizes versus sham, and dTMS RCTs show response rates around 38–45% at post-treatment to 1 month, which appear comparable to or better than many pharmacologic augmentation strategies while engaging a different mechanism and avoiding systemic adverse effects, but I must emphasize the absence of definitive head-to-head trials when counseling patients [^115mSL9x] [^1137cZKu] [^115LkrHn].

> But wait, what if prior CBT and multiple medication failures predict poor neuromodulation outcomes. Real-world and subgroup analyses suggest dTMS can still be effective even after multiple failed medications and CBT, though individual predictors vary and greater baseline severity may moderate benefit, so careful phenotyping and expectation setting remain important [^113FEgcR] [^116KgfHV].

> I should now formulate a pragmatic decision framework and double-check that it aligns with guidelines and evidence strength. For treatment-naive or minimally treated patients, SSRIs and CBT remain first-line due to robust efficacy, accessibility, and cost considerations, whereas after at least two adequate SSRI trials with or without CBT, it is reasonable to offer TMS as an evidence-based next step, favoring FDA-cleared dTMS protocols or low-frequency SMA-targeted rTMS when available, while accounting for patient preference, comorbidities, clinic access, and insurance coverage [^115txCWf] [^115LkrHn] [^111A39D2].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line and ensure I am not overstating certainty. Medications are the initial standard for OCD with strong evidence bases, yet TMS — especially dTMS to mPFC/ACC with symptom provocation and low-frequency rTMS targeting SMA — demonstrates consistent, medium-magnitude benefits and clinically meaningful response rates in treatment-resistant populations, offering a circuit-directed, well-tolerated alternative that can be integrated into stepped care when pharmacotherapy and CBT have not yielded sufficient improvement [^1137cZKu] [^115LkrHn] [^115mSL9x].

---

TMS is a **non-invasive neuromodulation** option for OCD [^112YEoHX], most appropriate as an adjunct or alternative when first-line SSRIs or clomipramine are ineffective or poorly tolerated [^11774HFX]. dTMS is **FDA-cleared** for OCD [^1137cZKu] and shows moderate efficacy with a favorable safety profile [^115LkrHn], whereas rTMS shows less consistent results [^115mSL9x] and is not FDA-cleared for OCD. Medications remain first-line due to stronger evidence and established long-term use [^11774HFX], but TMS is valuable for treatment-resistant cases [^112EPL3b] or when side effects limit pharmacotherapy [^115txCWf].

---

## Mechanisms of action

### TMS

- **Mechanism**: TMS modulates cortical excitability [^112jKQfe] and neural circuits implicated in OCD, particularly the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loop [^11774HFX].
- **dTMS**: Targets deeper brain regions (e.g. medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex) involved in OCD pathophysiology [^1137cZKu] [^117CMqz6].
- **rTMS**: Typically targets superficial cortical areas (e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area) [^112jKQfe] [^111A39D2].

---

### Medications

SSRIs increase **serotonin levels**, modulating neurotransmission within CSTC circuits, while clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is a potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Antipsychotics modulate dopamine and serotonin receptors and are used as adjuncts in treatment-resistant cases [^11774HFX].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### TMS

- **dTMS efficacy**: FDA-cleared for OCD [^111km4oA]; randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show significant symptom reduction (Y-BOCS) and response rates of 38–45% [^1137cZKu] [^115LkrHn].
- **Real-world dTMS**: Sustained response in ~52% of patients [^112EPL3b], including those who failed multiple medications and CBT [^113FEgcR].
- **rTMS efficacy**: Mixed results; some studies show moderate benefit [^115wGJz2], others no significant difference from sham [^114EBLKh] [^112y9NzZ].

---

### Medications

SSRIs/clomipramine are **first-line treatments** [^115txCWf] with robust evidence; response rates are ~40–60% [^11774HFX]. Antipsychotic augmentation is effective in treatment-resistant cases, increasing response rates by **~20–30%** [^115txCWf] [^11774HFX].

---

## Safety and tolerability

### TMS

Common **side effects** include mild headache, scalp discomfort, and transient anxiety [^1137cZKu]. Serious **adverse events** are rare, with no significant cognitive impairment or systemic side effects reported [^115LkrHn].

---

### Medications

- **SSRIs**: Gastrointestinal disturbances, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, sleep disturbances [^11774HFX].
- **Clomipramine**: Anticholinergic effects, cardiovascular risks, weight gain [^11774HFX].
- **Antipsychotics**: Metabolic syndrome, extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation [^11774HFX].

---

## Patient adherence and satisfaction

TMS **adherence** is generally high due to minimal side effects and its non-invasive nature [^112EPL3b], whereas **medication adherence** is often limited by side effects and delayed onset of action [^11774HFX].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

TMS has **higher upfront costs** but may be **cost-effective over the long term** due to sustained symptom improvement and reduced healthcare utilization, whereas **medications** have lower initial costs but may incur long-term expenses due to side effects and relapse.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

First-line treatment is **SSRIs or clomipramine combined with CBT** [^11774HFX]. TMS, particularly dTMS, is recommended as a **second-line option** for treatment-resistant OCD or when medications are poorly tolerated, and can also be combined with medications to enhance efficacy.

---

## Patient characteristics influencing treatment choice

Treatment selection is shaped by severity; **treatment-resistant OCD** may benefit from TMS [^1137cZKu]. Comorbidities, contraindications, and side-effect profiles may favor TMS over medications, and patient preferences and tolerance for side effects further guide the choice [^11774HFX].

---

## Long-term outcomes and relapse rates

TMS shows **sustained symptom improvement** in real-world studies, but long-term data are limited [^112EPL3b]. Medications are effective long-term, but **relapse is common upon discontinuation** [^11774HFX].

---

## Practical considerations

TMS requires **specialized equipment, trained personnel, and regular clinic visits** [^112YEoHX], whereas **medications** are widely available, though adherence and side effects remain concerns [^11774HFX].

---

## Summary of comparative analysis

| **Factor** | **TMS** | **Medications** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Neuromodulation of CSTC circuits | Serotonin modulation |
| Efficacy | Moderate (dTMS FDA-cleared) | High (SSRIs, clomipramine) |
| Safety | Minimal side effects | Systemic side effects |
| Adherence | High | Variable |
| Cost-effectiveness | Potentially cost-effective long-term | Lower initial cost |
| Guidelines | Second-line or adjunctive | First-line |
| Long-term outcomes | Sustained improvement (limited data) | Effective but relapse common |

---

TMS is a **valuable alternative** or adjunctive treatment for OCD [^1137cZKu], especially in treatment-resistant cases or when medications are poorly tolerated. Medications remain first-line due to robust evidence, but TMS offers a favorable safety profile and can provide sustained symptom improvement [^11774HFX] [^112EPL3b].

### Real-world efficacy of deep TMS for obsessive-compulsive disorder: Post-marketing data collected from twenty-two clinical sites [^112EPL3b]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) with the H7-coil was FDA cleared for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in August 2018 based on multicenter sham-controlled studies. This study examines the efficacy of dTMS for OCD in real-world practices.

- **Methods**: All dTMS clinics were asked to supply data on treatment details and outcome measures. The primary outcome measure was response, defined by at least a 30% reduction in the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score from baseline to endpoint. Secondary outcome measures included first response, defined as the first time the YBOCS score met response criteria, and at least one-month sustained response. Analyses included the response rate at the endpoint (after 29 dTMS sessions), and the number of sessions and days required to reach first response and sustained response.

- **Results**: Twenty-two clinical sites with H7-coils provided data on treatment and outcome (YBOCS) measures from a total of 219 patients. One hundred sixty-seven patients who had at least one post-baseline YBOCS measure were included in the main analyses. Overall first and sustained response rates were 72.6% and 52.4%, respectively. The response rate was 57.9% in patients who had YBOCS scores after 29 dTMS sessions. First response was achieved on average after 18.5 sessions (SD = 9.4) or 31.6 days (SD = 25.2). Onset of sustained one-month response was achieved on average after 20 sessions (SD = 9.8) or 32.1 days (SD = 20.5). Average YBOCS scores demonstrated continuous reduction with increasing numbers of dTMS sessions.

### Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): Practical strategies for pharmacological and somatic treatment in adults [^115txCWf]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

This narrative review gathers a range of international experts to critically appraise the existing trial-based evidence relating to the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults. We discuss the diagnostic evaluation and clinical characteristics followed by treatment options suitable for the clinician working from primary through to specialist psychiatric care. Robust data supports the effectiveness of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine in the short-term and the longer-term treatment and for relapse prevention. Owing to better tolerability, SSRIs are acknowledged as the first-line pharmacological treatment of choice. For those patients for whom first-line treatments have been ineffective, evidence supports the use of adjunctive antipsychotic medication, and some evidence supports the use of high-dose SSRIs. Novel compounds are also the subject of active investigation. Neurosurgical treatments, including ablative lesion neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation, are reserved for severely symptomatic individuals who have not experienced a sustained response to both pharmacological and cognitive behavior therapies.

### Efficacy and safety of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder: A prospective multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1137cZKu]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling condition that often responds unsatisfactorily to pharmacological and psychological treatments. Converging evidence suggests a dysfunction of the cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit in OCD, and a previous feasibility study indicated beneficial effects of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) targeting the medial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. The authors examined the therapeutic effect of dTMS in a multicenter double-blind sham-controlled study.

- **Methods**: At 11 centers, 99 OCD patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either high-frequency (20 Hz) or sham dTMS and received daily treatments following individualized symptom provocation for 6 weeks. Clinical response to treatment was determined using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), and the primary efficacy endpoint was the change in score from baseline to posttreatment assessment. Additional measures were response rates (defined as a reduction of ≥ 30% in YBOCS score) at the posttreatment assessment and after another month of follow-up.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine percent of the active treatment group and 96% of the sham treatment group completed the study. The reduction in YBOCS score among patients who received active dTMS treatment was significantly greater than among patients who received sham treatment, with reductions of 6.0 points and 3.3 points, respectively. The response rates were 38.1% and 11.1%, respectively. At the 1-month follow-up, the response rates were 45.2% in the active treatment group.

RCTs of TMS for OCD

For OCD studies, the baseline mean (SD) Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score was 25.8 (4.3) [eTable 2 in Supplement 1]. The most common TMS target was the supplementary motor area (SMA) or pre-SMA, present in 18 of 44 studies (40.1%), and the most commonly used TMS protocol was 1 Hz, utilized in 23 of 44 studies (52.3%). Several studies compared multiple TMS targets and protocols [Figure 3 and eTables 2 and 3 in Supplement 1].

- **Systematic Review Results for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Nicotine Studies (N = 71)**: Displayed here are study characteristics such as the use of provocation, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coil, and stimulation protocol for studies of OCD (n = 44) and nicotine dependence (n = 27) included in the systematic review. The "other" category for the TMS protocol includes one study with 6 Hz then 1 Hz and one study with alpha TMS (8 to 12 Hz).

RCTs of TMS for Nicotine Dependence

For nicotine dependence studies, the baseline mean (SD) of cigarettes smoked per day was 19.9 (5.8) and the mean (SD) Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score, where available, was 5.4 (1.3) [eTable 2 in Supplement 1]. The most common TMS target was the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, either unilateral or bilateral, found in 18 of 27 studies (66.7%), and the most commonly used TMS protocol was 10 Hz, utilized in 17 of 27 studies (63.0%). Several studies compared multiple TMS targets and protocols [Figure 3; eTables 2 and 4 in the Supplement].

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RyjNU]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

- **Forest plot of meta-analysis results for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and nicotine studies**: Shown here are standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all studies included in the meta-analysis (N = 63). The overall estimated effect size indicates a reduction in symptoms, with more negative values indicating more effective treatment (pooled estimate shown with 95% CI). The effect size for each study is a weighted average of the effect sizes within each study, assuming a compound symmetric correlation structure (eMethods in Supplement 1). The size of points indicates their relative weight in the meta-analysis model.

- **Meta-analysis model estimates and multivariate model contrasts**: The abbreviation OCD stands for obsessive-compulsive disorder. The overall estimated benefit of symptom provocation compared with no provocation was not statistically significant (model 2 provocation, SMD [SE] = −0.23 [0.21]; 95% CI, −0.68 to 0.21; p = 0.28) [Table]. There was not a significant difference in the effect size of TMS versus sham between diagnostic groups OCD and nicotine (model 3 group, SMD [SE] = 0.14 [0.13]; 95% CI, −0.12 to 0.40; p = 0.29) [Table], suggesting that TMS was similarly effective between the two diagnostic groups.

Model 4 included terms for diagnostic group, symptom provocation, and their interaction and did not show a significant interaction (model 4) [Table]. Within this model, we compared the treatment (active vs. sham) for each combination of diagnostic group and provocation setting. A significant treatment difference was found in nicotine studies with provocation.

### Is TBS an effective add-on therapy in treatment-resistant OCD? - A randomized controlled trial [^1161Y8yj]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). High credibility.

The exploration of theta burst stimulation (TBS) in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment is still in its nascent stages, and these initial findings underscore the need for further research to optimize stimulation parameters and identify patient subgroups that may benefit the most from this intervention. This paper aims to contribute to this growing body of literature by presenting original randomized controlled trial research on the efficacy of intermittent and continuous TBS as add-on interventions in treatment-resistant OCD.

The study was conducted between December 2019 and December 2022 in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled design. Participants with severe OCD (n = 27) were randomly allocated into active stimulation (iTBS and cTBS, n = 14) and sham stimulation (n = 13) groups and observed for a follow-up period of 3 months. Depressive symptoms and general functioning were also monitored.

Despite growing scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and TBS in treating OCD, our study yielded inconclusive results. The heterogeneity of symptom presentations in our study group complicates the assessment of treatment efficacy. While significant improvements were observed across several measures over time, many effects were independent of the specific intervention group. Subgroup analysis and follow-up results suggest that TMS, particularly cTBS, may offer some benefit in managing OCD symptoms, although larger sample sizes and more focused studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Ruminative disorders, SUD, and PTSD being targeted with neuromodulation

DBS and TMS have both shown variable efficacy or been considered for treating OCD, anorexia, SUD, depression, and PTSD. DBS, which stereotactically targets focal nuclei, and TMS, which focally targets broader brain regions, contrast with the global approach of ingesting a 5-HT 2A-R agonist to more broadly alter neural networks. As psilocybin-assisted therapy has shown early efficacy for depression and addiction and is in Phase 2 trials for OCD and anorexia, the relative roles of PAT versus DBS and/or TMS warrant investigation.

Such studies might show one approach outperforms another for certain subgroups in terms of efficacy, safety, and cost. Alternatively, PAT combined with neuromodulation may prove to be synergistic.

### Pre-supplementary motor network connectivity and clinical outcome of magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^115ddy5z]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). High credibility.

Many randomized and sham-controlled trials have investigated the clinical efficacy of rTMS in OCD. However, most were small sample studies with varied parameters regarding the stimulation target (e.g. dorsal prefrontal cortex and supplementary motor area [SMA]), frequency (e.g. 1 and 10 Hz), duration (1–6 weeks), and number of total pulses (7,500–60,000). A meta-analysis indicated that low-frequency rTMS over the SMA may offer the greatest effectiveness in OCD.

The anterior part of the SMA (preSMA) is a crucial node of the response inhibition network. Its connection with the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is important for suppressing responses that are no longer required or are inappropriate. A double-blind multicenter study indicated that DBS on the STN could significantly reduce the symptoms of OCD. From a network perspective, it has been suggested that the effective target for rTMS could be identified through resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the DBS site. In clinical applications, this personalized target may improve treatment efficacy, similar to findings from major depression treatment.

Using a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled design, we initially tested the clinical efficacy of an rTMS protocol with personalized targets. Then, resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data were utilized to elucidate the underlying neural mechanism. We predicted that the target network plays an important role.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of psychiatric disorders [^117EpUe8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an emerging novel treatment modality for psychiatric disorders, particularly major depression. A device for the delivery of TMS was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. TMS is being studied for a variety of psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. In this article, we describe TMS and its neurobiologic basis, as well as the efficacy and safety data of TMS with regard to a range of psychiatric disorders.

### Pre-supplementary motor network connectivity and clinical outcome of magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111A39D2]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). High credibility.

This study investigated the neural mechanism of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients in the context of a randomized clinical trial. There were four main findings. First, the alleviation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms was greater in the real group than in the sham group, with 45% of patients in the real group being responsive to the treatment. Second, the spatial similarity of each patient's target network to the ideal connectivity pattern was predictive of symptom improvement. Third, the whole-brain connectivity strength of the ideal Target Network (iTN) significantly decreased after real treatment. The greater the functional connectivity changes in the precuneus (PCC) and supramarginal gyrus (SMG), the better the improvement in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) scores. Finally, this network mechanism of rTMS was further validated in three independent datasets, suggesting its generalizability to other long-term rTMS protocols.

The potential of rTMS in alleviating OCD symptoms has been investigated by many randomized clinical trials. However, findings on clinical efficacy were inconsistent, possibly due to differences in the rTMS setting. A meta-analysis showed that low-frequency rTMS applied over the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) may offer the greatest effectiveness in alleviating symptoms associated with OCD. Consistent with this prediction, we found that 1-Hz rTMS over the pre-SMA significantly decreased the symptoms of OCD patients. Particularly, the personalized target defined by the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) connectivity map may have positively contributed to symptom improvement.

### Functional connectivity changes and symptoms improvement after personalized, double-daily dosing, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder: A pilot study [^117QDBkC]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). High credibility.

Intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors that characterize obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are associated with aberrant resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) patterns within the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits. A high percentage of OCD patients do not respond to conventional pharmacological treatments or psychotherapy. In these patients, inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the supplementary motor area (SMA) has resulted in a significant clinical benefit.

- **Methods**: In the study, we applied a novel protocol of 1-week MRI-guided individualized double-daily sessions of rTMS treatment (1-Hz; 110% of resting motor threshold/7200 pulses/day) to the bilateral SMA in 9 OCD patients. We tested its feasibility-safety, clinical efficacy, and rsFC-related changes.

- **Results**: Patients reported no side effects during and after rTMS. Personalized rTMS treatment led to a significant improvement of OCD symptoms (average 25%; p = .005) and the persistence of benefit up to a 3-month follow-up. rsFC analysis revealed a significant reduction of connectivity patterns between bilateral SMA and subcortical regions, specifically in the basal ganglia and thalamus. Additional analysis showed that OCD symptoms severity correlates with a higher connectivity pattern between bilateral SMA and subcortical regions.

- **Conclusions**: rTMS double-daily sessions are safe, feasible, and effective in OCD. The clinical outcomes, consistent with those found in our previous RCT, are linked to decreased connectivity between SMA and subcortical regions.

### Brain stimulation treatment for bipolar disorder [^112R6G68]. Bipolar Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) alters neural activity in relatively focal brain regions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves delivering repeated pulses for prolonged neuromodulation. Treatment varies in pulse frequency (low or high) and intensity relative to the motor threshold and can be targeted unilaterally or bilaterally. High-frequency rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is the most common protocol. More recent approaches include accelerated rTMS, priming TMS, deep TMS (dTMS), synchronized TMS, and theta burst stimulation.

Standard rTMS protocols involve identical stimuli spaced by an identical inter-stimulus interval. Effects depend on stimulation frequency: low-frequency rTMS (LF rTMS ≤ 1 Hz) depresses cortical excitability, whereas high-frequency rTMS (HF rTMS > 5 Hz) increases cortical excitability. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) involves bursts of high-frequency stimulation (3 pulses at 50 Hz) repeated with an inter-stimulus interval of 200 ms (5 Hz). In an intermittent TBS (iTBS) protocol, bursts are delivered for 2 seconds, then repeated every 10 seconds (2 seconds of TBS followed by a pause of 8 seconds). In a continuous TBS protocol (cTBS), bursts are repeated for 40 seconds without any pause. Adapted from Klomjai et al. (2015).

### Sleep disturbances in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Association with non-response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) [^116EuQcT]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising augmentation strategy for treatment-refractory OCD. However, a substantial group still fails to respond. Sleep disorders, such as circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD), are highly prevalent in OCD and might mediate treatment response. The aims of the study were to compare sleep disturbances between OCD patients and healthy subjects, as well as between rTMS responders and non-responders. Most importantly, the study sought to determine sleep-related predictors of rTMS non-response.

Methods included 22 OCD patients receiving at least 10 sessions of rTMS combined with psychotherapy. Sleep disturbances were measured using questionnaires and actigraphy. Sleep in patients was compared to that of healthy subjects. Treatment response was defined as a greater than 35% reduction on the YBOCS. Treatment response prediction models were based on measures of CRSD and insomnia.

Results indicated that sleep disturbances were more prevalent in OCD patients than in healthy subjects. The OCD group consisted of 12 responders and 10 non-responders. The CRSD model could accurately predict non-response with 83% sensitivity and 63% specificity, whereas the insomnia model could not.

In conclusion, CRSD is more prevalent in OCD patients than in healthy subjects, specifically in rTMS non-responders. Therefore, CRSD may serve as a biomarker for different subtypes of OCD corresponding with response to specific treatment approaches.

### A pilot study of magnetic seizure therapy for treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111XMWhy]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Low credibility.

There is growing interest in the potential of neuromodulation options in treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a new treatment intervention in which generalized seizures are induced with transcranial magnetic stimulation. We conducted a pilot study to assess the efficacy and cognitive effects of MST in patients with treatment-resistant OCD.

- **Methods**: In an open-label pilot study, participants with treatment-resistant OCD with baseline Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores of ≥ 16 were treated with up to 24 acute treatments. The primary clinical outcomes were clinical response (Y-BOCS score reduction ≥ 30%) and remission (final Y-BOCS score ≤ 8). A neurocognitive battery, the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptoms-Self Report (QIDS-SR), the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) were also completed as secondary measures.

- **Results**: Ten participants with OCD who had not responded to medications or psychotherapy enrolled in the study, and seven completed an adequate trial (defined as ≥ 8 treatments). MST was associated with minimal cognitive effects except for some decrease in autobiographical memory and no serious adverse effects. Only one participant met the predefined criteria for response, and none for remission. The baseline and endpoint Y-BOCS scores were not statistically different.

- **Conclusion**: Overall, MST was not beneficial in a small group of patients with treatment-resistant OCD. At this time, other avenues should be considered for treatment.

### Pre-supplementary motor network connectivity and clinical outcome of magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^113fshJD]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

Some limitations of this study should be mentioned. First, this was a single-center study with a small sample size. Besides the network mechanism, which was validated using three independent datasets, the clinical efficacy of the treatment protocol needs to be further validated using a multisite dataset.

Second, although the iTN showed significantly predictive value for symptom outcome, an independent dataset is still necessary to demonstrate its generalization in clinical application. Third, this study aimed to investigate the mechanism of rTMS treatment on OCD, rather than to compare clinical efficacy between FC-based and traditional rTMS protocols. Thus, we did not include a control group that received real rTMS without FC-based target definition, and our clinical findings cannot demonstrate whether the FC-based rTMS is better than traditional rTMS in clinical efficacy.

Fourth, all the rTMS protocols in the validation analysis were inhibitory sequences that could decrease the excitability of the target. Whether the mechanism can be generalized to an excitatory sequence (i.e. 10 or 20 Hz) needs further investigation. Finally, OCD patients with comorbidities were excluded from this study because we aimed to explore the rTMS effect on OCD symptoms rather than other psychiatric symptoms or their interactions. This is also an effective approach to exclude confounding factors in small sample studies. Future studies are necessary to determine whether our findings can be generalized to OCD patients with comorbidities.

### Electroconvulsive therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review [^1173Ch9Y]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Surgical therapies for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), such as deep brain stimulation or psychosurgery, remain unattainable for many patients. Despite the long-held view that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an ineffective treatment for OCD, there is no systematic review to support or refute this claim, which is the basis of the review.

- **Data sources**: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and LILACS databases was conducted on December 22, 2013, using the terms obsessive-compulsive disorder and electroconvulsive therapy. Reference lists, specific journals, and clinical trial registries were also scrutinized. No date or language limitation was imposed on the search.

- **Study selection**: After excluding irrelevant and redundant records from the 500 identified titles, the 50 articles reporting the acute treatment effects of ECT in OCD and related constructs (involving a total of 279 patients) were analyzed for this study.

- **Data extraction**: The relevant sociodemographic, clinical, and outcome data of individual cases were extracted. Data from individual cases were used to compare the characteristics of responders versus nonresponders to ECT.

- **Results**: Most selected records were case reports/series; there were no randomized controlled trials. A positive response was reported in 60.4% of the 265 cases in which individual responses to ECT were available. ECT responders exhibited a significantly later onset of OCD symptoms (P = .003), were more frequently non-depressed (P = .009), and more commonly reported being treated with ECT.

### Modulation of motor cortex excitability in obsessive-compulsive disorder: an exploratory study on the relations of neurophysiology measures with clinical outcome [^112Kg3tG]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the supplementary motor area (SMA) showed clinical benefit in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We tested whether clinical improvement was associated with enhanced cortical inhibition as measured by single and paired-pulse TMS variables. In a double-blind randomized trial involving 18 OCD patients receiving 4 weeks of either active or sham rTMS, we assessed bilateral resting and active motor thresholds (RMT and AMT), cortical silent period (CSP), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF).

We examined correlations between changes in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Self-report (Y-BOCS-SR), Clinical Global Impression-Severity subscale (CGI-S), and cortical excitability measures. Active rTMS increased right hemisphere RMT, which correlated with Y-BOCS-SR improvement. Baseline RMT hemispheric asymmetry — defined as the difference between left and right hemisphere RMT — and its normalization after active rTMS, correlated with Y-BOCS-SR and CGI-S improvements. Additionally, active rTMS increased right hemisphere SICI, which correlated with Y-BOCS-SR and CGI-S at week 4 and with the normalization of baseline RMT hemispheric asymmetry.

Treatment-induced changes in cortical excitability measures are consistent with an inhibitory action of SMA rTMS on dysfunctional motor circuits in OCD. Correlations of neurophysiology measures with therapeutic outcomes support the role of SMA in the modulation of OCD symptoms.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves symptoms and reduces clinical illness in patients suffering from OCD — Results from a single-blind, randomized clinical trial with sham cross-over condition [^115Qkn7N]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2015). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) employs both psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological methods, yielding encouraging yet mixed results. This study tested the hypothesis that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can improve symptoms and lessen illness severity in patients with treatment-resistant OCD.

- **Methods**: Twenty-one patients (57% females; mean age: 35.8 years), all suffering from treatment-resistant OCD, were randomly assigned to either an rTMS-first-sham-second or a sham-first-rTMS-second condition. Each treatment session lasted for about 50 minutes, conducted five times a week over four weeks. Symptom severity was measured using both self-reports and expert ratings.

- **Results**: There was a notable reduction in symptom severity, as reported by both patients and experts, in the rTMS condition compared to the sham condition. Full and partial responses were recorded in the rTMS condition, which were not observed in the sham condition.

- **Conclusions**: The findings from this single-blind, sham- and cross-over design trial suggest that rTMS serves as an effective intervention for patients with treatment-resistant OCD.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r-TMS) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistance in obsessive-compulsive disorder: A meta-analysis and clinical implications [^115mSL9x]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Despite promising results from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, the efficacy of r-TMS as a treatment for OCD remains controversial, at least in part owing to inconsistency in trial methodologies and heterogeneity in trial outcomes. This meta-analysis attempts to explain some of this heterogeneity by comparing the efficacy of r-TMS in patients with or without resistance to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), defined using standardized criteria.

- **Methods**: We conducted a pre-registered (PROSPERO ID: 241381) systematic review and meta-analysis. English language articles reporting blinded RCTs were retrieved from searches using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies were subjected to subgroup analysis based on four stages of treatment resistance, defined using an adaptation of published criteria (1 = not treatment resistant, 2 = one SSRI trial failed, 3 = two SSRI trials failed, 4 = two SSRI trials failed plus one or more CBT trial failed). Meta-regression analyses investigated patient and methodological factors (age, duration of OCD, illness severity, stage of treatment-resistance, or researcher allegiance) as possible moderators of effect size.

- **Results**: Twenty-five independent comparisons (23 studies) were included. Overall, r-TMS showed a medium-sized reduction of Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores (Hedge's g: -0.47; 95% CI: -0.67 to -0.27) with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 39.8%). Assessment of publication bias using Trim and Fill analysis suggested a reduc[tion in bias].

### Defining functional brain networks underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using treatment-induced neuroimaging changes: A systematic review of the literature [^117CMqz6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Approximately 2%-3% of the population suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Several brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD, but their various contributions remain unclear. We examined changes in structural and functional neuroimaging before and following a variety of therapeutic interventions as an index into identifying the underlying networks involved. We identified 64 studies from 1990 to 2020 comparing pretreatment and post-treatment imaging of patients with OCD, including metabolic and perfusion, neurochemical, structural, functional, and connectivity-based modalities.

- **Treatment class**: Included pharmacotherapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy/exposure and response prevention, stereotactic lesions, deep brain stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Changes in several brain regions are consistent and correspond with treatment response despite the heterogeneity in treatments and neuroimaging modalities. Most notable are decreases in metabolism and perfusion of the caudate, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC), including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), ventromedial PFC (VMPFC), and ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC). Modulating activity within regions of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical system may be a common therapeutic mechanism across treatments.

We identify future needs and knowledge gaps that can be mitigated by implementing integrative methods. Future studies should incorporate a systematic, analytical approach to testing objective correlates of treatment response.

### The efficacy of deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the medial prefrontal cortex in obsessive compulsive disorder: results from an open-label study [^112ZW1Ni]. Depression and Anxiety (2015). Low credibility.

Significant numbers of patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) respond minimally to currently available treatments. Furthermore, the application of both high- and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been shown to be ineffective in the reduction of OCD symptoms. In this study, we instead targeted the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and applied low-frequency rTMS to patients with OCD and assessed their clinical response.

- **Methods**: In an open-label design, 10 OCD patients with no other Axis I psychiatric disorders were recruited. Twelve hundred pulses of 1-Hz frequency were applied over the mPFC (Brodmann areas 24 and 32) using a double-cone coil for 10 days. Regions of interest were located on participants' MRIs using neuronavigation software. Patients' symptoms were rated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).

- **Results**: All patients demonstrated improvement in their OCD symptoms after 10 sessions of rTMS, as shown by a mean improvement in Y-BOCS score of 39% (SD = 15%; P < .001, F = 62.95). This improvement persisted 1 month following the last session of rTMS.

- **Conclusions**: Our results suggest the use of low-frequency deep rTMS as a promising and robust intervention in OCD symptom reduction. However, this study is limited by its open-label nature and its lack of a control group, so further randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these results.

### Update on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Different targets [^111yQh17]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are egodystonic, unwanted thoughts, images, or impulses that repeatedly enter one's mind. Compulsions are repetitive, time-consuming behaviors or mental acts often performed to neutralize the anxiety provoked by obsessions. The prevalence of OCD in the general population is estimated at 1% to 3%, and the disorder is associated with impaired functioning and decreased quality of life. The general treatment of OCD involves the use of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor at an adequate dose, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or a combination of the two. However, up to 40% of patients fail to respond satisfactorily to these generally adequate treatment options, and 10% cannot be helped at all.

With the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), it has become possible to modulate local neural activity by inducing a depolarizing magnetic field pulse. Because OCD may be related to increased neural activity in prefrontal subcortical circuits, the inhibitory effect of rTMS was hypothesized to be beneficial in OCD treatment. In 1997, Greenberg et al. introduced rTMS as a new treatment approach for OCD. Previously, rTMS had been shown to have a positive effect on mood disorders with stimulation of the prefrontal cortex. Greenberg et al. hypothesized that inhibition of the prefrontal activity with rTMS might reduce obsessive-compulsive symptoms. They applied rTMS (80% motor threshold, 20 Hz for 2 s/min) for 20 min to 12 patients with OCD and found a significant reduction in symptoms.

### Neural correlates associated with symptom provocation in pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder following a single session of sham-controlled repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [^1153ipP1]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Treatments for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) could be enhanced if the physiological changes engendered by treatment were known. This study examined neural correlates of a provocation task in youth with OCD, before and after sham-controlled repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). We hypothesized that rTMS to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex would inhibit activity in cortico-striato-thalamic (CST) circuits associated with OCD to a greater extent than sham rTMS.

After baseline (Time 1) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a provocation task, subjects received one session of either fMRI-guided sham (SG; n = 8) or active (AG; n = 10) 1-Hz rTMS over the rDLPFC for 30 minutes. During rTMS, subjects were presented with personalized images that evoked OCD-related anxiety. Following stimulation, fMRI and the provocation task were repeated (Time 2). Contrary to our prediction for the provocation task, the AG was associated with no changes in BOLD response from Times 1 to 2. In contrast, the SG had a significant increase at Time 2 in BOLD response in the right inferior frontal gyrus and right putamen, which persisted after adjusting for age, gender, and time to scanner as covariates.

This study provides an initial framework for TMS interrogation of the CST circuit in pediatric OCD.

### Defining functional brain networks underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using treatment-induced neuroimaging changes: A systematic review of the literature [^114JReFK]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021).

Approximately 2%–3% of the population suffers from obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Several brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD, but their various contributions remain unclear. We examined changes in structural and functional neuroimaging before and following a variety of therapeutic interventions as an index into identifying the underlying networks involved. We identified 64 studies from 1990 to 2020 comparing pretreatment and post-treatment imaging of patients with OCD, including metabolic and perfusion, neurochemical, structural, functional, and connectivity-based modalities.

Treatment class included pharmacotherapy, cognitive–behavioural therapy/exposure and response prevention, stereotactic lesions, deep brain stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Changes in several brain regions are consistent and correspond with treatment response despite the heterogeneity in treatments and neuroimaging modalities. Most notable are decreases in metabolism and perfusion of the caudate, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), ventromedial PFC (VMPFC), and ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC). Modulating activity within regions of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical system may be a common therapeutic mechanism across treatments.

We identify future needs and knowledge gaps that can be mitigated by implementing integrative methods. Future studies should incorporate a systematic, analytical approach to testing objective correlates of treatment response.

### Clinical practice: Obsessive-compulsive disorder [^11774HFX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on obsessive-compulsive disorder:

- **Definition**: OCD is a chronic mental health condition characterized by disabling and distressing obsessions and compulsions.

- **Pathophysiology**: OCD is associated with hyperactivity of the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate, as well as abnormalities in functional or structural connections, including the anterior cingulate, thalamus, cortex, amygdala, and parietal cortex. There are deficits in cognitive abilities, including executive functioning, impulsivity in motor function, and cognitive inflexibility. Abnormal interactions in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop, including links to the amygdala, cause an imbalance between glutamatergically mediated excitatory and GABA-mediated inhibitory control mechanisms in the frontostriatal circuit. This results in neurocognitive deficits, obsessions, and compulsions, which may be associated with other comorbidities, such as tic disorders, anxiety disorders, and psychotic disorders.

- **Epidemiology**: The 12-month and lifetime prevalence of OCD is estimated at 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively.

- **Risk factors**: OCD is a multifactorial familial condition involving polygenic and environmental risk factors. Adverse perinatal events, psychological trauma, and neurological trauma may modify the expression of risk genes, triggering obsessive-compulsive behaviors. OCD often co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders, such as social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobias, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia.

### Efficacy of brain stimulation therapies across psychiatric, movement, and cognitive disorders: An umbrella review synthesizing meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^115JHuWK]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Building on the exploration of brain stimulation therapies (BSTs) for single diseases or symptoms, some researchers have attempted to broaden their focus. For example, studies have investigated the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on pain, cognitive function, and psychiatric symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis or examined its impact on core symptoms or unique health endpoints across a range of disorders. Research also explores symptoms from a transdiagnostic perspective. One study on BSTs for depressive symptoms across psychiatric, movement, and cognitive disorders identified the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a transdiagnostic neural mechanism. Another study on transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) for treating anxiety and depression found that disorders such as OCD and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) share fundamental clinical features and similar neuropathological mechanisms involving the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Additionally, research involving non-invasive, non-convulsive electrical neuromodulation found improvements in mood and sleep symptoms across diagnoses. Despite many studies attempting to link various diseases from the perspectives of specific diseases or symptoms, the overall research is limited in scope and quantity. Evidence does not provide comprehensive guidance for psychiatric, movement, and cognitive disorders.

An umbrella review is a comprehensive analysis of the highest-level evidence, namely systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It helps determine whether different authors reach similar conclusions on related topics.

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156Qhwy]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the association of symptom provocation with clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) suggest that symptom provocation may improve clinical response to TMS for nicotine use and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Larger, well-powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compare TMS with and without provocation are critical to establish the effect of symptom provocation on TMS response.

### A unified connectomic target for deep brain stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^114p9aCF]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

Going further, shared symptom networks could be present in other diseases for which multiple surgical targets are investigated. Major depression and Tourette's syndrome are obvious examples, and extensive work in this direction is currently ongoing. Similar concepts could even be applied to more established targets such as STN vs. GPi DBS or symptom-specific alleviations across diseases.

Potentially, DBS surgery in the (distant) future could involve detailed preoperative phenotyping to establish a broad patient-specific symptom score. Based on databases of clinical improvements along affected symptom axes, a mix of networks that should be modulated to alleviate each patient's specific symptom profile could be identified. Such concepts are still mostly speculation but could be investigated in future studies.

This said, we must emphasize that the present study investigated data on a group level and utilized connectivity data from individuals without OCD. As mentioned by others in the very context, we could not agree more that surgical decision-making for DBS should not be based on such aggregated normative data alone. Further studies are required to determine whether individual patient connectivity or generic connectome data (or both) could assist with optimizations in surgical targeting or DBS programming by determining crossing sites of symptom networks for specific patients.

### Introducing navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation as a refined brain mapping methodology [^114iDVb6]. Neurosurgical Review (2001). Low credibility.

A major intrinsic limitation of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to map the human brain lies in the unclear relationship between the position of the stimulating coil on the scalp and the underlying stimulated cortex. The relationship between structure and function as the major feature constituting a brain mapping modality cannot, therefore, be established. Recent advances in image processing allowed us to refine TMS by combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities with TMS, using a neuronavigation system to measure the position of the stimulating coil and map this position onto an MRI data set.

This technique has several advantages over recent TMS mapping strategies. The position of the coil on the scalp can be held constant as verified by real-time visual guidance. When evaluating higher cortical functions, the relationship between underlying cortical anatomy and the scalp stimulation site can be accurately assessed. Cortical motor output maps can be easily obtained for preoperative planning and decision-making for mass lesions near the rolandic cortex in patients.

In conclusion, navigated TMS is a reliable alternative for localizing cortical functions and, therefore, may be a useful adjunct or, in selected patients, even a helpful alternative to other functional neuroimaging methods.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): an exploratory meta-analysis of randomized and sham-controlled trials [^115bBZ4J]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and to generate hypotheses for more robustly powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs on rTMS for OCD have produced conflicting results, potentially due to limited statistical power among individual studies.

The method involved searching the literature for RCTs on rTMS for OCD from 1995 through December 2012. The databases used included MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SCOPUS. An exploratory random-effects meta-analysis was conducted, with the main outcome measures being pre-post changes in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores, response to treatment, and overall dropout rates at study end.

Results were obtained from 10 RCTs, comprising a total of 282 subjects with OCD. The pooled Hedges' g for pre-post Y-BOCS scores was 0.59 (z = 2.73, p = 0.006), indicating a significant and medium-sized difference in outcomes favoring active rTMS. Response rates were 35% and 13% for patients receiving active and sham rTMS, respectively (OR = 3.4, p = 0.002). Sub-group analyses suggested that low-frequency rTMS and rTMS protocols targeting non-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions, such as the orbitofrontal cortex or supplementary motor area, appear to be the most promising for reducing OCD-related symptoms. No differences in baseline depression scores or dropout rates at study end were observed between active and sham rTMS groups, although OCD severity at baseline was higher in the active rTMS group.

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111MrsYy]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for the treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and nicotine dependence. Although TMS is effective for many psychiatric and substance use disorders, questions remain about its underlying mechanism and ways to optimize clinical response.

It is well established that TMS has state-dependent effects on brain circuitry. State dependence signifies that the effect of brain stimulation results from the interaction between external stimulation and the internal brain state. The state-dependent effects of TMS are readily observable during motor threshold determination, defined as the minimum stimulation level that will elicit a defined motor response (i.e. usually a 50-mV motor-evoked potential or observable twitch in a defined muscle) in 50% of attempts. It is well established that the active motor threshold (i.e. the motor threshold when a muscle is partially contracted) is lower than the resting motor threshold. State-dependent effects of TMS have been demonstrated in the motor, visual, and memory systems, where prestimulation neural activation increases susceptibility to TMS effects. This has also been shown for emotional states, where the reactivation of a fear-related memory before TMS successfully eliminated physiological fear responses 24 hours after active TMS but not after sham TMS or when TMS was administered without fear reactivation. It has, therefore, been proposed that provoking symptoms may…

### Efficacy of intensive orbitofrontal continuous theta burst stimulation (iOFcTBS) in obsessive compulsive disorder: A randomized placebo controlled study [^111uWu9p]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can non-invasively modulate specific brain regions in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Citing orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) hyper-connectivity with the striatum as the most consistent finding implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD, we aimed to study the effect of novel continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) targeting the OFC in OCD subjects using a randomized placebo-controlled design. Thirty-three patients were randomly allocated to active cTBS (n = 18) and sham (n = 15) groups. They received 10 TBS sessions, 2 per day (total of 1200 pulses; intensive protocol) for 5 days in a week.

The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores were assessed at baseline, after the last session, and at 2 weeks post-rTMS. On repeated measures-ANOVA, a significant group*time effect (from pretreatment to 2 weeks post TBS) for obsessions, compulsions, HAM-A, HAM-D, and CGI scores was found. However, when controlled for confounding variables, only HAM-A scores and CGI effect retained statistical significance. We conclude that intensive OFC cTBS (iOFcTBS) in OCD is well tolerated with clinically significant improvements in anxiety symptoms and global severity. This improvement in anxiety symptoms could be due to modulations of state-dependent dysregulation in OCD.

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112q47Ck]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

We performed a multilevel random-effects meta-analysis, which allowed us to include multiple estimates per study (e.g. for different clinical outcomes) by accounting for within-study correlation using a random effect for study and to use study-specific random effects to account for additional variability between individual effect sizes due to heterogeneity in the effect across outcomes. Four meta-analytic models were estimated using the metafor R package (R Project for Statistical Computing).

- **Model 1**: An intercept-only model quantifying the overall estimated effect size aggregated across the studies.
- **Model 2**: Added a fixed effect for symptom provocation.
- **Model 3**: Added a fixed effect comparing OCD vs. nicotine studies with model 1.
- **Model 4**: Included provocation, diagnostic group (i.e. OCD, nicotine dependence), and their interaction.

We used model 4 to estimate effect sizes and confidence intervals for each relevant study group (e.g. OCD studies with provocation) and to test for a significant provocation effect in either OCD or nicotine studies. As an exploratory analysis, we investigated the difference between excitatory and inhibitory TMS by adding a protocol covariate to model 4. Excitatory sequences were defined as any TMS greater than 1 Hz or intermittent theta burst stimulation, and inhibitory sequences were defined as any TMS of 1 Hz or less or continuous theta burst stimulation. For all models, we used the CR2 robust variance adjustment to account for variance misspecification within studies. We assessed within- and between-study heterogeneity using the I² statistic.

### Right versus left prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder: a preliminary investigation [^116GYLa4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

There is preliminary evidence that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be useful for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but no definitive study has been published, and the effect of laterality of stimulation is uncertain.

- **Method**: Subjects (N = 12) with resistant OCD were allocated randomly to either right or left prefrontal rTMS daily for 2 weeks. They were assessed by an independent rater at 1 and 2 weeks and 1 month later.

- **Results**: Subjects had an overall significant improvement in the obsessions (p < .01), compulsions (p < .01), and total (p < .01) scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) after 2 weeks and at 1-month follow-up. This improvement was significant for obsessions (p < .05) and tended toward significance for total Y-BOCS scores (p = .06) after correction for changes in depression scores on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. There was no significant difference between right- and left-sided rTMS on any of the parameters examined. Two subjects (33%) in each group showed clinically significant improvement that persisted at 1 month, but with relapse later in 1 subject.

- **Conclusion**: A proportion (about one quarter) of patients with resistant OCD appear to respond to rTMS to either prefrontal lobe. However, in the absence of a sham treatment group in this study, we cannot rule out the possibility of this being a placebo response. This treatment warrants further investigation to better establish its efficacy and examine the best parameters for response.

Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS), an advancement of transcranial magnetic stimulation, was created to reach wider and possibly more profound regions of the brain. At present, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of dTMS in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

- **Objective**: This study used a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dTMS for treating OCD.

- **Methods**: Four randomized controlled trials were found by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to February 2024. The fixed effects meta-analysis model was used for the purpose of data merging in Stata17. The risk ratio (RR) value was used as the measure of effect size to compare response rates and dropout rates between active and sham dTMS.

- **Results**: The meta-analysis included four randomized-controlled trials involving 252 patients with treatment-resistant OCD. Active dTMS showed a notably greater rate of response on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) in comparison to sham dTMS after treatment (Y-BOCS: RR = 3.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.06 to 6.69) and at the one-month follow-up (Y-BOCS: RR = 2.60, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.26). Subgroup analysis revealed that active dTMS with H-coils was more effective than sham dTMS (RR = 3.57, 95% CI 1.93 to 6.60). No serious adverse events were documented in the studies that were included.

- **Conclusion**: The findings suggest that dTMS demonstrates notable efficacy and safety in treating patients with treatment-resistant OCD compared to sham dTMS.

The study supports the potential of dTMS as a treatment option.

### Glutamatergic neurotransmission is affected by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the supplemental motor cortex of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^114DsCJq]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). High credibility.

In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), glutamatergic neurotransmission dysfunction plays a key role in its pathophysiology. This research assessed changes in neurometabolites in the bilateral striatum of OCD patients receiving low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using 1H proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS).

- **Methods**: 52 OCD patients were divided into an rTMS treatment group (29 patients) and a control group (medication only, 22 patients). The levels of neurometabolites in the bilateral striatum of patients with OCD were measured using MRS before and after treatment. All participants were taking medication prior to the treatment and during the process.

- **Results**: Following rTMS treatment, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score significantly decreased in the rTMS group compared with the control group. Glutamate (Glu) and glutamate and glutamine complexes (Glx) in the bilateral striatum of the rTMS treatment response group increased significantly with the improvement of OCD. Glu in the bilateral striatum and Glx in the right striatum were positively correlated with compulsion after the treatment.

- **Conclusions**: The physiopathological mechanism of OCD may be related to glutamatergic dysfunction. Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the supplementary motor area can improve OCD symptoms by modulating glutamatergic levels in the bilateral striatum of patients with OCD.

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111HPbFG]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

It remains unknown if TMS protocols with symptom provocation improve clinical response more than protocols without provocation. Because the only FDA-approved TMS protocols that include symptom provocation are for OCD and nicotine dependence, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate how much provoking a symptomatic state before TMS improves treatment response for these indications. Specifically, we aimed to aggregate effects across the field to estimate the effectiveness of active TMS compared with sham for OCD and nicotine dependence, as well as the benefit of symptom provocation.

### An international survey of different transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [^1132jJM6]. Psychiatry Research (2021). Low credibility.

This study aims to evaluate preferences and trends in the delivery of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). A 10-item online questionnaire was developed and conducted between April and June 2020, surveying providers of TMS for patients with OCD internationally. A total of 27 valid responses were analyzed from 10 countries. The most common target for TMS was the supplementary motor area, and stimulation was commonly given bilaterally, though techniques differed between centers. Exposure tasks were not commonly used during TMS. The study calls for more research to clarify the best mode of TMS delivery for OCD.

### Update on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder: different targets [^112jKQfe]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

In the early 1980s, the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device was developed by Barker and colleagues. The device stimulates the human cortex directly using a contactless and noninvasive method. It uses a strong pulse of electricity sent through a coil to induce a magnetic field pulse in the area under the coil. This pulse has the capacity to depolarize superficial local neurons. To create a longer-lasting effect on the depolarized neurons, the application of repetitive TMS (rTMS) is needed. The magnitude and direction of rTMS-induced neuronal modulation depend on extrinsic factors such as motor threshold, frequency, and the total number of stimuli, as well as intrinsic factors like the functional state of the cortex. For example, it appears that low-frequency rTMS (0–5 Hz) results in decreased neural excitability and regional cerebral blood flow, as opposed to high-frequency rTMS (5–20 Hz), which increases both.

Because knowledge of the involvement of specific brain circuits in OCD is advancing, rTMS has been applied to several brain targets. The rationale for the first rTMS studies in OCD was based on functional neuroimaging studies of OCD that demonstrated abnormalities in the orbitofrontal subcortical circuits, especially in the orbital frontal gyri and medial caudate nuclei. This circuitry may be manipulated with rTMS by:

- **Stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)**.
- **Inhibition of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) directly**.
- **Inhibition of the supplementary motor area (SMA)**.

The SMA was chosen as a useful target for rTMS because…

### Symptom provocation and clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111km4oA]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The FDA-cleared TMS protocols for OCD and nicotine dependence provoke a symptomatic state before TMS in hopes of shifting the brain into a state more sensitive to TMS effects. For OCD, this involves provoking obsessive-compulsive symptoms through auditory or visual stimuli based on a personalized hierarchy for 5 minutes before TMS until their level of distress is 4 to 7 out of 10 on a visual analog scale. Using this protocol, active TMS significantly reduced OCD symptoms, with a response rate of 45.2% compared to 17.8% using sham.

- **Model of hypothesized effects of symptom provocation on clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)**: Repetitive TMS (rTMS) has known state-dependent effects. The US Food and Drug Administration–cleared TMS protocols for nicotine dependence and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) both include provocation of a symptomatic state (craving, obsessive-compulsive thoughts, respectively) in an effort to improve TMS response. However, these experiments have been performed in small numbers, and the overall effect of symptom provocation has not been quantified.

For smoking cessation, the FDA-cleared protocol involves a 5-minute provocation procedure where patients imagine their greatest craving trigger, listen to an audio recording instructing them to handle a cigarette and lighter, then view smoking images. In the study that led to FDA clearance of TMS for smoking cessation, the active TMS group had a higher continuous quit rate (28.0% vs 11.7%) and greater reductions in craving.

### Defining functional brain networks underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using treatment-induced neuroimaging changes: A systematic review of the literature [^112Xtj1u]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive technique that induces an electric field on the brain via alternating currents in a wire coil held adjacent to the scalp. The induced field produces electrical stimulation in brain regions directly beneath the coil [S42-S44]. The parameters of stimulation, including coil geometry, frequency, intensity, and location, determine the effects. Among repetitive TMS (rTMS) approaches in neuropsychiatry, the most commonly studied patterns of stimulation are slow (5 Hz) and theta-burst [S45].

- **Metabolic and perfusion studies (FDG-PET, SPECT)**: Slow rTMS (1 Hz) of the right OFC with a butterfly double-cone coil decreased metabolic activity (FDG-PET) in the right OFC and correlated with a decrease in Y-BOCS. The right DLPFC, right middle gyrus, right orbital gyrus, left subgenual ACC, and left orbital gyrus also showed decreased metabolism; however, none of these were correlated with Y-BOCS (n = 19 adults) [S46].

- **Functional studies (task fMRI, rs-fMRI)**: A recent sham-controlled study evaluated slow rTMS of the right DLPFC region during a provocation task. The active group (n = 10 adults) showed no change in BOLD response before versus after stimulation, whereas the sham group (n = 8 adults) showed a BOLD increase at the right inferior frontal gyrus and right putamen, which did not correlate with symptom improvement [S47].

Summary of neuroimaging changes with TMS that significantly correlated with symptom change: Low-frequency rTMS treatment to the right OFC decreased metabolic activity in the right OFC [S46]. (Refer to figure 2E, table 1.)

### Increases in functional connectivity between the default mode network and sensorimotor network correlate with symptomatic improvement after transcranial direct current stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder [^1154bPZX]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Non-invasive neuromodulation is a promising intervention for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), although its neurobiological mechanisms of action are still poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that abnormalities in the connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) with other brain regions and networks are involved in OCD pathophysiology. We examined if transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) alters these connectivity patterns and if they correlate with symptom improvement in treatment-resistant OCD.

- **Methods**: In 23 patients from a larger clinical trial (comparing active tDCS to sham), who underwent pre- and post-treatment MRI scans, we assessed resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data. The treatment involved 30-minute daily tDCS sessions for four weeks (weekdays only), with the cathode over the SMA and the anode over the left deltoid. We conducted whole-brain connectivity analysis comparing active tDCS-treated to sham-treated patients.

- **Results**: We found that active tDCS, but not sham, led to connectivity increasing between the DMN and the bilateral pre/postcentral gyri (p = 0.004, FDR corrected) and temporal-auditory areas plus the SMA (p = 0.028, FDR corrected). Also, symptom improvement was directly associated with connectivity increasing between the left lateral sensorimotor network and the left precuneus (r = 0.589, p = 0.034).

- **Limitations**: Limited sample size (23 participants with resting-state neuroimaging), inability to analyze specific OCD symptom dimensions (e.g. harm, sexual/religious, symmetry).

### Update on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder: different targets [^1131abN6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

In an Indian sham-controlled study, active rTMS at 10 Hz, 110% motor threshold (n = 21) and sham rTMS (n = 21) of the right DLPFC elicited similar improvement in obsessions and compulsions 2 weeks after the 10th session. The Y-BOCS reduction for active rTMS was 5.0 points (19.5%), and 4.2 points (17.7%) for sham rTMS. Interestingly, depressive scores, as measured by the HAM-D, were reduced significantly over time in the real rTMS group compared with the sham rTMS group (P > 0.04). A total of 76.2% of those receiving real rTMS were partial responders (25% reduction in HAM-D scores from baseline), compared with 66.7% in the sham group. The authors concluded that right DLPFC rTMS has no effect on OCD but is modestly effective in the treatment of comorbid depressive symptoms.

In conclusion, in open-label studies, high-frequency rTMS of the right and/or left DLPFC appears to be effective in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms. However, this could not be replicated in double-blind, sham-controlled studies. In those studies, neither low nor high rTMS and neither rTMS to the left nor to the right DLPFC appeared to be more effective than sham rTMS.

- **Orbitofrontal cortex**: In 2009, Ruffini and colleagues examined the OFC as a new target for rTMS in drug-resistant OCD patients. The participants received 10 min of 1-Hz rTMS at 80% motor threshold for 15 sessions to the left OFC; however, the coil was placed parallel (active, n = 16) or perpendicular (sham, n = 7) to the scalp. They found a significant reduction of Y-BOCS scores comparing active versus sham treatment for 10 weeks.

### A transdiagnostic evaluation of cortical inhibition in severe mental disorders using transcranial magnetic stimulation [^116KX214]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

Multiple lines of investigation suggest that aberrations in cortical inhibition are central to the phenotypic manifestations of severe mental disorders. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) combined with electromyography can characterize these inhibitory processes in the motor cortex with satisfactory temporal precision. We examined TMS-evoked short- (SICI) and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) and cortical silent period (CSP) as markers of GABA A- (SICI) and GABA B-mediated (LICI and CSP) cortical neurotransmission in individuals with mania (n = 40), schizophrenia (n = 76), unipolar depression (n = 86), and OCD (n = 43), comparing them to healthy subjects (n = 125).

We hypothesized transdiagnostic GABA A deficits across clinical groups and diagnosis-specific GABA B alterations in mania (increased) and OCD (decreased). After controlling for potential confounders (gender, education, benzodiazepine prescription, and motor threshold) using ANCOVA, we observed no significant group difference in SICI (F = 1.04, P = 0.38), but a significant group effect in LICI (F = 16.29, P < 0.001) and CSP (F = 3.02, P = 0.018). Post-hoc analyses revealed that LICI was significantly reduced in OCD but increased in mania and schizophrenia compared to the healthy group. Similarly, CSP was significantly reduced in OCD and depression groups as compared to the reference group. We observed that LICI and CSP both followed similar descending gradients from mania through schizophrenia and depression to OCD.

### Better than treated as usual: Transcranial magnetic stimulation augmentation in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, mini-review and pilot open-label trial [^111MeXwJ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area has been shown to be effective in a subset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) subjects, yet these results are still to be confirmed. This preliminary study compares the efficacy of augmentation with 1 Hz rTMS over the supplementary motor area and the usual augmentation treatment (treated as usual, TAU) with antipsychotics in a sample of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-refractory OCD patients.

- **Method**: Fifty SSRI-refractory OCD patients consecutively admitted were studied; 25 were treated with a three-week trial of 1 Hz bilateral rTMS over the supplementary motor area and 25 with antipsychotic drugs. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS; primary outcome measure), Hamilton Depression and Hamilton Anxiety scales were administered at the first, second, and third weeks of treatment.

- **Results**: The Y-BOCS showed a statistically significant time effect from the baseline to the third week, with 68% of responders (Y-BOCS score reduction of ≥ 25%), in comparison with 24.0% in the TAU group. In the rTMS group, 17.6% of patients achieved remission.

- **Conclusions**: 1 Hz rTMS over the supplementary motor area appeared to be effective in approximately two-thirds of SSRI-refractory OCD subjects, whereas in the TAU group only one-quarter of subjects were responders. The supplementary motor area might be a new target area to be further explored with neuromodulation for OCD treatment.

### Moderators and predictors of response to deep transcranial magnetic stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder [^116KgfHV]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) has emerged as a treatment option for adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who continue to exhibit impairing symptoms following an adequate response to first-line interventions. Currently, little is known about the predictors or moderators of dTMS outcomes for OCD. This paper examined whether several theoretically relevant variables might predict and moderate treatment effects, including OCD symptom severity, functional impairment, co-occurring depressive symptoms, age, gender, age of OCD onset, and family history of OCD.

As part of a previously reported study, 100 patients received 29 dTMS or sham stimulation treatments over six weeks. dTMS was administered using a Magstim Rapid2 TMS (The Magstim Co. Ltd, Whitland, Carmarthenshire, United Kingdom) stimulator equipped with an H-shaped coil design, which was specifically designed to stimulate the dorsal mPFC-ACC bilaterally. Findings suggest older participants and those with lower OCD severity and disability respond faster to both dTMS and sham stimulation. dTMS of the dorsal mPFC/ACC appeared to have larger benefits for individuals with greater OCD severity, whereas the difference between treatment arms was minimal in those with lower severity. Implications of these findings for the treatment of OCD are discussed.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation in neurology [^112YEoHX]. The Lancet Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool for the electrical stimulation of neural tissue, including the cerebral cortex, spinal roots, and cranial and peripheral nerves. TMS can be applied as single pulses of stimulation, pairs of stimuli separated by variable intervals to the same or different brain areas, or as trains of repetitive stimuli at various frequencies. Single stimuli can depolarize neurons and evoke measurable effects. Trains of stimuli, known as repetitive TMS, can modify the excitability of the cerebral cortex at the stimulated site and also at remote areas along functional anatomical connections.

TMS might provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the neural circuitry underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders. It may also be developed into clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic tests and have therapeutic uses in various diseases. This potential is supported by the available studies, but more work is needed to establish the role of TMS in clinical neurology.

### Investigating brain structure and tDCS response in obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111Xzc9G]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors, with associated brain abnormalities in various regions. This study explores the correlation between neural biomarkers and the response to transcranial Direct Stimulation (tDCS) in OCD patients. Using structural MRI data from two tDCS trials involving 55 OCD patients and 28 controls, cortical thickness and gray matter morphometry were analyzed. Findings revealed thicker precentral and paracentral areas in OCD patients compared to controls (p < 0.001).

Correlations between cortical thickness and treatment response indicated a significant association between a thinner precentral area and reduced Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) scores (p = 0.02). While results highlight the complexity of treatment response predictors, this study sheds light on potential neural markers for tDCS response in OCD patients. Further investigations with larger datasets are warranted to better understand the underpinnings of these biomarkers and their implications for personalized treatment approaches.

### Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder is efficacious even in patients who failed multiple medications and CBT [^113FEgcR]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Low credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling disease with a lifetime prevalence of 2%-3%. About 40–60% of these patients do not adequately respond to pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) was shown to be safe and effective as a treatment alternative for OCD, and it recently received regulatory approvals. However, it is unclear whether patients who failed numerous medications and/or CBT can still benefit from dTMS. Here, we analyzed recent data from a double-blind multicenter dTMS study and found efficacy of this novel treatment even in OCD patient cohorts who previously failed to respond to multiple medications and CBT.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder: a double-blind controlled investigation [^114EBLKh]. Psychological Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted.

- **Method**: Subjects with treatment-resistant OCD were randomized to receive rTMS (n = 10) or sham rTMS (n = 8) for 10 sessions of daily stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Both subjects and raters were blind to the treatment. Subjects were offered an open extension of up to 20 sessions of rTMS.

- **Results**: The two groups did not differ in change in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) or Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory scores over 10 sessions, with or without correction for depression ratings. Over 20 sessions, there was a significant reduction in total YBOCS scores, but not after controlling for depression. rTMS over 20 sessions was well tolerated.

- **Conclusion**: Two weeks of rTMS over the left DLPFC is ineffective for treatment-resistant OCD.

### An updated meta-analysis: Short-term therapeutic effects of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder [^115wGJz2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to evaluate the short-term therapeutic effects of using repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and to examine potential influencing factors.

- **Method**: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Wanfang, CNKI, and Sinomed databases on September 18, 2016, and reviewed the references of previous meta-analyses. Sham-controlled, randomized clinical trials using rTMS to treat OCD were included. Hedge's g was calculated for the effect size. Subgroup analyses and univariate meta-regressions were conducted.

- **Results**: Twenty studies with 791 patients were included. A large effect size (g = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55–0.87; P < 0.001) was found for the therapeutic effect. Targeting the supplementary motor area (SMA) (g = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.12–1.01; P < 0.001), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (g = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.02–0.93; P = 0.02), bilateral DLPFC (g = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38–0.92; P < 0.001), and right DLPFC (g = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.70–1.15; P < 0.001), excluding the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (g = 0.56; 95% CI, -0.05–1.18; P = 0.07), showed significant improvements over sham treatments. Both low-frequency (g = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50–0.96; P < 0.001) and high-frequency (g = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.89; P < 0.001) treatments were significantly better than sham treatments, with no significant differences between the effects of the two frequencies. The subgroup analyses indicated that patients who were non-treatment resistant, lacked comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD), and received threshold-intensity rTMS showed larger therapeutic effects.
