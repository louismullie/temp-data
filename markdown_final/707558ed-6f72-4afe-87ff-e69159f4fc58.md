## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the epidemiology of pruritus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and scope to anchor prevalence estimates. Then, I should verify global and regional prevalence data and demographic patterns. Next, I will examine etiologic distributions and high-burden subtypes. After that, I should review disease-specific epidemiology and quality-of-life impact. Finally, I will identify knowledge gaps and synthesize key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical definitions and scope so I don't misinterpret the data. Chronic pruritus is generally defined as itch persisting beyond 6 weeks, and it is commonly categorized by etiology into inflammatory, neuropathic, systemic, psychogenic, or unknown causes, which frames both prevalence and burden estimates in the literature.

> I will now examine global prevalence. Wait, let me verify the most recent large-scale estimate. A 2023 international cross-sectional study across 20 countries reported a worldwide point prevalence of pruritus of 39.8% over the prior 7 days, with a sample of 50,552 individuals, suggesting pruritus is a common global symptom rather than a rare complaint [^113bZoG2]. Hold on, I should also check lifetime estimates for chronic pruritus specifically. A 2024 JAMA review estimates chronic pruritus affects approximately 22% of people in their lifetime, and accounts for about 1% of physician visits, underscoring its clinical footprint [^116x5fUR].

> Next, I should review demographic patterns. The same international study found a modest female predominance (40.7% vs 38.9% in men, P < 0.001) and a clear age gradient, with the highest prevalence in those aged 65 years and older at 43.3%, consistent with geriatric literature noting epidermal barrier, immune, and neural changes that predispose to chronic itch in older adults [^113bZoG2] [^116YY5cF]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there was no ethnic difference, but I should double-check that assertion. The study reported no significant difference by ethnicity (P = 0.14), which supports the conclusion of no major ethnic variation in overall pruritus prevalence in that dataset [^113bZoG2].

> Let me consider geographic and economic gradients. The international analysis found lower prevalence in Europe (35.9%) and Latin America (36.5%) compared with North America (41.2%), and higher prevalence in Africa (45.7%), with BRICS countries showing higher prevalence than developed countries (40.3% vs 38.7%, P < 0.001), suggesting regional and economic variations that may reflect environmental, healthcare access, or diagnostic/reporting differences [^113bZoG2].

> I need to check etiologic distributions to contextualize prevalence. According to a high-quality review, inflammatory etiologies account for roughly 60% of chronic pruritus, neuropathic or mixed etiologies for about 25%, and other causes including systemic, medication-induced, and infectious etiologies for the remaining 15%, which helps explain why pruritus spans dermatologic and systemic domains [^116x5fUR]. But wait, what if the cause remains elusive despite workup? Chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) is reported in 8% to 15% of affected patients, with higher prevalence among the elderly, which complicates management and epidemiologic attribution [^116xy64i].

> Now, I should review high-burden subtypes. Chronic kidney disease–associated pruritus (CKD-aP) is notably prevalent among dialysis patients, historically around 60%, with large international datasets showing that severe itch remains common and undertreated, and contemporary cohorts still demonstrate substantial prevalence and quality-of-life impact, including in nondialysis CKD stages 3–5 where prevalence rises with declining kidney function [^notfound] [^113M6ehM]. Hold on, I should verify regional variability. Meta-analytic data from China suggest very high prevalence among maintenance hemodialysis patients, approaching 78% overall and about 49% with moderate-to-severe itch, highlighting regional differences and potential under-recognition in some settings [^111XGQ7y]. I should also confirm hepatobiliary associations. Cholestatic pruritus in primary biliary cholangitis is reported in up to 50% at some point in the disease course, though claims-based estimates often undercount it, indicating underdiagnosis in routine care [^116wFfqH] [^116nif46]. Let me not forget neuropathic itch. Although population-level estimates are sparse, a German database analysis suggests neuropathic itch accounts for about 8% of chronic pruritus cases, with entities like brachioradial pruritus showing demographic and climatic patterns, including female predominance and possible UV-related triggers in warmer climates [^11474EZi].

> I will now examine disease-specific epidemiology to avoid overgeneralization. Atopic dermatitis is a major inflammatory driver of pruritus, with global prevalence estimates around 7–10% in children and variable in adults, and more than 85% of moderate-to-severe patients reporting daily itch, illustrating the tight link between inflammatory dermatoses and pruritus burden [^117CxEZe] [^111DG7Su]. Chronic urticaria prevalence is estimated at roughly 0.5–5% in the general population, with incidence around 1.4% per year and female predominance, and mast cell–mediated mechanisms directly produce pruritus and wheals, reinforcing the inflammatory category's contribution to chronic itch [^115QkuuL] [^113zeGzM]. Prurigo nodularis, a sequela of chronic scratching, shows rising prevalence in registry data, reaching 14.1 per 100,000 in Denmark by 2021, with female predominance and frequent psychiatric comorbidity, reflecting both neural sensitization and systemic burden [^115GtQhJ]. Connective tissue diseases also contribute; for example, systemic sclerosis cohorts report pruritus in about 42.6% of patients, with associations to skin and gastrointestinal involvement, indicating systemic inflammatory drivers of itch [^112KLrX2].

> Next, I should review quality-of-life and health-system impact to ensure the epidemiology translates to clinical relevance. Chronic pruritus is consistently associated with sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and reduced productivity, with suicidal ideation reported in a meaningful subset of patients with chronic pruritus, particularly in atopic dermatitis, underscoring the psychosocial morbidity that accompanies high-intensity itch [^115JVZrk] [^111DG7Su]. Let me verify healthcare utilization signals. In the UK, most eczema care occurs in primary care with very high attendance rates, and chronic pruritus is a common reason for dermatology and general practice visits, supporting the notion that pruritus drives substantial healthcare demand even when the underlying diagnosis is an inflammatory dermatosis [^111mDd22] [^111WKGoK].

> Hold on, I should verify malignancy associations because this affects diagnostic yield in undifferentiated pruritus. Population-based cohort data show that chronic pruritus without skin disease confers a modestly increased risk of incident hematologic and bile duct malignancies, with hazard ratios around 2.02 and 3.73 respectively, though absolute incidence remains low, which argues for selective, risk-stratified evaluation rather than blanket screening in all such patients [^116cdMVm]. I should confirm predictors of malignancy in undifferentiated pruritus. Case-control analyses suggest older age, male sex, liver disease, and smoking increase the odds of underlying malignancy, which can guide targeted workups in higher-risk presentations [^115Fou7K].

> I need to ensure I address measurement and definitional issues that can bias epidemiologic estimates. There is a lack of standardized, objective biomarkers for itch, so prevalence and severity rely heavily on patient-reported outcomes, and heterogeneity in case definitions, especially for atopic dermatitis, complicates cross-study comparisons and prevalence estimation, highlighting a methodological limitation that may obscure true burden and etiologic patterns [^114DSg37] [^112deQJk]. But wait, what if we are mixing acute and chronic itch in surveys? The large international study captured 7-day point prevalence without distinguishing chronicity, which may inflate estimates relative to strictly chronic pruritus definitions, so I should be cautious in extrapolating those figures to chronic disease burden [^113bZoG2].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Globally, pruritus is highly prevalent, with point estimates near 40% and lifetime chronic pruritus around 22%, with demographic, regional, and etiologic variations that map onto inflammatory, neuropathic, and systemic categories, and with high-burden subtypes including CKD-aP, cholestatic pruritus, neuropathic itch, and pruritus from inflammatory dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis and chronic urticaria, all of which carry substantial quality-of-life and healthcare utilization consequences [^113bZoG2] [^116x5fUR] [^111nPsBp] [^116wFfqH] [^117CxEZe] [^111u5XWi] [^115JVZrk] [^111mDd22].

Pruritus is highly prevalent globally, with a **worldwide prevalence of 39.8%** in the past 7 days [^113bZoG2] and a **lifetime prevalence of chronic pruritus of ~22%** [^116x5fUR]. It is more common in women and increases with age, peaking in those ≥ 65 years [^113bZoG2]. Chronic pruritus is especially frequent in patients with systemic diseases: 60–70% in chronic kidney disease [^111nPsBp], ~50% in primary biliary cholangitis [^116nif46], and ~42% in systemic sclerosis [^112KLrX2]. It is also common in inflammatory dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis [^116x5fUR] [^111ec7Jo] and in chronic urticaria [^111u5XWi]. Pruritus significantly impairs quality of life [^117Dy3Zv], causing sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and reduced productivity [^115JVZrk].

### Burden of atopic dermatitis in Asia [^111ec7Jo]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by intense pruritus and eczematous lesions. It is considered one of the most common chronic conditions, with an estimated global prevalence of nearly 230 million. As in the rest of the world, prevalence of atopic dermatitis has been increasing in Asian countries over the last few decades. This increased prevalence in Asian countries has been attributed to factors such as rapid urbanization, increasingly Westernized lifestyles, and improved standards of living and education. As a result, it is important to understand the increasing burden of disease in Asian countries and the differences between the countries in terms of epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, management, quality of life and economic burden.

Summary Statement 10 — Definition and epidemiology of chronic urticaria: Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as urticaria that has been continuously or intermittently present for at least 6 weeks, and urticaria/angioedema persisting for 6 weeks or longer is designated as chronic; when no underlying cause is found, CU has been referred to as CIU. The prevalence of CU in the general population has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 5%, and incidence has been estimated at 1.4% per year, with studies showing an increased prevalence in female subjects and a female/male ratio ranging from 7:3 to as high as 4:1; physical urticarias tend to have a longer duration than CIU, typically persisting for many years.

### Chronic pruritus and connective tissue disorders: review, gaps, and future directions [^113iUiat]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic itch is a common skin manifestation in many connective tissue diseases. However, the cause of chronic itch in these diseases is still not fully understood. The complex, and in some cases incomplete understanding of, pathogenesis in each condition makes it difficult to target specific mediators of chronic itch. It is important to better understand the pathophysiology of chronic itch in these conditions, as this information might provide a fuller understanding of the pathogenesis of the diseases in general and lead to the development of more specific treatments for connective tissue diseases in patients with chronic itch. We present a review of the literature on what is known about the prevalence, possible pathophysiology, and effect on quality of life of chronic itch in patients with scleroderma, Sjögren's syndrome, dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and mixed connective tissue disease.

### Disease burden of primary biliary cholangitis and associated pruritus based on a cross-sectional US claims analysis [^116wFfqH]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Despite these limitations this study is unique in that it provides a comprehensive, real-world perspective of the overall burden of PBC and PBC-associated pruritus in a relatively large population, especially given the rarity of the disease. Our analyses confirm current knowledge regarding the burden of pruritus and highlight the substantial impact of pruritus on psychiatric and sleep disorders in patients with PBC. The results also emphasise that pruritus might be often underdiagnosed and, consequently, undertreated in clinical practice, reflecting a clear unmet need for newer effective and safe treatments for cholestatic pruritus.

Regarding specific circumstances for pruritus, more specifically with respect to patients with psychogenic pruritus, BAD 2018 guidelines recommend to consider offering psychosocial and behavioral interventions, including education on how to avoid trigger factors, how to apply treatments, lifestyle interventions, relaxation techniques, cognitive restructuring, and behavior modification, including habit reversal training, in distressed patients with chronic pruritus likely of psychogenic origin.

### Emerging therapeutic options for chronic pruritus [^111kukRW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic pruritus, defined as an unpleasant sensation resulting in a need to scratch that lasts more than 6 weeks, is a prevalent and bothersome symptom associated with both cutaneous and systemic conditions. Due to complex pathogenesis and profuse contributing factors, chronic pruritus therapy remains challenging. Regardless of the well-established antipruritic properties of classic pharmacotherapy (topical therapy, phototherapy and systemic therapy), these methods often provide insufficient relief for affected individuals. Owing to the growing interest in the field of pruritic research, further experimental and clinical data have emerged, continuously supporting the possibility of instigating novel therapeutic measures. This review covers the most relevant current modalities remaining under investigation that possess promising perspectives of approval in the near future, especially opioidergic drugs (mu-opioid antagonists and kappa-opioid agonists), neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, biologic drugs, Janus kinase inhibitors, ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors, aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists and histamine H 4 receptor antagonists.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

While the overall prevalence of chronic kidney disease–associated pruritus (CKD-aP) in our study is similar to previously published literature, the prevalence of moderate to severe pruritus is lower.

This study adds:

Awareness of CKD-aP is high in Austrian nephrologists compared with previously published literature.

Potential impact:

High awareness and a multimodal treatment approach might explain the lower prevalence of moderate–severe pruritus in this study.

### Clinical aspects and management of chronic itch [^111WKGoK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pruritus (CP) (ie, itch that persists for more than 6 weeks) poses significant challenges to patients' health and quality of life. It is a common reason for visits to dermatologists and general practitioners and can be caused by a range of conditions, including systemic diseases such as chronic kidney disease or liver diseases, malignancies, neuropathic conditions, and dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis. CP often does not develop in parallel with the course of the disease and can become an entity of its own, which must be treated with antipruritic drugs, even if the underlying cause is already under therapy. Depending on the etiology of CP, different pathways in the pathogenesis have been analyzed recently, following which new treatments have been developed and tested in randomized controlled trials. This article discusses the recent results of these studies and highlights how best to manage health care for patients with CP.

### Patterns and trends in eczema management in UK primary care (2009–2018): a population-based cohort study [^111mDd22]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Eczema (syn. "atopic dermatitis", "atopic eczema") is the most common inflammatory skin condition worldwide in children, 1 and persistence of chronic disease into adulthood is common. 2, 3 Eczema can be extremely disabling and has a significant psychological impact in both children and adults. 4, 5, 6

In the UK, the burden of eczema management falls on primary care. Attendance rates are high, with 96% of children with eczema reported to have had a primary care attendance within the preceding year. 7 Whilst contemporary UK population‐based estimates of eczema disease severity are lacking, a 1998 cross‐sectional analysis in a UK general practice setting estimated 16% of eczema in children aged 1–5 to be moderate or severe. 7 Recent studies of children with eczema actively recruited from UK primary care suggest this figure may be even higher. 8, 9 US population‐based studies have reported 7% of children and 11% of adults with eczema have severe disease. 10, 11 Whilst those with more severe disease are more likely to be referred for specialist care, the majority of these cases are managed without secondary care referral. 7 As a result, the principal costs for eczema are those of primary care attendances and prescribing. 12

Standard topical eczema care includes regular emollient application. Escalation to topical corticosteroids (TCS), or, as an alternative, topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI), is common for maintenance and flare management, 13, 14 and topical antimicrobials can be used to address secondary skin infections, or pruritis. 14 Antihistamines are also commonly used to treat pruritus associated with eczema, although evidence for their effectiveness is limited. 15 In more severe disease, systemic immuno‐modulatory treatment may be required. 16, 17 Recently, the first biologic therapy for eczema, dupilumab, was approved, and this can now be prescribed for adults and adolescents with moderate or severe eczema who have not responded or have contraindications to conventional systemic therapies. 18

Despite the high disease burden and multiple treatments available, a contemporary overview of UK primary care healthcare and treatment utilization patterns and trends in children and adults with eczema is lacking. We set out to describe healthcare utilization in people with eczema across the lifespan, including primary care attendances, specialist referrals, prescribing and, as a surrogate marker of moderate and severe eczema, treatment escalation patterns. 19

### Disease burden of primary biliary cholangitis and associated pruritus based on a cross-sectional US claims analysis [^116nif46]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

We observed a low (~7%) prevalence of pruritus in the overall PBC population. This is inconsistent with the published literature that reports approximately 50% of patients are affected at any given point after a PBC diagnosis and up to 75% are affected by it over the course of their disease. The lower prevalence of pruritus we observed may indicate that pruritus is under-reported in observational electronic healthcare databases. It is also possible that physicians may have prescribed a treatment for pruritus, without recording a pruritus diagnosis (discussed further below). The low prevalence of pruritus also highlights the possibility that pruritus remains under-recorded, and diagnosis may be limited to patients with more severe presentations. Nevertheless, the prevalence of pruritus was still significantly higher in the PBC population compared with non-cases.

A key finding of this study is the increased comorbid medical burden for patients with PBC and pruritus relative to non-cases, particularly for comorbidities with a major impact on HRQoL such as psychiatric conditions (depression or anxiety) as well as fatigue and sleep-related issues. The magnitude of difference in the prevalence of these conditions was greater in the PBC-pruritus subpopulation compared with broader PBC group; for example, fatigue was up to two-fold higher in the PBC-pruritus subpopulation and 1.5-fold higher in the broader PBC population versus non-cases. These findings are in agreement with a recently published review of the literature, which concluded that pruritus, fatigue, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders are the most frequently reported symptoms that patients with PBC experience, and these symptoms have a considerable negative impact on their HRQoL. However, it should be emphasised here that comparisons between the PBC population and the PBC-pruritus subpopulation are reported only for illustrative purposes, as any apparent differences between iSPRs may be attributable to differences in population structure of the two samples; however, the age-sex structure of the PBC and PBC-pruritus groups was broadly similar. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that our conclusion that patients with PBC and pruritus have an increased comorbid medical burden may be influenced by the fact that patients with more severe presentations of pruritus may have received the L29 code for pruritus (as noted above).

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^114RqM41]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Itch, also known as pruritus, is defined as an uncomfortable sensation that provokes an urge to scratch. It impairs the quality of life (QOL) of those experiencing itch and can be debilitating and even lethal when it becomes severe and/or chronic. Therefore, dermatologists and physicians who see patients with itch must be knowledgeable about it. This review will provide an overview of the pathophysiology and treatment strategies for itch, with a particular focus on itch with no underlying primary pruritic skin disease.

6 CUTANEOUS PRURITUS: ITCH WITH NO PRIMARY PRURITIC DERMATOSIS

Itch typically arises from inflamed skin, which may be the result of allergic inflammation or infectious skin (e.g. fungal, parasitic, and viral infections). On the other hand, a certain population of patients with itch present with uninflamed or normal‐appearing skin. These skin conditions may or may not result in secondary skin changes due to scratching. This itch condition is coined "cutaneous pruritus" in the Japanese Dermatological Association's guideline", pruritus with no underlying dermatosis", or "generalized pruritus without rash" if itch is generalized, in the British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the investigation and management of generalized pruritus in adults without an underlying dermatosis, 2018, and "pruritus on non‐diseased skin" in a position paper of the International Forum for the Study of Itch. The Japanese guideline further categorizes cutaneous pruritus into two phenotypes: generalized cutaneous pruritus and localized cutaneous pruritus. Generalized pruritus refers to presence of itch on a wide area of the body, while localized pruritus is defined as itch fixed and localized to a specific part of the body.

Hereinafter, the term cutaneous pruritus is used to describe itch without primary pruritic dermatosis and observable primary rash.

### Global skin disease morbidity and mortality: an update from the global burden of disease study 2013 [^117TPRDB]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Data points from the aforementioned literature search were analyzed in a Bayesian meta-regression modeling tool, DisMod-MR 2.0, to yield prevalence estimates that are consistent with the other available epidemiological parameters for each of the skin conditions. All estimates were generated with 1000 draws from the posterior distribution of the quantity of interest, which allows for generation of 95% uncertainty intervals. Compared with the previous GBD 2010 study, DisMod-MR was recoded and optimized to run up to 50 times faster and shifted from a negative binomial to an offset log-normal model.

The literature search for GBD 2013 compared with GBD 2010 doubled the data set for psoriasis with an additional 30 prevalence and 5 incidence studies. Psoriasis was also modeled with a smaller remission assumption (0.05–0.15 remitted cases per case per year), better reflecting a chronic disease pattern. Of note, the GBD definition of remission is the rate at which cases stop fulfilling the case definition, that is, cure. For cellulitis, 13 191 incidence data points from both inpatient and outpatient samples were added. No additional data sources were added for pyoderma in GBD 2013. However, duration of disease was decreased from approximately 1 year in GBD 2010 to between 2 weeks for treated disease to 4 weeks for untreated disease in GBD 2013. For fungal skin diseases, prevalence was estimated separately for tinea capitis and "other fungal skin diseases". Similarly, prevalences of viral warts and molluscum contagiosum were modeled separately and then summarized as "viral skin diseases". In GBD 2010, studies for "itch" were used as prevalence of pruritus, which inaccurately included cases of pruritic skin and nonskin conditions. Comparatively, GBD 2013 included only outpatient data from Norway and the United States and several data points from the literature of patients with a diagnosis of pruritus (excluding known causes of itch). While no additional data sources were added, acne vulgaris modeling in GBD 2013 no longer assumes that reported data include asymptomatic cases because most data points were based on examination and therefore would reflect symptomatic cases. For alopecia areata, GBD 2013 applied lower estimates from the largest data source (outpatient data from the United States). No new data sources for urticaria were added; however, similarly to the case for acne vulgaris, GBD 2013 urticaria data points reflect solely symptomatic cases. For decubitus ulcer, input data were incidence from hospital admission and outpatient data. In GBD 2010, implausible duration estimates led to an overestimate of prevalence, which has been corrected in GBD 2013. Global Burden of Disease 2013 set bounds on the remission rate from 0.5 to 6 corresponding to duration range of 2 months to 2 years.

### The epidemiology of eczema in children and adults in england: a population-based study using primary care data [^112UVN3j]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects around 200 million people world‐wide. 1, 2 The incidence of eczema has risen significantly over past decades, in particular in high‐income countries. 3 It most commonly develops in the first year of life, although onset can occur at any age. 4, 5 Eczema usually follows a chronic relapsing–remitting course, and maintaining disease control may require the use of ongoing treatment. 6

Whilst many eczema‐affected children will have resolution or improvement by late childhood, 4 a substantial proportion of people will have ongoing eczema into adulthood, and flare ups can occur even after long periods of remission. 5, 7 Itch, discomfort, and visible skin lesions result in disturbed sleep and social embarrassment and affect the quality of life of those affected and their families. 8 When moderate to severe, the psychological impact in children and adults is often profound. 9, 10, 11

In the United Kingdom (UK), prevalence estimates vary widely, especially in adults, and contemporary data on the factors influencing eczema development, such as urban environments, are lacking. Recent questionnaire‐based studies suggest prevalence rates of 2.5%‐15% in adults. 12, 13 Given that the majority of eczema patients are seen and treated in primary care in the UK, databases of electronic health records from general practitioner (GP) practices provide a rich data source from which epidemiological analyses can be derived. 14 In a recent study using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), approximately 500,000 people were identified as having eczema between 1998 and 2015, which scales to a UK prevalence of 10%. 15 However, this study was designed to assess cardiovascular outcomes in eczema not prevalence per se and only assessed the adult population. Another CPRD study was conducted to examine the incidence of eczema in children between 1997 and 2015 and found the highest incidence in those younger than 2 years of age (15.9 [95% CI 15.7–16.1] per 100 person‐years in males and 11.7 [11.5–11.8] in females) and the lowest incidence in those 5 years of age and older (0.4 [0.3–0.4] per 100 person‐years in males and 0.5 [0.5–0.5] in females). 16

### Global burden of atopic dermatitis: examining disease prevalence across pediatric and adult populations world-wide [^1116x42a]. Dermatologic Clinics (2024). Medium credibility.

Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a common, pruritic inflammatory skin disease associated with marked disease burden and substantial health care costs. AD does not discriminate between populations; prevalence estimates vary widely with most studies focusing on general or pediatric populations and a limited number of studies in adult populations solely. The costs of treating AD are staggering. Studies that examine differences in prevalence may be difficult to compare due to differences in study designs. However, understanding the prevalence of AD across populations is critical if we are to improve the lives of patients and caregivers living with this disease.

### Diagnosis and management of neuropathic itch [^115LVQ6i]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pruritus is a challenging condition that can be caused by injury or dysfunction in any part of the nervous system. A vast array of clinical pictures exist, including both localized and generalized pruritus, and their principal entities are described in this article. Diagnosis is often difficult and depends on patient history, imaging, and neurophysiologic studies. Other causes of chronic itch should be excluded. The management of neuropathic itch is demanding and the majority of interventions are not curative. The best treatment options include anticonvulsants, topical anesthetics, and capsaicin.

### Neuropathic pruritus [^115sNBgW]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Pruritus, also known as itch, is a very common, unpleasant sensation that elicits an urge to scratch. Its origin is not always in the skin, and neuropathic itch that is caused by neuronal or glial damage is common, but poorly understood by both dermatologists and neurologists. Although pruritus has not been considered as serious a symptom as pain, it is difficult to treat and — if chronic — can severely impair quality of life. Neuropathic itch is often associated with other clinical symptoms, most commonly neuropathic pain, and hypersensitization to stimuli is present in both pruritus and pain of neuropathic origin. The shared aetiology can aid in finding suitable treatment for itch in some cases, but more detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of itch, along with standardized, well-controlled trials, is needed. Pruritus research is an emerging but currently very active field, and our understanding of this sensation is rapidly increasing. Here, we review new discoveries regarding the role of the nervous system and the contribution of different pathways in pruritus, discuss the different aetiologies of neuropathic itch, and outline currently available and potential strategies for managing neuropathic pruritus.

### International comparisons of prevalence, awareness, and treatment of pruritus in people on hemodialysis [^113M6ehM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Uremic pruritus in patients on hemodialysis is associated with depression, lower quality of life, and mortality. We studied the prevalence, awareness, and treatment of pruritus to assess how well this important condition is currently managed internationally.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Data from 35,452 patients on hemodialysis in up to 17 countries from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study were analyzed to describe pruritus prevalence from 1996 to 2015. Data from 6256 patients and 268 medical directors in 17 countries in 2012–2015 were analyzed to describe predictors, effects, medical directors' awareness, and treatment of pruritus.

Results

Patients very much or extremely bothered by itching declined from 28% in 1996 to 18% in 2015. In 2012–2015, among patients nearly always or always bothered by itching, pruritus had a major effect on work and social life; 18% used no treatment for pruritus, and 17% did not report itching to health care staff. In total, 69% of medical directors underestimated the prevalence of pruritus in their unit. Managing high serum phosphorus and low Kt/V was ranked as the most important intervention, but no relationship was found between these factors and pruritus; 57% of medical directors used oral antihistamines for first-line chronic treatment of pruritus. Gabapentin was used by 45% as first-, second-, or third-line treatment. Nalfurafine was only used in Japan.

Conclusions

The prevalence of pruritus in people on hemodialysis is decreasing but remains underestimated. Large numbers of patients on hemodialysis with severe pruritus do not receive treatment. There is wide variation in the use of unlicensed medications for the treatment of pruritus. These data provide a benchmark for initiatives to improve the management of uremic pruritus.

### Pruritus in adult dermatomyositis [^114RxnCU]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis has a significant clinical component of pruritus that has not yet been studied. Pruritus can significantly affect the life of patients. The aim of the present work was to study the degree of pruritus experienced by patients. A four-question survey was sent to patients with documented dermatomyositis. The survey used a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to describe current, worst and daily pruritus, and the effect this has on daily activities. Twenty-six subjects returned completed questionnaires: four had no pruritus; the majority had a significant amount with means above 50 on the VAS. A mean of 44.6 was found for the effect on daily life. Further studies should be performed to examine the prevalence and severity of pruritus in this population and it's effect on their quality of life. Clinicians must be aware of the significant pruritus and provide adequate therapy to improve quality of life.

### Disease burden of primary biliary cholangitis and associated pruritus based on a cross-sectional US claims analysis [^115jERWC]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective cross-sectional study indicates that patients with PBC experience a significant burden from their disease, including a high prevalence of comorbidities, particularly psychiatric disorders, fatigue and sleep disturbance. Furthermore, these comorbidities were more common in the presence of pruritus.

Consistent with the literature, a female-to-male ratio of PBC cases of 9:1 was observed, with most cases between 55 and 64 years of age. By contrast, pruritus was more frequent (15%) in the youngest age group (18–34 years), and a considerable proportion of patients (~40%) in the PBC-pruritus subpopulation was in the 35–54 year age group, suggesting that patients can suffer with pruritus and its consequential impact on well-being and productivity for many years. An association between younger age and persistent high levels of pruritus has also been reported previously based on patient data in the UK.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of chronic widespread pain in the general population [^114w6cE2]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence estimates of low-risk studies were consistently between 10% and 15%. Prevalence estimates in females were around double those for males, whereas prevalence estimates generally plateaued in middle age (40–60 years). This matches the patterns of prevalence of primary care-recorded widespread pain consultationand nonspecific chronic pain.

European estimates of prevalence were slightly higher than those from North America. However, the number of North American studies was low and only 2 of these 6 studies were not in more specific populations. Smaller numbers of studies from other locations and diverse methodological approaches make comparisons between other regions difficult. There were some apparent cultural and socioeconomic differences in CWP prevalence. The 2 most extreme outliers for CWP prevalence included in the review represent select populations (considered to be representative of the general population in the geographical locale from which they were selected) rather than the wider general population. The highest estimate for prevalence is for a low socioeconomic population, whereas the lowest estimate is in a North American Indian trial population.

Four, studies found differences in CWP prevalence between ethnic or cultural groups. Although observed differences in prevalence in 2 of these studies may also be due to different approaches to data collectionand recruitment, this finding may offer some support for ethnic or cultural variation in CWP. Whether any differences in the experience of CWP are attributable to lifestyle, genetics, or sociocultural influences are unclear, and it is difficult to draw convincing conclusions based on evidence from only 4 studies. However, potential cultural differences in pain reporting should be considered during clinical history taking, and further research should investigate the extent and nature of ethnic, cultural, and regional variation in CWP prevalence, as this may offer insights into the aetiology or management of this condition.

### Chronic pruritus in the geriatric population [^116YY5cF]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus (> 6 week's duration) in the geriatric population (≥ 65 years old), is an increasing health care problem. The pathophysiologic predisposing factors are abnormalities of the epidermal barrier, immune system, and nervous system. Causes can be dichotomized into histaminergic and nonhistaminergic pruritus. Topical treatments are generally safe. Systemic treatments are chosen depending on the condition, comorbid diseases, and drug interactions. Treatment options are limited. Progress has been made in identifying itch-selective mediators over the last decade. Numerous new medications are currently undergoing clinical trials and they are anticipated to enter the clinics in the near future.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^115E9U5X]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Itch, also known as pruritus, is one of the most prevalent symptoms observed in dermatological practices. Itch frequently arises from primary pruritic dermatoses, although it may also manifest in the absence of a primary pruritic skin rash. The latter itchy condition is referred to as "cutaneous pruritus" in the Japanese guidelines published in 2020. Cutaneous pruritus can be classified into two categories based on its distribution: localized cutaneous pruritus and generalized cutaneous pruritus. Localized cutaneous pruritus is indicative of a neuropathic cause, whereas generalized cutaneous pruritus suggests underlying systemic disease(s), drug-induced itch, psychogenic itch (also known as functional itch disorder), or chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO). Systemic diseases associated with cutaneous pruritus include disorders of iron metabolism, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease (especially cholestasis), endocrine/metabolic diseases, hematological disorders, and malignant solid tumors. CPUO is a term used to describe chronic itch that is often generalized and for which no underlying cause can be identified despite a comprehensive and careful diagnostic workup. A variety of treatment approaches are available for cutaneous pruritus, including device-based physical therapies (such as phototherapy) and medications that act on the itch-perception processing pathway from the skin, peripheral sensory nerves, the spinal cord, to the brain. This review presents an overview of the current knowledge regarding cutaneous pruritus, from its underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms to the diagnostic procedures and treatment approaches that are currently available.

### Prevalence, patient burden and physicians' perception of pruritus in haemodialysis patients [^113qM3Dv]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

In our study, we assessed the prevalence of CKD-aP by validated tools in a contemporary cohort of HD patients. The overall prevalence was comparable to historical international figures, but high-intensity pruritus is less frequent but still massively impacts QoL. Austrian nephrologists estimated the prevalence reasonably well, with a slight overestimation of severe pruritus. The high awareness of CKD-aP in Austrian nephrologists may explain the lower prevalence of more severe pruritus. Risk factors for moderate–severe pruritus were higher CRP and PTH values.

### Chronic urticaria [^111u5XWi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic urticaria:

- **Definition**: Chronic spontaneous urticaria is a persistent pruritic disorder defined by recurrent wheals, angioedema, or both occurring most days for more than 6 weeks without an external trigger. Symptoms are mediated by transient, localized dermal edema and sensory nerve activation and substantially impair QoL.
- Pathophysiology: Dermal mast cells are central drivers; their degranulation releases histamine, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor, and cytokines that increase vascular permeability and recruit eosinophils, basophils, T cells and neutrophils. Two immune endotypes are recognized: an IgE-driven "autoallergic" mechanism with IgE autoantibodies to self antigens, and a type IIb autoimmune mechanism with IgG anti-FcεRI or anti-IgE that activates mast cells and complement; additional contributors include coagulation pathway activation, cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-33, and MRGPRX2-mediated non-IgE mast cell activation.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of chronic urticaria in the US is estimated at 230 cases per 100,000 adults.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for chronic urticaria include autoimmune disorders and a history of acute urticaria. Certain triggers or exacerbating factors, such as drugs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics), can also induce urticaria.
- Disease course: Onset is usually abrupt after a latency period and the course is heterogeneous: many patients remit within months but a substantial fraction experience years of intermittent flares; angioedema occurs in roughly 40–50% and may dominate the clinical picture. Disease activity is assessed clinically (UAS7) and by biomarkers that correlate with severity or treatment response, for example low total IgE and basopenia with type IIb disease and elevated D-dimer or CRP with more active disease.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chronic spontaneous urticaria is typically self-limited, with most patients improving within months to a few years, though some experience prolonged or recurrent disease. Severe activity, angioedema, autoimmune features, and elevated inflammatory markers predict a slower response and greater chronicity. Mortality is negligible, but persistent symptoms can markedly affect QoL, requiring long-term monitoring and individualized treatment.

### Chronic pruritus: a review [^116x5fUR]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic pruritus, defined as itch experienced for 6 weeks or longer, affects approximately 22% of people in their lifetime. Approximately 1% of physician visits are for the chief concern of chronic pruritus. Chronic pruritus is associated with adverse outcomes, including impaired sleep and reduced quality of life.

Observations

Chronic pruritus can be categorized by etiology into inflammatory, neuropathic, or a combination of inflammatory and neuropathic pruritus. Chronic pruritus is due to inflammation in approximately 60% of patients and may be caused by eczema, psoriasis, or seborrheic dermatitis. Chronic pruritus is due to a neuropathic or mixed etiology in approximately 25% of patients. Neuropathic causes of chronic pruritus include postherpetic neuralgia and notalgia paresthetica and are typically due to localized or generalized nerve dysregulation. Approximately 15% of people with chronic pruritus have other causes including systemic diseases with secondary itch, such as uremic pruritus and cholestatic pruritus, medication-induced pruritus such as pruritus due to immunotherapy, and infectious etiologies such as tinea corporis and scabies. When few primary changes are present, a thorough history, review of symptoms, and laboratory evaluation should be performed, particularly for people with chronic pruritus lasting less than 1 year. Clinicians should consider the following tests: complete blood cell count, complete metabolic panel, and thyroid function testing to evaluate for hematologic malignancy, liver disease, kidney disease, or thyroid disease. First-line treatment for inflammatory chronic pruritus includes topical anti-inflammatory therapies such as hydrocortisone (2.5%), triamcinolone (0.1%), or tacrolimus ointment. Approximately 10% of patients do not respond to topical therapies. In these patients, referral to dermatology and systemic oral or injectable treatments such as dupilumab or methotrexate may be considered. When no underlying systemic disease associated with pruritus is identified, patients are likely to have neuropathic chronic pruritus or mixed etiology such as chronic pruritus of unknown origin. In these patients, neuropathic topical treatments such as menthol, pramoxine, or lidocaine can be used either alone or in combination with immunomodulatory agents such as topical steroids. Other effective therapies for neuropathic pruritus include gabapentin, antidepressants such as sertraline or doxepin, or opioid receptor agonist/antagonists such as naltrexone or butorphanol.

Conclusions and Relevance

Chronic pruritus can adversely affect quality of life and can be categorized into inflammatory, neuropathic, or a combined etiology. First-line therapies are topical steroids for inflammatory causes, such as hydrocortisone (2.5%) or triamcinolone (0.1%); topical neuropathic agents for neuropathic causes, such as menthol or pramoxine; and combinations of these therapies for mixed etiologies of chronic pruritus.

### Novel approach to unpleasant symptom clusters surrounding pruritus in patients with chronic kidney disease and on dialysis therapy [^113dHmTA]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

People suffering from end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), also known as stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD), experience a high burden of symptoms, which markedly impair their physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as well as their ability to perform everyday activities. People with ESKD who require hemodialysis for renal replacement therapy value the reduction of their symptom burden over prolonged survival, illustrating the devastating impact these symptoms have on their lives. Hence, the proactive identification and alleviation of symptoms are critical to the holistic management of these individuals. CKD-associated pruritus (CKD-aP; previously known as uremic pruritus) is a frequent and burdensome symptom reported by patients with CKD, and often worsens as CKD progresses to ESKD requiring renal replacement therapy.

Symptom burden among people with ESKD on hemodialysis is high and symptom presentation is often complex. CKD-aP rarely occurs in isolation and is often a cause of distress to patients undergoing dialysis. In most cases, CKD-aP occurs in a constellation with other debilitating symptoms that have synergistic effects on one another and amplify patients' suffering. When two or more symptoms co-occur and are related, they are known as a symptom cluster. Because individual symptoms are related, they may share a common biological mechanism that can be targeted for intervention. Thus, targeting one symptom in the cluster for intervention may have an effect on other symptoms in a given symptom cluster. However, symptom cluster science across the spectrum of CKD is in its infancy and more research is needed to untangle the complex relationships between symptoms and patient outcomes. Identification of symptom clusters among patients with ESKD undergoing dialysis may help inform symptom assessment, risk-stratification, and development of patient-centered interventions to reduce symptom burden, thereby reducing the negative impact on patient HRQoL.

Here, we review the clinical impact of CKD-aP on co-occurring symptoms and important patient outcomes, including HRQoL, risk for infections, hospitalizations and mortality, in patients with ESKD undergoing dialysis. The potential clinical benefits of alleviating CKD-aP and the potential effects on other symptoms will also be discussed.

### Chronic pruritus in the absence of specific skin disease: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy [^112tTwvW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus is a major and distressing symptom of many cutaneous and systemic diseases and can significantly impair the patient's quality of life. Pruritus perception is the final result of a complex network involving dedicated nerve pathways and brain areas, and an increasing number of peripheral and central mediators are thought to be involved. Itch is associated with most cutaneous disorders and, in these circumstances, its management overlaps with that of the skin disease. Itch can also occur without associated skin diseases or primary skin lesions, but only with nonspecific lesions secondary to rubbing or scratching. Chronic itch with no or minimal skin changes can be secondary to important diseases, such as neurologic disorders, chronic renal failure, cholestasis, systemic infections, malignancies, and endocrine disorders, and may also result from exposure to some drugs. The search for the cause of pruritus usually requires a meticulous step-by-step assessment involving careful history taking as well as clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Few evidence-based treatments for pruritus are available. Topical therapy, oral histamine H(1) receptor antagonists, and phototherapy with UV radiation can target pruritus elicitation in the skin, whereas antiepileptic drugs, opioid receptor antagonists, and antidepressants can block signal processing in the CNS.

### Diagnostic and treatment algorithm for chronic nodular prurigo [^116rGcZn]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic nodular prurigo (CNPG) is a subtype of chronic prurigo, also called prurigo nodularis, and a chronic skin condition characterized by intensely pruritic nodular lesions. Although the exact cause of CNPG is unknown, it appears to result from a repetitive itch-scratch cycle induced by neuronal sensitization to chronic pruritus. CNPG is associated with an underlying dermatologic condition in about half of patients, and it can also be attributed to systemic, neurologic, psychogenic, or unknown causes. For most patients, multiple underlying causes are identified. Patients with CNPG often experience impaired quality of life, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression. To encourage consistent and accurate diagnosis and treatment of CNPG across regions, we are proposing a diagnostic and treatment algorithm that includes initial assessment of core symptoms, detailed dermatologic history and clinical examination, patient-reported outcomes, diagnostic workup, and recommended therapies. This information is supplemented with photographs to illustrate clinical appearance and disease severity. Because CNPG is often multifactorial and it can take months to years for lesions to heal, interdisciplinary cooperation and long-term management are important.

### Practice gaps in pruritus [^112dGSgR]. Dermatologic Clinics (2016). Low credibility.

There are several practice gaps in the evaluation and management of itch. These gaps include a dearth of objective measures of itch, infrequent use of validated patient-reported outcomes for itch, non-evidence-based treatment, and lack of consensus about the ideal workup for generalized itch. The present article reviews these gaps and presents potential solutions.

### Transformation of 5-D itch scale and numerical rating scale in chronic hemodialysis patients [^115rak2L]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pruritus is one of the most common and frustrating symptoms in hemodialysis (HD) patients with a prevalence of approximately 36–50%. Pruritus is associated with not only impaired quality of life but also high psychological burden. Because Pruritus is a subjective experience, it is difficult to measure Pruritus objectively. Many assessments of pruritus are currently available, including unidimensional, multidimensional, and other scales (Table 1) but none of them is accepted by most experts as a gold standard. A reliable measurement of pruritus intensity is critical for studies assessing the efficacy of antipruritic treatment. It is generally accepted that at least two different measurements should be used to access pruritus intensity in clinical studies.

Table 1
Summary of measurements of pruritus in the literature

Multidimensional scales not only access pruritus intensity but measure the impact of pruritus on patients' quality of life. Commonly used multidimensional scales include the pruritus grading system, the 5-D itch scale, and the itch severity scale. The 5-D itch scale was published in 2010 and was validated with Numerical rating scale (NRS) in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus, skin, liver, or kidney disease. The 5-D itch scale, sensitive to the changes of pruritus with time, is a brief, single paged, multidimensional quantification of pruritus. NRS, an unidimensional scale, which may be the most widely used is a validated measurement of UP in HD patients. Pruritus intensity measured using NRS can be categorized into no (0 point), mild (1–3 points), moderate (4–6 points), severe (7–8 points), and very severe pruritus (≥ 9 points). However, information regarding the 5-D itch scale categories on uremic pruritus is currently not available. The aim of the study is to investigate the 5-D itch scale categories based on NRS categories in HD patients. The information found will enable comparisons of the pruritus intensity and prevalence of pruritus among studies using different score systems. This information would make contribution to bioinformatics researches.

### Five-year malignancy incidence in patients with chronic pruritus: a population-based cohort study aimed at limiting unnecessary screening practices [^116cdMVm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of malignancy in patients with chronic pruritus and nondiseased skin is unknown.

Objective

We sought to assess the hazard ratio (HR) of incident overall malignancy and incident malignancy by subtype in patients with chronic pruritus during the 5 years after diagnosis.

Methods

A population-based cohort study was performed in the Health Improvement Network. In all, 8744 patients with chronic pruritus were matched with 31,580 patients without chronic pruritus based on sex, age, and practice. Primary outcomes were HR of incident malignancy and HR of malignancy subtypes.

Results

The fully adjusted HR for incident malignancy in patients with chronic pruritus was 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.98–1.33). The fully adjusted HR for incident hematologic malignancy and incident bile duct malignancy in patients with chronic pruritus was 2.02 (95% confidence interval 1.48–2.75) and 3.73 (95% confidence interval 1.55–8.97), respectively. The incidence of hematologic malignancy and cholangiocarcinoma in patients with chronic pruritus was 0.0016 and 0.0003 per person-year, respectively.

Limitations

Potential for misclassification and detection biases is a limitation.

Conclusions

Chronic pruritus without concomitant skin changes is a risk factor for having undiagnosed hematologic and bile duct malignancies, but not other malignancies. The overall incidence of these malignancies in patients with chronic pruritus is very low.

### Prevalence of chronic hand eczema in adults: a cross-sectional survey of over 60 000 respondents from the general population of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK [^112w9JZy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The lack of attention paid to chronic hand eczema (CHE) and the lack of a specific International Classification of Diseases code for it may have limited assessment of its prevalence. To date, prevalence estimates have primarily been derived from (partly small) single-country studies.

Objectives

To estimate the annual prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosed CHE across sociodemographic characteristics in adults living in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.

Methods

In the observational Chronic Hand Eczema epidemiology, Care, and Knowledge of real-life burden (CHECK) study, a questionnaire was administered to adults aged 18–69years in the general population, recruited through online panels. Quotas and minor weighting adjustments were performed to ensure that the participants were representative of the general population with regard to sex, age, region, employment status, urban/rural setting and - in the UK only - ethnicity. Additional weights were applied to account for population size differences when aggregating country results. Information on self-reported physician-diagnosed CHE was collected. CHE was defined, in accordance with the European Society of Contact Dermatitis, as having had hand eczema continuously for ≥ 3months or at least two flares in the past 12months. The annual prevalence of CHE was determined for each country, and by subgroups of sex, age, employment and urban/rural setting.

Results

Of 60 131 participants, 2847 self-reported physician-diagnosed CHE, yielding an annual prevalence of 4.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6–4.9]. Subgroup analyses revealed that the prevalence of CHE was significantly higher in women than in men [5.6% (95% CI 5.4–5.9) vs. 3.8% (95% CI 3.6–4.1); P < 0.001], in employed vs. unemployed people [5.3% (95% CI 5.1–5.6) vs. 3.3% (95% CI 3.1–3.6); P < 0.001] and in urban vs. rural residents [5.0% (95% CI 4.8–5.2) vs. 3.7% (95% CI 3.4–4.1); P < 0.001). Prevalence was highest in those aged 30–39years (6.5%, 95% CI 6.0–7.0) and lowest in those aged 60–69years (2.6%, 95% CI 2.3–3.0).

Conclusions

This large multinational study is the first to assess the prevalence of CHE in Europe and Canada using a consistent definition across a broad geographical population. This study reveals that CHE is a common skin disease with annual prevalence of 4.7%, with a higher prevalence in women, people aged 30–39, employed people and those living in urban areas.

### Atopic dermatitis beyond eczema: a review on its systemic impact through pruritus and associated comorbidities [^113FXKR6]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease, traditionally recognized for its defining eczematous lesions. However, the implications of atopic dermatitis extend far beyond eczema itself. Increasing understanding of the disease has enabled a more accurate characterization of its burden, including structural and functional skin alterations as well as various systemic comorbidities. This review examines the impact of the disease, beginning with the neuroimmune pathways underlying pruritus and its psychosocial burden, and progressing to the current concepts surrounding the atopic march and the broader spectrum of inflammatory or immune-mediated non-atopic comorbidities, including the emerging discussion on its similarities and differences with psoriasis. Special attention has been given to literature published from 2015 onwards. Ultimately, this review aims to deepen the understanding of the systemic nature of atopic dermatitis, providing a broader conceptual framework for assessing disease extent and severity.

### Pharmacological interventions for pruritus in adult palliative care patients [^116krQUD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane review published in 2013 (Issue 6). Pruritus occurs in patients with disparate underlying diseases and is caused by different pathologic mechanisms. In palliative care patients, pruritus is not the most prevalent but is one of the most puzzling symptoms. It can cause considerable discomfort and affects patients' quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different pharmacological treatments for preventing or treating pruritus in adult palliative care patients.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), and MEDLINE (OVID) up to 9 June 2016 and Embase (OVID) up to 7 June 2016. In addition, we searched trial registries and checked the reference lists of all relevant studies, key textbooks, reviews and websites, and we contacted investigators and specialists in pruritus and palliative care regarding unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of different pharmacological treatments, compared with a placebo, no treatment, or an alternative treatment, for preventing or treating pruritus in palliative care patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the identified titles and abstracts, performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias and methodological quality. We summarised the results descriptively and quantitatively (meta-analyses) according to the different pharmacological interventions and the diseases associated with pruritus. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created 10 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

In total, we included 50 studies and 1916 participants in the review. We added 10 studies with 627 participants for this update. Altogether, we included 39 different treatments for pruritus in four different patient groups. The overall risk of bias profile was heterogeneous and ranged from high to low risk. However, 48 studies (96%) had a high risk of bias due to low sample size (i.e. fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm). Using GRADE criteria, we downgraded our judgement on the quality of evidence to moderate in seven and to low in three comparisons for our primary outcome (pruritus), mainly due to imprecision and risk of bias. In palliative care participants with pruritus of different nature, the treatment with the drug paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, reduced pruritus by 0.78 points (numerical analogue scale from 0 to 10; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.19 to -0.37; one RCT, N = 48, quality of evidence: moderate) compared to placebo. For participants suffering from uraemic pruritus (UP), gabapentin was more effective than placebo (visual analogue scale (VAS): 0 to 10), mean difference (MD) -5.91, 95% CI -6.87 to -4.96; two RCTs, N = 118, quality of evidence: moderate). The κ-opioid receptor agonist nalfurafine showed amelioration of UP (VAS 0 to 10, MD -0.95, 95% CI -1.32 to -0.58; three RCTs, N = 422, quality of evidence: moderate) and only few adverse events. Moreover, cromolyn sodium relieved UP participants from pruritus by 2.94 points on the VAS (0 to 10) (95% CI -4.04 to -1.83; two RCTs, N = 100, quality of evidence: moderate) compared to placebo. In participants with cholestatic pruritus (CP), data favoured rifampin (VAS: 0 to 100, MD -24.64, 95% CI -31.08 to -18.21; two RCTs, N = 42, quality of evidence: low) and flumecinol (RR > 1 favours treatment group; RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.39; two RCTs, N = 69, quality of evidence: low) and showed a low incidence of adverse events in comparison with placebo. The opioid antagonist naltrexone reduced pruritus for participants with CP (VAS: 0 to 10, MD -2.26, 95% CI -3.19 to -1.33; two RCTs, N = 52, quality of evidence: moderate) compared to placebo. However, effects in participants with UP were inconclusive (percentage difference -12.30%, 95% CI -25.82% to 1.22%, one RCT, N = 32). Furthermore, large doses of opioid antagonists (e.g. naltrexone) could be inappropriate in palliative care patients because of the risk of reducing analgesia. For participants with HIV-associated pruritus, it is uncertain whether drug treatment with hydroxyzine hydrochloride, pentoxifylline, triamcinolone or indomethacin reduces pruritus because the evidence was of very low quality (e.g. small sample size, lack of blinding).

Authors' Conclusions

Different interventions tended to be effective for CP and UP. However, therapies for patients with malignancies are still lacking. Due to the small sample sizes in most meta-analyses and the heterogeneous methodological quality of the included trials, the results should be interpreted cautiously in terms of generalisability.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^113zeGzM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — definition and epidemiology: CU is defined as urticaria that has been continuously or intermittently present for at least 6 weeks. The prevalence of CU in the general population has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 5%, although true point, cumulative, and lifetime prevalence have not been established; the incidence of CU has been estimated at 1.46 per year. The duration varies considerably, with physical urticarias tending to persist the longest, and some patients with CU might have urticaria and angioedema occurring simultaneously or separately; activation of the coagulation cascade, including increased prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 and D-dimer levels, has been described.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^114Ay6MS]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 TERMINOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION OF ITCH

Various classifications of itch have been proposed based on such criterion as the duration of the condition, the underlying pathogenesis, the causes, the affected areas, and its characteristics (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Classifications of itch.

2.1 Acute itch and chronic itch

Itch that persists for a duration of fewer than 6 weeks is classified as acute itch. Chronic itch is itch that lasts for 6 weeks and more.

2.2 Chemical itch and mechanical itch

The majority of itching sensation occurs when sensory nerve fibers are activated by a single or combination of substances known as pruritogens (Table 2). Furthermore, innocuous mechanical force can elicit itching sensation, particularly in patients with chronic itch. The former type of itch is referred to as chemical itch and the latter is designated as mechanical itch.

TABLE 2
Pruritogens and their receptors.

2.3 Histaminergic itch and nonhistaminergic itch

Itch‐conveying sensory nerve fibers in the skin can be divided into two subsets: histaminergic nerves and nonhistaminergic nerves. Histaminergic nerves express histamine receptor H1R and are responsible for histamine‐induced itch. Nonhistaminergic nerves show responsiveness to pruritogens other than histamine, leading to nonhistaminergic itch.

2.4 Inflammatory itch and neuropathic itch

Itching sensation is usually associated with inflammatory conditions, particularly allergic inflammation (e.g. atopic dermatitis, urticaria, and contact dermatitis). The presence of inflammation facilitates the secretion of pruritogen from various types of cells. Secreted pruritogens then act on sensory nerve fibers, resulting in itching. This type of itch is referred to as inflammatory itch. On the other hand, some types of itching sensation do not necessarily arise from this inflammation‐pruritogen axis. Itch‐conveying nerve fibers may autonomically generate electrical impulses for some reasons (e.g. damage, inflammation, degeneration, and/or dysfunction of nerve fibers) even in the absence of apparent inflammation, resulting in itching on their innervated site(s). This itch is called neuropathic itch.

2.5 Generalized itch and localized itch

The term generalized itch is used to describe the presence of itching sensation across the body. Localized itch represents fixed itch localized to the specific part of the body.

### Factors mediating the impact of chronic pruritus on quality of life [^117Dy3Zv]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Chronic pruritus is a common problem with a deleterious effect on quality of life. The factors mediating the relationship between chronic pruritus and quality of life are poorly understood.

Objective

To determine the factors that mediate the impact of chronic pruritus on quality of life.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study based on a nationwide telephone survey of US military veterans sampled from the Veterans Hospital Patient Database. Participants were veterans who agreed to participate and were found to have chronic pruritus.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Statistical significance of predictor variables (characteristics of patients and their chronic pruritus) in multivariate analysis using ItchyQoL scores as response variables.

Results

Of 6000 veterans telephoned, 1075 consented to participate; 405 of these had chronic pruritus. Factors that mediated the impact of chronic pruritus on quality of life were demographic characteristics (age [P = 0.007], race [P = 0.05], marital status [P = 0.04]), personality (extroversion [P = 0.03], neuroticism [P = 0.01]), pruritus characteristics (severity [P < .001], duration [P = 0.01], frequency [P < .001], location [P = 0.005]), and possible etiology (cutaneous vs systemic [P = 0.03]). Notable factors not found significant include sex (P = 0.98) and socioeconomic variables (education level [P > .99], employment status [P = 0.53], income [P = 0.62]).

Conclusions and Relevance

The multitude of factors that significantly influence the impact of chronic pruritus on quality of life demonstrates the complex nature of this relationship. A better appreciation of these factors will improve the clinical evaluation and treatment of chronic pruritus.

### Laboratory and dialysis characteristics in hemodialysis patients suffering from chronic itch – results from a representative cross-sectional study [^113GhnHP]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

GEHIS (German Epidemiological Hemodialysis Itch Study) is a cross-sectional study that investigated 860 hemodialysis (HD) patients from a randomly selected cluster-sample (considering the regional distribution of dialysis units in Germany) aiming to identify different prevalence estimates of chronic itch. According to the international classification, chronic itch (CI) is defined as itch lasting for 6 weeks and longer. This classification had never been applied in a cohort of hemodialysis patients except for GEHIS. Our first analyses revealed that CI affects 25.2% (point prevalence) of HD patients. 35.2% reported to have suffered from chronic itch (CI) at least once in their life (lifetime prevalence) and 27.2% reported CI within the past 12 months. CI was significantly less prevalent in patients with an etiology of secondary glomerulonephritis. There was a significant association of the time since HD treatment started and the occurrence of CI. General health status and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were significantly more impaired in those suffering from CI. All this demonstrates that CI in HD patients is a frequent, long-lasting burden significantly impairing patient's health.

The role of comorbidities in the occurrence of itch in HD patients is unclear and has so far only been investigated for selected comorbidities. Single studies investigated some abnormalities of laboratory parameters in HD patients suffering from itch e.g. parathormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus, but the role of them in the occurrence and the intensity of CI in HD patients is still unclear. So far, there is no systematic investigation on dialyzer membrane use and the development of CI. Smaller studies hint to conflicting results regarding the role of dialyzer membranes. The current analyses investigated possible associations of medical (etiology of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), comorbidities), laboratory and dialysis characteristics (time, duration, dialyzer membrane, anticoagulation) with the occurrence and characteristics of CI.

### Itch: epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic workup [^111XYUnR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Itch, or pruritus, is the uncomfortable sensation underlying the desire to scratch. Itch is a very common complaint in the general population that can result from dermatologic, systemic (eg, renal, hepatobiliary, endocrine), paraneoplastic, neuropathic, and psychogenic etiologies. Chronic itch is associated with significant sleep disturbances and profoundly reduces overall quality of life. Certain populations, including elderly and African Americans, are at increased risk of experiencing heightened burden of itch. Because of the variable clinical presentation and wide-ranging etiologies, itch presents a challenge for clinicians. The initial evaluation should include a complete blood count, with differential, hepatic, renal, and thyroid function testing along with diabetes screening. Further testing should be guided by history and physical examination findings. There should be a heightened concern for underlying malignancy in individuals older than 60 years of age who have a history of liver disease and diffuse itch less than 12 months of duration. For individuals with chronic pruritus of unknown origin, increased blood eosinophils may serve as a biomarker of T helper cell type 2 polarization and response to immunomodulator therapies. In this first part of a 2-part continuing medical education series, we describe the broader epidemiology and specific conditions associated with itch and the clinical presentation and diagnostic workup for patients with itch.

### Prevalence of pruritus associated with hemodialysis and its association with sleep quality among hemodialysis patients: a multicenter study [^117Mzw9B]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pruritus is one of the main skin complaints and one of the most common skin problems. It is defined as an irritating skin sensation that can affect the quality of life. Some studies show that there is a significant presence of people suffering from pruritus in the general population with a risk of 7% yearly of having it at least once in life. Moreover, there are many causes of pruritus worldwide classified as dermatological or nondermatological, such as systemic, psychiatric, neurological, or drug reactions. And, it is associated with them in different percentages, ranging from a quarter in hemodialysis (HD) patients to almost all patients with dermatologic diseases such as urticaria and atopic dermatitis (AD).

The pathophysiology of CKD-associated pruritus (chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus) is still not known and is supposed to be a multifactorial problem depending on demographic, neuropathic, and psychogenic factors. During hemodialysis, many substances are produced from white blood cells, such as interleukin-1, which is released immediately after contact with a dialysis machine and membranes; interleukin-1 is thought to be one of the biological causes of pruritus.

CKD-associated pruritus is a prevalent and annoying complication that HD patients suffer from, which has a laborious effect on their quality of life. As it happens more frequently at night, it also affects sleep quality. Unfortunately, it is quite often ignored in hemodialysis patients, leading to a worsening of symptoms over time. Furthermore, HD patients who developed CKD-associated pruritus experienced delays in sleep and awakening. In 2019, a meta-analysis and systematic review revealed that the likelihood of sleep disturbances was 40% (95% CI = 0.30 to 0.49).

The evaluation of pruritus using patient-reported outcomes is a priority for the patient, as there are no universally accepted biomarkers or objective measures of itch. Similarly, evaluating sleep quality is equally important since patient-reported outcomes reflect the patient's perception of their health and are associated with quality of life. In fact, pre-dialysis and hemodialysis patients have significant burden symptoms (i.e. pain), which leads to poor sleep and reduced quality of life. Furthermore, several previous analyses have shown that pruritus and insomnia are associated with poor quality of life. Therefore, research to determine the prevalence and severity of pruritus and sleep is very important to guide future interventions.

### Prevalence and influencing factors of pruritus in maintenance hemodialysis patients in China: a meta-analysis [^111XGQ7y]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, cohort studies by international researchers have reported an incidence of CKD-ap ranging from 40 to 90% in MHD patients and from 19 to 29% in non-MHD patients. However, clinical workers often overlook the adverse effects and burdens caused by CKD-ap in MHD patients. Recent foreign studies have indicated that the incidence of moderate to severe CKD-ap is approximately 40%. In recent years, more attention has been paid to CKD-ap, with European countries such as Spain and France developing interventions and treatment methods to prevent or reduce its occurrence. Chinese studies on MHD patients have revealed that approximately 78% of MHD patients have CKD-ap, and 49.22% of them suffer from moderate to severe CKD-ap. According to some scholars, the incidence of CKD-ap in Chinese MHD patients ranges from 20 to 98%, which is significantly higher compared to that reported in other studies. This discrepancy may be attributed to the insufficient attention to CKD-ap in MHD patients in China, coupled with a lack of clinical trials and interventions. Consequently, treatment often only commences after symptoms appear, highlighting a lack of awareness regarding CKD-ap prevention. Therefore, clarifying the incidence of CKD-ap in Chinese patients with MHD and its associated factors is crucial for improving skin management and the quality of life of t this patient population. Currently, numerous related studies exist; however, they show significant discrepancies in results due to differences in sample size, region, and assessment tools. To this end, the present meta-analysis was conducted to systematically evaluate CKD-ap prevalence and its associated factors in Chinese MHD patients, aiming to inform future preventive strategies.

### Pruritus in systemic disease: mechanisms and management [^111MxdNa]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

Pruritus is the most common symptom of skin disease. Even in the absence of primary cutaneous findings, severe and extensive pruritus often is associated with systemic disease. This review considers briefly the physiology of pruritus and discusses the various systemic diseases often accompanied by this bothersome symptom. In addition to exploring the possible mechanisms and potential therapies of itching in selected disorders, this review presents general recommendations for evaluating patients with unexplained pruritus and management guidelines for alleviating their discomfort.

### Pruritus [^1155NkQ4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2012). Low credibility.

Health-related quality of life (QoL) is a patient-reported outcome that describes the impact of the disease in question to all aspects of persons' life, including psychosocial, emotional, physical, and functional impact. As such, health-related QoL is particularly relevant in conditions that have no physical signs and need to rely on patient reports to know whether they are improving or not. Work is beginning in pruritus to develop instruments that can measure pruritus-related QoL. This article reviews the instruments that have been developed and used in pruritus and also reviews the literature regarding the impact of pruritus on QoL.

### Gender differences in chronic pruritus: women present different morbidity, more scratch lesions and higher burden [^113CZNet]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although sex and gender are increasingly perceived as important factors in medicine, there is only very little knowledge on these issues in patients with chronic pruritus (CP).

Objectives

The aim of this retrospective study was to compare multiple parameters of CP in a large representative group of patients and to assess any sex and gender differences.

Methods

Patients (n = 1037, 54.8% women) with CP (> 6 weeks' duration) were analysed concerning gender differences in multiple parameters, including quality of life, CP-underlying diseases, co-morbidities and clinics. We used McNemar tests for dependent variables, and χ(2) tests and t-tests for independent variables, to evaluate gender-specific differences.

Results

Men were significantly older (P < 0.001) than women and had significantly more often cardiovascular (P < 0.001) and urogenital (P < 0.0001) co-morbidities, a higher number of co-medications (P = 0.041), and more often dermatological and systemic diseases leading to CP. Women had more neuropathic and psychosomatic diseases underlying the CP. They significantly more often showed a worsening of the CP by emotional (P = 0.002) and psychosomatic factors (P = 0.046). Women reported more often on localized itching occurring in attacks, with stinging, warmth and painful qualities (P < 0.05). Women significantly more often showed chronic scratch lesions and prurigo nodularis (P = 0.001), in contrast to men who significantly more frequently had CP on noninflamed skin (P = 0.004). In addition, women obtained higher visual analogue scale scores (P = 0.031) and reported a higher impact on quality of life (P = 0.033) than men.

Conclusions

There are gender-specific differences not only in the quality, localization and triggering of CP but also in the underlying disease and scratching behaviour. These facts must be taken into account in the medical care of patients with CP and when conducting any kind of clinical research on itch. Further research is needed to achieve a gender-specific and gender-adapted diagnostics and treatment of CP.

### Psychogenic itch [^112zrCm7]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The burden of itch

Like pain, nausea or asphyxiation, itch can cause major suffering. A large epidemiological study (4995 participants) of the burden of common skin conditions in dermatological patients across Europeshowed that compared with participants who did not report itch, those who reported itch showed more limitations on the European Quality of life-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ5D, a generic instrument) and a larger impact on the dermatology life quality index (DLQI), 60% vs 25%. The negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) resulting from chronic itch increases with the intensity of the pruritus. This relationship is not necessarily a linear one but is dependent on various factors, such as body site, coping abilities, and personality.

The negative impact of itch on quality of life has consequences on mental health. Many studies have found a positive association between itch and depression scores. Patients who scored high on a depression scale, also scored higher for itch intensity than patients, who scored low in depression scales.

Anxiety and depression are consequences of itch as well as aggravating factors for itch condition and scratching. Psychogenic factors frequently enhance somatic sensations, such as pruritus or painand neither psychogenic nor organic pruritus could exist in a pure form. Hence, the broad majority of patients with pruritus suffer from a somatic disease and their symptoms can be modulated by psychological factors, such as depression or anxiety. Nonetheless, some patients have a specific psychogenic pruritus.

### Incidence and prevalence of prurigo nodularis and associated comorbidities in Denmark from 1998 to 2021 [^115GtQhJ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic skin condition characterized by intense itching from nodular skin lesions. Despite its impact on patients' quality of life, limited data exist on its epidemiology.

Objectives

To estimate the incidence and prevalence of hospital-diagnosed PN and to explore the burden of associated comorbidities.

Methods

A national register-based study in Denmark was conducted using data from Danish national health registers to determine the incidence and prevalence of PN diagnosed in hospitals from 1998 to 2021 and to explore the occurrence of comorbidities.

Results

In total, we identified 1209 individuals diagnosed with PN. The mean age of onset was 45years, with a female predominance of 58% (696/1209). The prevalence of PN increased over the studied period, reaching 14.1 per 100 000 individuals by 2021. Comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease had higher odds ratios preceding the diagnosis of PN, whereas the odds ratios for atopic dermatitis, mood disorders and depressive disorders increased following the onset of PN.

Conclusion

The findings indicate a significant association between PN and various comorbidities, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary care. The increase in prevalence suggests a growing burden of disease. Although the study may underestimate the true prevalence of PN because of reliance on hospital records, it reveals a rising rate prevalence of PN and associated comorbidities in Denmark. The observed high prevalence of mental health problems in individuals with PN should be a focus of concern for the treating physicians.

### End-stage renal disease chronic itch and its management [^1157j8ZU]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease chronic itch is a frequent symptom that bothers patients with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease. The pathogenesis of the chronic itch symptom is complex and not yet fully understood and includes many metabolic, immunologic, and neurogenic factors. A significant burden of the disease results in decreased quality of life with sleep impairment, depressive symptoms, and increased mortality of affected individuals. No treatment of choice is available; topical therapy (emollients), phototherapy (UV-B), and systemic therapy (antiepileptics, opioid agonists, and antagonists) provide significant relief in varying percentages of patients.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^115QkuuL]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — definition, duration, epidemiology, and pathobiology: CU is defined as urticaria that has been continuously or intermittently present for at least 6 weeks, and the duration varies considerably, with physical urticarias tending to persist the longest, often for many years. The prevalence of CU in the general population has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 5%, and the incidence has been estimated at 1.4% per year. Some patients with CU might have both urticaria and angioedema, occurring simultaneously or separately. Pathogenically, the skin mast cell is the most important cell in patients with CU, and histamine is the predominant mediator, although other cells and mediators also play a key role; activation of the coagulation cascade, including increased prothrombin fragment F1+2 and D-dimer levels, has been described and might be a marker of CU with angioedema severity.

### Interventions for chronic pruritus of unknown origin [^116xy64i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pruritus is a sensation that leads to the desire to scratch; its origin is unknown in 8% to 15% of affected patients. The prevalence of chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) in individuals with generalised pruritus ranges from 3.6% to 44.5%, with highest prevalence among the elderly. When the origin of pruritus is known, its management may be straightforward if an effective treatment for the causal disease is available. Treatment of CPUO is particularly difficult due to its unknown pathophysiology.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for CPUO in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the following up to July 2019: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registries. We checked the reference lists of included studies for additional references to relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We sought to include randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials that assessed interventions for CPUO, as defined in category VI ('Other pruritus of undetermined origin, or chronic pruritus of unknown origin') of the International Forum for the Study of Itch (IFSI) classification, in children and adults. Eligible interventions were non-pharmacological or topical or systemic pharmacological interventions, and eligible comparators were another active treatment, placebo, sham procedures, or no treatment or equivalent (e.g. waiting list).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'Patient- or parent-reported pruritus intensity' and 'Adverse events'. Our secondary outcomes were 'Health-related quality of life', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Depression', and 'Patient satisfaction'. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We found there was an absence of evidence for the main interventions of interest: emollient creams, cooling lotions, topical corticosteroids, topical antidepressants, systemic antihistamines, systemic antidepressants, systemic anticonvulsants, and phototherapy. We included one study with 257 randomised (253 analysed) participants, aged 18 to 65 years; 60.6% were female. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of three different doses of oral serlopitant (5 mg, 1 mg, and 0.25 mg, once daily for six weeks) compared to placebo for severe chronic pruritus; 25 US centres participated (clinical research centres and universities). All outcomes were measured at the end of treatment (six weeks from baseline), except adverse events, which were monitored throughout. A pharmaceutical company funded this study. Fifty-five per cent of participants suffered from CPUO, and approximately 45% presented a dermatological diagnosis (atopic dermatitis/eczema 37.3%, psoriasis 6.7%, acne 3.6%, among other diagnoses). We unsuccessfully attempted to retrieve outcome data from study authors for the subgroup of participants with CPUO. Participants had pruritus for six weeks or longer. Total study duration was 10 weeks. Participants who received serlopitant 5 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient-reported pruritus intensity as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS; a reduction in VAS score indicates improvement) compared to placebo (126 participants, risk ratio (RR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 3.35; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 5 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low-certainty evidence: adverse events (127 participants; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.50); health-related quality of life (as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); a higher score indicates greater impairment; 127 participants; mean difference (MD) -4.20, 95% CI -11.68 to 3.28); and sleep disturbances (people with insomnia measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Symptom Questionnaire-Insomnia (PSSQ-I), a dichotomous measure; 128 participants; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.01). Participants who received serlopitant 1 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient-reported pruritus intensity as measured by VAS compared to placebo; however, the 95% CI indicates that there may also be little to no difference between groups (126 participants; RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.54; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 1 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low-certainty evidence: adverse events (128 participants; RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.47); health-related quality of life (DLQI; 128 participants; MD -6.90, 95% CI -14.38 to 0.58); and sleep disturbances (PSSQ-I; 128 participants; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.84). Participants who received serlopitant 0.25 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient-reported pruritus intensity as measured by VAS compared to placebo; however, the 95% CI indicates that there may also be little to no difference between groups (127 participants; RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.77; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 0.25 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low-certainty evidence: adverse events (127 participants; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.24); health-related quality of life (DLQI; 127 participants; MD -5.70, 95% CI -13.18 to 1.78); and sleep disturbances (PSSQ-I; 127 participants; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.17). The most commonly reported adverse events were somnolence, diarrhoea, headache, and nasopharyngitis, among others. Our included study did not measure depression or patient satisfaction. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes due to indirectness (only 55% of study participants had CPUO) and imprecision. We downgraded outcomes other than patient-reported pruritus intensity a further level due to concerns regarding risk of bias in selection of the reported result and some concerns with risk of bias due to missing outcome data (sleep disturbances only). We deemed risk of bias to be generally low.

Authors' Conclusions

We found lack of evidence to address our review question: for most of our interventions of interest, we found no eligible studies. The neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist serlopitant was the only intervention that we could assess. One study provided low-certainty evidence suggesting that serlopitant may reduce pruritus intensity when compared with placebo. We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant on other outcomes, as certainty of the evidence is very low. More studies with larger sample sizes, focused on patients with CPUO, are needed. Healthcare professionals, patients, and other stakeholders may have to rely on indirect evidence related to other forms of chronic pruritus when deciding between the main interventions currently used for this condition.

### Research techniques made simple: itch measurement in clinical trials [^114DSg37]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic itch, defined as itch lasting longer than 6 weeks, is a highly prevalent and debilitating symptom known to profoundly and negatively affect quality of life. The development of effective targeted therapies for some chronic itch disorders such as atopic dermatitis has given widespread recognition to the importance of measuring itch in clinical trials. Clinical trials now use itch measurement as a primary outcome measure, and steps toward the standardization of itch assessment are being made to meet the growing need for reliably measuring itch and its impact on quality of life in the clinical research setting. Itch can be evaluated via subjective patient-reported assessments or by objective measurement of scratching activity and scratching-induced skin changes. Herein, methods for the subjective assessment of itch via both unidimensional and multidimensional tools are discussed.

### Different definitions of atopic dermatitis: impact on prevalence estimates and associated risk factors [^112deQJk]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Search for definitions of atopic dermatitis in the literature

We reviewed 45 studies (Fig. S2; see Supporting Information) and identified 59 different operational definitions of AD (summarized in Table S1; see Supporting Information). In total, 32 studies included a cumulative estimate of AD (lifetime period), 26 used current AD (defined as the presence of AD in the previous 6, 12 or 24 months) and no time period was specified in one study. Within each definition, there was further heterogeneity (e.g. within the category of physician‐confirmed AD for cumulative prevalence we found six different definitions; Table S1). After definitions that consisted of a combination of several data sources were decomposed, further heterogeneity became apparent (31 were derived from a single data source, 24 from two, and four from three or more). Of these, 41 definitions were based on physician‐confirmed AD, 43 on parent‐reported AD, seven on physical examination and two on data from medical records.

Of the 59 operational definitions, 27 were derived based on questions referring to an 'itchy skin condition', 23 on 'skin condition affecting skin creases' and 17 on 'chronic skin condition'. Of the 43 case definitions that included 'parent‐reported AD', 27 (63%) incorporated at least one of these three common features. Of these, 11 adopted all three features (Fig. S3; see Supporting Information). Of 41 definitions that included 'physician‐confirmed AD', 33 relied on a single or several questions pertaining to physician diagnosis (Fig. S3). Only seven definitions incorporated the use of treatment, and the age of onset was considered in four.

We then chose four common operational case definitions (Table 1) to estimate the prevalence, risk factors and predictive performance of prediction models in the two cohorts, as follows. Definition 1: physician‐confirmed AD. Definition 2: physician‐confirmed AD and parent‐reported chronic itchy skin condition affecting skin creases. Definition 3: parent‐reported chronic itchy skin condition affecting skin creases. Definition 4: physician‐confirmed AD or parent‐reported chronic itchy skin condition affecting skin creases. For these analyses, 'controls' were defined as children who did not fulfil the case definition.

### An update on pruritus associated with CKD [^117WKzYp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease is increasing worldwide. Despite improvements in dialysis methods, including the development of novel biocompatible membranes and ultrapure dialysate, CKD-associated pruritus remains a common and significant public health issue. Not only does this distressing symptom profoundly impact on quality of life and sleep, recent evidence showed that pruritus also was associated with poor patient outcome. Nonetheless, nephrologists and other health care professionals often fail to recognize and adequately address the pruritus associated with CKD. The pathophysiological mechanism of CKD-associated pruritus is poorly defined, and, as a result, the development of specific therapies has proved to be a challenge. The purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of this neglected topic by providing an overview of recent epidemiological studies, outcomes data, proposed pathophysiological mechanisms, and emerging treatment options.

### Emerging therapeutic options for chronic pruritus [^1119Yg7Q]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pruritus (CP), defined as an unpleasant sensation resulting in a need to scratch that lasts more than 6 weeks, is a prevalent and bothersome symptom associated with cutaneous conditions (such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis [AD], lichen planus [LP], etc.); however, primarily extracutaneous ailments may also play a role in the occurrence of CP. Prominent examples of the latter include end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, chronic hepatobiliary conditions, or malignancies, to name just a few. The etiology of CP may be comprehensively classified as dermatologic, systemic, neurologic, psychogenic, mixed or unknown. Therefore, physicians other than dermatologists also frequently encounter this phenomenon in both outpatient and clinical settings. The burden of CP stems from a marked decrease in various domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

### Multidimensional pruritus assessment in hemodialysis patients [^111p3grA]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Itching, an unpleasant sensation of the skin, causing a desire to scratch, is a bothersome and unpleasant symptom in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients and has the highest prevalence among cutaneous manifestations in renal disease. The prevalence of uremic pruritus varies between 10 and 77%.

Uremic pruritus has a multifactorial etiopathogenesis, and is associated with physical disability, impaired quality of life, and limitations in activities of daily living. Uremic pruritus is strongly associated with physical and mental limitations, insomnia, and chronic fatigue; discomfort, embarrassment/isolation, and secondary skin changes due to scratching of lesions; and anger, anxiety, and depression.

Despite the high prevalence and life changing effects, multidimensional symptom evaluation and the main effects on patient life remain poorly characterized, as most research has focused on severity and direction. Multidimensional itch assessment should be conducted to assess and manage itching symptom in clinical environment due to multifactorial nature. Multidimensional approach for pruritus includes measuring degree, duration, direction, impact on activities of daily life, and location of pruritus. As further multifaceted paradigm of itching taken into consideration, assessment of care and treatment success also be evaluated within numerous dimensions. This time and individual sensitive approach also helps to screen and record the changes over time.

An important role of health care professionals is recognition and management of pruritus symptoms in hemodialysis patients, as well as determination of the effect on quality of life, and assessment, evaluation, and treatment of symptoms using a biopsychosocial approach. Hence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of uremic pruritus and to describe the multidimensional symptom experience in hemodialysis patients, according to duration, degree, direction, disability, and distribution, as well as to determine the associations between pruritus, patient clinical features, and dialysis parameters.

### Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus, still a vexing problem [^111nPsBp]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP), formerly termed uremic pruritus, is a severely distressing condition that is common (60% of patients on dialysis) and frequently underdiagnosed and untreated. 1,2 The pruritus can be severe enough to diminish sleep and is associated with worse mortality rates, as demonstrated in several large studies. 1,2 It can also occur in nondialysis patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD, with an increasing prevalence in patients with worsening kidney function, age, and medical comorbidities. The pathophysiology likely involves many factors and molecules. 3.

### Lifetime prevalence and associated factors of itch with skin conditions: atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and dry skin in individuals aged > 50 years [^111zGMmQ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Itch, common in dermatological conditions, is often accompanied by psychological distress and reduced quality of life. However, research on the prevalence and associated factors of itch with skin conditions in general populations is limited.

Objectives

This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the lifetime prevalence of itch with skin conditions and to identify its associated factors in individuals aged > 50years.

Methods

Participants from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort, were interviewed to assess whether they had ever had an itchy skin condition, defining lifetime itch with skin conditions. Over 20 demographic, lifestyle, dermatological and nondermatological factors were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis explored associations between these factors and itch with skin conditions, reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

In total, 5246 eligible participants were included (age range 51–100years, median age 67; 56.0% women). The results revealed a -lifetime prevalence of 33.7% for itch with skin conditions. Factors significantly associated with itch were female sex (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11–1.43), body mass index (1.02, 1.01–1.03), self-reported atopic dermatitis (4.29, 3.74–4.92), presence of atopic dermatitis (1.97, 1.60–2.43), self — reported psoriasis (2.31, 1.77–3.01), presence of psoriasis (2.11, 1.55–2.87), self-reported dry skin (1.95, 1.73–2.20), self-reported asthma (1.40, 1.08–1.83), renal impairment (1.45, 1.17–1.79), and clinically relevant depressive (1.85, 1.52–2.25) and anxiety symptoms (1.36, 1.11–1.66).

Conclusions

This study reveals a substantial one-third lifetime prevalence of itch with skin conditions in individuals aged > 50years. Significant associations with diverse lifestyle, demographic, dermatological and, intriguingly, nondermatological factors, including renal impairment, imply additional contributors to induction or persistence of itch in individuals with skin conditions.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of chronic widespread pain in the general population [^114YUmyu]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is common and associated with poor general health. There has been no attempt to derive a robust prevalence estimate of CWP or assess how this is influenced by sociodemographic factors. This study therefore aimed to determine, through a systematic review and meta-analysis, the prevalence of CWP in the adult general population and explore variation in prevalence by age, sex, geographical location, and criteria used to define CWP. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED were searched using a search strategy combining key words and related database-specific subject terms to identify relevant cohort or cross-sectional studies published since 1990. Included articles were assessed for risk of bias. Prevalence figures for CWP (American College of Rheumatology criteria) were stratified according to geographical location, age, and sex. Potential sources of variation were investigated using subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Twenty-five articles met the eligibility criteria. Estimates for CWP prevalence ranged from 0% to 24%, with most estimates between 10% and 15%. The random-effects pooled prevalence was 10.6% (95% confidence intervals: 8.6–12.9). When only studies at low risk of bias were considered pooled, prevalence increased to 11.8% (95% confidence intervals: 10.3–13.3), with reduced but still high heterogeneity. Prevalence was higher in women and in those aged more than 40 years. There was some limited evidence of geographic variation and cultural differences. One in 10 adults in the general population report chronic widespread pain with possible sociocultural variation. The possibility of cultural differences in pain reporting should be considered in future research and the clinical assessment of painful conditions.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^117CxEZe]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) definition and epidemiology — AD is a chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease that occurs most frequently in children, but also affects many adults, follows a relapsing course, and is often associated with elevated serum immunoglobulin (IgE) levels and a personal or family history of type I allergies, allergic rhinitis, and asthma; atopic eczema is synonymous with AD. AD onset is most common between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the eruption in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age, and while the majority have resolution by adulthood, 10% to 30% do not. AD has a complex pathogenesis involving genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors that lead to a dysfunctional skin barrier and dysregulation of the immune system, notable clinical findings include erythema, edema, xerosis, erosions/excoriations, oozing and crusting, and lichenification, and pruritus is a hallmark of the condition that contributes substantially to disease burden.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^111C7uM9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) gaps in research — the expert group's priorities emphasize that while much is known about diagnosis and evaluation, much has yet to be learned. Significant gaps in research were identified, including but not limited to: validation studies of the AAD workgroup diagnostic criteria, development, validation, and uniformity in use of disease severity and quality of life measurements applicable to a busy clinical practice environment, interventional studies testing impact of multidisciplinary management on AD outcomes, and additional quality, controlled studies on epidemiologic risk factors for disease. It is hoped that additional knowledge of AD pathogenesis will soon lead to a proven biomarker for diagnosis and/or monitoring, and that AD-associated pruritus is better understood to generate improved therapeutic options.

3 ITCH ASSESSMENT TOOLS

Itch is a subjective and multidimensional experience, rendering it challenging to quantify. Moreover, there is currently a dearth of reliable biomarkers or objective tools for evaluating the severity of itch. Consequently, itch should be assessed based primarily on verbal expressions provided by patients. There are several major assessment tools for itch (Table 3).

TABLE 3
Itch assessment tools.

3.1 Numerical rating scale

Patients are asked to rate their itch on an 11‐point Likert score from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no itch and 10 the worst itch imaginable. The score for itch intensity is provided out of 10, e.g. 7 of 10, or just 7/10. The peak pruritus numerical rating scale (PP‐NRS), also known as the worst itch numerical rating scale (WI‐NRS), represents the individual's worst itch in the past 24 h.

Generally, itch intensity measured with the numerical rating scale (NRS) can be categorized into no itch (NRS, 0), mild itch (NRS, 1–2), moderate itch (NRS, 3–6), severe itch (NRS, 7–8), and very severe itch (NRS, 9–10). Another category is also widely used as: no itch (NRS, 0), mild itch (NRS, 1–3), moderate itch (NRS, 4–6), and severe itch (NRS, 7–10). The PP‐NRS is a widely utilized instrument used in routine dermatological practices and clinical trials. The most appropriate threshold for defining a clinically relevant, within‐person response is reported to be a ≥ 2‐ to 4‐point change in the PP‐NRS.

3.2 Visual analogue scale

The visual analogue scale (VAS) consists of a horizontal 10‐cm line with two end points of 0 (zero, no itch) at the left and 10 (the worst itch imaginable) at the right. Patients are instructed to rate their itch severity from zero to 10 by placing a mark on the line. The score is provided out of 10 (cm) or 100 (mm), e.g. 7.2 out of 10 (cm), or just 7.2/10, as provided in the NRS.

### From compression to itch: exploring the link between nerve compression and neuropathic pruritus [^11474EZi]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Definition of Neuropathic Itch from Spinal Impingement

Neuropathic itch from spinal impingement is itch without a primary rash caused by spinal impingement, as in brachioradial pruritus (BRP), notalgia paresthetica (NP), and anogenital itch, which are forms of neuropathic itch — defined as the sensation of pruritus that is caused by neural dysfunction at any point along the afferent pathway. This non-dermatological itch is typically chronic in nature and may be accompanied by other abnormal sensory symptoms in a dermatomal distribution, such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, or hypoesthesia. This sensory combination may lead to feelings more characteristic of pain, such as burning, stinging, or tingling. Another distinguishing feature of neuropathic itch is the potential presence of other forms of neural damage, including motor or autonomic damage. The pruritus may be localized due to compression of a single nerve fiber or generalized due to broader nerve degeneration. Of note, neuropathic pruritus tends to be moderate to severe, with an average itch severity of 6.5–7.8 on a mean numeric rating scale (NRS). This likely contributes to a host of comorbid features that negatively impact quality of life in patients with chronic pruritus, especially depressed mood, disrupted sleep, and strained social relationships.

Epidemiology

Neuropathic itch is a common origin of chronic pruritus, accounting for an estimated 8% of cases in the general population, according to a German database. Epidemiological studies exploring the prevalence and incidence of neuropathic itch are notably lacking in the existing literature. The most common forms of neuropathic itch are BRP, NP, and anogenital itch, albeit there are no detailed epidemiologic data.

Identifying the cause of neuropathic itch can be a convoluted process, and recognizing key epidemiological factors may be a helpful tool in narrowing the potential contributing mechanisms. BRP, for instance, is 2–3 times more commonly seen in white women in the fifth to sixth decades of life. The prevalence of BRP in the general population is unknown, although it is considered to be rare. BRP also appears to be more common in the tropics or subtropics compared with moderate climates or may present with disease flares during the warmer months with remission during cooler periods. The increased prevalence of BRP in regions with high ultraviolet (UV) exposure may relate to sun damage of itch -inhibitory nerve fibers in skin.

### Predictors of malignancy development in patients with chronic pruritus [^115Fou7K]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with pruritus have been shown to have an increased incidence of certain subtypes of malignancy.

Objective

To assess predictors of malignancy in patients with chronic pruritus without prior dermatologic diagnoses.

Methods

Case-control study of 398 patients with chronic pruritus who developed a malignancy were compared with 8346 patients with chronic pruritus who did not develop a malignancy. Primary outcomes were odds of developing incident malignancy.

Results

Age greater than 60 years (OR 4.04, 95% CI 3.08, 5.31), male sex (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.13, 1.71) and liver disease (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.00, 5.65) were predictors of malignancy development in patients with chronic pruritus and non-diseased skin. In an exploratory analysis with multiple imputation via chained equations, age greater than 60 years (OR 4.13, 95% CI 3.15, 5.42), male sex (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02, 1.55), and current or prior smoking (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.42, 2.88) were predictors of malignancy development in patients with chronic pruritus and non-diseased skin.

Limitations

Potential for misclassification and detection biases. Missing data.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with chronic pruritus without concomitant dermatologic diagnoses, older age, male sex, liver disease and tobacco abuse increase the odds of an underlying malignancy.

### Emerging therapeutic options for chronic pruritus [^1179Kgpr]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Regardless of the cause, patients with CP will benefit from the continuously increasing armamentarium of novel therapies. To a large extent, the expected progress is based on the flourishing data on CP pathophysiology, but, in the era of evidence-based medicine, another crucial factor (conscientious planning and execution of clinical trials) has to be taken into account. Thereby, therapeutic success, safety and economic issues will be maintained in real-life settings.

### The characteristics and impact of pruritus in adult dermatology patients: a prospective, cross-sectional study [^115JVZrk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pruritus often accompanies chronic skin diseases, exerting considerable burden on many areas of patient functioning; this burden and the features of pruritus remain insufficiently characterized.

Objective

To investigate characteristics, including localization patterns, and burden of pruritus in patients with chronic dermatoses.

Methods

We recruited 800 patients with active chronic skin diseases. We assessed pruritus intensity, localization, and further characteristics. We used validated questionnaires to assess quality of life, work productivity and activity impairment, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality.

Results

Nine out of every 10 patients had experienced pruritus throughout their disease and 73% in the last 7 days. Pruritus often affected the entire body and was not restricted to skin lesions. Patients with moderate to severe pruritus reported significantly more impairment to their sleep quality and work productivity, and they were more depressed and anxious than control individuals and patients with mild or no pruritus. Suicidal ideations were highly prevalent in patients with chronic pruritus (18.5%) and atopic dermatitis (11.8%).

Conclusions

Pruritus prevalence and intensity are very high across all dermatoses studied; intensity is linked to impairment in many areas of daily functioning. Effective treatment strategies are urgently required to treat pruritus and the underlying skin disease.

### Pruritus as a sign of systemic disease [^114FxJ2y]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pruritus, as one of the most common clinical manifestations in medicine, has been recognized for many centuries. Defined as an unpleasant sensation resulting in the need to scratch, it is divided into acute and chronic stages, based on the duration of the clinical manifestation. Classically, pruritus is associated with cutaneous disorders; however, it may also accompany various systemic disorders, including renal, hepatic, hematologic, or oncologic, and be the first or solitary manifestation of an underlying systemic disease. Additionally, the clinical manifestation may occur as an adverse reaction to drug administration. The pathogenesis of itch is multifactorial, involving various neuromediators and cytokines, with a prominent role of peripheral and central nervous system in its development. Based on an underlying disorder, the affected patients present different clinical patterns of pruritus. Diagnostic approach is based on detailed history taking and physical examination. Frequently, additional diagnostic measures, including laboratory or imaging tests, are performed, especially when the cause of pruritus is unknown. Pruritus remains a challenging clinical manifestation with a significant importance for physicians managing systemic disorders.

### Practical approaches for diagnosis and management of prurigo nodularis: United States expert panel consensus [^114prQiE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic disease characterized by intensely pruritic, raised, nodular lesions. Because there are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies specifically for PN, management is highly variable, and no consensus exists on treatment regimens.

Objective

To provide practical guidance to help United States dermatologists diagnose and effectively treat patients with PN.

Methods

We participated in a roundtable discussion to develop consensus recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of PN from a United States perspective.

Results

The core findings in PN are the presence of firm, nodular lesions; pruritus lasting at least 6 weeks; and a history or signs, or both, of repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing. The diagnostic workup involves a complete review of systems, considering potential systemic diseases, and assessment of disease severity, including disease burden and pruritus intensity. Treatment should be selected based on a patient's clinical presentation, comorbidities, and response to prior treatments and should address both neural and immunologic components of pruritus.

Limitations

Data on PN are from anecdotal or small clinical trials, and all treatments are currently used off-label.

Conclusion

An effective treatment approach for patients with PN should be based on clinical judgment and tailored to the individual needs of the patient.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis symptom burden is substantial. Intense pruritus occurs in most patients, with more than 85% of patients with moderate-to-severe disease reporting daily itch and 42% experiencing itch for 18 or more hours each day. More than 40% of children and 60% of adults report skin pain. Sleep disturbance is common — Children (47%-80%) and adults (33%-87%) frequently report sleep disturbance — along with difficulty falling asleep, frequent nighttime wakening, excessive daytime sleepiness, and objective findings of prolonged sleep-onset latency, reduced sleep efficiency, and increased time awake.

### International study on prevalence of itch: examining the role of itch as a major global public health problem [^113bZoG2]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Very few studies have evaluated the global prevalence of pruritus.

Objectives

To assess its prevalence according to age, sex, ethnicity and geographic region.

Methods

An international cross-sectional study was conducted in 20 countries from January to April 2023. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire on sociodemographics, and to confirm the presence or absence of a skin disease in the last 12 months and the presence or absence of pruritus in the last 7 days.

Results

The studied sample included 50 552 individuals. The worldwide prevalence of pruritus was 39.8%. The age group ≥ 65 years had the highest prevalence (43.3%). The prevalence was 40.7% among women and 38.9% among men (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between ethnicities (P = 0.14). Compared with North America (41.2%), the prevalence of pruritus was significantly lower in Europe (35.9%, P < 0.001), Australia (38.4%, P = 0.017), East Asia (40.2%, P = 0.04) and Latin America (36.5%, P < 0.001), and higher in Africa (45.7%, P = 0.007). No significant difference was found with the Middle East (40.2%, P = 0.36). The prevalence of pruritus in BRICS countries (40.3%) was significantly higher than that in developed countries (38.7%) (P < 10⁻³).

Conclusions

Out analysis is limited because there is no information about the severity or type (acute, chronic) of pruritus. The global prevalence of pruritus revealed age, sex and geographic region differences, with no ethnic differences.

### Common dermatologic… [^111tic5P]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility. Patients scratch pruritic areas and subsequently develop secondary lesions, worsening dermatitis and associated pruritus; this process is often called the itch-scratch cycle. Flexural areas are commonly affected, including ankles, regions behind the ears, and the antecubital and popliteal fossae. Patients with this condition often have a personal or family history of asthma or allergic rhinitis, and symptoms commonly begin during childhood. Treatment includes limiting exposure to water, liberal emollient use, and topical corticosteroid application. 8, 9. 1, 4, 10 and topical corticosteroid application. 11 DERMATOPHYTOSIS. 13 Patients with scabies infestations typically report pruritus that worsens at night and can persist despite mite eradication. Skin findings common to scabies include burrows, vesicles, and papules in finger web spaces and axillae and on wrists, ankles, genitals, and extensor surfaces. Secondary skin lesions may be caused by scratching.

Microscopic examination of skin scrapings may reveal scabies, mites, eggs, and feces. 13 Insects commonly known to cause pruritic bites include mosquitoes, fire ants, bed bugs, gnats, fleas, and chiggers. These insects injure the skin through stabbing mechanisms that expose the affected skin to the insect's saliva. An individual's allergic response to the injury and insect saliva determines the severity of the localized reaction. Patients with sensitive skin can quickly develop localized hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritic, erythematous urticarial papules and plaques. 4 Malignancy, including cervical, prostate, and colon cancers, can cause chronic generalized pruritus. 1 Chronic conditions, including renal and hepatic failure, thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and multiple sclerosis, can also precipitate diffuse pruritus without concurrent skin disease.

Psychogenic etiologies are diagnoses of exclusion; however, a history of emotional stress or chronic or transient psychiatric conditions may increase suspicion for pruritus. 10, 18. General Management The determination of underlying etiologies affects treatment selection. Diagnosis and treatment of an underlying condition often resolves the associated pruritus. Although general management principles are provided in European guidelines, randomized controlled trials supporting these measures are lacking, and the recommendations are consensus based.

### Assessing pruritus in hidradenitis suppurativa: a cross-sectional study [^115BtgPL]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also known as acne inversa, is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory skin disease that mostly develops after puberty and predominantly occurs in women, with a female-to-male ratio of 3:1. The estimated prevalence rate in Europe is approximately 1%. Risk factors for developing HS are smoking and overweight or obesity. The disease is characterized by deep-seated, inflamed nodules and abscesses, often followed by sinus tract formation, and is most commonly located in the flexural body sites carrying terminal hairs.

Key symptoms of HS include acute and chronic pain, discomfort, and a purulent, foul-smelling discharge, which, overall, contribute to a poor quality of life. Previous clinical studies have mainly focused on these well-known symptoms, while less is known about the itch sensation, also known as pruritus. In 2011, a small qualitative study in which 12 HS patients were interviewed for the first time revealed that not only drainage, pain, and scarring but also itching have a significant psychosocial impact in HS patients.

To date, one cross-sectional study demonstrated a positive association between disutility and itch in a cohort of 294 HS patients, using the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) and a visual analog scale (VAS), respectively. However, the prevalence and accompanying (psychosocial) factors of pruritus in HS have not been adequately investigated to date. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, and explore the characteristics, of pruritus in a cohort of HS patients. In addition, serological and histological markers of pruritus were evaluated in a subpopulation.

### Itch: from mechanism to (novel) therapeutic approaches [^111gDE8P]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Itch is a common sensory experience that is prevalent in patients with inflammatory skin diseases, as well as in those with systemic and neuropathic conditions. In patients with these conditions, itch is often severe and significantly affects quality of life. Itch is encoded by 2 major neuronal pathways: histaminergic (in acute itch) and nonhistaminergic (in chronic itch). In the majority of cases, crosstalk existing between keratinocytes, the immune system, and nonhistaminergic sensory nerves is responsible for the pathophysiology of chronic itch. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the molecular, neural, and immune mechanisms of itch: beginning in the skin, proceeding to the spinal cord, and eventually ascending to the brain, where itch is processed. A growing understanding of the mechanisms of chronic itch is expanding, as is our pipeline of more targeted topical and systemic therapies. Our therapeutic armamentarium for treating chronic itch has expanded in the last 5 years, with developments of topical and systemic treatments targeting the neural and immune systems.

### A comprehensive conceptual model of the experience of chronic itch in adults [^113n1g8e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Itch is common and often debilitating. Itch is best assessed by self-report, often using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Current PROMs for itch are limited and may not capture its full impact on quality of life (QOL).

Objective

We sought to develop a comprehensive conceptual model of itch to improve the understanding of itch for clinicians and to serve as a framework for development of efficient and valid PROMs of itch.

Methods

Using mixed methods, including systematic review (n = 491 articles), semi-structured interviews (n = 33 adults with chronic itch with multiple etiologies), and grounded theory using a constant comparative approach, we developed a conceptual model of itch.

Results

We found the Wilson and Cleary model to be a reasonable framework for organizing our findings. It includes five primary components: biological and physiological variables, symptom status, functional status, general health perceptions, and QOL. We propose a causal relationship beginning with the biological and physiological driving factors, with direct and indirect impacts of itch and its sequelae, including pain and sleep disturbance. These can impair function, lead to task avoidance, stigma, social life and relationship problems, emotional disturbances, and treatment burden. Together, these sequelae alter one's perceptions of health, QOL, and treatment response.

Conclusions

Our conceptual model demonstrates the profound patient-burden of itch and identifies unmet needs in the evaluation and management of itch.

### Acute and chronic urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^112xXbHJ]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute urticaria:

- **Definition**: Acute urticaria is a self-limited cutaneous condition characterized by transient, erythematous, and pruritic wheals or hives.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute urticaria is caused by mast cell and basophil activation, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which results in vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, leading to characteristic skin lesions. The activation of these cells can occur through multiple triggers, including IgE- and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of acute urticaria in the United Kingdom is estimated at 355 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, acute urticaria presents as itchy, raised welts that can appear anywhere on the body. These hives are transient, often moving from one area of the body to another. In some cases, acute urticarial lesions may display central clearing with an ecchymotic or hemorrhagic hue.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of acute urticaria is generally good, as it is typically a self-limiting condition that resolves within 6 weeks.

### Prevalence, incidence, and severity of hand eczema in the general population – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114mdrUf]. Contact Dermatitis (2021). Medium credibility.

Accurate assessments of the burden of hand eczema (HE) in the general population are important for public awareness and intervention. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide updated estimates of prevalence and incidence, alongside additional epidemiological endpoints on HE in the general population. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting the prevalence and/or incidence of HE in the general population. Proportion meta-analyses were performed to calculate pooled estimates of prevalence, incidence, severity, and the proportion of individuals with HE and a history of atopic dermatitis. Sixty-six studies were included in the quantitative analysis encompassing 568100 individuals. The pooled estimates for lifetime, 1-year, and point prevalence were 14.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.6–16.5), 9.1% (95% CI: 8.4–9.8) and 4.0% (95% CI: 2.6–5.7), respectively. The pooled incidence rate of HE was 7.3 cases/1000 person-years (95% CI: 5.4–9.5). The occurrence of HE was 1.5–2 times higher in females than males. More than one third suffered from moderate/severe disease and around one third had a history of atopic dermatitis. HE was a recurrent, long-lasting disease with an average age at onset of the early- to mid-twenties. In conclusion; HE is a highly prevalent disease in the general population and carries a significant risk of long-term or chronic disease.

### Itch and pruritus: what are they, and how should itches be classified? [^115xpg6E]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Itch and pruritus are two terms for the same thing. In this essay I will argue that casting about for a distinction between them creates only confusion. Once that matter is settled, it is still necessary to come up with a clinical classification for itches of different types. No system yet proposed, including the one that will be suggested here, is perfect.

### Prevalence and clinical correlates of pruritus in patients with systemic sclerosis: an updated analysis of 959 patients [^112KLrX2]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

One previous study has estimated the prevalence of pruritus in SSc, but that study had important limitations due to a relatively small sample size. The present study updates the analyses of the previous study using a substantially larger patient sample. The objectives were to (i) document the proportion of patients who experience pruritus on most days overall and by disease duration and (ii) identify clinical correlates of pruritus.

Methods

Patients from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group Registry ≥ 1 year after registry enrolment were asked on two consecutive annual visits whether they had experienced pruritus in the past month on most days and underwent clinical history and medical examination. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association between sociodemographic and clinical variables and pruritus.

Results

Among 959 patients, 42.6% reported pruritus. Of 693 patients with data for both visits, 333 (48%) did not report pruritus at either visit, 209 (30%) reported pruritus at both visits and 151 (22%) reported pruritus at one, but not the other, visit. The presence of pruritus was independently associated with greater skin involvement [odds ratio (OR) = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00, 1.04, P = 0.017] and greater gastrointestinal involvement (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.04, 1.48, P = 0.018).

Conclusion

Pruritus is common in SSc across the course of the disease and has small but statistically significant associations with the degree of skin involvement and gastrointestinal system involvement.
