## Question

How combined oral contraceptives pills relieve pain in case of endometriosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how combined oral contraceptive pills relieve pain in endometriosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of endometriosis and why it hurts. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic actions of COCPs and how they intersect with those mechanisms. Next, I will examine clinical evidence for pain reduction and clarify where the evidence is strong versus limited. After that, I need to consider practical dosing strategies and how they affect outcomes. Finally, I should review safety, alternatives, and guideline-based positioning to ensure the recommendations are clinically sound and supported by data.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology I'm relying on: endometriosis is driven by estrogen-dependent ectopic endometrial-like tissue that proliferates and bleeds cyclically, triggering inflammation, neuroangiogenesis, and nociception, with additional contributions from progesterone resistance that sustains estrogen dominance and amplifies local estradiol production within lesions. These mechanisms collectively explain dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain [^115wpZYk] [^113QeHCV].

> I need to check the pharmacologic effects of COCPs that plausibly counter this biology: combined estrogen–progestin pills suppress pituitary gonadotropins and thereby inhibit ovulation and new corpus luteum formation, thin the endometrium, and stabilize cycles. Critically, the progestin component induces decidualization and atrophy of eutopic and ectopic endometrium, which reduces cyclical proliferation, bleeding, and inflammatory signaling that drive pain, while continuous regimens avoid hormone-free intervals that can reactivate endometriotic activity [^113ZBrA2] [^111XzL9V] [^111LM8Cr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about magnitude of benefit. I should verify the clinical evidence base. High-quality contemporary guidance recommends combined hormonal contraceptives as first-line therapy for endometriosis-associated pain, and a recent network meta-analysis suggests COCPs confer a modest but significant reduction in endometriosis-associated pelvic pain versus placebo, while acknowledging that progestins and GnRH analogs often achieve larger effects; earlier Cochrane reviews found signals of benefit but judged the evidence as low to very low quality due to small, biased trials, so I need to be cautious in overstating effect sizes [^112Kz3EG] [^117RLfKU] [^115at8Y6] [^114hHzkt].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative context so I don't over-attribute to COCPs alone. The PRE-EMPT randomized trial showed that after conservative surgery, long-acting progestogens and COCPs yielded similar ~40% improvements in pain at three years, with fewer repeat surgeries or second-line treatments in the long-acting progestogen arm; this supports equivalence of pain control between strategies and highlights adherence and procedural outcomes as differentiators rather than pain efficacy per se [^116MPS27] [^116CXMMu] [^113hTqQg].

> I should confirm dosing strategy nuances because regimen matters clinically. Continuous or extended-cycle COCPs are favored over cyclic 21/7 regimens to minimize hormone-free intervals that can trigger rebound estradiol rises and breakthrough pain; randomized and systematic data in general CHC populations show improved menstrual symptom control with continuous dosing, and endometriosis-specific observational data suggest better pain control with continuous COCPs, aligning with mechanistic expectations and guideline preferences [^111XzL9V] [^112vToz6] [^1137gvrg] [^112Kz3EG].

> Let me consider safety and tolerability so recommendations are balanced. COCPs are generally well tolerated and are category 1 for endometriosis per U.S. MEC, but estrogen-related risks such as venous thromboembolism must be screened and counseled; progestin-only options or local progestins may be preferable for patients with estrogen contraindications or intolerance, and long-acting progestogens may improve adherence and reduce treatment failure, albeit with their own side-effect profiles including irregular bleeding and, for some agents, bone effects with prolonged use [^116t9fcT] [^113h684V] [^1144Jhex].

> But wait, what if first-line hormonal therapy fails or is contraindicated? I should double-check escalation pathways. Guidelines support offering progestin-only therapy, GnRH agonists or antagonists with appropriate add-back when needed, and, for refractory cases, aromatase inhibitors in combination regimens; oral GnRH antagonists demonstrate dose-responsive efficacy for pain but carry hypoestrogenic adverse effects at higher doses, reinforcing the need to individualize and monitor bone health and vasomotor symptoms during prolonged suppression [^114KkaoY] [^112X1DAd] [^1113mJKW] [^115ohUSs].

> I will now examine the strength of evidence and acknowledge limitations so we don't overstate. While guidelines endorse COCPs and multiple studies report pain improvements, head-to-head superiority data versus progestins are limited and heterogeneous, and a meaningful minority of patients have minimal response to hormonal therapy; thus, shared decision-making should include expectations, side effects, fertility goals, and the possibility of switching class or adding surgical evaluation if medical therapy is inadequate [^111CDXdg] [^115wpZYk] [^111zR814].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the mechanistic-clinical bridge succinctly: COCPs reduce endometriosis pain primarily by suppressing ovulation and cyclical hormonal fluctuations, thinning and stabilizing the endometrium, and inducing progestin-mediated atrophy and anti-inflammatory effects within ectopic lesions. Continuous regimens enhance these benefits by avoiding hormone-free intervals, and while COCPs are effective for many, they are roughly equivalent in pain control to long-acting progestogens post-surgery, with the choice driven by patient preference, contraindications, and adherence considerations [^112Kz3EG] [^111XzL9V] [^113h684V] [^111CDXdg].

---

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) relieve endometriosis pain by **suppressing ovulation and menstruation** [^111CDXdg], which reduces cyclic hormonal fluctuations and endometrial proliferation [^112Kz3EG]. They also **thin the endometrium** [^1146qDgM], lowering prostaglandin production and uterine contractions, and induce atrophy of ectopic endometrial tissue [^112Kz3EG], decreasing inflammation and lesion activity. Continuous or extended regimens are preferred [^1137gvrg] to minimize hormone-free intervals and breakthrough pain [^111LM8Cr]. COCs are first-line therapy for endometriosis-related pain [^115wpZYk] and are effective for dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain [^1137gvrg].

---

## Mechanisms of pain relief

### Suppression of ovulation and menstruation

- **Ovulation suppression**: COCs inhibit gonadotropins, preventing ovulation and reducing estrogen-driven proliferation of ectopic endometrium [^112Kz3EG].

- **Menstrual suppression**: Continuous or extended regimens reduce or eliminate menstruation, decreasing retrograde flow and inflammation [^111XzL9V].

- **Hormonal stability**: Constant hormone levels avoid estrogen surges that exacerbate endometriosis pain [^111LM8Cr].

---

### Reduction of endometrial proliferation and prostaglandin production

- **Endometrial thinning**: COCs thin the endometrium, reducing prostaglandins and uterine contractions that cause pain [^1146qDgM].

- **Prostaglandin reduction**: Lower prostaglandins decrease menstrual cramps and pelvic pain [^1146qDgM].

- **Lesion atrophy**: Progestins induce atrophy of ectopic endometrium, reducing lesion activity and pain [^112Kz3EG].

---

### Anti-inflammatory effects

COCs reduce inflammatory cytokines and mediators, thereby **lowering inflammation and pain**. Estrogen-driven neuroangiogenesis is also suppressed, decreasing nerve growth and pain signaling.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting COC use

- **First-line therapy**: COCs are recommended for endometriosis-related pain [^111CDXdg] by ESHRE and ACOG [^111Fybze].

- **Pain reduction**: COCs significantly reduce dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain [^1137gvrg] [^111CDXdg].

- **Continuous regimens**: Continuous or extended COCs are more effective than cyclic dosing for pain control [^1137gvrg] [^111acqei].

---

## Comparison with other hormonal therapies

| **Therapy** | **Mechanism** | **Efficacy** | **Side effects** |
|-|-|-|-|
| COCs | Suppress ovulation, thin endometrium, anti-inflammatory | Effective for pain relief | - Breast tenderness <br/> - Mood changes <br/> - Thromboembolism |
| Progestins | Induce atrophy, suppress ovulation | Effective for pain relief | - Irregular bleeding <br/> - Mood changes <br/> - Bone loss |
| GnRH agonists | Suppress estrogen, induce hypoestrogenism | Highly effective for pain relief | - Hot flashes <br/> - Bone loss <br/> - Menopausal symptoms |

---

COCs offer a **favorable balance of efficacy and tolerability**, making them a common first-line choice [^113tXFb8].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Non-curative**: COCs control symptoms but do not cure endometriosis; pain may recur after stopping therapy [^115wpZYk].

- **Side effects**: Breast tenderness, mood changes, and thromboembolism risk should be considered [^112gTeTP].

- **Patient selection**: Contraindications include thromboembolic disorders, estrogen-dependent cancers, and certain cardiovascular conditions [^113gH8a8].

---

Combined oral contraceptives relieve endometriosis pain by **suppressing ovulation and menstruation**, thinning the endometrium, and reducing prostaglandins and inflammation. Continuous or extended regimens improve outcomes, and COCs are a first-line, effective option for many patients.

Objective

To report a patient with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome with functional endometrium treated with preoperative continuous combined low-dose monophasic oral contraceptives.

Design

Case report.

Setting

University hospital.

Patient(S)

A 12-year-old nulligravid adolescent girl.

Intervention(S)

Preoperative continuous combined low-dose monophasic oral contraceptives for 7 months, and laparoscopic resection of the rudimentary uterus and uterine horns with unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Relief of pain after hormonal treatment and the operative procedure.

Result(S)

Successful preoperative treatment of endometriosis and pain before definitive diagnosis and removal of müllerian remnants in a patient with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome.

Conclusion(S)

Patients with obstructive müllerian malformations with functional endometrium can be preoperatively managed with continuous combined low-dose monophasic oral contraceptives to control pain and treat endometriosis. This may permit a delay in surgical intervention to facilitate other investigations and to allow thorough counselling of the patient and her family about the implications of the diagnosis.

### Long-term oral contraceptive pills and postoperative pain management after laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometrioma: a randomized controlled trial [^111acqei]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate postoperative long-term cyclic and continuous administration of combined oral contraceptive (OC) pills in preventing endometriosis-related pain recurrence.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

Tertiary care university hospital.

Patient(S)

Three hundred eleven women who underwent laparoscopic excision for symptomatic ovarian endometrioma.

Intervention(S)

Patients were randomly divided into three groups: nonuser group receiving no therapy, and cyclic user group and continuous user group receiving low-dose, monophasic OC pills for 24 months in either cyclic or continuous administration.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Presence and intensity of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain were assessed by a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively.

Result(S)

A significant reduction in recurrence rate and VAS scores for dysmenorrhea was evident in the continuous users versus the other groups at 6 months, and in cyclic users versus nonusers at 18 months postoperatively. No significant differences in recurrence rate and VAS scores for dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain were demonstrated among the groups. The increase of VAS scores from 6–24 months during the study period for dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain was significantly higher in nonusers than in the other groups.

Conclusion(S)

Long-term postoperative use of OC pills can reduce the frequency and the severity of recurrent endometriosis-related dysmenorrhea.

### Progestagens and anti-progestagens for pain associated with endometriosis [^1118fiLW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory condition defined by the presence of glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. It occurs in 7% to 10% of all women of reproductive age and may present as pain or infertility. The pelvic pain may be in the form of dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia or pelvic pain. Initially a combination of estrogens and progestagens was used to create a pseudopregnancy and alleviate the symptoms associated with endometriosis. Progestagens alone or anti-progestagens have been considered as alternatives because they are inexpensive and may have a better side effect profile than other choices.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of both the progestagens and anti-progestagens in the treatment of painful symptoms ascribed to the diagnosis of endometriosis.

Search Methods

We used the search strategy of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group to identify all publications which described or might have described randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any progestagen or any anti-progestagen in the treatment of symptomatic endometriosis. We updated the review in 2011.

Selection Criteria

We considered only RCTs which compared the use of progestagens and anti-progestagens with other interventions, placebo or no treatment for the alleviation of symptomatic endometriosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We have added six new studies, bringing the total of included studies to 13 in the update of this review. The six newly included studies evaluated progestagens (comparisons with placebo, danazol, oral or subdermal contraceptive, oral contraceptive pill and danazol, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue and other drugs). The remaining studies compared the anti-progestagen gestrinone with danazol, GnRH analogues or itself.

Main Results

The progestagen medroxyprogesterone acetate (100 mg daily) appeared to be more effective at reducing all symptoms up to 12 months of follow-up (MD -0.70, 95% CI -8.61 to -5.39; P < 0.00001) compared with placebo. There was evidence of significantly more cases of acne (six versus one) and oedema (11 versus one) in the medroxyprogesterone acetate group compared with placebo. There was no evidence of a difference in objective efficacy between dydrogesterone and placebo. There was no evidence of a benefit with depot administration of progestagens versus other treatments (low dose oral contraceptive or leuprolide acetate) for reduced symptoms. The depot progestagen group experienced significantly more adverse effects. There was no overall evidence of a benefit of oral progestagens over other medical treatment at six months of follow-up for self-reported efficacy. Amenorrhoea and bleeding were more frequently reported in the progestagen group compared with other treatment groups. There was no evidence of a benefit of anti-progestagens (gestrinone) compared with danazol. GnRH analogue (leuprorelin) was found to significantly improve dysmenorrhoea compared with gestrinone (MD 0.82, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.49; P = 0.02) although it was also associated with increased hot flushes (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to -0.63; P = 0.006).

Authors' Conclusions

There is only limited evidence to support the use of progestagens and anti-progestagens for pain associated with endometriosis.

### Long acting progestogens versus combined oral contraceptive pill for preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain: the PRE-EMPT pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial [^113h684V]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of long acting progestogens compared with the combined oral contraceptive pill in preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain.

Design

The PRE-EMPT (preventing recurrence of endometriosis) pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial.

Setting

34 UK hospitals.

Participants

405 women of reproductive age undergoing conservative surgery for endometriosis.

Interventions

Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a secure internet facility to a long acting progestogen (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system) or the combined oral contraceptive pill.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was pain measured three years after randomisation using the pain domain of the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes (evaluated at six months, one, two, and three years) included the four core and six modular domains of the EHP-30, and treatment failure (further therapeutic surgery or second line medical treatment).

Results

405 women were randomised to receive a long acting progestogen (n = 205) or combined oral contraceptive pill (n = 200). At three years, there was no difference in pain scores between the groups (adjusted mean difference -0.8, 95% confidence interval -5.7 to 4.2, P = 0.76), which had improved by around 40% in both groups compared with preoperative values (an average of 24 and 23 points for long acting progestogen and combined oral contraceptive pill groups, respectively). Most of the other domains of the EHP-30 also showed improvement at all time points compared with preoperative scores, without evidence of any differences between groups. Women randomised to a long acting progestogen underwent fewer surgical procedures or second line treatments compared with those randomised to the combined oral contraceptive pill group (73 v 97; hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.00).

Conclusions

Postoperative prescription of a long acting progestogen or the combined oral contraceptive pill results in similar levels of improvement in endometriosis related pain at three years, with both groups showing around a 40% improvement compared with preoperative levels. While women can be reassured that both options are effective, the reduced risk of repeat surgery for endometriosis and hysterectomy might make long acting reversible progestogens preferable for some.

### Pharmacologic interventions for endometriosis-related pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117RLfKU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of various medications for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain through a network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register until July 22, 2024. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov for additional data on recently completed trials or potentially eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but found nothing.

Methods Of Study Selection

The analysis included randomized RCTs that used pharmacologic interventions for managing endometriosis-related pain. The primary efficacy outcome was endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, which included dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain. The analysis adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

A total of 31 RCTs involving 8,665 patients were included in the analysis. In terms of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, four interventions demonstrated significantly greater efficacy compared with placebo: leuprolide combined with combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (standardized mean difference [SMD] -1.40, 95% CI, -2.41 to -0.38), dienogest (SMD -1.20, 95% CI, -1.78 to -0.61), leuprolide alone (SMD -1.05, 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.45), and combined OCP (SMD -0.67, 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.09). Leuprolide combined with combined OCP emerged as the most effective treatment modality. In addition, elagolix and the combination of vitamin C and vitamin E were identified as the most effective interventions for dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. For nonmenstrual pelvic pain, gestrinone demonstrated superior efficacy compared with placebo and all other interventions.

Conclusion

This network meta-analysis indicates that leuprolide in combination with combined OCP, elagolix, vitamins C and E, and gestrinone may represent the most effective therapeutic options for alleviating endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain. These findings enhance our understanding of the relative efficacy of treatment strategies for pain associated with endometriosis. Future research should focus on conducting larger-scale and rigorously designed clinical trials within the target patient populations to further validate these results.

### Long acting progestogens versus combined oral contraceptive pill for preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain: the PRE-EMPT pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial [^1168sEXm]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was the recurrence of symptoms as evaluated by the pain domain of the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30, where 0 is best score and 100 is worst score) three years after randomisation. The EHP-30 is a validated condition specific tool to assess impact on quality of life by endometriosis.

Secondary clinical outcome measures included the remaining EHP-30 core domains (control and powerlessness, emotional wellbeing, social support, self-image) and optional modular domains (work, relationship with children, sexual relationship, feelings about the medical profession, treatment, and infertility). Other secondary outcomes were pain during periods, during intercourse, and at any other time (measured by a visual analogue scale, where 0 was no pain and 100 was worst imaginable pain), a four point ordinal global impression of change in pain, menstrual regularity on a four point ordinal scale, the Fatigue Severity Score, generic quality of life (measured by EQ-5D-5L), and capabilities (ICECAP-A — ICEpop CAPability measure for Adults). The results of ICECAP will be presented and discussed in a separate economics paper. Further surgery (laparoscopy to investigate recurrent pain, to treat endometriosis, or hysterectomy) or the use of gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogues were used as a proxy for treatment failure, with a return to preoperative EHP-30 scores also added to these as a further outcome. Change or cessation of randomised treatment, which did not necessitate withdrawal from the trial, were classed as discontinuation. Serious events were classed as those requiring hospital admission or resulting in death or disability, and were categorised as expected or unexpected, and related or unrelated to trial treatment.

Outcomes were collated in a participant completed questionnaire booklet at baseline and then at six months, one, two, and three years. Participants who did not return questionnaires were contacted by telephone to collect the primary outcomes (clinical and economic) and information on further treatment or pregnancy. Other secondary outcomes were not obtained for the telephone completed shortened questionnaire. Data on further surgical procedures and second line medical treatments for endometriosis were obtained directly from participants and also the hospital records of non-responders.

### Long acting progestogens versus combined oral contraceptive pill for preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain: the PRE-EMPT pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial [^111cczKe]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

There were 21 serious adverse events in 14 women in the LAP group and 17 events in 15 women in the COCP group (P = 0.79), none directly related to the trial treatment. Seven reports (four in LAP group, three in COCP group) were linked to planned pregnancy and birth, eight (four in each group) associated with recurrent pain, and seven (four LAP, three COCP) were associated with the index endometriosis surgery. The remainder were incidental hospital admissions.

### Does nomegestrol acetate plus 17 β-estradiol oral contraceptive improve endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain in women? [^112xmwcH]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the study group and the control group at baseline. At the 3-month follow-up, 10 (10.1%) women of study group discontinued COC due to spotting; at the 6-month follow-up the dropout rate was 12.1% (12 women). Therefore, 77 (77.8%) women completed the study. However, in their daily diary women recorded mild adverse events at the 3-month follow-up, which did not provoke discontinuation, namely spotting (16 = 16.2%), nausea (12 = 12.2%), or breast tenderness (13 = 13.2%). Finally, 17 (17.2%) and 29 (29.3%) women had amenorrhea at the 3-month follow-up and the 6-month follow-up, respectively.

Table 1.
Demographic Characteristics

The dropout rate of the control group was 9.5% (6 women) and 28.6% (18 women) at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, respectively. Consequently, 39 (61.9%) women completed the study. They did not record any adverse events during the usage of on-demand NSAIDs, either at the 3- or 6-month follow-ups.

The intragroup analysis showed an improvement of the VAS score at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups of women on E2/NOMAC (p < 0.001). No change was observed in the control group from baseline to both the follow-ups (p ≤ 0.4). The intergroup comparison between baseline values showed no differences (p ≤ 0.4). On the contrary, the comparison was statistically significant at the 3-month (p < 0.001) and the 6-month follow-ups (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1).

### Oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists for treating endometriosis-associated pain: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115ohUSs]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the use of oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists and synthesize their efficacy and safety parameters for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

Premenopausal women with endometriosis who had experienced moderate or severe pain.

Intervention(S)

The Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and MEDLINE were searched until April 10, 2022. Only randomized controlled trials were included. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2. A Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis was used to perform indirect comparisons. I² was used to assess the global heterogeneity. Relative treatment estimates were performed. Treatment ranking was performed through the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Endometriosis-associated pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and noncyclic pelvic pain reduction.

Result

(s): Five studies and 6 randomized controlled trials, including a total of 2,796 women and 10 different doses of oral GnRH antagonist treatments, were eligible for inclusion. All studies were considered to have a low risk of bias. Almost all efficacy- and safety-related outcomes showed a dose-response relationship. Regarding endometriosis-associated pain, the top 3 treatments were elagolix 400 mg, linzagolix 75 mg, and linzagolix 200 mg, with mean differences of -1.26 (95% credible interval [CrI], -1.70 to -0.79), -0.98 (95% CrI, -1.84 to -0.15), and -0.98 (95% CrI, -1.90 to -0.064), respectively. The top 3 treatments to decrease dysmenorrhea were relugolix 40 mg, elagolix 400 mg, and relugolix 20 mg, with mean differences of -1.60 (95% CrI, -2.07 to -1.14), -1.25 (95% CrI, -1.56 to -0.95), and -1.10 (95% CrI, -1.59 to -0.62), respectively. However, only high-dose treatments were significantly associated with most quality of life- and adverse effect-related outcomes. Relugolix 40 and 20 mg and elagolix 400 mg, with odds ratios of 6.88 (95% CrI, 2.18–24.58), 1.60 (95% CrI, 0.62–4.13), and 1.85 (95% CrI, 1.05–3.30), had a significantly increased incidence of adverse events.

Conclusion

(s): Oral GnRH antagonists are effective for endometriosis-associated pain and dysmenorrhea and the patient global impression. The incidence of ovarian hypoestrogenic effects in a short-term duration was significant in a dose-effect response, particularly the highest dose.

### Reevaluating response and failure of medical treatment of endometriosis: a systematic review [^115phdkp]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1
Characteristics of articles in the study.

The most common classes of therapy included in the study were GnRH agonists and progestins (14 articles each). During screening of abstracts, three clinical studies were identified that reported on the use of NSAIDs to treat women with endometriosis; however, all were excluded on the basis of low patient numbers. Despite being widely prescribed for women with endometriosis, CHCs were the focus of only three eligible articles. These comprised one RCT comparing COCs with placebo, one prospective cohort study of continuous and cyclic COC regimens after surgical treatment, and a patient preference study of the contraceptive ring and patch. The treatments reported varied according to date of publication, reflecting the shift in medical therapy from danazol and gestrinone (publication years 1982–1998) and GnRH agonists (publication years 1988–2000) to progestins (publication years 2000–2016) and CHCs (publication years 2008–2013). Most studies of drugs for which approval for endometriosis treatment was sought, including GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, and progestins, were funded by industry, whereas none of the three studies of CHCs received industry funding.

Most articles described two or more treatment groups; there were 125 treatment arms in total. Most studies (79.3%) included assessment of endometriosis-associated pain. The most commonly used methods were 4-point subjective scales (22.4%), VAS score (22.4%), and the Biberoglu and Behrman score or modified versions thereof (15.5%). Three studies (5.2%) used more than one method to measure pain symptoms. Data for the response of pain symptoms to treatment were presented in only 29 of the 58 articles identified. Information was available in different studies for pelvic tenderness and the following pain symptoms: dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, nonmenstrual pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dyschezia, and abdominal pain. Separate data on induration were reported in only four studies and therefore were not extracted. No studies reported on the entire spectrum of endometriosis-associated pain symptoms; 25 studies included data on three or more pain symptoms.

Objective

To compare the effects of dienogest and a combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) after laparoscopic surgery on pain and quality of life in women with severe endometriosis.

Methods

A randomized double-blind pilot study was conducted from March 2018 to March 2020 in women with severe endometriosis confirmed by laparoscopic surgery. A total of 108 patients who had undergone laparoscopic surgery received dienogest, COCP, or placebo daily for 6 months. Primary and secondary outcomes were compared between the three groups.

Results

Treatment with dienogest or COCP was associated with improved self-reported pain after 6 months of treatment, as evidenced by significantly lower scores for pelvic pain and dyspareunia compared with placebo (P < 0.05). Significant differences in overall quality of life score were observed over 6 months in the dienogest, COCP, and placebo groups (mean difference 22.00, 23.45, and 6.45 points, respectively; P < 0.001). Post-hoc analysis revealed a significant difference in overall quality of life score between the placebo group and the dienogest (P < 0.001) and COCP groups (P = 0.004).

Conclusion

Postoperative administration of dienogest or COCP reduced endometriosis-associated pain and improved quality of life in women with severe endometriosis.

### Does nomegestrol acetate plus 17 β-estradiol oral contraceptive improve endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain in women? [^113Xgdq1]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary end point of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 6 months' treatment with E2/NOMAC COC in women affected by endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain. Women had an improvement in their chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia, recorded by VAS at the 3-month follow-up compared to the baseline values; this benefit was maintained until the end of the study. On the contrary, women on NSAIDs did not have benefits during their usage. The progressive reduction of the pain syndrome reported by women on E2/NOMAC COC could have contributed to improve their QoL and their sexual life further (secondary end point). Assessment of their QoL is a crucial parameter to take into account before concluding on the efficacy of a treatment. Improvement in somatic and mental scores by the SF-36 was observed in women on COC at both follow-ups.

Moreover, a gradual improvement of sexual function and a reduction of sexual distress starting from the 3-month follow-up until the 6-month follow-up was observed. The benefits obtained by women on E2/NOMAC were not observed in those using on-demand NSAIDs. Particularly, even if the women on NSAIDs had improved FSFI scores at both the follow-ups and improved FSDS score at the 6-month follow-up, however the scores remained under the cutoffs. Beyond these considerations of intragroup comparison between follow-ups and baseline values, the improvement of the pain symptoms, the QoL, sexual function, and sexual distress was more evident in women on E2/NOMAC than in those on NSAIDs, when the study group and control group values were compared at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Moreover, at the end of the study the rate of satisfaction was better (or higher?) in women on E2/NOMAC COC than in those on NSAIDs.

Materials and Methods

The departmental institutional review board approved the study. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Helsinki Declaration. Informed written consent was obtained from each woman before entering the study, and they did not receive payment of any kind. The time of enrollment was from October 2017 to March 2019.

Two hundred fifty-five women aged 18–39 years old (mean age 26.7 ± 7.6), affected by chronic pelvic pain, were invited to participate in a comparative, open-label prospective study at the Chronic Pelvic Pain Clinic of the Gynecological Unity, Department of General Surgery and Medical Surgical Specialties, University of Catania, Italy. Each woman had been using on-demand NSAIDs from 15 months to 8 years. Before enrollment, medical, surgical, and medication history were assessed to ensure study eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria for combined oral contraceptive (COC) usage. Moreover, women under gonadotropin releasing hormone analog treatment within the last 6 months or hormonal contraceptive treatment within the last 3 months were excluded.

Furthermore, women had to be sexually active, having had at least one sexual activity during the month before counseling, without desiring procreation in the following 6 months after the start of the study. Women with a history of nonorganic sexual dysfunction or having a partner affected by sexual dysfunction were excluded. A psychosexual investigation was performed by S.C.

Moreover, physical and gynecological examinations and transvaginal sonography (TVS), to rule out rectovaginal endometriosis ovarian endometria or adenomyosis, were performed. Based on the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology guidelines, only women affected by chronic pelvic pain with a clinical suspicion of endometriosis, such as dysmenorrhea, noncyclical chronic pelvic pain, or deep dyspareunia, were included. Consequently, 93 (36.4%) women with ultrasound-based evidence of endometriosis were excluded from participating in the study. Of these 33 (12.9%), 31 (12.2%) and 29 (11.3%) women were diagnosed by TVS to have rectovaginal endometriosis, ovarian endometrioma, or adenomyosis, respectively. Finally, 162 (63.6%) women participated in the study.

Results

Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the study group and the control group at baseline. At the 3rd and the 6th month follow-ups, 3 (5.6%) and 2 (3.7%) women of study group, respectively, discontinued treatment due to spotting. Those patients were prescribed combined oral contraceptive treatment in a continuous regimen. Moreover, at the 12th, and 18th month follow-ups, 2 (3.7%) and 4 (7.4%) women, respectively, discontinued DNG to plan a pregnancy. None of the patients from the study group underwent surgical treatment. Therefore, 43 (79.6%) women completed the study. Moreover, women reported mild adverse events at the 3rd month follow-up, which did not provoke discontinuation, namely spotting (9 = 16.6%), nausea (7 = 12.9%) or breast tenderness (8 = 14.3%). Finally, at the 3rd and the 6th month follow-ups, 10 (20.4%) and 39 (79.6%) women underwent amenorrhea, respectively. Amenorrhea rate was 88.3% at the 24th month follow-up. Eight women (21.1%) of the control group decided to undergo surgical treatment and 30 (78.9%) chose to continue using their previous on-demand NSAIDs. They reported mainly nausea (23 = 76.5%) during the usage of on-demand NSAIDs. Finally, 5 women (16.6%) chose to adopt a combined oral contraceptive during the period between the 6th and 18th month of the study, and 3 (10%) dropped out at the 24 th month. Consequently, 22 (73.3%) women completed the study.

In light of the above, using a COC containing E2 could lead to fewer negative effects than EE on the endometriosis tissue. Unlike some other progestins, NOMAC is a 19-norprogesterone derivative that binds specifically to the progesterone receptor, exerts strong antiestrogenic effects, and has potent antigonadotropic activity; it reaches a peak serum concentration within 4 hours after oral administration, with a half-life of ∼50 hours. Because of its long half-life compared with other contraceptive progestins it is able to cover the 4-day hormone-free interval. Consequently, E2/NOMAC COC has a prevalent progestogen activity, reducing bleeding; moreover, amenorrhea increased somewhat over time with E2/NOMAC COC use.

In our study 29.3% women had amenorrhea. Considering the retrograde flow of menstrual tissue through the fallopian tubes to be the most widely accepted explanation of endometriosis pathogenesis, the reduction or absence of bleeding in women on E2/NOMAC could be a useful effect.

Our study performed a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, but it is necessary to point out that to definitively diagnose the major forms of endometriosis, laparoscopy remains the gold standard. This could be a limitation of our study. However, today pelvic pain, when supposed to be due to endometriosis, can be treated without a definitive diagnosis using a hormonal drug to reduce menstrual flow, especially when women refer to be affected not only by chronic pelvic pain but also by dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia.

It is important to consider that chronic pelvic pain usually starts during adolescence. In fact, most women affected by pelvic pain report symptoms beginning after menarche; they also report a longer time and worse experience before obtaining a diagnosis. Consequently, treatment is often started several years later, not always restricting the progression of endometriosis. Early diagnosis is essential to decrease pain and hopefully prevent disease progression and preserve future fertility. Usually the pain symptoms reappear when COC intake is discontinued. Consequently, its usage has to be for a long time. To choose a COC with natural estrogen, such as E2, and a progestogen with a strong receptor binding for ectopic endometrium, such as NOMAC, could avoid adverse metabolic events in users.

### Oral contraceptives for pain associated with endometriosis [^114hHzkt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition which affects many women of reproductive age worldwide and is a major cause of pain and infertility. The modern oral contraceptive pill is widely used to treat pain occurring as a result of endometriosis, although the evidence for its efficacy is limited.

Objectives

To assess the effects of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) in comparison to other treatments for painful symptoms of endometriosis in women of reproductive age.

Search Strategy

We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2006); EMBASE (1980 to September 2006); National Research Register; and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

All truly randomised controlled trials of the use of oral contraceptive pills in the treatment of women of reproductive age with symptoms ascribed to the diagnosis of endometriosis and made visually at surgical procedure were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two review authors. One of the assessors was an expert in the content matter. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

Only one study met the inclusion criteria, in which a total of 57 women were allocated to two groups to compare an OCP to a GnRH analogue. Methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were unclear and the study was acknowledged by its authors to be underpowered. Women in the GnRH analogue group became amenorrhoeic during the treatment period of six months, whilst women in the OCP group reported a decrease in dysmenorrhoea. No evidence of a significant difference between the two groups was observed in terms of dysmenorrhoea at six months follow up after stopping treatment (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.90). Some evidence for a decrease in dyspareunia was found at the end of treatment in women in the GnRH analogue group, although no evidence of a significant difference in dyspareunia was observed at the end of the six months follow up (OR 4.87; 95% CI 0.96 to 24.65).

Authors' Conclusions

The limited data we found available suggests that this is no evidence of a difference in outcomes between the the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) studied and GnRH analogue was as effective as a GnRH analogue in treating for endometriosis-associated painful symptoms of endometriosis. However, the lack of studies with larger sample sizes, or focusing on other comparable treatments is concerning and further research is needed to fully evaluate fully the role of OCPs oral contraceptive pills in managing symptoms associated with ement of endometriosis.

### Long acting progestogens versus combined oral contraceptive pill for preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain: the PRE-EMPT pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial [^113G3trv]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Trial design

The PRE-EMPT (preventing recurrence of endometriosis) trial was a multicentre, pragmatic, parallel group, open label, superiority randomised controlled trial. In response to clinician and patient feedback that treatment preferences might prevent randomisation to a multiarm trial, the study was designed prospectively to be adaptive, based on feasibility of recruitment; the full methods have been detailed previously. In brief, during an internal pilot phase, patients could enter the study provided they were willing to be randomised to at least one form of LAP (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate — DMPA, or the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system — LNG-IUS) and at least one intervention that was not a LAP (COCP or no treatment). At the end of this pilot phase, a report was provided to a joint trial steering committee and data monitoring committee describing the frequency of randomisation options chosen so that a feasible design including the most commonly chosen options could be agreed for the remainder of the study. A qualitative assessment was also conducted during this time, the results of which fed into any decisions about trial design. The treatment options described below reflect the revised design that compares LAP as a class of treatments (DMPA or LNG-IUS) versus COCP.

The protocol (supplementary material 1) received clinical trial authorisation (EudraCT 2013–001984–21) from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority and a favourable ethical opinion from the East of Scotland Ethics Committee (14/ES1004). The trial was prospectively registered in the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN97865475;). A statistical analysis plan was generated for the clinical trial (supplementary material 2), and all participants provided written informed consent. We used the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) checklist when writing this report.

### Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for endometriosis [^115rvsDK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition affecting 6 to 11% of reproductive-age women and may cause dyspareunia, dysmenorrhoea, and infertility. One treatment strategy is medical therapy with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) to reduce pain due to endometriosis. One of the adverse effects of GnRHas is a decreased bone mineral density. In addition to assessing the effect on pain, quality of life, most troublesome symptom and patients' satisfaction, the current review also evaluated the effect on bone mineral density and risk of adverse effects in women with endometriosis who use GnRHas versus other treatment options.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of GnRH analogues (GnRHas) in the treatment of painful symptoms associated with endometriosis and to determine the effects of GnRHas on bone mineral density of women with endometriosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the trial registries in May 2022 together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared GnRHas with other hormonal treatment options, including analgesics, danazol, intra-uterine progestogens, oral or injectable progestogens, gestrinone and also GnRHas compared with no treatment or placebo. Trials comparing GnRHas versus GnRHas in conjunction with add-back therapy (hormonal or non-hormonal) or calcium-regulation agents were also included in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodology as recommended by Cochrane. Primary outcomes are relief of overall pain and the objective measurement of bone mineral density. Secondary outcomes include adverse effects, quality of life, improvement in the most troublesome symptoms and patient satisfaction. Due to high risk of bias associated with some of the studies, primary analyses of all review outcomes were restricted to studies at low risk of selection bias. Sensitivity analysis including all studies was then performed.

Main Results

Seventy-two studies involving 7355 patients were included. The evidence was very low to low quality: the main limitations of all studies were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious imprecision. Trials comparing GnRHas versus no treatment We did not identify any studies. Trials comparing GnRHas versus placebo There may be a decrease in overall pain, reported as pelvic pain scores (RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.41 to 3.24, 1 RCT, n = 87, low-certainty evidence), dysmenorrhoea scores (RR 2.25; 95% CI 1.59 to 3.16, 1 RCT, n = 85, low-certainty evidence), dyspareunia scores (RR 2.21; 95% CI 1.39 to 3.54, 1 RCT, n = 59, low-certainty evidence), and pelvic tenderness scores (RR 2.28; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.50, 1 RCT, n = 85, low-certainty evidence) after three months of treatment. We are uncertain of the effect for pelvic induration, based on the results found after three months of treatment (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.79, 1 RCT, n = 81, low-certainty evidence). Besides, treatment with GnRHas may be associated with a greater incidence of hot flushes at three months of treatment (RR 3.08; 95% CI 1.89 to 5.01, 1 RCT, n = 100, low-certainty evidence). Trials comparing GnRHas versus danazol For overall pain, for women treated with either GnRHas or danazol, a subdivision was made between pelvic tenderness, partly resolved and completely resolved. We are uncertain about the effect on relief of overall pain, when a subdivision was made for overall pain (MD -0.30; 95% CI -1.66 to 1.06, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low-certainty evidence), pelvic pain (MD 0.20; 95% CI -0.26 to 0.66, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low-certainty evidence), dysmenorrhoea (MD 0.10; 95% CI -0.49 to 0.69, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low-certainty evidence), dyspareunia (MD -0.20; 95% CI -0.77 to 0.37, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low-certainty evidence), pelvic induration (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.59 to 0.39, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low-certainty evidence), and pelvic tenderness (MD -0.20; 95% CI -0.78 to 0.38, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low-certainty evidence) after three months of treatment. For pelvic pain (MD 0.50; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.90, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low-certainty evidence) and pelvic induration (MD 0.70; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.19, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low-certainty evidence), the complaints may decrease slightly after treatment with GnRHas, compared to danazol, for six months of treatment. Trials comparing GnRHas versus analgesics We did not identify any studies. Trials comparing GnRHas versus intra-uterine progestogens We did not identify any low risk of bias studies. Trials comparing GnRHas versus GnRHas in conjunction with calcium-regulating agents There may be a slight decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) after 12 months treatment with GnRHas, compared to GnRHas in conjunction with calcium-regulating agents for anterior-posterior spine (MD -7.00; 95% CI -7.53 to -6.47, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low-certainty evidence) and lateral spine (MD -12.40; 95% CI -13.31 to -11.49, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For relief of overall pain, there may be a slight decrease in favour of treatment with GnRHas compared to placebo or oral or injectable progestogens. We are uncertain about the effect when comparing GnRHas with danazol, intra-uterine progestogens or gestrinone. For BMD, there may be a slight decrease when women are treated with GnRHas, compared to gestrinone. There was a bigger decrease of BMD in favour of GnRHas, compared to GnRHas in conjunction with calcium-regulating agents. However, there may be a slight increase in adverse effects when women are treated with GnRHas, compared to placebo or gestrinone. Due to a very low to low certainty of the evidence, a wide range of outcome measures and a wide range of outcome measurement instruments, the results should be interpreted with caution.

### Dysmenorrhea, a narrative review of therapeutic options [^116usVBu]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Hormonal-Based Therapy: Hormonal Contraception

Another pharmacologic treatment for primary dysmenorrhea is hormonal-based contraception. For women who are agreeable to hormonal treatment and desire contraception in addition to dysmenorrhea treatment, hormonal contraception is a good option. Estrogen prevents the release of FSH, ultimately preventing ovulation. Progesterone causes thinning of the endometrial lining and thickening of cervical mucus, preventing sperm from penetrating. A thin endometrial lining has less arachidonic acid to be used for prostaglandin synthesis, thus reducing both blood flow and contractions during menstruation.

There are many forms of combined estrogen-progesterone therapies such as oral contraception pills (OCPs), a transdermal patch, or a vaginal ring. A Cochrane review article investigating oral contraceptive use identified twenty-one randomized control trials comparing OCPs with placebo, different dosages of OCPs, and OCPs versus NSAIDs. The review found that OCPs reduce pain significantly more than placebo pills in women who suffer from dysmenorrhea. However, OCPs increase the risk of side effects, including irregular bleeding and headaches, and have been known to increase the risk of adverse events, such as blood clots. The data were insufficient to determine if continuous OCPs (no inactive tablets) were superior to the standard regiment of 21 days of hormone pills. There was also insufficient evidence in this review comparing NSAIDs and OCPs. Furthermore, rates of symptom relief were similar with estrogen doses < 35mcg or > 35mcg. There are limited data investigating the use of an estrogen vaginal ring or transdermal patch in the treatment of dysmenorrhea. One review showed evidence that the vaginal ring works as well as OCPs for symptom relief, while another randomized trial suggested OCPs have better efficacy than the transdermal patch. Nonetheless, the decision to implement estrogen-based therapies and the route of administration should be a shared decision between women and doctor with the women's medical history taken into consideration.

### Medical management of endometriosis-associated pain [^113tXFb8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In the coming years, basic science research into the mechanisms of endometriosis development and persistence almost certainly will open new avenues for treatment. A wide armamentarium of medical therapies already exists, however. The efficacy of most of these methods in reducing endometriosis-associated pain is well established. The choice of which to use depends largely on patient preference after an appropriate discussion of risks, side effects, and cost. Typically, oral contraceptives and NSAIDs are first-line therapy because of their low cost and mild side effects (Box 6). Because of its greater potential for suppressing endometrial development, consideration should be given to prescribing a low-dose monophasic oral contraceptive continuously. If adequate relief is not obtained or if side effects prove intolerable, consideration should be given to the use of progestins (oral, intramuscular, or IUD) or a GnRH agonist with immediate add-back therapy. Progestins are less expensive, but GnRH agonists with add-back may be better tolerated. If none of these medications proves beneficial or if side effects are too pronounced, then repeat surgery is warranted. The surgery may have analgesic value and serves to reconfirm the diagnosis. Finally, if endometriosis is identified at the time of surgery, then consideration should be given to prescribing medical therapy postoperatively.

### Practice bulletin no. 114: management of endometriosis [^113MTMsK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for endometriosis, more specifically with respect to management outcomes, ACOG 2010 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- medical suppressive therapy improves pain symptoms; however, recurrence rates are high after the medication is discontinued

- medical suppressive therapies such as oral contraceptives or GnRH agonists for endometriosis-associated infertility are ineffective

- there is significant short-term improvement in pain after conservative surgical treatment; however, as with medical management, there is also a significant rate of pain recurrence

- surgical management of endometriosis-related infertility improves pregnancy rates, but the magnitude of improvement is unclear.

### Reevaluating response and failure of medical treatment of endometriosis: a systematic review [^117LJgFx]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Surprisingly, median rates of discontinuation due to adverse events or lack of efficacy were consistently low across different therapies, with discontinuation rates of 5%–9% among patients treated with CHCs, progestins, danazol, GnRH agonists, or GnRH antagonists. Among patients who received GnRH agonists with add-back therapy, 12% discontinued treatment. For the synthetic steroid hormone gestrinone, this value was 16%; however, it may be difficult to draw meaningful comparisons between discontinuation rates for therapies that are self-administered daily and those that are administered by injection once every 12 weeks.

Limited data on patient-centered ratings of treatment satisfaction were reported in the included studies. They were evaluated in only five studies, which showed that a median of 61% of women who received CHCs or a progestin were satisfied with their treatment. Interestingly, in one study, the proportion of women who were dissatisfied with CHC treatment was approximately one-half that of women who had pain remaining at the end of CHC treatment (31% and 59%, respectively). These results indicate that some women are satisfied with their treatment even if it does not completely relieve their pain. A meta-analysis comparing measures of treatment outcome in women with endometriosis found that, although the patient-reported VAS pain score correlates well with the Clinical Global Impression efficacy index, it accounts for only 28% of the variability between different scales measuring patient-reported treatment satisfaction. This demonstrates that both patient-reported pain and clinician-assessed treatment efficacy are not the only aspects of living with endometriosis that affect women's quality of life, and it highlights the need to assess both endometriosis-associated pain and health-related quality of life with the use of a disease-specific tool.

### Estrogen-progestins and progestins for the management of endometriosis [^112Kz3EG]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is characterized by frequent recurrences of symptoms and lesions even after extirpative surgery. Because medical therapies control but do not cure the disease, long periods of pharmacologic management may be needed until pregnancy desire or, sometimes, physiologic menopause. Hormonal drugs suppress ovulation and menstruation and have similar beneficial effects against pain. However, only estrogen-progestins and progestins have safety/tolerability/cost profiles that allow long-term use. These compounds induce atrophy of eutopic and ectopic endometrium, have antiinflammatory and proapoptotic properties, and can be delivered via different modalities, including oral, transdermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, vaginal, and intrauterine routes. At least two-thirds of symptomatic women are relieved from pain and achieve appreciable improvements in health-related quality of life. Progesterone resistance may cause nonresponse in the remaining one-third. When using estrogen-progestins continuously, individualized, tailored cycling should be explained to improve compliance. All combinations demonstrated a similar effect on dysmenorrhea, independently from progestin type. Estrogen-progestins with the lowest possible estrogen dose should be chosen to combine optimal lesion suppression and thrombotic risk limitation. Progestins should be suggested in women who do not respond or manifest intolerance to estrogen-progestins and in those with dyspareunia and/or deep lesions. Progestins do not increase significantly the thrombotic risk and generally may be used when estrogens are contraindicated. Estrogen-progestins and progestins reduce the incidence of postoperative endometrioma recurrence and show a protective effect against endometriosis-associated epithelial ovarian cancer risk.

### Patient-physician interactions regarding dyspareunia with endometriosis: online survey results [^113SSumA]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study and others, indicate that women's experiences with dyspareunia can negatively impact the lives of patients and may be associated with anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem, highlighting a need for effective disease management. A previous study that used a sample population recruited from the same social media network found that the majority of women (61.5% in the United States and 69.4% outside the United States) were disappointed with their healthcare practitioner. This previous study also found that the treatment goals of practitioners were usually not aligned with women's own goals and needs. These findings complement results from our current study, which suggest that women may not be getting sufficient information about their dyspareunia or effective treatments to mitigate their pain and lessen the negative impact painful sex has on daily lives. Indeed, 36% of surveyed women reported that the medical advice provided by their healthcare practitioner was ineffective in addressing their pain. Whereas the details of the medical advice provided to the participants are not clear, the benefits of surgical and medical methods to improve dyspareunia are well documented. Many women in our study (42%) reported their healthcare practitioners recommended surgery. In addition to pelvic floor physical therapy and psychological therapies, a variety of medications to lesson dyspareunia are also available. However, women in our study reported that healthcare practitioners rarely recommended these treatments. Ospemifene (Duchesnay USA, Rosemont, Pennsylvania) and prasterone (AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc. Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) were the two medications indicated for dyspareunia that were most frequently prescribed to patients in our study, but they have not been studied extensively in a younger population of women with endometriosis. Combined oral contraceptives can also be effective in relieving pain, but they do come with some negative sexual effects and may lead to mood disorders in some women. Elagolix (AbbVie Inc. North Chicago, Illinois, USA) is an additional medication for the treatment of dyspareunia and other endometriosis-associated pain and was recently approved in the United States and Canada. This medication has been found to improve women's pain and quality of sexual relationships. Although medications may be effective, they can be cost prohibitive since out-of-pocket costs can total to thousands of dollars for the uninsured over the course of a year. Even the $15 to $50 monthly out-of-pocket costs for oral contraceptives are not trivial for many women. Educating practitioners about these and other treatment options and encouraging them to listen to patient needs may help more women find a treatment option that works for their unique needs. Patients who are satisfied with their healthcare have also been shown to be more likely to continue visiting their practitioner and adhere to prescribed treatments.

### Evaluation and treatment of endometriosis [^1151z8Tj]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Endometriosis, which affects up to 10 percent of reproductive-aged women, is the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterine cavity. It is more common in women with pelvic pain or infertility (25 to 40 percent and 70 to 90 percent, respectively). Some women with endometriosis are asymptomatic, whereas others present with symptoms such as debilitating pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and decreased fertility. Diagnosis of endometriosis in primary care is predominantly clinical. Initial treatment includes common agents used for primary dysmenorrhea, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combination estrogen/progestin contraceptives, or progestin-only contraceptives. There is some evidence that these agents are helpful and have few adverse effects. Referral to a gynecologist is necessary if symptoms persist or the patient is unable to become pregnant. Laparoscopy is commonly used to confirm the diagnosis before additional treatments are pursued. Further treatments include gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, danazol, or surgical removal of ectopic endometrial tissue. These interventions may control symptoms more effectively than initial treatments, but they can have significant adverse effects and limits on duration of therapy.

### ESHRE guideline: endometriosis [^115dKsg4]. Human Reproduction Open (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for endometriosis, more specifically with respect to analgesics, ESHRE 2022 guidelines recommend to consider offering NSAIDs or other analgesics (either alone or in combination with other treatments) to reduce endometriosis-associated pain.

### Long acting progestogens versus combined oral contraceptive pill for preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain: the PRE-EMPT pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial [^111GmUhc]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Sample size

The final sample size calculation reflected the changes to the trial design at the end of the internal pilot phase. The original sample size conservatively assumed the possibility that all treatment options would be taken forward and up to six comparisons would be made; this would require extensive multiplicity adjustments. Because only one main comparison was taken forward, a smaller sample size was needed in the final design. The revised estimate of the standard deviation was taken from pooled baseline data at the end of this pilot phase. These changes were approved by the trial steering committee and data monitoring committee and were made blind to any accruing follow-up data.

To detect an eight point difference on the EHP-30 pain domain with 90% power (P = 0.05) and assuming a standard deviation of 22 points required 160 participants per group, 320 in total. To account for a 20% loss to follow-up, this target was inflated to 400. The size of difference targeted (0.36 standard deviation) was considered to be small (0.2 standard deviation) to moderate (0.5 standard deviation). This sample size would also provide 80% power to detect a 10-point difference in the two stratified analyses of LNG-IUS versus COCP, and DMPA versus COCP provided similar numbers were recruited to the DMPA and LNG-IUS groups.

### Use of combined hormonal contraceptives for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain: a systematic review of the evidence [^1137gvrg]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the available clinical evidence on the use of combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) agents (estrogen [E]-progestin combinations) for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain.

Design

A systematic review of the MEDLINE, Embase, and Derwent Drug File databases for prospective clinical studies.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

Women with endometriosis diagnosed by validated means.

Intervention(S)

Combined hormonal contraceptive agents, active comparators, placebo, or no treatment.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Endometriosis-related pain (dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia).

Result(S)

Nine randomized controlled trials and nine observational studies met the inclusion criteria. The quality of data was low: only two of the nine randomized trials were placebo controlled, and most trials were not blinded. The CHC agents were reported to significantly reduce dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia from baseline in most studies; continuous administration seemed to be more useful than cyclic administration. The effectiveness of CHC agents for pain reduction was similar to or less than that of oral progestins and GnRH agonists.

Conclusion(S)

The available literature suggests that CHC treatment is effective for relief of endometriosis-related dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia; however, the supportive data are of low quality. Furthermore, insufficient data exist to reach conclusions about the overall superiority of any given CHC therapy, and the relative benefit in comparison to other approaches. Additional high-quality studies are needed to clarify the role of CHC agents and other treatments in women with endometriosis-related pain.

### Does nomegestrol acetate plus 17 β-estradiol oral contraceptive improve endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain in women? [^112T9kHp]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: To evaluate the effects of a 24/4 regimen combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 1.5 mg 17β-estradiol (E2) and 2.5 mg nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) compared to on-demand nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on women affected by endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain (the primary end point) and their quality of life (QoL) and sexual function (the secondary end points).

Materials and Methods: Ninety-nine women on E2/NOMAC constituted the study group; and 63 women on NSAIDs constituted the control group. The visual analogic scale was used to measure the levels of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia. To assess their QoL, sexual function, and sexual distress, the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) were used, respectively. The study included two follow-ups at 3 and 6 months.

Results: Improvement in chronic pelvic pain was observed in the study group at both the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (p < 0.001). SF-36, FSFI, and FSDS had a similar trend at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (p < 0.001). Women on NSAIDs did not report any reduction in pain symptoms or improvement in QoL (p ≤ 0.4). However, they had a limited improvement of their FSFI and FSDS (p < 0.001). The improvement of the pain symptoms, QoL, FSFI, and FSDS, was more evident in women on E2/NOMAC than in those on NSAIDs, when the study group and control group values were compared at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (p < 0.001).

Conclusions: Women on E2/NOMAC COC showed a better reduction of endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain and an improvement of their QoL and sexual activity than those of the women on NSAIDs.

### Diagnosis and management of endometriosis [^1175VBxn]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Signs and symptoms of endometriosis are nonspecific, and an acceptably accurate noninvasive diagnostic test has yet to be reported. Serum markers do not provide adequate diagnostic accuracy. The preferred method for diagnosis of endometriosis is surgical visual inspection of pelvic organs with histologic confirmation. Such diagnosis requires an experienced surgeon because the varied appearance of the disease allows less-obvious lesions to be overlooked. Empiric use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen is a reasonable symptomatic treatment, but the effectiveness of these agents has not been well-studied. Oral contraceptive pills, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and intrauterine levonorgestrel are relatively effective for pain relief. Danazol and various gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues also are effective but may have significant side effects. There is limited evidence that surgical ablation of endometriotic deposits may decrease pain and increase fertility rates in women with endometriosis. Presacral neurectomy is particularly beneficial in women with midline pelvic pain. Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy definitively treat pain from endometriosis at 10 years in 90 percent of patients.

### Endometriosis: an overview of cochrane reviews [^116XCies]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This overview reports on interventions for pain relief and for subfertility in pre-menopausal women with clinically diagnosed endometriosis.

Objectives

The objective of this overview was to summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on treatment options for women with pain or subfertility associated with endometriosis.

Methods

Published Cochrane systematic reviews reporting pain or fertility outcomes in women with clinically diagnosed endometriosis were eligible for inclusion in the overview. We also identified Cochrane reviews in preparation (protocols and titles) for future inclusion. The reviews, protocols and titles were identified by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Archie (the Cochrane information management system) in March 2014. Pain-related outcomes of the overview were pain relief, clinical improvement or resolution and pain recurrence. Fertility-related outcomes were live birth, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage and adverse events. Selection of systematic reviews, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken in duplicate. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR tool. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using GRADE methods. Review findings were summarised in the text and the data for each outcome were reported in 'Additional tables'.

Main Results

Seventeen systematic reviews published in The Cochrane Library were included. All the reviews were high quality. The quality of the evidence for specific comparisons ranged from very low to moderate. Limitations in the evidence included risk of bias in the primary studies, inconsistency between the studies, and imprecision in effect estimates. Pain relief (14 reviews) Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues One systematic review reported low quality evidence of an overall benefit for GnRH analogues compared with placebo or no treatment. Ovulation suppression Five systematic reviews reported on medical treatment using ovulation suppression. There was moderate quality evidence that the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUD) was more effective than expectant management, and very low quality evidence that danazol was more effective than placebo. There was no consistent evidence of a difference in effectiveness between oral contraceptives and goserelin, estrogen plus progestogen and placebo, or progestogens and placebo, though in all cases the relevant evidence was of low or very low quality. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)A review of NSAIDs reported inconclusive evidence of a benefit in symptom relief compared with placebo. Surgical interventions There were two reviews of surgical interventions. One reported moderate quality evidence of a benefit in pain relief following laparoscopic surgery compared to diagnostic laparoscopy only. The other reported very low quality evidence that recurrence rates of endometriomata were lower after excisional surgery than after ablative surgery. Post-surgical medical interventions Two reviews reported on post-surgical medical interventions. Neither found evidence of an effect on pain outcomes, though in both cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Alternative medicine There were two systematic reviews of alternative medicine. One reported evidence of a benefit from auricular acupuncture compared to Chinese herbal medicine, and the other reported no evidence of a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and danazol. In both cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Anti-TNF-α drugs One review found no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between anti-TNF-α drugs and placebo. However, the evidence was of low quality. Reviews reporting fertility outcomes (8 reviews) Medical interventions Four reviews reported on medical interventions for improving fertility in women with endometriosis. One compared three months of GnRH agonists with a control in women undergoing assisted reproduction and found very low quality evidence of an increase in clinical pregnancies in the treatment group. There was no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between the interventions in the other three reviews, which compared GnRH agonists versus antagonists, ovulation suppression versus placebo or no treatment, and pre-surgical medical therapy versus surgery alone. In all cases the evidence was of low or very low quality. Surgical interventions Three reviews reported on surgical interventions. There was moderate quality evidence that both live births or ongoing pregnancy rates and clinical pregnancy rates were higher after laparoscopic surgery than after diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was low quality evidence of no difference in effectiveness between surgery and expectant management for endometrioma. One review found low quality evidence that excisional surgery resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rates than drainage or ablation of endometriomata. Post-surgical interventions Two reviews reported on post-surgical medical interventions. They found no evidence of an effect on clinical pregnancy rates. The evidence was of low or very low quality. Alternative medicine A review of Chinese herbal medicine in comparison with gestrinone found no evidence of a difference between the groups in clinical pregnancy rates. However, the evidence was of low quality. Adverse events Reviews of GnRH analogues and of danazol reported that the interventions were associated with higher rates of adverse effects than placebo; and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates of adverse events than other treatments. Chinese herbal medicine was associated with fewer side effects than gestrinone or danazol. Three reviews reported miscarriage as an outcome. No difference was found between surgical and diagnostic laparoscopy, between GnRH agonists and antagonists, or between aspiration of endometrioma and expectant management. However, in all cases the quality of the evidence was of low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

For women with pain and endometriosis, suppression of menstrual cycles with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUD) and danazol were beneficial interventions. Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis and excision of endometriomata were also associated with improvements in pain. The evidence on NSAIDs was inconclusive. There was no evidence of benefit with post-surgical medical treatment. In women with endometriosis undergoing assisted reproduction, three months of treatment with GnRH agonist improved pregnancy rates. Excisional surgery improved spontaneous pregnancy rates in the nine to 12 months after surgery compared to ablative surgery. Laparoscopic surgery improved live birth and pregnancy rates compared to diagnostic laparoscopy alone. There was no evidence that medical treatment improved clinical pregnancy rates. Evidence on harms was scanty, but GnRH analogues, danazol and depot progestagens were associated with higher rates than other interventions.

### Does nomegestrol acetate plus 17 β-estradiol oral contraceptive improve endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain in women? [^114nV7TS]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Women on E2/NOMAC COC reported a better reduction of endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain and an improvement of their QoL and sexual activity than those of women on NSAIDs. The current study has some limitations; the main one is the lack of laparoscopy to confirm endometriosis. Moreover, the lack of comparison between women on E2/NOMAC COC and women on COC having EE combined with a progestogen, rather than women on NSAIDs, or women on fixed dose of NSAIDs in a continuous regimen could be another limit of our investigation. Finally, a weakness of the study may be the lack of randomization and the fact that it was an unblended study. These limits need to be addressed in the future using a long-term follow-up investigation, to better analyze the end points of the current study.

### Does nomegestrol acetate plus 17 β-estradiol oral contraceptive improve endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain in women? [^115EkUKf]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

To enroll adolescents without a desire for pregnancy could be the aim of a future study to investigate the long-term effects of E2/NOMAC on pain and QoL, correlated to the metabolic aspects. This could permit us to better understand how to manage endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain.

### Does nomegestrol acetate plus 17 β-estradiol oral contraceptive improve endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain in women? [^113QeHCV]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Today, progestogens are used for off-label treatment of endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain, excluding Dienogest (DNG) that has been approved for clinical treatment of endometriosis. Because of its elimination half-life of around 10 hours, DNG is used in continuous regimens. It is interesting to note that DNG 2 mg daily provides ovulation inhibition, but ovarian activity is not completely suppressed; thus it has not been approved as a contraceptive.

Consequently, women affected by endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain that do not desire pregnancy could choose to use an estrogen–progestogen contraceptive, in a continuous regimen. This regimen could be adopted based on the half-life of progestogen and to avoid the hormone-free interval during which the symptoms may reappear. In fact, women on 21/7 conventional COCs may still have pelvic pain during the 7-day hormone-free interval, mainly due to the raised estradiol levels and increasing number of follicles induced by the increasing follicle-stimulating hormone levels during the hormone-free interval. On the contrary, the effectiveness of combined estradiol valerate with DNG in a 26/2 four-phase formulation pill has been observed.

Currently, DNG could also be used with 30 μg ethinyl estradiol (EE) in a 21/7 combined regimen pill, but this regimen can fail in controlling the chronic pelvic pain; therefore, continuous regimen was introduced, even if the quantity of EE could act negatively on ectopic endometrium tissue with an excessive proliferative effect and insufficient inhibiting activity of progestogen. In fact, recent investigations on estrogen and progesterone signaling in the healthy endometrium show a complementary activity of the two steroids, the first inducing epithelial proliferation and the second inhibiting estrogen proliferation. This harmonic correlation between the two steroids undergoes dysregulation in endometriosis.

Endometrium-like tissue located outside the uterine cavity is under a continuous inflammatory condition due to progesterone resistance and estrogen dominance activity on the ectopic endometrial tissue. Progesterone resistance is due to the loss or alteration of receptor expression in the endometrium from women with endometriosis. Consequently, the reduction of 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, normally induced by progesterone to convert E2 to the less potent estrone, and the upregulation of E2-producing p450 aromatase expression induce an E2 increased level in endometriosis tissue. Upregulation of E2 promotes the pain symptoms of endometriosis because of nerve growth and endothelial growth factors due to increased neuroangiogenesis and neuroinflammation.

### Long acting progestogens versus combined oral contraceptive pill for preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain: the PRE-EMPT pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial [^112F2Kk2]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies

The prolonged duration of this trial, which started recruitment in 2014, means that newer hormonal treatment options for endometriosis have become available, including the fourth generation synthetic oral progestogen dienogestand oral gonadotrophin releasing hormone antagonistscontaining add-back hormone replacement. Importantly, however, LAPs and COCP are commonly used hormonal contraceptives worldwide; they are cheap, easily accessed, and have a well known side effect and safety profile. Although the follow-up period is the longest of any comparable trial, the evidence provided by this trial is only relevant for the three years after surgery in a condition that can persist until menopause and often requires several episodes of further treatment.

The absence of a no treatment option prevented exploration of the impact of surgery alone, although a systematic review involving 17 studies of various hormonal treatments for different endometriosis subtypes showed a decreased risk of recurrence associated with their use. Our trial also assumes an inherent benefit from surgery, which has not been conclusively shown. However, the first six months after surgery does reveal the biggest reduction in self-reported pain scores. An ongoing trial, ESPRIT 2, aims to assess the short term impact of destruction of superficial endometriosis lesions compared with laparoscopy alone, but as choice of postoperative hormones will be determined by participants, LAPs and COCP will not be compared. Although recruitment was completed before the covid-19 pandemic, the restrictions on elective surgeries in 2020 and the length of subsequent surgical waiting lists might have reduced the number of repeat procedures.

Meaning of the study

The results of this trial show that prescribing a LAP or COCP is equally effective in reducing pain three years after endometriosis surgery, and reinforce current guidance recommending routine postsurgical hormonal treatment in this context. Women undergoing laparoscopic surgery can be informed that either class of hormonal drug reduces pain over a three year period and that LAPs could lower the risk of further surgery. Healthcare providers can note that prescribing LAPs reduces the need for further second line treatments.

### Non-surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain [^111onF7U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain is a common and debilitating condition; its aetiology is multifactorial, involving social, psychological and biological factors. The management of chronic pelvic pain is challenging, as despite interventions involving surgery, many women remain in pain without a firm gynaecological diagnosis.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of non-surgical interventions for women with chronic pelvic pain.

Search Methods

We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register. We also searched (from inception to 5 February 2014) AMED, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS. We handsearched sources such as citation lists, trial registers and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on non-surgical management of chronic pelvic pain were eligible for inclusion. We included studies of women with a diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome or adhesions but excluded those with pain known to be caused by endometriosis, primary dysmenorrhoea (period pain), active chronic pelvic inflammatory disease or irritable bowel syndrome. We considered studies of any non-surgical intervention, including lifestyle, physical, medical and psychological treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. Meta-analysis was performed using the Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome measure was pain relief, and secondary outcome measures were psychological outcomes, quality of life, requirement for analgesia and adverse effects. The quality of the evidence was assessed by using GRADE methods.

Main Results

Twenty-one RCTs were identified that involved non-surgical management of chronic pelvic pain: 13 trials were included in the review, and eight were excluded. The studies included a total of 750 women-406 women in the intervention groups and 344 in the control groups. Included studies had high attrition rates, and investigators often did not blind adequately or did not clearly describe randomisation procedures. Medical treatment versus placebo Progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)) was more effective than placebo at the end of treatment in terms of the number of women achieving a greater than 50% reduction in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score immediately after treatment (Peto OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.70 to 5.31, two studies, n = 204, I(2) = 22%, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence of benefit was maintained up to nine months after treatment (Peto OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.71, two studies, n = 204, I(2) = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). Women treated with progestogen reported more adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness) than those given placebo (high-quality evidence). The estimated effect of lofexidine on pain outcomes when compared with placebo was compatible with benefit and harm (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.61, one study, 39 women, low-quality evidence). Women in the lofexidine group reported more adverse effects (including drowsiness and dry mouth) than women given placebo (moderate-quality evidence). Head-to-head comparisons of medical treatments Head-to-head comparisons showed that women taking goserelin had greater improvement in pelvic pain score (MD 3, 95% CI 2.08 to 3.92, one study, n = 47, moderate-quality evidence) at one year than those taking progestogen. Women taking gabapentin had a lower VAS pain score than those taking amytriptyline (MD -1.50, 95% CI -2.06 to -0.94, n = 40, low-quality evidence). Study authors reported that no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of adverse effects among women taking gabapentin compared with women given amytriptyline. The study comparing goserelin versus progestogen did not report on adverse effects. Psychological treatment Women who underwent reassurance ultrasound scans and received counselling were more likely to report improved pain than those treated with a standard 'wait and see' policy (Peto OR 6.77, 95% CI 2.83 to 16.19, n = 90, low-quality evidence). Significantly more women who had writing therapy as a disclosure reported improvement in pain than those in the non-disclosure group (Peto OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.41 to 14.13, n = 48, very low-quality evidence). No difference between groups in pain outcomes was noted when other psychological therapies were compared with standard care or placebo (quality of evidence ranged from very low to low). Studies did not report on adverse effects. Complementary therapy Distension of painful pelvic structures was more effective for pain when compared with counselling (MD 35.8, 95% CI 23.08 to 48.52 on a zero to 100 scale, one study, n = 48, moderate-quality evidence). No difference in pain levels was observed when magnetic therapy was compared with use of a control magnet (very low-quality evidence). Studies did not report on adverse effects. The results of studies examining psychological and complementary therapies could not be combined to yield meaningful results.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence of moderate quality supports progestogen as an option for chronic pelvic pain, with efficacy reported during treatment. In practice, this option may be most acceptable among women unconcerned about progestogenic adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness-the most common adverse effects). Although some evidence suggests possible benefit of goserelin when compared with progestogen, gabapentin as compared with amytriptyline, ultrasound versus 'wait and see' and writing therapy versus non-disclosure, the quality of evidence is generally low, and evidence is drawn from single studies. Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, RCTs of other medical, lifestyle and psychological interventions are urgently required.

### Endometriosis [^1153SmeK]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ectopic endometrial tissue is found in 1.5% to 6.2% of women of reproductive age, in up to 60% of those with dysmenorrhoea, and in up to 30% of women with subfertility, with a peak incidence at around 40 years of age. However, symptoms may not correlate with laparoscopic findings.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of hormonal treatments given at diagnosis of endometriosis? What are the effects of hormonal treatments before surgery for endometriosis? What are the effects of non-hormonal medical treatments for endometriosis? What are the effects of surgical treatments for endometriosis? What are the effects of hormonal treatment after conservative surgery for endometriosis? What are the effects of hormonal treatment after oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) for endometriosis? What are the effects of treatments for ovarian endometrioma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 40 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: combined oral contraceptives, danazol, dydrogesterone, gestrinone, gonadorelin analogues, aromatase inhibitors, hormonal treatment before surgery, hormonal treatment, laparoscopic cystectomy, laparoscopic removal of endometriotic deposits (alone or with uterine nerve ablation), laparoscopic removal plus presacral neurectomy, laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, presacral neurectomy alone, and progestogens other than dydrogesterone.

### Time for global health policy and research leaders to prioritize endometriosis [^111cZZ4v]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Heterogeneous presentation of endometriosis impedes diagnosis and treatment

Most pelvic endometriosis comprises three subtypes: superficial peritoneal, ovarian cysts ("endometrioma"), and deep disease. Symptom manifestation and severity vary, and underdiagnosis is common due to erroneous symptom normalization and overlap with other diseases. Recently, refined imaging techniques identify, with high accuracy, ovarian and deep disease, but reliance on surgical visualisation for the most common superficial peritoneal lesions continues to impede timely diagnosis. Surgery or imaging requires access to healthcare services, which varies significantly across socio-economic and racial/ethnically underserved groups and geographies. Average diagnostic delay is 7 years after symptom onset, with delays > 10 years not uncommon. There remains no reliable non-invasive biomarker of any endometriosis subtype.

Treatment of pain symptoms falls broadly into surgical removal of disease and associated adhesions and hormonal suppressive therapies, including combined oral contraceptive steroids, progestins, gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues, androgens and aromatase inhibitors. Medical therapies that decrease oestrogen (or counter oestrogen action) are prescribed, because steroids play a key role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Unfortunately, both approaches are suboptimal. Surgery is associated with recurrence rates up to 50% within 5 years, and contraceptive hormone treatments often have unacceptable side effects and are counterproductive to fertility goals. Geographic and financial barriers to accessing treatment from endometriosis-trained healthcare providers are common. Surveys of patients consistently highlight symptom relief and improved medical therapies that do not limit fertility as a top priority for research. Historically, pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to develop new drugs for endometriosis, and focus has been on variations of hormonal, anti-inflammatory, or repurposed therapies, lacking revolutionary impact. While novel treatment discovery is essential, clinical trials for endometriosis have been plagued by widespread variations in outcome reporting, and only a fraction of completed trials is published.

Emerging chronic pelvic pain-focused therapies that include considerations of neuropathic and nociceptive pathways have not been adequately studied. Those with persistent/recurrent pain have a high rate of hysterectomywhich does not eliminate pain recurrence and may heighten risks for multiple conditions later in life. Further, commonly reported life-impacting concerns including fatigue and impaired sexual functioning have yet to be targeted for treatment among patients with endometriosis. A critical impediment to discovery of novel diagnostics and treatments and personalized approaches is the lack of a prognostically correlated classification of the highly heterogenous presentation of endometriosis lesion types and symptoms, which includes variation and evolution within patients across the life-course.

### ESHRE guideline: endometriosis [^111j2fGG]. Human Reproduction Open (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for endometriosis, more specifically with respect to prevention of recurrence, ESHRE 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate long-term hormone therapy (such as combined hormonal contraceptives) for the secondary prevention of endometrioma and endometriosis-associated related symptom recurrence after surgical management of ovarian endometrioma in patients not immediately seeking conception.

### Long acting progestogens versus combined oral contraceptive pill for preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain: the PRE-EMPT pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial [^112nKk98]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis is an oestrogen dependent condition that affects up to one in 10 women of reproductive age. Characterised by the growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, it can cause severe pelvic pain and infertility that can have a serious impact on quality of life. The condition requires a laparoscopy for definitive diagnosis and is frequently treated by excision or ablation of affected tissue at the same time.

Recurrence of endometriosis after surgery is common and poses a major challenge to its successful management. Population based data from Scotland shows that, after initial surgery for endometriosis, 62% of treated women have at least one repeat operation, 45% have two or more, and nearly 25% need surgical removal of their ovaries, often combined with a hysterectomy.

The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology recommend the use of hormonal preparations including the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and progestogens to treat endometriosis related pain. It is unclear as to which of these two treatment regimens is better at preventing the recurrence of endometriosis related pain after surgical treatment. Additionally, continuation rates and adherence to treatment might be improved by use of long acting progestogens (LAPs) as there is no need to take drugs on a daily basis.

Our aim was to evaluate whether LAPs or COCP were more effective in preventing the recurrence of pain in women undergoing conservative surgery for endometriosis. The economic results from a parallel cost effectiveness evaluation will be presented in a separate paper.

### Reevaluating response and failure of medical treatment of endometriosis: a systematic review [^114MjcKQ]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

No data on the type of pain experienced (e.g. nociceptive, neuropathic, or inflammatory pain) were available in the reviewed studies. This important information could be captured with the use of specifically developed and validated questionnaires, such as those published recently as part of the Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonisation (EPHect) Project. This multinational initiative developed standards for the collection of clinical and epidemiologic data relevant to endometriosis research, facilitating large-scale collaboration. Leading academic endometriosis centers have adopted the principles of the EPHect Project, and the questionnaires are freely available. The collection and analysis of qualitative data on the background and medical history of women with endometriosis may improve understanding of the underlying pathologic processes of the disease and help in the development of novel treatment strategies and in the assessment of treatment outcome/effectiveness in clinical trials. Similarly, the Core Outcomes in Women's and Newborn Health initiative, which aims to harmonize outcome reporting in women's health research, will be a helpful tool in improving clinical trials in the future.

Our review has revealed several important limitations of existing studies of endometriosis treatment. Few articles provided data for the outcomes of interest. Owing to the limited availability of data, results from treatment arms were pooled by treatment type. Similarly, because of the way in which findings were reported, outcomes data for discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or adverse events were combined. In addition, although the present study had no restrictions on publication date and included a broad range of treatments, patient-centered ratings of treatment satisfaction were either absent or incompletely reported, and they were evaluated in only four studies. Furthermore, there was heterogeneity in the CHCs and progestins examined; we found a similar treatment heterogeneity and lack of consistently reported data in a systematic review of surgical treatment of endometriosis (Singh SS et al. A systematic review of endometriosis interventions: what is missing in the literature? Poster presented at the 2nd Congress of Society of Endometriosis and Uterine Disorders, Barcelona, Spain, May 12–14, 2016).

### Does nomegestrol acetate plus 17 β-estradiol oral contraceptive improve endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain in women? [^111LM8Cr]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 10% of women of reproductive age are affected by endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain. Women frequently experience dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, fatigue, and infertility together with chronic pelvic pain.

Progestins taken orallyor by subdermal implant, intrauterine device, administration, or estrogen–progestin combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs)are normally used to counteract, but not to cure, chronic pelvic pain symptoms due to the effects of ovarian estrogenic secretion on the endometrium-like tissue developing outside the uterus. In fact, when women discontinue their usage, pelvic pain usually reappears.

It is customary for women affected by chronic pelvic pain to take on-demand nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Women commonly adopt hormonal treatment when their doctor informs them that they are infertile and/or affected by endometriosis. However, the first step in prescribing a drug for chronic pelvic pain is to understand the needs of each subject. In fact, women without the desire for procreation are more likely to use CHCs.

Outcomes depend on the specific dose, formulation, delivery system, or regimen. Conventional 21/7 regimens can fail during the 7-day hormone-free interval producing limited benefits on pain symptoms; therefore, continuous or extended CHC regimens were introduced. In fact, women on conventional CHCs may still experience headaches, pelvic pain, and mood changes during the hormone-free interval, mainly due to the raised estradiol levels and increased number of follicles induced by the increasing follicle-stimulating hormone levels during the hormone-free interval.

Recently, a new oral CHC containing 1.5 mg 17β-estradiol (E2) with 2.5 mg nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) has been used with 24 days of active pill use followed by a 4-day hormone-free interval regimen.NOMAC has a long half-life (45–50 hours) compared with other contraceptive progestins, and thus, it is able to cover the 4-day hormone-free interval by its steroidal effects; consequently, its contraceptive efficacy could be more compared with progestins with a shorter half-life.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an E2/NOMAC contraceptive pill on the pain symptoms of women affected by endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain without the desire for procreation (the primary end point). Moreover, the quality of life (QoL) and sexual function were investigated (the secondary end points).

The FSFI and FSDS improved at the 3 (p = 0.001) and 6 (p = 0.001) month follow-ups in women on E2/NOMAC (Table 2). Even if the women of the control group had improved FSFI scores at both the follow-ups (p = 0.001) and the FSDS score at the 6-month follow-up (p = 0.001), however, the scores remained under the cutoffs (Table 3). In fact, the intergroup statistical comparison for FSFI and FSDS scores showed statistically significant differences at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (p < 0.001) (Tables 4 and 5).

### Effects of long-term treatment with dienogest on the quality of life and sexual function of women affected by endometriosis-associated pelvic pain [^117Pfbm1]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

It is interesting to note that DNG 2 mg daily provides ovulation inhibition, but ovarian activity is not completely suppressed; thus it has not been approved as a contraceptive. Moreover, circulating estradiol levels during treatment with DNG 2 mg daily are similar to those in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The moderate suppression of estradiol with DNG may represent a potential advantage over other therapies, such as GnRH agonists, which require estrogen add-back if used for more than 6 months.

Currently, DNG is also used with ethinyl estradiol in a combined 21/7 regimen pill, but this regimen can fail in controlling pelvic pain; therefore, a so-called long-cycle regimen was introduced. In fact, women on conventional COCs may still experience headaches, pelvic pain and mood changes during the hormone-free interval, mainly due to the raised estradiol levels and increasing number of follicles induced by the increasing follicle-stimulating hormone levels during the hormone-free interval. On the contrary, the effectiveness of combined estradiol valerate in a 26/2 four-phase formulation pill has been observed.

Our study performed a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, but it is necessary to point out that the gold standard investigation to a definitive diagnosis of most forms of endometriosis is laparoscopy for women presenting symptoms suggestive of endometriosis. This could be a limit of our study. However, pain symptoms suggestive of the disorder can be treated without a definitive diagnosis using a hormonal drug to reduce menstrual flow.

The multidisciplinary nature of chronic pelvic pain may cause confusion for a correct diagnosis and treatment. To avoid this, women affected by chronic pelvic pain but also by dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia were enrolled in our current study. Another characteristic of pelvic pain due to endometriosis is its beginning during adolescence; in fact, women usually report a longer time and worse experience while obtaining a diagnosis. Thus, treatment is often started several years after use of NSAIDs. The delay of an appropriate treatment negatively affects the QoL of woman, often not restricting the progression of endometriosis.

DNG represents a promising medication for the long-term management of endometriosis. Probably, a longer period without pelvic pain could lead to a greater awareness of being able to live their sexuality without discomfort and improve their QoL.

### Endometriosis: a review [^115wpZYk]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease defined by endometrial-like tissue (lesions) outside the uterine lining. It affects up to 10% of women worldwide, and 9 million women in the US, during reproductive years.

Observations

Endometriosis has varying clinical presentations; however, 90% of people with endometriosis report pelvic pain, including dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, and 26% report infertility. Risk factors for endometriosis include younger age at menarche, shorter menstrual cycle length, lower body mass index, nulliparity, and congenital obstructive müllerian anomalies such as obstructed hemivagina. Although definitive diagnosis requires surgical visualization of lesions, a suspected clinical diagnosis can be made based on symptoms, supported by physical examination findings and imaging with transvaginal ultrasound and/or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging; normal physical examination and imaging do not exclude the diagnosis. The diagnosis is often delayed, averaging 5 to 12 years after onset of symptoms, with most women consulting 3 or more clinicians prior to diagnosis. Hormonal medications, such as combined oral contraceptives and progestin-only options, are first-line treatment and should be offered to symptomatic premenopausal women who do not currently desire pregnancy. In a network meta-analysis (n = 1680, 15 clinical trials), hormonal treatments including combined oral contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists led to clinically significant pain reduction compared with placebo, with mean differences ranging between 13.15 and 17.6 points (0–100 visual analog scale) with little difference in effectiveness among options. However, 11% to 19% of individuals with endometriosis have no pain reduction with hormonal medications and 25% to 34% experience recurrent pelvic pain within 12 months of discontinuing hormonal treatment. Surgical removal of lesions, usually with laparoscopy, should be considered if first-line hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated. Second-line hormone therapies include GnRH agonists and antagonists, and third-line treatments include aromatase inhibitors. Hysterectomy with surgical removal of lesions may be considered when initial treatments are ineffective. However, approximately 25% of patients who undergo hysterectomy for endometriosis experience recurrent pelvic pain and 10% undergo additional surgery, such as lysis of adhesions, to treat pain.

Conclusions and Relevance

Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain affecting approximately 10% of reproductive-age women. Hormonal suppression with combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestins is first-line treatment for women who are not seeking immediate pregnancy. Surgical removal of endometriosis lesions may be performed if hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated, and hysterectomy may be considered if medical treatments and surgical removal of lesions do not relieve symptoms.

### A systematic literature review on patient-reported outcome domains and measures in nonsurgical efficacy trials related to chronic pain associated with endometriosis: an urgent call to action [^117LbRh8]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Included patients were exclusively female and most frequently in the age group of 30 to 40 years (102, 53.4%), followed by 18 to 29 years (20, 10.5%). In 32 studies (16.8%), the intervention groups differed in age. Most of the patients included in the studies had previously undergone diagnostic (102, 53.4%) or therapeutic surgery (48, 25.1%) to confirm the diagnosis (endometriosis). 25 studies (13.1%) specifically defined chronic pelvic pain ≥ 3 months and 29 studies (15.2%) described the pain as "chronic" or "recurrent" for inclusion. In all other studies (137, 71.7%) for the included patients, a disease duration ≥ 3 months (including painful symptoms) was given.

Most interventions studied in the trials were hormonal treatments, including GnRH receptor antagonists (162, 84.8%). Only 6 studies (3.1%) used analgesics, 10 (5.2%) used other drugs, and 21 (11.0%) used nonpharmacological treatments. Of 22 studies combining interventions, 20 were combined with hormonal treatment. In total, 69 studies (36.1%) were placebo-controlled, while 123 studies (64.4%) used a hormonal treatment or other pharmacological (2, 1.0%) or nonpharmacological comparators (8, 4.2). 42 studies (22.0%) had more than one comparator arm.

A detailed list of study characteristics is given in supplemental digital content (see table 3).

3.2. Quality-dependent analysis

All included studies were graded according to the risk of bias GRADE criteria, (supplemental digital content, Table 2). More than half of the studies (113, 59.2%) were of a moderate-to-high methodological quality, while the rest (78, 40.8%) were of low methodological quality. GRADE for each study is shown in supplemental digital content (see Table 4).

### Oral contraceptives for pain associated with endometriosis [^115at8Y6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition which affects many women of reproductive age worldwide and is a major cause of pain and infertility. The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is widely used to treat pain occurring as a result of endometriosis, although the evidence for its efficacy is limited.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of oral contraceptive preparations in the treatment of painful symptoms ascribed to the diagnosis of laparoscopically proven endometriosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following from inception to 19 October 2017: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and the trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). We also handsearched reference lists of relevant trials and systematic reviews retrieved by the search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) of the use of COCPs in the treatment of women of reproductive age with symptoms ascribed to the diagnosis of endometriosis that had been made visually at a surgical procedure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. One review author was an expert in the content matter. We contacted study authors for additional information. The primary outcome was self-reported pain (dysmenorrhoea) at the end of treatment.

Main Results

Five trials (612 women) met the inclusion criteria. Only three trials (404 women) provided data that were suitable for analysis. Combined oral contraceptive pill versus placeboTwo trials compared COCP with a placebo. These studies were at high risk of bias. For GRADE outcomes (self-reported pain (dysmenorrhoea) at the end of treatment), the quality of the evidence very low. Evidence was downgraded for imprecision as it was based on a single, small trial and for the visual analogue scale data there were wide confidence intervals (CIs). There appeared to have been substantial involvement of the pharmaceutical company funding the trials. Treatment with the COCP was associated with an improvement in self-reported pain at the end of treatment as evidenced by a lower score on the Dysmenorrhoea verbal rating scale (scale 0 to 3) compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) -1.30 points, 95% CI -1.84 to -0.76; 1 RCT, 96 women; very low quality evidence), a lower score on the Dysmenorrhoea visual analogue scale (no details of scale) compared with placebo (MD -23.68 points, 95% CI -28.75 to -18.62, 2 RCTs, 327 women; very low quality evidence) and a reduction in menstrual pain from baseline to the end of treatment (MD 2.10 points, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.82; 1 RCT, 169 women; very low quality evidence). Combined oral contraceptive pill versus medical therapiesOne underpowered trial compared the COCP with another medical treatment (goserelin). The study was at high risk of bias; the trial was unblinded and there was insufficient detail to judge allocation concealment and randomisation. For GRADE outcomes (self-reported pain (dysmenorrhoea) at the end of treatment), the quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low. At the end of treatment, the women in the goserelin group were amenorrhoeic and therefore no comparisons could be made between the groups for the primary outcome. At six months' follow-up, there was no clear evidence of a difference between women treated with the COCP and women treated with goserelin for measures of dysmenorrhoea on a visual analogue scale (scale 1 to 10) (MD -0.10, 95% CI -1.28 to 1.08; 1 RCT, 50 women; very low quality evidence) or a verbal rating scale (scale 0 to 3) (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.99 to 0.79; 1 RCT, 50 women; very low quality evidence). At six months' follow-up, there was no clear evidence of a difference between the COCP and goserelin groups for reporting complete absence of pain as measured by the visual analogue scale (risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.43; 1 RCT, 50 women; very low quality evidence) or the verbal rating scale (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08; 1 RCT, 49 women; low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the limited evidence from two trials at high risk of bias and limited data for the prespecified outcomes for this review, there is insufficient evidence to make a judgement on the effectiveness of the COCP compared with placebo and the findings cannot be generalised. Based on the limited evidence from one small trial that was at high risk of bias, there is insufficient evidence to make a judgement on the effectiveness of the COCP compared with other medical treatments. Only one comparison was possible, with the medical intervention being goserelin, and the findings cannot be generalised. Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of COCPs in managing pain-related symptoms associated with endometriosis. There are other formulations of the combined hormonal contraception such as the transdermal patch, vaginal ring or combined injectable contraceptives which this review did not cover but should be considered in future updates.

### Combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) as treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea [^1146qDgM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Dysmenorrhoea refers to the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps and is a common gynaecological complaint. Research as early as 1937 has shown that dysmenorrhoea responds favourably to ovulation inhibition, and that the synthetic hormones in the combined oral contraceptive pill can be used to treat dysmenorrhoea. These hormones act by suppressing ovulation and lessening the endometrial lining of the uterus. Therefore, menstrual fluid volume decreases along with the amount of prostaglandins produced, in turn effectively reducing dysmenorrhoea by decreasing uterine motility, and thus uterine cramping. The use of combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) has been advocated as a treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea since their introduction for general use in 1960. There is evidence from epidemiological studies of general populations that combined OCPs can effectively treat dysmenorrhoea.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to determine the efficacy of combined oral contraceptive pills for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Register of controlled trials, CCTR, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL, were performed. Attempts were also made to identify trials from the National Research Register, the Clinical Trials Register and the citation lists of review articles and included trials.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were RCTs that compared all types of combined oral contraceptives (oestrogen/progestogen) with other combined oral contraceptives, placebo, no treatment, or treatment with nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea. The main outcome measures were pain relief, adverse effects, additional analgesics required and time off work or school.

Data Collection and Analysis

Nine trials were identified that appeared to fulfil the initial criteria for this review. Of these nine trials, four were excluded, two at further investigation revealed a lack of randomisation and two included combined oral contraceptives that are now discontinued due to very high oestrogen content. Of the remaining five RCTs, four were included in the meta-analysis (Buttram 1969; Cullberg 1972; GPRG 1968; Nakano 1971). The results of the other trial (Matthews 1968) were included in the text of the review for discussion because data were not available in a form that allowed it to be combined in a meta-analysis. Data for all outcomes were in dichotomous form and the Peto odds ratio was used in the meta-analysis for all comparisons.

Main Results

Combined OCPs with medium dose oestrogen (> 35 mcg) and 1st/2nd generation progestogens were shown to be more effective than placebo for pain relief. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the results from different studies and when data were analysed with a random effects model, the confidence intervals increased and the results became statistically non-significant. For the other outcomes, there was a significant difference in favour of OCPs when compared to placebo for the outcome of absence from work or school, and there was no difference between the treatment groups and placebo in the number of adverse effects experienced.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No conclusions can be made about the efficacy of commonly used modern lower dose combined oral contraceptives for dysmenorrhoea. While there is some evidence from four RCTs that combined OCPs with medium dose oestrogen and 1st/2nd generation progestogens are more effective than placebo it should be emphasised that the studies were small, of poor quality and all included much higher doses of hormones that those commonly prescribed today. Therefore no recommendations can be made regarding the efficacy of modern combined oral contraceptives.

### Continuous or extended cycle vs. cyclic use of combined hormonal contraceptives for contraception [^111XzL9V]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The avoidance of menstruation through continuous or extended (greater than 28 days) administration of combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) has gained legitimacy through its use in treating endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and menstruation-associated symptoms. Avoidance of menstruation through extended or continuous use of CHCs for reasons of personal preference may have additional advantages to women, including improved compliance, greater satisfaction, fewer menstrual symptoms, and less menstruation-related absenteeism from work or school.

Objectives

To determine the differences between continuous or extended-cycle CHCs (pills, patch, ring) in regimens of greater than 28 days of active hormone compared with traditional cyclic dosing (21 days of active hormone and 7 days of placebo, or 24 days of active hormones and 4 days of placebo). Our hypothesis was that continuous or extended-cycle CHCs have equivalent efficacy and safety but improved bleeding profiles, amenorrhea rates, adherence, continuation, participant satisfaction, and menstrual symptoms compared with standard cyclic CHCs.

Search Methods

We searched computerized databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PUBMED, EMBASE, POPLINE, LILACS) for trials using continuous or extended CHCs (oral contraceptives, contraceptive ring and patch) during the years 1966 to 2013. We also searched the references in review articles and publications identified for inclusion in the protocol. Investigators were contacted regarding additional references.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in any language comparing continuous or extended-cycle (greater than 28 days of active hormones) versus traditional cyclic administration (21 days of active hormones and 7 days of placebo, or 24 days of active hormones and 4 days of placebo) of CHCs for contraception.

Data Collection and Analysis

Titles and abstracts identified from the literature searches were assessed for potential inclusion. Data were extracted onto data collection forms and then entered into RevMan 5. Peto odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all outcomes for dichotomous outcomes. Weighted mean difference was calculated for continuous outcomes. The trials were critically appraised by examining the following factors: study design, blinding, randomization method, group allocation concealment, exclusions after randomization, loss to follow-up, and early discontinuation. Because the included trials did not have a standard treatment (type of CHC formulation, route of delivery, or time length for continuous dosing), we could not aggregate data into meta-analysis.

Main Results

Twelve randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. Study findings were similar between 28-day and extended or continuous regimens in regard to contraceptive efficacy (i.e., pregnancy rates) and safety profiles. When compliance was reported, no difference between 28-day and extended or continuous cycles was found. Participants reported high satisfaction with both dosing regimens, but this was not an outcome universally studied. Overall discontinuation and discontinuation for bleeding problems were not uniformly higher in either group. The studies that reported menstrual symptoms found that the extended or continuous group fared better in terms of headaches, genital irritation, tiredness, bloating, and menstrual pain. Eleven out of the twelve studies found that bleeding patterns were either equivalent between groups or improved with extended or continuous cycles over time. Endometrial lining assessments by ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy were done in some participants and were all normal after cyclic or extended CHC use.

Authors' Conclusions

The 2014 update yielded four additional trials but unchanged conclusions. Evidence from existing randomized control trials comparing continuous or extended-cycle CHCs (greater than 28 days of active combined hormones) to traditional cyclic dosing (21 days of active hormone and 7 days of placebo, or 24 days of active hormone and 4 days of placebo) is of good quality. However, the variations in type of hormones and time length for extended-cycle dosing make a formal meta-analysis impossible. Future studies should choose a previously described type of CHC and dosing regimen. More attention needs to be directed towards participant satisfaction, continuation, and menstruation-associated symptoms.

### Reevaluating response and failure of medical treatment of endometriosis: a systematic review [^112gTeTP]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Discuss: You can discuss this article with its authors and with other ASRM members at

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that mainly affects women of reproductive age. Medical therapy can alleviate endometriosis-associated pain, but for many women pain relief is limited in efficacy and duration, and symptoms often reoccur after treatment cessation. Most current medical therapies for endometriosis to treat the disease and its symptoms rely on suppression of local or systemic estrogen levels or direct hormonal effects on endometriosis lesions. To date, all available hormonal therapies appear to have similar efficacy, but their tolerability profiles differ. The most widely used long-term therapies are progestins and combined oral contraceptives (COCs), but they are associated with irregular bleeding patterns, breast tenderness, and mood disturbances in some women. Other hormonal therapies include GnRH agonists, which induce a hypoestrogenic state resulting in menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, and are associated with reduced bone mineral density. They are therefore normally restricted to short-term use. Combination with add-back therapy may extend the period for which GnRH agonists can be used, although long-term safety data on this treatment regimen are limited. Danazol, especially when administered orally, is associated with significant androgenic side effects, which has considerably restricted its routine use. In addition, analgesics, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are widely prescribed for pain relief despite limited evidence of their efficacy in endometriosis.

### Progestin-only pills may be a better first-line treatment for endometriosis than combined estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills [^111kzhV8]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

For decades, combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) have been the first-line treatment for menstrual and pelvic pain associated with endometriosis without any clinical evidence of efficacy. Initial relief provided by OCPs is likely a result of improvement in primary dysmenorrhea. Biologic data and limited clinical evidence support a potential adverse effect of long-term use of OCPs on the progression of endometriosis. In contrast, there is randomized, controlled trial data to support the use of oral progestin-only treatment for pelvic pain associated with endometriosis and for suppressing the anatomic extent of endometriotic lesions. Both norethindrone acetate and dienogest have regulatory approval for treating endometriosis and may be better than OCPs as a first-line therapy.

### A clinician's guide to the treatment of endometriosis with elagolix [^1144Jhex]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent, inflammatory condition marked anatomically by the presence of extrauterine lesions containing endometrial glands and stroma. Affecting an estimated 6%–10% of women, endometriosis is one of the most common gynecologic conditions among reproductive-age women. The symptoms of endometriosis have a tremendous impact on patients' lives, negatively influencing quality of life, emotional well-being, intimate relationships, work life, and daily activities. Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, which often manifests as dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual pelvic pain (NMPP), and dyspareunia, plays a dominant role in the effect of endometriosis on patients' daily lives and physical functioning.

A plethora of pharmaceutical agents are prescribed for management of pain associated with endometriosis, although few of these have been approved for this indication by regulatory bodies. Among commonly used off-label agents are combined hormonal contraceptives. Findings from a recent meta-analysis revealed that, whereas evidence suggests combined hormonal contraceptives reduce endometriosis-associated pain, supportive data are low quality and there are insufficient data comparing these agents with other options for managing endometriosis-associated pain. Moreover, combined oral contraceptives are not effective for symptom relief in as many as one-third of symptomatic women with endometriosis, and efficacy may wane over time.

Progestin-only formulations have been shown to reduce endometriosis-associated pain, but are subject to the same progesterone resistance that limits the effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives. Progestin therapy (progestin only oral or depot contraception) is commonly associated with breakthrough bleedingthat could exacerbate symptoms of pain.

In addition, long-term administration of the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate is linked to decreases in bone mineral density (BMD), which may not be completely reversible. In the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment options for endometriosis-associated pain management include three gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (leuprolide acetate, goserelin acetate, and nafarelin acetate), two progestins (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethindrone acetate), danazol (which is not commonly prescribed due to its androgenic side effects), and the recently marketed GnRH receptor antagonist, elagolix.

### Long acting progestogens versus combined oral contraceptive pill for preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain: the PRE-EMPT pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial [^113nqFkJ]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Patient and public involvement

Input from patients and the public was crucial in shaping the design of the internal pilot and the main trial, and in the choice of the primary and secondary outcomes. Patient and public involvement (PPI) at the design stage of the trial led to the inclusion of the fatigue scale as an outcome measure. As coapplicant, our lead PPI representative provided a patient centred perspective to all discussions and decisions on recruitment, follow-up, and the use of language within documents aimed at participants.

PPI colleagues also influenced our recruitment and follow-up strategies, especially the decision to opt for telephone follow-up for participants after two unsuccessful attempts to contact them by mail. Finally, input from PPI colleagues has been invaluable in interpreting trial results. PPI groups including Endometriosis UK supported the use of several complementary routes of communication to engage with patients from all backgrounds and ensure that the key messages from this trial were available to all those with endometriosis, their families, and all those who care for them.

### Health benefits of oral contraceptives [^111jXh61]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

A sizeable literature corroborates the multiple health benefits of oral contraceptive use. The first estrogen/progestin combination pills were marketed to treat a variety of menstrual disorders. Although currently used oral contraceptives no longer carry FDA-approved labeling for these indications, they remain important therapeutic options for a variety of gynecologic conditions. Well-established gynecologic benefits include a reduction in dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, iron-deficiency anemia, ectopic pregnancy, and PID. Although older, higher-dose pills reduced the incidence of ovarian cysts, low-dose pills suppress follicular activity less consistently. Nevertheless, cycle-related symptoms, including functional cysts, dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, and ovulation pain (mittelschmerz), generally improve. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome note improvement in bleeding patterns and a reduction in acne and hirsutism. Symptoms from endometriosis also improve with oral contraceptive therapy. Current data suggest that oral contraceptive therapy increases bone density and that past use decreases fracture risk. Oral contraceptives also improve acne, a major health concern of young women. Oral contraceptives provide lasting reduction in the risk of two serious gynecologic malignancies — ovarian and endometrial cancer. The data with respect to ovarian cancer are compelling enough to recommend the use of oral contraceptives to women at high risk by virtue of family history, positive carrier status of the BRCA mutations, or nulliparity, even if contraception is not required. Health care providers must counsel women regarding these benefits to counteract deeply held public attitudes and misconceptions regarding oral contraceptive use. Messages should focus on topics of interest to particular groups of women. The fact that oral contraceptives increase bone mineral density and reduce ovarian cancer is of great interest to women in their forties and helps influence use and compliance in this group. In contrast, the beneficial effects of oral contraceptives on acne resonates with younger women. Getting the good news out about the benefits of oral contraceptives will enable more women to take advantage of their positive health effects.

### Continuous or extended cycle vs. cyclic use of combined oral contraceptives for contraception [^112vToz6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The avoidance of menstruation through extended or continuous administration (greater than 28 days of active pills) of combination oral contraceptives (COCs) has gained legitimacy through its use in treating endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and menstruation-associated symptoms. Avoidance of menstruation through continuous use of COCs for reasons of personal preference may have additional advantages to women, including improved compliance, greater satisfaction, fewer menstrual symptoms, and less menstruation-related absenteeism from work or school.

Objectives

To determine the differences between COCs dosed continuously (greater than 28 days of active pills) compared with traditional cyclic dosing (21 days of active pills and 7 days of placebo). Our hypothesis was that continuously administered COCs have equivalent efficacy and safety but improved bleeding profiles, amenorrhea rates, adherence, continuation, participant satisfaction, and menstrual symptoms compared with cyclic COCs.

Search Strategy

We searched computerized databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, LILACS) for trials using continuous or extended COCs during the years 1966 to 2005. We also searched the references in review articles and publications identified for inclusion in the protocol. Investigators were contacted regarding additional references.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in any language comparing continuous (greater than 28 days of active pills) versus traditional cyclic administration (21 days of active pills and 7 days of placebo) of COCs for contraception.

Data Collection and Analysis

Titles and abstracts identified from the literature searches were assessed for potential inclusion. Data were extracted onto data collection forms and then entered into RevMan 4.2. Peto odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all outcomes for dichotomous outcomes. Weighted mean difference was calculated for continuous outcomes. The trials were critically appraised by examining the following factors: study design, blinding, randomization method, group allocation concealment, exclusions after randomization, loss to follow-up, and early discontinuation. Because the included trials did not have a standard treatment (type of pill and time length for continuous dosing), we could not aggregate data into meta-analysis.

Main Results

Six randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. Study findings were similar between 28-day and extended cycles in regard to contraceptive efficacy (i.e., pregnancy rates) and safety profiles. When compliance was reported, no difference between 28-day and extended cycles was found. Participants reported high satisfaction with both dosing regimens, but this was not an outcome universally studied. Overall discontinuation and discontinuation for bleeding problems were not uniformly higher in either group in most studies. The few studies that reported menstrual symptoms found that the extended cycle group fared better in terms of headaches, genital irritation, tiredness, bloating, and menstrual pain. Five out of the six studies found that bleeding patterns were either equivalent between groups or improved with continuous-dosing regimens. Endometrial lining assessments by ultrasound were done in a small number of participants but all endometrial stripe measurements were less than 5 mm.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from existing randomized control trials comparing COCs given continuously (greater than 28 days of active pills) to traditional monthly cyclic dosing (21 days of active pills and 7 days of placebo) is of good quality. However, the variations in type of pill and time length for continuous dosing make direct comparisons between regimens impossible. Future studies should choose a previously described type of pill and dosing regimen. More attention needs to be directed towards participant satisfaction and menstruation-associated symptoms.

### Optimal management of endometriosis and pain [^1127jVeL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of endometriosis-associated pain involves inflammatory and hormonal alterations and changes in brain signaling pathways. Although medical treatment can provide temporary relief, most patients can achieve long-term sustained pain relief when it is combined with surgical intervention. Owing to its complexity, there is an ongoing debate about how to optimally manage endometriosis-associated pain. We believe optimal management for this condition requires: 1) possible egg preservation in affected young patients with and without endometriomas; 2) preoperative medical suppression to inhibit ovulation and to avoid removal of functional cysts that might look like endometriomas; and 3) postoperative hormonal suppression to decrease recurrence, but this treatment should be modified according to disease severity, symptoms, and fertility goals.

### Reevaluating response and failure of medical treatment of endometriosis: a systematic review [^111zR814]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that one-fourth to one-third of patients treated with the use of COCs or progestins require further treatment because of lack of response or poor tolerability, but there are limited data to support these figures. A review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the period 1976–1998 showed that 40%–70% of women receiving surgical treatment or medical therapy had relief from endometriosis-associated pelvic pain for ≥ 6 months. In contrast, in a systematic review of the use of progestins published in 1997, ∼9% of women had no reduction in pelvic pain and 50% reported pelvic pain at the end of the follow-up period.

The main objectives of the present systematic review were to determine response rates to medical therapy, the frequency and extent of remaining endometriosis-associated pain symptoms, and the recurrence of pain symptoms after cessation of therapy. Furthermore, we set out to characterize the patient population for whom existing medical therapies do not provide relief from endometriosis-associated pain. Knowledge of these data is of central clinical importance because it helps to inform both health care professionals and patients and aids in managing patients' expectations. In addition, such data form the basis for management decisions about unmet clinical needs and will assist in improving future clinical trial design.

### Endometriosis: the effects of dienogest [^113m72xM]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ectopic endometrial tissue is found in 2% to 6% of women of reproductive age, in up to 60% of those with dysmenorrhoea, and in up to 30% of women with subfertility, with a peak incidence at around 40 years of age. However, symptoms may not correlate with laparoscopic findings.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of dienogest for the treatment of endometriosis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

Five studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: dienogest versus placebo or no treatment; dienogest versus gonadorelin analogues; dienogest versus combined oral contraceptives; dienogest versus other progestogens.

### Long acting progestogens versus combined oral contraceptive pill for preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain: the PRE-EMPT pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial [^115id65w]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Results

Across 34 UK gynaecology clinics, 2858 women were screened for eligibility and 405 were randomised (fig 1). Supplementary table 1 lists reasons for ineligibility. The follow-up rate for the primary outcome was 337 of 405 (83%) at three years; 381 of 405 (94%) provided an EHP-30 pain score for at least one of the follow-up time points. Final follow-up data were obtained in July 2022.

Fig 1
CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) trial profile. Completed EHP-30 pain score at any assessment time: LAP, n = 195; COCP, n = 186. COCP = combined oral contraceptive pill; EHP-30 = Endometriosis Health Profile 30; LAP = long acting progestogen

Participants had a mean age of 29 years (standard deviation 6.6) and most (91%, 369 of 405) described their ethnicity as white (table 1). Endometriosis was graded by the surgeon as stage I or stage II (American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification of minimal or mild) in 79% (319 of 405) of participants and endometrial tissue was deemed to have been completely excised at operation in 91% (369 of 405). The minimisation algorithm ensured balance between groups in terms of age, extent of excision as judged by surgeon, stage of endometriosis, LAP selection, and centre; the groups were also well balanced for the other baseline characteristics.

### The role of progestins in treating the pain of endometriosis [^116Mn1ZU]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Progestins, synthetic progestational agents, have been used in the management of symptomatic endometriosis both as primary therapy and as an adjunct to surgical resection. A variety of oral agents have been employed in this regard with investigators demonstrating differing degrees of benefit. Unfortunately, due to the lack of large-scale, appropriately controlled, randomized trials, or dose-ranging studies, no single agent can be demonstrated to be truly efficacious. The lack of a standardized instrument to evaluate painful symptoms makes comparative analysis more difficult. Injectable administration of long-acting depot medroxyprogesterone acetate preparations intramuscularly or subcutaneously has been investigated in three randomized trials. The lower dose subcutaneous injection holds promise with an apparent reduction in side effects. Issues of reversible bone mineral density loss, breakthrough bleeding, and return of menses have not been completely resolved. Selective progesterone receptor modulators represent an intriguing alternative. These orally administered agents have been shown in preliminary investigations to be not only efficacious in reducing symptoms but also associated with minimal side effects. Further investigation of these agents is clearly required.

### Long acting progestogens versus combined oral contraceptive pill for preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain: the PRE-EMPT pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial [^116MPS27]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Of the 205 women randomised to LAP, a few more were offered treatment with DMPA compared with LNG-IUS (114 (56%) v 91 (44%)). Approximately four-fifths (81%, 254 of 313; table 1) of these treatment options were driven by patient preference. Approximately 65% of participants allocated a LAP were still using a LAP at one year, reducing to 37% by three years. The equivalent figures in the COCP group were lower at 53% and 25%, respectively (supplementary figure 1, panel A). Switching from one LAP treatment to another (ie, from LNG-IUS to DMPA or vice versa) or supplementation of a (related) non-trial drug was also a relatively common occurrence. Adherence to the initially allocated treatment (without any treatment change at all) occurred in 56% and 48% of participants at one year and 26% and 24% at three years in the LAP and COCP groups, respectively (supplementary figure 1, panel B; data are provided for LNG-IUS and DMPA separately in supplementary figure 2). Supplementary tables 2 and 3 summarise reasons for non-adherence.

Primary outcome measure

Three years after randomisation, no evidence was found of a statistically significant difference in pain scores between groups (adjusted mean difference −0.8, 95% CI −5.7 to 4.2; P = 0.76), with both groups showing a similar reduction of around 40% (on average, 24 points for LAP group and 23 points for COCP group) compared with preoperative values (table 2). On average, both groups maintained improved pain scores at all follow-up intervals compared with their preoperative scores (supplementary table 4; fig 2). We did not find any differential effect in any of the prespecified subgroups relating to the primary outcome (supplementary table 5). Sensitivity analysis conducted to investigate missing data assumptions did not alter the initial interpretation (supplementary table 6).

### Contraception choices in women with underlying medical conditions [^113gH8a8]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians often prescribe contraceptives to women of reproductive age with comorbidities. Novel delivery systems (e.g., contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, single-rod implantable device) may change traditional risk and benefit profiles in women with comorbidities. Effective contraceptive counseling requires an understanding of a woman's preferences and medical history, as well as the risks, benefits, adverse effects, and contraindications of each method. Noncontraceptive benefits of combined hormonal contraceptives, such as oral contraceptive pills, include regulated menses, decreased dysmenorrhea, and diminished premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Oral contraceptive pills may be used safely in women with a range of medical conditions, including well-controlled hypertension, uncomplicated diabetes mellitus, depression, and uncomplicated valvular heart disease. However, women older than 35 years who smoke should avoid oral contraceptive pills. Contraceptives containing estrogen, which can increase thrombotic risk, should be avoided in women with a history of venous thromboembolism, stroke, cardiovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease. Progestin-only contraceptives are recommended for women with contraindications to estrogen. Depo-Provera, a long-acting injectable contraceptive, may be preferred in women with sickle cell disease because it reduces the frequency of painful crises. Because of the interaction between antiepileptics and oral contraceptive pills, Depo-Provera may also be considered in women with epilepsy. Implanon, the single-rod implantable contraceptive device, may reduce symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Mirena, the levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine contraceptive system, is an option for women with menorrhagia, endometriosis, or chronic pelvic pain.

### Practice bulletin no. 114: management of endometriosis [^114D274f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for endometriosis, more specifically with respect to hormone therapy, ACOG 2010 guidelines recommend to initiate add-back hormone therapy to reduce or eliminate GnRH agonist-induced bone mineral loss and to provide symptomatic relief without reducing the efficacy of pain relief, when relief of pain from treatment with a GnRH agonist supports continued therapy.

Discussion

Statement of principal findings

A strategy of prescribing LAP or COCP after surgery for endometriosis resulted in similar levels of pain at three years, with both groups reporting an improvement of almost 40% from pretreatment levels on average. Choice of a particular LAP (LNG-IUS or DMPA) before randomisation did not alter these findings. Use of LAPs reduced the risk of second line medical treatments and further surgery.

### Aromatase inhibitors: the next generation of therapeutics for endometriosis? [^111q5LEa]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective and Design

To review the role of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in the treatment of endometriosis.

Conclusion(S)

Endometriosis is a common estrogen-dependent disorder that can result in substantial morbidity, including pelvic pain, multiple operations, and infertility. Approximately only half of women with endometriosis get pain relief from existing medical or surgical treatments. Medical treatments usually are directed at inhibiting estrogen action or its production from the ovaries and do not address local estrogen biosynthesis by the aromatase enzyme in endometriotic lesions. A single gene encodes aromatase, which is the final enzyme in the estrogen biosynthesis pathway, and its inhibition effectively eliminates estrogen production. The recently introduced highly specific AIs have successfully treated pelvic pain and significantly reduced the lesion size. In premenopausal women, an AI alone may induce ovarian folliculogenesis, and thus AIs are combined with a progestin, a combination oral contraceptive, or a GnRH analogue. The side-effect profile of AIs administered in combination with an oral contraceptive or a progestin is remarkably benign. We review herein the published clinical evidence for the use of AIs in the treatment of endometriosis.

### Chronic pelvic pain in women [^113ng3um]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

The etiology of chronic pelvic pain in women is poorly understood. Although a specific diagnosis is not found in the majority of cases, some common diagnoses include endometriosis, adhesions, irritable bowel syndrome, and interstitial cystitis. The initial history and physical examination can narrow the diagnostic possibilities, guide any subsequent evaluation, and rule out malignancy or significant systemic disease. If the initial evaluation does not reveal a specific diagnosis, a limited laboratory and ultrasound evaluation can clarify the diagnosis, as well as rule out serious disease and reassure the patient. Few treatment modalities have demonstrated benefit for the symptoms of chronic pelvic pain. The evidence supports the use of oral medroxyprogesterone, goserelin, adhesiolysis for severe adhesions, and a multidisciplinary treatment approach for patients without a specific diagnosis. Less supporting evidence is available for oral analgesics, combined oral contraceptive pills, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, intramuscular medroxyprogesterone, trigger point and botulinum A toxin injections, neuromodulative therapies, and hysterectomy.

### Introduction: a focus on the medical management of endometriosis [^112WZ3g2]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

In this views and reviews series of articles, we focus on the long-term medical management of endometriosis in lieu of surgery. The development of noninvasive biomarkers will facilitate the early diagnosis of endometriosis and early medical management. We discuss the use of oral progestin-only as first line treatment in place of oral contraceptives. Future medical treatments may be curative rather than simply suppressive or palliative. The section on surgery mainly pertains to failed medical management or specific types of endometriosis which require surgical excision.

### Progestagens for pain symptoms associated with endometriosis [^111pVSyN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Endometriosis is a hormone-sensitive inflammatory condition affecting between 5% and 10% of reproductive-aged women and an unknown number of gender-diverse individuals. It is often associated with debilitating pelvic pain symptoms. Various formulations of progestagens (e.g. oral, depot, implantable) have been studied as potential treatments for endometriosis because they induce atrophy of endometrial tissue.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of progestagens in the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO on 29 October 2024 without language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing progestagens for symptomatic endometriosis against placebo, other medications, or different doses of progestagens. Studies assessing the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device were ineligible, as a separate Cochrane review covers this intervention. Participants were of reproductive age with a laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis and associated pain symptoms. Primary outcomes included endometriosis-associated pain symptoms (overall pain, pelvic pain, and dysmenorrhoea). Secondary outcomes included quality of life, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs), each with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The meta-analysis employed a fixed-effect model, and we assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. We used GRADE to assess evidence certainty.

Main Results

We included 33 RCTs involving 5059 participants with symptomatic, laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis. We judged 13 studies at overall low risk of bias. The following comparisons are limited by the small number of studies reporting each outcome. Pain outcomes, quality of life, and patient satisfaction were measured at six months unless otherwise specified. Oral progestagens versus placebo or no treatment (8 studies) Oral progestagens compared with placebo probably reduce overall pain measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS; MD -2.58, 95% CI -3.13 to -2.03; moderate certainty), and probably reduce dysmenorrhoea at three months (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.70, moderate certainty), but may have little to no effect on pelvic pain at three months (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.69; low certainty). Oral progestagens improve quality of life (SF-36 score; MD 4.11, 95% CI 2.41 to 5.82, high certainty). There is probably little to no difference between the interventions in study withdrawal due to adverse effects (RR 2.36, CI 0.74 to 7.52, moderate certainty) and cumulative side effects (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.46, moderate certainty). Oral progestagens versus oral contraceptives (4 studies) Oral progestagens compared with oral contraceptives probably have little to no effect on pelvic pain measured on a VAS (MD 0.38, 95% CI -0.46 to 1.22, moderate certainty). There was very low-certainty evidence about their effect on dysmenorrhoea at 12 months (MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.15), quality of life (SF-36 general health perception; MD 5.2, 95% CI -1.3 to 11.70), and patient satisfaction (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.57). Oral progestagens may lead to better quality of life (SF-36 pain score; MD 11.5, 95% CI 2.35 to 20.65, low certainty). There may be little to no difference between oral progestagens and oral contraceptives in study withdrawal due to adverse effects (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.07, low certainty), and there is probably little to no difference in cumulative side effects (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.60, moderate certainty). Oral progestagens versus gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (10 studies) Oral progestagens compared with GnRH agonists may have little to no effect on overall pain measured on a VAS (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.28), risk of pelvic pain (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.59), dysmenorrhoea (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.00), SF-36 physical health score (MD 0.40, 95% CI -1.58 to 2.38), SF-36 mental health score (MD -0.50, 95% CI -3.75 to 2.75), patient satisfaction (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.26), and study withdrawal due to adverse effects (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.43). All these outcomes had low-certainty evidence. The risk of cumulative side effects was probably higher with oral progestagens (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.86, moderate certainty). Depot progestagens versus GnRH agonists (2 studies) Depot progestagens compared with GnRH agonists reduce dysmenorrhoea risk slightly (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.97, high certainty) but may have little to no effect on pelvic pain (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.07, low certainty). The interventions may be similar in study withdrawal due to adverse effects (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 8.32, low certainty), but the risk of cumulative side effects is probably lower with depot progestagens (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11, moderate certainty). Depot progestagens versus GnRH antagonist (1 study) Depot progestagens compared with GNRH agonists may have little to no effect on pelvic pain (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.03, low certainty), dysmenorrhoea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.03, low certainty), and cumulative adverse effects (RR 1.04, 0.95 to 1.14, low certainty). Study withdrawal due to side effects is likely higher with depot progestagens (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.94, moderate certainty). Depot progestagens versus the etonogestrel implant (1 study) There was very low-certainty evidence about the effect of depot progestagens versus the etonogestrel implant on overall pain measured on a VAS (MD 0.80, 95% CI - 0.42 to 2.02), patient satisfaction (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.66), and study withdrawal due to adverse effects (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.63 to 5.33).

Authors' Conclusions

In individuals with endometriosis, oral progestagens compared with placebo likely reduce overall pain and dysmenorrhoea and may reduce pelvic pain. Compared with other hormonal suppression strategies, the evidence is less certain due to the small number of studies for each comparison and outcome. Despite such limitations, this update provides a comprehensive overview and valuable insights on progestagen treatment for endometriosis, emphasising the nuanced balance between efficacy, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction.

### Does nomegestrol acetate plus 17 β-estradiol oral contraceptive improve endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain in women? [^115HMWGY]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Each woman underwent a sexual history interview. To define sexual dysfunction, the definition and classification of the second report of the international consensus development conference were used.

Sexual behavior was assessed using the self-administered Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) validated in the Italian gynecological population. The FSFI consists of six domains, which include desire (two items), arousal (four items), lubrication (four items), orgasm (three items), satisfaction (three items), and pain (three items), answered on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (no sexual activity) or 1 (never/very low) to 5 (always/very high). A score is calculated for each of the six domains, and the total score is obtained summing all the items. The total score range is 2–36. An FSFI cutoff of ≤ 26.55 is usually accepted for diagnosis of sexual dysfunction in women within a wide age range.

Moreover, for diagnosis of sexual dysfunction an essential element is the requirement that the condition causes significant personal distress for the woman. Therefore, the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) was used. The FSDS consists of 12 items, with a maximum score of 48. An FSDS score of ≥ 15 corresponds to clinically significant distress. We considered women with an FSFI score of ≤ 26.55 to be affected by sexual dysfunction if they also had an FSDS score of 15 or greater.

The study included two follow-ups at 3 and 6 months. All questionnaires were administered to both groups at the baseline evaluation and at each follow-up. Moreover, each woman received a diary to record daily sexual events, covering behaviors from self-stimulation to arousal with their partner and actual intercourse, indicated as "yes" or "no"; adverse events, namely spotting, nausea, or breast tenderness; and the characteristics of withdrawal and intracyclic bleeding. The recall period to check the events recorded above was at the end of each COC blister (about every 30 days).

At the end of the study, the women of the study group and those of the control group were asked to rate their satisfaction using E2/NOMAC COC and NSAIDs, respectively, indicating the following: very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied. Each woman on E2/NOMAC COC was informed that the pill and its regimen could cause amenorrhea.

### Does nomegestrol acetate plus 17 β-estradiol oral contraceptive improve endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain in women? [^114zreSb]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: To evaluate the effects of a 24/4 regimen combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 1.5mg 17β-estradiol (E2) and 2.5mg nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) compared to on-demand nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on women affected by endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain (the primary end point) and their quality of life (QoL) and sexual function (the secondary end points). Materials and Methods: Ninety-nine women on E2/NOMAC constituted the study group; and 63 women on NSAIDs constituted the control group. The visual analogic scale was used to measure the levels of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia. To assess their QoL, sexual function, and sexual distress, the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) were used, respectively. The study included two follow-ups at 3 and 6 months. Results: Improvement in chronic pelvic pain was observed in the study group at both the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (p < 0.001). SF-36, FSFI, and FSDS had a similar trend at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (p < 0.001). Women on NSAIDs did not report any reduction in pain symptoms or improvement in QoL (p ≤ 0.4). However, they had a limited improvement of their FSFI and FSDS (p < 0.001). The improvement of the pain symptoms, QoL, FSFI, and FSDS, was more evident in women on E2/NOMAC than in those on NSAIDs, when the study group and control group values were compared at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Women on E2/NOMAC COC showed a better reduction of endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain and an improvement of their QoL and sexual activity than those of the women on NSAIDs.

Strengths and weaknesses of the study

This large randomised trial evaluated hormonal treatments for endometriosis related pain with a long follow-up at three years, and also included an economic evaluation of postoperative use of LAP or COCP (the results will be reported in a separate paper). In addition to strict randomisation and flexibility in the interventions, the major strengths of this trial include its focus on patient centred outcomes, and the availability of primary outcome data on more than 80% (337/405) of participants. The pragmatic nature of the trial is more likely to enhance the generalisability of our findings, although the predominance of white women in the recruited sample limits our confidence about extrapolating the results to women from other ethnic groups.

The three year follow-up period and the pragmatic design meant that relatively few women continued on their initially allocated drug, changing or stopping their treatments depending on their circumstances, including changes in reproductive plans. The assumed improved continuation rate over COCP (25%) was marginal for DMPA (30%) but was evident for LNG-IUS (46%), which might mean the delivery method was better tolerated, but could equally represent the need to have the LNG-IUS removed at a medical facility. While these low adherence rates will have decreased the ability of the trial to detect a meaningful difference in efficacy between the two interventions, they do not necessarily detract from our ability to address the main aim of this pragmatic trial, which was to compare a policy of prescribing COCP or LAP after surgery for endometriosis over a three year time period.

PRE-EMPT provides data on only two of the three symptom outcomes in the core outcome set for endometriosis, which were published after the trial started. The precision of comparison of secondary outcomes was decreased by missing data owing to the prioritisation of methods designed to capture the primary outcome.

Treating the two LAP preparations as a single intervention assumes a comparable mechanism of action and potential impact on symptoms. Both treatments cause progestogenic effects, but there might be other modes of action: LNG-IUS acts locally in the uterus while DMPA is systemic and results in ovarian suppression. Balanced subgroup analysis did not show any differential effect on primary outcome measures. The current design also limits power for meaningful comparisons between LNG-IUS or DMPA individually with COCP. While these factors make it difficult to comment on the efficacy of LAPs and COCP, the results of this trial allow a clear understanding of the medium term value of prescribing either class of drug after endometriosis surgery.

Secondary outcomes

Most of the domains of the EHP-30 were improved in both groups at all time points compared with preoperative scores, but there was no consistent evidence of any difference between groups (table 2 for results at three years; supplementary table 7 other time points). Pain scores as measured by a visual analogue scale marginally improved at all time points compared with preoperative scores, and when pain was measured by a Likert scale, responses appeared consistent throughout, with most women reporting that their pelvic pain had not changed much or had become worse over the past month. There was no evidence of consistent differences between the groups (supplementary table 8).

The Fatigue Severity Scale results (supplementary table 9) were similar to baseline scores throughout in both groups, while generic quality of life scores showed marginal improvement compared with preoperative values (supplementary table 10). The numbers of participants reporting menstrual periods remained relatively consistent throughout and were lower in the LAP group than the COCP group (54% (87/161) at six months, 51% (51/101) at three years v 76% (116/152) at six months, 63% (62/98) at three years, respectively; supplementary table 11); these periods appeared to be less regular in the LAP group during the early stages of follow-up (supplementary table 12), but were comparable at three years (table 2). The number of recorded pregnancies was 17 in the LAP group and 24 in the COCP group (supplementary table 13).

Fewer women required additional treatment in the LAP group compared with the COCP group (73 v 97 events, occurring in 50 v 61 women because of several repeat interventions in some participants; supplementary table 14), translating to a 33% reduction in time to treatment failure (fig 3; hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.00). Inclusion of return to prerandomisation EHP-30 pain score into the definition of treatment failure showed 11% fewer failures in the LAP group than in the COCP group (supplementary figure 3, hazard ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.19).

Abstract

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of long acting progestogens compared with the combined oral contraceptive pill in preventing recurrence of endometriosis related pain.

Design

The PRE-EMPT (preventing recurrence of endometriosis) pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial.

Setting

34 UK hospitals.

Participants

405 women of reproductive age undergoing conservative surgery for endometriosis.

Interventions

Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a secure internet facility to a long acting progestogen (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system) or the combined oral contraceptive pill.

Main outcome measures

The primary outcome was pain measured three years after randomisation using the pain domain of the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes (evaluated at six months, one, two, and three years) included the four core and six modular domains of the EHP-30, and treatment failure (further therapeutic surgery or second line medical treatment).

Results

405 women were randomised to receive a long acting progestogen (n = 205) or combined oral contraceptive pill (n = 200). At three years, there was no difference in pain scores between the groups (adjusted mean difference −0.8, 95% confidence interval −5.7 to 4.2, P = 0.76), which had improved by around 40% in both groups compared with preoperative values (an average of 24 and 23 points for long acting progestogen and combined oral contraceptive pill groups, respectively). Most of the other domains of the EHP-30 also showed improvement at all time points compared with preoperative scores, without evidence of any differences between groups. Women randomised to a long acting progestogen underwent fewer surgical procedures or second line treatments compared with those randomised to the combined oral contraceptive pill group (73 v 97; hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.00).

Conclusions

Postoperative prescription of a long acting progestogen or the combined oral contraceptive pill results in similar levels of improvement in endometriosis related pain at three years, with both groups showing around a 40% improvement compared with preoperative levels. While women can be reassured that both options are effective, the reduced risk of repeat surgery for endometriosis and hysterectomy might make long acting reversible progestogens preferable for some.

Unanswered questions and future research

Other hormonal drugs, including dienogest and combination gonadotrophin releasing hormone antagonists with add-back hormone preparations, should be compared against LAPs and the COCP to determine relative effectiveness in preventing recurrence of pain, and their costs. The identification of non-invasive methods to diagnose endometriosis (radiological or by reliable blood and urinary biomarkers) to avoid the need for initial and repeat laparoscopy would be hugely beneficial. Therefore, future research should focus on early, non-invasive diagnosis and effective treatment of endometriosis to ensure long term alleviation of pain and improved quality of life.

Introduction

Ectopic endometrial tissue is found in up to 20% of asymptomatic women, up to 60% of those with dysmenorrhoea, and up to 30% of women with subfertility, with a peak incidence at around 40 years of age. However, symptoms may not correlate with laparoscopic findings.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of hormonal treatments given at diagnosis of endometriosis? What are the effects of hormonal treatments before surgery for endometriosis? What are the effects of non-hormonal medical treatments for endometriosis? What are the effects of surgical treatments for endometriosis? What are the effects of hormonal treatment after conservative surgery for endometriosis? What are the effects of hormonal treatment after oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) for endometriosis? What are the effects of treatments for ovarian endometrioma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to April 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 32 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: combined oral contraceptives; danazol; dydrogesterone; gestrinone; gonadorelin analogues; hormonal treatment before surgery; hormonal treatment; laparoscopic cystectomy; laparoscopic removal of endometriotic deposits (alone or with uterine nerve ablation); laparoscopic removal plus presacral neurectomy; laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; presacral neurectomy alone; and progestogens other than dydrogesterone.
