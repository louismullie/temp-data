## Question

HOW TO DIAGNOSE FH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect FH clinically. Then, I should verify which diagnostic criteria to apply and how genetic data integrate with those criteria. Next, I need to check for secondary causes that can mimic FH. After that, I should consider when and how to use genetic testing and how to interpret negative results. Then, I will examine physical findings that support the diagnosis. Next, I should plan cascade screening of relatives. Finally, I will review risk stratification, special considerations for homozygous FH, and summarize an algorithmic approach while validating each step against current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the triggers for clinical suspicion, because missing this step leads to underdiagnosis. Adults with untreated LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL and children with LDL-C persistently ≥ 150–160 mg/dL, a history of premature ASCVD in the proband or close relatives, and classic findings such as tendon xanthomas or corneal arcus before age 45 should prompt evaluation for FH; the condition is common (about 1 in 220–250) yet largely undiagnosed, so I need to keep a low threshold for suspicion in practice [^114GY9Hx] [^1159VzAv] [^113uhyJh].

> Next, I will apply validated clinical criteria, but I should double-check the nuances of each system before classifying the case. The Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN), Simon Broome, and MEDPED criteria are accepted frameworks; DLCN assigns points across LDL-C level, family history, premature ASCVD, physical signs, and genetics and classifies as possible, probable, or definite FH, while Simon Broome defines "definite FH" with very high cholesterol plus tendon xanthomas or a pathogenic variant and "probable FH" with high cholesterol plus family history; MEDPED uses age- and family linkage–specific cholesterol cut points; I should confirm that many payers prefer DLCN granularity for advanced therapy authorization [^113DvfU6] [^111AN7gq] [^113x2Gh9]. Wait, let me verify one common pitfall: a positive genetic test alone is sufficient for a definite diagnosis under Simon Broome, but in DLCN a pathogenic variant contributes points and still requires phenotypic elevation to meet "definite" cutoffs; yes, that distinction is correct and clinically important [^113DvfU6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before excluding secondary causes of hyperlipidemia that can confound the phenotype. I need to check thyroid function, liver enzymes and cholestasis markers, renal function, fasting glucose or A1c, and review medications that raise LDL-C; guidelines emphasize that secondary causes should be excluded or corrected before confirming FH, and that repeated measurements are advisable to ensure persistent elevation [^1148un7X] [^113x2Gh9].

> Now, I should consider genetic testing strategy and interpretation because it refines diagnosis and enables cascade screening. Testing for LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 is standard; most monogenic FH is due to LDLR variants, with APOB and PCSK9 less frequent; I should confirm age thresholds for testing in children and remember that a negative genetic test does not exclude FH given detection gaps and polygenic causes; moreover, carriers of pathogenic variants often warrant more aggressive management and facilitate family-based identification [^1159VzAv] [^114byJ2i] [^116TNxyv] [^113AY7yK]. Wait, I need to verify professional society positions on when to offer testing: CCS 2018 and other expert statements recommend offering genetic testing when available to patients with definite or probable clinical FH and to enable cascade testing of relatives, which aligns with practice in specialized lipid clinics [^116DGfnE] [^112yaoDz].

> I will now examine the role of the physical examination, but I should confirm which signs meaningfully shift pretest probability. Tendon xanthomas, especially at the Achilles tendons, and corneal arcus before age 45 are classic and add substantial weight in criteria such as DLCN; sonographic tendon assessment can increase detection of xanthomas, and these findings should be explicitly documented because they can materially change the diagnostic score [^1148un7X].

> Next, I should review cascade screening because it is the highest-yield case-finding strategy in FH. Once an index case is identified, I need to ensure first-degree relatives undergo lipid profiling and, when a pathogenic variant is known, targeted genetic testing; direct contact strategies and extending beyond first-degree relatives increase new cases per index case, and starting in childhood (from age 5, earlier if HoFH suspected) allows early intervention; I should also remember reverse cascade screening when a child is diagnosed [^113uhyJh] [^114nN96v] [^116TNxyv] [^112z9TCc] [^116zPT5W]. But wait, what if local resources are limited? CCS still recommends building cascade protocols at regional and national levels, given Tier 1 evidence for effectiveness in identifying additional affected relatives [^116zPT5W] [^115xzK2Z].

> I need to ensure risk assessment and treatment planning are tailored for FH rather than using general population tools. Hold on, I should verify guidance on risk calculators: CCS 2018 explicitly recommends against using Framingham, Pooled Cohort Equations, or SCORE for risk stratification in FH; instead, I should consider genotype, baseline LDL-C, response to therapy, and conventional risk modifiers like age, sex, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, HDL-C, and lipoprotein(a), while targeting at least a 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline within a shared decision-making framework [^114bRGoM] [^116cg93D] [^111VSB58] [^112yaoDz]. Hmm, wait a minute, did I skip monitoring requirements? No — those fall under management rather than diagnosis per se, but flagging them early helps coordinate timely escalation to ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, and referral when needed [^111VSB58].

> Special considerations for suspected homozygous FH (HoFH) warrant immediate attention, and I should double-check the red flags. Markedly elevated untreated LDL-C often > 500 mg/dL, cutaneous or tendon xanthomas in early childhood, and both parents with phenotypes consistent with HeFH should prompt urgent referral to specialized centers; untreated LDLR-negative HoFH rarely survive beyond the second decade, so early initiation of maximal lipid-lowering therapy and apheresis where available is critical [^115YErJb] [^112DPQ8K]. Hold on, I should verify timing: expert consensus advises starting intensive therapy ideally in the first year of life or at diagnosis, with apheresis by age 5–8 when feasible, which underscores the need for rapid recognition and action [^112DPQ8K].

> Let me summarize the diagnostic algorithm to ensure internal consistency with guidelines before finalizing. Suspect FH in markedly elevated LDL-C or premature ASCVD, apply DLCN or Simon Broome to classify probability, exclude secondary causes, and, when available, use genetic testing for definitive diagnosis and to enable cascade screening; document physical signs to support scoring, and confirm diagnosis either by a pathogenic variant or a high clinical score such as DLCN > 8, then proceed to family screening and risk-tailored therapy planning; this pathway aligns with CCS 2018 and ESC/EAS 2020 recommendations [^112yaoDz] [^113x2Gh9] [^114nN96v].

> As a final check, let me consider implementation tools that can augment case finding without replacing clinical judgment. Electronic health record algorithms and machine learning models can surface at-risk individuals at scale and may outperform traditional criteria for identifying variant carriers in population datasets, but I should confirm positives with clinical criteria and genetics and embed these tools into a cascade screening workflow to translate detection into outcomes [^1152nXhS] [^1162KgBH] [^115sgk17].

Diagnose familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) by combining **clinical criteria, lipid levels, and genetic testing**, then confirm with cascade screening of relatives [^113x2Gh9] [^114nN96v]. Use the **Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) or Simon Broome criteria**, and confirm with genetic testing when available [^111AN7gq] [^114byJ2i]. Cascade screening of **first-degree relatives** [^115xzK2Z] is essential for early detection and prevention of premature cardiovascular disease [^112yaoDz].

---

## Clinical diagnostic criteria

Several **validated clinical criteria** are used to diagnose FH [^114UjqiV]:

- **Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria**: A point-based system considering LDL-C levels, family history, clinical signs (e.g. tendon xanthomas), and genetic testing results [^111AN7gq].

- **Simon Broome criteria**: Incorporates LDL-C levels, family history, clinical signs, and genetic testing results [^114UjqiV].

- **MEDPED criteria**: Age-specific LDL-C thresholds combined with family history [^113DvfU6].

These criteria **classify patients as definite, probable, or possible FH** based on clinical findings and lipid levels [^111AN7gq].

---

## Lipid profile assessment

Elevated **LDL-C levels** are a hallmark of FH [^113x2Gh9]. The following thresholds are commonly used [^111jRqVp]:

| **Age group** | **LDL-C threshold** |
|-|-|
| Adults | ≥ 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) |
| Children | ≥ 160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L) |

---

These thresholds are used alongside clinical criteria to **identify individuals suspected of having FH** [^114GY9Hx].

---

## Genetic testing

Genetic testing is **recommended to confirm the diagnosis of FH** and to identify specific mutations [^114byJ2i]. The most common genes implicated in FH include:

- **LDLR**: Low-density lipoprotein receptor gene.

- **APOB**: Apolipoprotein B gene.

- **PCSK9**: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene [^113x2Gh9].

Identifying pathogenic variants in these genes provides **definitive confirmation of FH** [^116DGfnE].

---

## Cascade screening

Cascade screening involves **systematic testing of first-degree relatives** of individuals with FH [^114nN96v]. This approach significantly increases detection of new FH cases and enables early intervention to prevent premature cardiovascular disease [^113uhyJh].

---

## Exclusion of secondary causes

Before confirming FH, it is essential to **exclude secondary causes** of hypercholesterolemia, such as hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, or certain medications [^1148un7X].

---

## Summary of diagnostic process

1. **Clinical evaluation**. Use validated criteria (DLCN, Simon Broome) to assess clinical signs, family history, and lipid levels [^111AN7gq].

2. **Lipid profile**. Measure LDL-C levels to identify hypercholesterolemia [^113x2Gh9].

3. **Genetic testing**. Confirm diagnosis by identifying pathogenic variants in LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 genes [^114byJ2i].

4. **Cascade screening**. Test first-degree relatives to identify additional cases [^114nN96v].

5. **Exclude secondary causes**. Rule out other causes of hypercholesterolemia [^1148un7X].

---

Diagnosing FH relies on a combination of clinical criteria, lipid profile assessment, genetic testing, and cascade screening of relatives. This comprehensive approach ensures **accurate diagnosis and early intervention** to prevent premature cardiovascular disease [^113x2Gh9].

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly concerning patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, the CCS 2018 guidelines recommend implementing cascade screening (lipid profile) protocols at the local, provincial, and national levels. These protocols should be offered to first-degree relatives of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^113DvfU6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Although there are no internationally agreed-upon criteria for the diagnosis of FH, useful diagnostic criteria have been developed. The main diagnostic tools used for FH include the US Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death (MEDPED) criteria, the UK Simon Broome system (UK FH Register criteria), the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria, and the National Lipid Association expert panel recommendations. The Dutch Lipid Clinic Network, which uses a scoring system to predict the likelihood of an index patient having FH, and the Simon Broome criteria are the only tools that incorporate genetic test results into their algorithm. In the Simon Broome criteria, a positive genetic test is sufficient for a definitive diagnosis of FH, while in the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria, a positive genetic test should be accompanied by an additional measure (e.g. elevated LDL-C levels) to fulfill the definite diagnosis criteria.

Although the existing diagnostic tools differ from each other, both in structure and the cut-off values of the LDL-C level necessary for diagnosis, their predictive values are comparable. Among these diagnostic strategies, the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria provide the most detailed assessment of the likelihood of a diagnosis of HeFH and are sometimes favored by insurance providers for the purpose of denial or approval of treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with FH. More recently, the American Heart Association proposed a simple set of criteria; however, these criteria have not yet been widely adopted.

### New case detection by cascade testing in familial hypercholesterolemia: A systematic review of the literature [^113uhyJh]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia is 1 in 250, but less than 10% of patients are diagnosed. Cascade testing enables early detection of cases through systematic family tracing. The establishment of familial hypercholesterolemia cascade testing programs in the US could be informed by approaches used elsewhere.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of published studies in the English language on cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolemia. These studies reported the number of index cases and number of relatives tested, and specified methods of contacting relatives and testing modalities used. For each study, we calculated the yield (proportion of relatives who test positive) and new cases per index case to facilitate comparison.

- **Results**: We identified 10 studies from the literature that met inclusion criteria; the mean number of probands and relatives per study was 242 and 826, respectively. The average yield was 44.76%, with a range of 30% to 60.5%, and the mean new cases per index case was 1.65, with a range of 0.22 to 8.0. New cases per index case tended to be greater in studies that used direct contact versus indirect contact (2.06 versus 0.86), tested beyond first-degree relatives versus only first-degree relatives (3.65 versus 0.80), used active sample collection versus collection at clinic (4.11 versus 1.06), and utilized genetic testing versus biochemical testing (2.47 versus 0.42).

- **Conclusions**: New case detection in familial hypercholesterolemia cascade testing programs tended to be higher with direct contact of relatives and testing beyond first-degree relatives.

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^1159VzAv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common yet underdiagnosed autosomal dominant disorder that affects approximately 1 in 220 individuals globally. FH is characterized by a lifelong elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and, if untreated, leads to early-onset atherosclerosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Affected men and women who are untreated have a 30% to 50% risk of a fatal or nonfatal cardiac event by ages 50 and 60 years, respectively.

The most common causes of FH are pathogenic variants of the LDL receptor (LDL-R) gene, responsible for 85% to 90% of genetically confirmed FH. Pathogenic variants of the apolipoprotein (ApoB) gene result in decreased binding of LDL to the LDL-R and account for 5% to 15% of cases. Gain-of-function mutations in the gene for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), which result in increased destruction of LDL-R, are responsible for 1% of cases of FH. Autosomal recessive FH, caused by homozygous mutations in the LDL-R adaptor protein-1, is associated with a mild homozygous FH (HoFH) phenotype and is beyond the scope of this review.

### The lipoprotein profile evaluated by 1H-NMR improves the performance of genetic testing in familial hypercholesterolemia [^117VJ4MV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) relies on clinical and genetic criteria. A significant portion of FH patients who meet the criteria for definite FH exhibit negative genetic testing. Enhancing the identification of true genetic-based FH remains a clinical challenge. In-depth analysis of lipoprotein alterations could potentially increase the yield of genetic testing. We assessed whether the number, size, and composition of lipoproteins evaluated by 1H-NMR could enhance the identification of FH patients with pathogenic gene variants.

- **Methods**: We studied 294 clinically definite FH patients, with 222 (75.5%) showing positive genetic testing, as the discovery cohort. For external validation, we studied 88 children with FH, 72 (81%) of whom had positive genetic testing. The advanced lipoprotein test, based on 1H-NMR (Liposcale®), was conducted at baseline following a lipid-lowering drug washout of at least six weeks. Random forest and logistic regression evaluated the association of variables with genetic variants. Areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated, and a predictive formula was developed and applied to the validation cohort.

- **Results**: A formula derived from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lipoprotein analyses effectively improved the identification of genetically positive FH patients beyond low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (AUC = 0.87). Key parameters contributing to the identification formula included LDL particle number, high-density lipoprotein size, and remnant cholesterol. The formula also enhanced the classification of FH children with a higher accuracy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^115gxXfv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

FH is significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated, particularly in children. The burden of early diagnosis of FH rests on primary care providers, who have the unique potential to help improve the detection and management of FH. Universal lipid screening in children between the ages of 9 to 11 years, as recommended by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and American College of Cardiology, has the potential to substantially improve case finding.

Earlier lipid screening at the age of 2 years is recommended if a child has a strong family history of early-onset CAD (males, aged 240 mg/dL (6.2 mmol/L); or if the child has underlying cardiac risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus or obesity. Screening between the ages of 9 to 11 years enables the best discernment between those with and without FH and avoids confounding lipid changes secondary to LDL-C reduction, known to transiently occur during puberty. Survey data suggest that fewer than one-third of practicing pediatricians have adopted these recommendations. Other obstacles to early diagnosis include the limited public awareness of FH as a disease entity, its inherited nature, and the potential cardiovascular consequences if left untreated. Data from the FH Foundation's CASCADE (Cascade Screening for Awareness and Detection) FH registry demonstrated that the diagnosis of FH occurred…

### Limited-variant screening vs comprehensive genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis [^116EueHg]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Although identification of a P/LP variant is part of most diagnostic criteria for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), diagnosis has traditionally been based only on clinical criteria, including elevated LDL cholesterol levels and family history of premature cardiovascular disease. However, family history may be inconclusive or unavailable, making it insensitive, and clinical observations such as cholesterol levels do not always meet diagnostic thresholds in some families with FH. Genetic testing is sufficient for diagnosis within clinical diagnostic criteria and can identify affected family members before symptom onset, enabling children to benefit from routine evaluation or treatment at a young age. A 20-year follow-up study of statin therapy in children found that none of those receiving treatment had died of cardiovascular disease before age 40 years, compared with 7% of their parents, who had initiated treatment later in life.

Unfortunately, genetic testing for FH is underused, with 90% of affected individuals worldwide remaining undiagnosed and only 3.9% of patients with FH in the US having a record of genetic testing. Recent expert statements recommend that patients suspected of having FH be offered genetic testing and that first-degree relatives of genetically positive individuals be screened for FH by lipid profile or genetic testing. In addition, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cascade screening of relatives of individuals with FH. While the sequencing data in this study was sourced from a single clinical laboratory, any testing facility that provides high-coverage NGS is applicable.

### Canadian cardiovascular society position statement on familial hypercholesterolemia: Update 2018 [^111Vfd3T]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, the CCS 2018 guidelines recommend instituting a personalized treatment plan. This plan should take into account factors such as age, additional cardiovascular risk factors, psychosocial and socioeconomic factors, and personal and family preferences. This approach should be developed as a shared decision-making process. The diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia, using validated clinical criteria and/or genotyping, may occur at any age and imparts a high, lifelong risk of ASCVD.

### An evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of population genetic screening for familial hypercholesterolemia in US patients [^11524DeZ]. Atherosclerosis (2024). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia is an underdiagnosed genetic metabolic condition that limits the clearance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increases the lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Population genetic screening in unselected individuals could quickly identify cases of familial hypercholesterolemia and enable early prevention, but the economic impact of widespread screening on patients has not been studied.

- **Methods**: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of population genetic screening for familial hypercholesterolemia in 20 and 35-year-old adults in the United States from the perspective of patients. We developed a decision tree Markov hybrid model to examine diagnoses, cardiovascular disease, cardiac events, quality of life, and costs under population genetic screening compared to family-based cascade testing.

- **Results**: While population genetic screening increased diagnoses and reduced the incidence of cardiovascular disease, it was not cost-effective compared to cascade testing at levels of willingness to pay. Lower genetic testing costs, combined screening with other genetic conditions, and support to maintain lipid-lowering therapy use over time could improve the cost-effectiveness of population genetic screening.

- **Conclusions**: Future research is needed to examine how cost-sharing strategies may affect the cost-effectiveness of screening for patients and how families and providers experience the clinical and economic outcomes of population screening.

### Developing and optimizing innovative tools to address familial hypercholesterolemia underdiagnosis: Identification methods, patient activation, and cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolemia [^117NgfbV]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common cardiovascular genetic disorder and, if left untreated, is associated with an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Due to lifelong exposure to elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, individuals with FH are at very high risk of premature ASCVD without early and aggressive lipid-lowering therapy. Indeed, 17,500 deaths annually and a significant percentage of heart attacks in people under 45 are attributable to FH. Individuals with FH have up to a 20-fold increased risk of ASCVD relative to non-FH individuals with normal LDL-C. Importantly, when FH is diagnosed and treated early in life, the risk of ASCVD is greatly reduced.

Individuals with FH can be identified via clinical criteria and/or genetic testing. Because FH is an autosomal dominant genetic condition, screening at-risk relatives of individuals with FH (cascade testing) is highly effective in identifying additional individuals with FH who require treatment. However, in the United States, neither FH identification nor cascade testing is systematically performed. When index patient identification and cascade testing are routinely performed, ascertainment is vastly improved, preventive interventions begin at a younger age, and outcomes improve. Although FH is common, fatal, and treatable, estimates show 90% or 1.1 million people in the United States with FH are undiagnosed.

### Life course approach for managing familial hypercholesterolemia [^114d1v42]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

An FH diagnosis may be made if a genetic variant associated with FH is present, or phenotypic criteria using scoring algorithms such as Dutch Lipid Clinics, Simon–Broome, Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death, or American Heart Association. It should be remembered that patients with a genetic variant may not meet phenotypic criteria, and conversely, many patients who meet phenotypic criteria will not have a positive genetic test. While genetic testing is optimal for accurate diagnosis, it is also important for the initiation of cascade testing of relatives and, in the presence of severe hypercholesterolemia, in distinguishing between HeFH and HoFH. Testing may not be available in many places worldwide and may be too expensive for many families. Except for countries where cholesterol screening programs are in place, most children worldwide are diagnosed on the basis of cascade testing of index cases or a known positive family history of FH, premature CAD, or severely elevated cholesterol.

### A review on the diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of familial hypercholesterolaemia [^113AY7yK]. Atherosclerosis (2003). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) affects approximately 1 in 500 people (10 million worldwide), and the elevated serum cholesterol concentrations lead to more than a 50% risk of fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease by age 50 in men and at least 30% in women by age 60. Based on a systematic literature search, we review the natural history of FH, describe the diagnostic criteria, and consider the effectiveness of treatment.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive review was conducted of the literature on the diagnosis of FH, the morbidity and mortality related to treated and untreated FH, and the evidence on the effectiveness of treatment of FH in adults and children. Treatment options have changed since statin treatment became available, and we have not considered pre-statin therapy studies of treatment effectiveness.

- **Findings and discussion**: A clinical diagnosis of FH is widely used, but a definitive diagnosis can be made by genetic screening, although mutations are currently only detected in 30–50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis. Under-diagnosis of FH has been reported worldwide, ranging from less than 1% to 44%. The relative risk of death in FH patients not treated with statins is between three and fourfold. However, treatment is effective and delays or prevents the onset of coronary heart disease. Early detection and treatment are important. Aggressive LDL therapy is more effective in the regression of the carotid intima-media thickness than conventional LDL therapy. Diagnosis at birth is problematic and should be delayed until at least 2 years of age.

### Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: New insights and guidance for clinicians to improve detection and clinical management. A position paper from the consensus panel on familial hypercholesterolaemia of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^115YErJb]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular complications and natural history

The burden of markedly elevated plasma LDL-C levels from birth underlies the sequelae of ACVD complications unique to HoFH. The cholesterol-year score, an integrated measure of the severity and duration of hypercholesterolaemia, is directly associated with cholesterol deposition in vascular and extravascular compartments in HoFH patients, thus reinforcing the concept that absolute LDL-C levels affect the severity of the CV phenotype. In clinically diagnosed HoFH, the first major CV events often occur during adolescence, although angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and death have been reported in early childhood, typically in individuals who are LDLR-negative. Untreated HoFH patients who are LDLR-negative rarely survive beyond the second decade. While HoFH patients who are LDLR-defective have a better prognosis, almost all develop clinically significant ACVD by the age of 30. Long-term studies are still needed to assess CV risk in genetically confirmed HoFH without the severe phenotype usually observed in clinically defined HoFH.

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is characterized by accelerated atherosclerosis, typically affecting the aortic root and compromising the coronary ostia. It also affects other territories, including the carotid, descending aorta, and ileo-femoral and renal arteries. Cholesterol and calcium deposits, as well as fibrosis and inflammation in both the aortic root and aortic valve cusps, can lead to supra-valvular aortic stenosis. These manifestations often occur within the first and second decades of life for HoFH patients.

### Strategies for screening for familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care and other community settings [^114UjqiV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia is a common inherited condition linked to premature cardiovascular disease. The increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that result from high cholesterol levels since birth can be prevented by initiating lipid-lowering therapy. However, most patients in the UK and worldwide remain undiagnosed. Established diagnostic criteria in clinical practice include the Simon-Broome and Dutch Lipid Clinical Network criteria, classifying patients as having probable, possible, or definite familial hypercholesterolaemia.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of healthcare intervention strategies to systematically improve the identification of familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care and other community settings, compared to usual care (incidental approaches to identifying familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care and other community settings).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, with the last search conducted on 13 September 2021. Additional databases searched include the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and SCOPUS, alongside hand-searching relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and the grey literature. The last search for these was conducted on 05 March 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: Following the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group guidelines, we planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSI).

### Childhood screening for familial hypercholesterolemia: JACC review topic of the week [^114sKEg6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Screening for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in childhood remains controversial. Existing guidelines offer practitioners conflicting advice despite generally agreeing on the evidence and areas where evidence is lacking, including a lack of long-term clinical trials demonstrating coronary event reduction as a result of screening and long-term data on statin side effects. A limitation of existing evidence-based frameworks is reliance on one evidence grading system to determine recommendations. However, rigorous evidence evaluation alternatives relevant to FH exist. FH is considered a tier 1 genetic condition, meaning that identification and treatment will improve health outcomes among those affected. Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the primary consequence of FH, can be considered causal for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Incorporating these concepts into existing evidence pathways allows the inclusion of surrogate clinical trial outcomes (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and atherosclerosis regression) and observational data on medication safety, strengthening the evidence for pediatric screening for FH.

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^115HA9pM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

**Ongoing and future research**: There are still significant gaps in our understanding of optimal diagnostic tools and management methods for individuals with FH. The Familial Hypercholesterolemia Foundation established the ongoing CASCADE‐FH registry to address gaps in knowledge and identify barriers to comprehensive FH screening, identification, and treatment among 40 clinical sites across the United States. Patients with FH are followed longitudinally to track changes in LDL‐C‐lowering therapy, LDL‐C goal achievement, patient‐reported outcomes, and clinical outcomes. Data as of February 2017 demonstrated that less than 50% of patients were aware of available treatment options and the increased risk of heart disease. Results from the CASCADE‐FH registry, and similar registries in Europe and Asia, will help inform optimal screening, diagnosis, and treatment strategies in FH.

### Developing and optimizing innovative tools to address familial hypercholesterolemia underdiagnosis: Identification methods, patient activation, and cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolemia [^111yGVC2]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common cardiovascular genetic disorder and, if left untreated, is associated with an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Although FH is common, fatal, and treatable, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated due to a lack of systematic methods to identify individuals with FH and limited uptake of cascade testing.

- **Methods and results**: This mixed-method, multi-stage study will optimize, test, and implement innovative approaches for both FH identification and cascade testing in three aims. To improve the identification of individuals with FH, in Aim 1, we will compare and refine automated phenotype-based and genomic approaches to identify individuals likely to have FH. To improve cascade testing uptake for at-risk individuals, in Aim 2, we will use a patient-centered design thinking process to optimize and develop novel, active family communication methods. Using a prospective, observational pragmatic trial, we will assess the uptake and effectiveness of each family communication method on cascade testing. Guided by an implementation science framework, in Aim 3, we will develop a comprehensive guide to identify individuals with FH. Using the Conceptual Model for Implementation Research, we will evaluate implementation outcomes, including feasibility, acceptability, and perceived sustainability, as well as health outcomes related to the optimized methods and tools developed in Aims 1 and 2.

### Canadian cardiovascular society position statement on familial hypercholesterolemia: Update 2018 [^111VSB58]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for familial hypercholesterolemia, specifically concerning general principles, the CCS 2018 guidelines recommend instituting a personalized treatment plan. This plan should take into account at a minimum the patient's age, additional cardiovascular risk factors, psychosocial and socioeconomic factors, and personal and family preferences. The development of this plan should be a shared decision-making process, as the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia, using validated clinical criteria and/or genotyping, may occur at any age and imparts a high, lifelong risk of ASCVD.

### Selection of individuals for genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolaemia: Development and external validation of a prediction model for the presence of a mutation causing familial hypercholesterolaemia [^1135Qzhk]. European Heart Journal (2017). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease that warrants early diagnosis to prevent premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, genetic testing to make a definite diagnosis is costly, and careful selection of eligible subjects is important. Unfortunately, the accuracy of diagnostic criteria is poor, especially in young individuals. We therefore developed and validated a model to predict the presence of an FH-causing mutation in persons referred by general practitioners.

- **Methods and results**: All participants in the Dutch FH screening programme from 1994 to 2014 were included in the development cohort. The validation cohort consisted of consecutive patients, suspected for FH, attending the outpatient lipid clinic in Saguenay (Quebec) from 1993 to 2014. Cross-sectional data were available on medical history, lipid profile, and DNA analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for model development. The primary outcome was the presence of a deleterious FH mutation. The development cohort comprised 26,167 FH patients and 37,939 unaffected relatives. Our final model included age; sex; levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides; history and age of CVD; use of statins; smoking; alcohol; and presence of hypertension. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 85.4% (95% CI: 85.0–85.9). The calibration slope was 1.02 (where 1.00 is optimal). In the validation cohort (1436 FH patients and 1767 unaffected persons), the AUC was 95.4%.

### Genetic testing preferences and intentions in patients with clinically diagnosed familial hypercholesterolemia [^113Rxdvb]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2020). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common Mendelian disorder characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol levels, which, if untreated, can cause premature heart disease. Less than 10% of cases in the United States are diagnosed. This study investigates decision-making factors associated with intentions to have FH genetic testing among patients clinically diagnosed with FH.

Fifty-three clinically diagnosed adults with FH and no genetic testing were recruited through the FH Foundation and lipid clinics. Participants completed a survey containing items capturing various reasons to engage in genetic testing. Exploratory factor analysis of survey items identified three factors: aversion to FH genetic information; curiosity regarding medical/family history; and psychological reassurance. Psychological reassurance was the only significant predictor of genetic testing intentions. The positive effect of reassurance on genetic testing intention was moderated by aversion such that individuals who were low in reassurance were more inclined to decline testing if aversion was high.

The findings suggest that clinically diagnosed patients' decisions about FH genetic testing are driven principally by psychological reassurance, particularly when low in aversion to FH genetic information.

### Cardiovascular risk stratification in familial hypercholesterolaemia [^114Fhw7B]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common autosomal-dominant disorder in most European countries. Patients with FH are characterized by a raised level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a high risk of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Currently, there is no consensus regarding the clinical utility to predict future coronary events or testing for the presence of subclinical atherosclerotic disease in asymptomatic patients with FH.

Family screening of patients with FH, as recommended by the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline, would result in finding many young individuals with a diagnosis of FH who are clinically asymptomatic. The traditional CHD risk scores, such as the Framingham score, are insufficient for risk prediction in this group of young individuals.

In addition, a better understanding of the genetic aetiology of the FH phenotype and CHD risk in monogenic FH and polygenic hypercholesterolaemia is needed. Non-invasive imaging methods, such as carotid intima-media thickness measurement, might produce more reliable information in identifying high-risk patients with FH. The potential market authorization of novel therapeutic agents, such as PCSK9 monoclonal inhibitors, makes it essential to have a better screening programme to prioritize the candidates for treatment with the most severe form of FH and at higher risk of coronary events. The utility of new imaging techniques and new cardiovascular biomarkers remains to be determined in prospective trials.

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^112Xwtrw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic condition characterized by high cholesterol levels, specifically low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Various diagnostic criteria have been established to identify this condition, including:

- **US MEDPED criteria**: These criteria help diagnose FH in the United States by considering factors such as cholesterol levels and family history.

- **Simon Broome criteria**: Used in the UK, these criteria involve genetic testing and clinical presentations to diagnose FH according to registers specifically for this purpose.

- **Dutch lipid network criteria**: This set of guidelines originates from the Netherlands, focusing on lipid levels and genetic testing to establish a diagnosis of FH.

- **NLA considerations**: The National Lipid Association provides guidance on screening and diagnosing FH, combining different diagnostic considerations similar to established ones globally.

A comparison of these various criteria showcases different approaches to FH diagnosis. Additionally, diagnostic considerations by the American Heart Association emphasize factors like apolipoprotein B (ApoB), LDL-C, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) as important elements to consider in diagnosis.

### Knowledge gaps in the management of familial hypercholesterolaemia. A UK based survey [^115M6jUR]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Untreated individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are at increased risk of developing premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Early diagnosis and treatment can result in a normal life expectancy. A recent survey commissioned by the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) reported a lack of awareness of FH in the general population. We conducted a survey to assess knowledge among healthcare professionals involved in the assessment and management of cardiovascular risk and disease in the United Kingdom.

- **Methods**: A survey designed to assess knowledge of diagnostic criteria, risk assessment, the role of cascade screening, and management options for patients with FH was distributed to 1,000 healthcare professionals (response rate 44.3%). The same survey was redistributed following attendance at an educational session on FH.

- **Results**: 151 respondents (40.5%) reported having patients under their care who would meet the diagnostic criteria for FH, but just 61.4% recognized that cardiovascular risk estimation tools cannot be applied in FH, and only 22.3% understood the relative risk of premature CVD compared to the general population. Similarly, just 65.9% were aware of recommendations regarding cascade screening.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence and associated risk of FH continue to be underestimated, and knowledge of diagnostic criteria and treatment options is suboptimal. These results support the recent Consensus Statement of the EAS and production of quality standards by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Further work is required.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population: Guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease: Consensus statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^115xm9L9]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

We recommend that most individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) should be treated in primary care, preferably in a family context, while complex cases, including children, should be referred to specialized lipid or FH clinics. However, as FH management in primary care poses major challenges such as appropriate use of genetic testing, frequent requirement for polypharmacy, specialist knowledge of non-invasive testing, and complex organizational requirements for family cascade screening, 'shared care' between primary care and specialized lipid or FH clinics is another attractive option. In most countries, there is an urgent need for the education of physicians to deal with FH, to establish networks of Lipid/FH clinics, and to establish laboratories for genetic screening and testing, preferably in a concerted manner.

### Rationale and design of the Familial Hypercholesterolemia Foundation CASCADE screening for awareness and detection of familial hypercholesterolemia registry [^113HfqVr]. American Heart Journal (2014). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a hereditary condition caused by various genetic mutations that lead to significantly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, resulting in a 20-fold increased lifetime risk for premature cardiovascular disease. Although its prevalence in the United States is 1 in 300 to 500 individuals, less than 10% of FH patients are formally diagnosed, and many are not appropriately treated. Contemporary data are needed to more fully characterize FH disease prevalence, treatment strategies, and patient experiences in the United States.

- **Design**: The Familial Hypercholesterolemia Foundation, a patient-led nonprofit organization, has established the CASCADE FH Registry as a national, multicenter initiative to identify US FH patients and track their treatment, as well as clinical and patient-reported outcomes over time. The CASCADE FH will use multiple enrollment strategies to maximize identification of FH patients. Electronic health record screening of healthcare systems will provide an efficient mechanism to identify undiagnosed patients. A group of specialized lipid clinics will enter baseline and annual follow-up data on demographics, laboratory values, treatment, and clinical events. Patients meeting prespecified low-density lipoprotein or total cholesterol criteria suspicious for FH will have the opportunity to self-enroll in an online patient portal, with information collected directly from patients semiannually. Registry patients will be provided information.

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^115xzK2Z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Diagnosing familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in a child or parent provides the opportunity for cascade screening, which involves testing all first-degree relatives for elevated LDL-C or a known genetic mutation. When first-degree relatives of the index patient are identified to have FH, they become the locus for further cascade screening of second- and third-degree relatives. A number of studies in the primary care setting have successfully implemented strategies of either universal or opportunistic pediatric lipid screening, resulting in the diagnosis of FH in parents and siblings. The DECOPIN project also documented significant success in diagnosing FH among children whose parents were diagnosed both clinically and genetically as having definite FH. In fact, cascade screening of relatives has been given a Tier 1 classification by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because of the efficacy with which FH can be diagnosed in this setting.

### Defining severe familial hypercholesterolaemia and the implications for clinical management: A consensus statement from the International Atherosclerosis Society Severe Familial Hypercholesterolemia Panel [^1176YLTg]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia is common in individuals who have experienced a myocardial infarction at a young age. As many as one in 200 people could have heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, while up to one in 300,000 individuals could be homozygous. The phenotypes of heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia overlap considerably; the response to treatment is also heterogeneous. In this review, we aim to define a phenotype for severe familial hypercholesterolaemia and identify people at the highest risk for cardiovascular disease based on the concentration of LDL cholesterol in blood and individuals' responsiveness to conventional lipid-lowering treatment.

We assess the importance of molecular characterization and define the role of other cardiovascular risk factors and advanced subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in risk stratification. Individuals with severe familial hypercholesterolaemia might particularly benefit from early and more aggressive cholesterol-lowering treatment (e.g. with PCSK9 inhibitors). In addition to better-tailored therapy, more precise characterization of individuals with severe familial hypercholesterolaemia could improve resource use.

### A scoping review of interventions increasing screening and diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia [^1138owJ6]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the most common genetic conditions, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 250 individuals. If left untreated, FH greatly increases risk for cardiovascular disease and premature death. Currently, FH is largely underdiagnosed, and interventions are needed to increase identification. The purpose of this study was to identify effective interventions aimed at increasing FH diagnosis.

A scoping review of the literature addressing interventions to increase FH detection was conducted. Included studies detailed interventions that increased screening and detection of FH globally. Studies were characterized by intervention type and analyzed for themes using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.

A total of 46 studies across 32 countries were included in the review. All studies were effective in increasing FH detection. In total, 12 different intervention types were extracted, with the most used being cascade and electronic medical record screening-based interventions.

Given the diversity of effective interventions identified in this review, future efforts could explore approaches that maximize identification through a combination of interventions. Our results support one such strategy that uses electronic medical records to screen for index cases and a two-step indirect and direct contact method of index cases' relatives.

### Estimated yield of screening for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with and without genetic testing in US adults [^114CFpPz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the 2018 American College of Cardiology/AHA cholesterol guidelines recommending that all US adults aged ≥ 20 years not already on lipid-lowering therapy undergo lipid measurements to estimate ASCVD risk and establish baseline values, there is limited evidence on the diagnostic yield of screening and a relative lack of awareness and lipid testing among younger adults. Around two-thirds of US adults report having their cholesterol checked, but those aged ≥ 40 years are 2.5 to 2.7 times more likely to be aware of a hypercholesterolemia diagnosis than those aged < 40 years. As FH screening goes beyond measuring lipids alone, collecting accurate personal and family history information, patient symptoms, and genetics, it is likely that the number of young adults with FH screening is even lower.

Our results identified potential subgroups of US adults for whom FH screening may be especially beneficial.

- **Lipid-lowering treatment uncertainty**: In some groups that we examined, an FH diagnosis may not alter treatment decisions, such as those with an LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL for whom high-intensity statins are currently recommended. However, in subgroups for whom decisions about lipid-lowering treatment may be less certain — for example, young adults, those with an LDL-C between 160 and 189 mg/dL, or those with a 10-year ASCVD risk score < 7.5% — we quantified the potential FH screening yield that can be used to inform FH screening policy and clinical treatment decisions.

Data from the Familial Hypercholesterolemia Studies Collaboration show that the median age of FH diagnosis is 46 years. National FH screening programs could lead to earlier identification.

### Improving the detection of potential cases of familial hypercholesterolemia: Could machine learning be part of the solution [^115sgk17]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), while highly prevalent, is a significantly underdiagnosed monogenic disorder. Improved detection could reduce the large number of cardiovascular events attributable to poor case finding. We aimed to assess whether machine learning algorithms outperform clinical diagnostic criteria (signs, history, and biomarkers) and the recommended screening criteria in the United Kingdom in identifying individuals with FH-causing variants, presenting a scalable screening criterion for general populations.

- **Methods and results**: Analysis included UK Biobank participants with whole exome sequencing, classifying them as having FH when (likely) pathogenic variants were detected in their LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 genes. Data were stratified into three data sets for: (1) feature importance analysis; (2) deriving state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models; and (3) evaluating models' predictive performance against clinical diagnostic and screening criteria: Dutch Lipid Clinic Network, Simon Broome, Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death, and Familial Case Ascertainment Tool. One thousand and three of 454,710 participants were classified as having FH. A Stacking Ensemble model yielded the best predictive performance (sensitivity, 74.93%; precision, 0.61%; accuracy, 72.80%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 79.12%) and outperformed clinical diagnostic criteria and the recommended screening criteria in identifying FH variant carriers within the validation data set.

### Improving familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis using an EMR-based hybrid diagnostic model [^1152nXhS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) confers a greatly increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease but remains very underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary care populations. We assessed whether using a hybrid model consisting of two existing FH diagnostic criteria coupled with electronic medical record (EMR) data would accurately identify patients with FH in a Midwest US metropolitan healthcare system.

We conducted a retrospective, records-based, cross-sectional study using datasets from unique EMRs of living patients. Using Structured Query Language to identify components of two currently approved FH diagnostic criteria, we created a hybrid model to identify individuals with FH.

Of 264,264 records analyzed, between 794 and 1,571 patients were identified as having FH based on the hybrid diagnostic model, with a prevalence of 1:300 to 1:160. These patients had a higher prevalence of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) (38–58%) compared to the general population (1.8%) and higher than those having a high CAD risk but no FH (10%). Although most patients were receiving lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs), only 50% were receiving guideline-recommended high-intensity LLT.

Using the hybrid model, we identified FH with a higher clinical and genetic detection rate than using standard diagnostic criteria individually. Statin and other LLT use were suboptimal and below guideline recommendations. Because FH underdiagnosis and undertreatment are due partially to the challenges of implementing existing diagnostic criteria in a primary care setting, addressing these gaps is critical.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population: Guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease: Consensus statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^112kFwui]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Historically, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) was diagnosed clinically, and the phenotypically most severe cases were detected — those with severe LDL cholesterol elevations, premature and familial coronary heart disease (CHD), and tendon xanthomas. However, with an increased understanding of the genetic causes of this disease, direct detection of mutations in the LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, and LDLRAP genes is now available in many countries. Such progress has led to the understanding that some 10–40%, depending on referral criteria, of those with a clinical diagnosis will not have a detectable causal mutation; rather, they have a clinical diagnosis of FH but not a mutation diagnosis (Figure 6). There may therefore be other key genes implicated in this disease. Alternatively, these individuals may present a polygenic basis for their LDL cholesterol elevation without contributions from any of the classical FH genes.

- **Overlap of clinical and mutation diagnosis**: Figure 6 illustrates the fractions of three different clinical scenarios in a study from Spain. This study may not necessarily reflect the exact proportions for these three groups in other countries. 'Mutation without clinical diagnosis' means definite, probable, or possible familial hypercholesterolaemia with a familial hypercholesterolaemia-causing mutation but with less severely elevated LDL cholesterol (i.e. below the diagnostic threshold). LDL refers to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; FH is familial hypercholesterolaemia.

Conversely, genetic cascade testing from FH subjects…

### Genetic testing for a patient with suspected familial hypercholesterolaemia [^117Wz6Wk]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a genetic condition that results in elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, consequently increasing the risk for premature cardiovascular disease events. Although it is considered an autosomal-dominant genetic condition, the underlying genetic causes of FH can be complex. Currently, most guidelines rely on clinical criteria to diagnose FH; however, this approach has some pitfalls. We present a patient who was not formally diagnosed with FH using commonly accepted clinical criteria, but through genetic testing, was found to have a mutation for this disorder. This case highlights the challenges clinicians face in optimally diagnosing and managing such unusual cases. Through this case report, we aim to stimulate a debate among clinicians and other stakeholders regarding the need to develop more efficient methods for selecting patients for genetic testing in response to elevated LDL levels.

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^111jRqVp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

It is crucial to consider the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in children with LDL-C persistently above 160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L), in adults with LDL-C above 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L), especially if there is a family history of early-onset coronary artery disease (CAD), and in all patients with early CAD. Given that FH is an autosomal dominant disorder, an individual who is heterozygous for FH has a 50% chance of passing the gene to his or her children. Homozygous individuals, who have identical mutations in both alleles, compound heterozygotes, who inherited different mutations in both alleles of the same gene, or double heterozygotes, who have mutations in two different genes, will have offspring who are all obligate heterozygotes, assuming their partner does not have FH.

This review focuses on heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and aims to highlight the differences between FH, which is present from birth, and hyperlipidemia secondary to suboptimal diet and lifestyle or other causes of acquired hyperlipidemia that develop later in life. Diagnostic tools and potential treatments for individuals with FH will also be discussed.

### Efficacy of clinical diagnostic criteria for familial hypercholesterolemia genetic testing in Poland [^114o1ZzT]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which leads to premature cardiovascular events, remains underrecognized and undertreated in most countries. Untreated individuals aged 20–39 years are at a 100-fold higher risk of mortality from coronary heart disease compared to those of the general population. Therefore, special efforts should be implemented to diagnose FH patients at early stages of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the revised Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria proposed by the Polish Lipid Experts Forum to select index FH patients for DNA mutational analysis in Poland.

- **Methods**: The study included 193 unrelated adult patients (mean age 48 ± 13 years) with a clinical diagnosis of FH based on the revised DLCN score. These patients were tested sequentially for mutations in LDLR and APOB genes using bidirectional Sanger sequencing and MLPA techniques. The cut-off points of the clinical FH criteria score were assessed by ROC statistics to identify patients with the highest probability of carrying an FH-causing mutation.

- **Results**: The causal heterozygous LDLR or APOB mutation was identified in 41% (80/193) of probands. Adults aged < 40 years were more likely to carry an FH-causing mutation compared to subjects aged ≥ 40 years (65% vs. 33%; p < 0.001). LDL-C thresholds for the molecular diagnosis of FH were 5.79 mmol/l for individuals aged < 40 and 6.7 mmol/l for subjects ≥ 40 years old. The threshold values of the clinical diagnostic score for efficient selection of patients for genetic testing were 5 and 7 points for individuals aged < 40 and ≥ 40 years, respectively.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population: Guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease: Consensus statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^1148un7X]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) relies on five criteria: family history, clinical history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD), physical examination for xanthomas and corneal arcus, very high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol on repeated measurements, and/or a causative mutation detected by molecular genetics. Secondary causes of hyperlipidaemia must be excluded by determining that liver enzymes, renal function, and thyroid hormones are normal and that there is no hyperglycaemia or albuminuria.

In addition to drawing a family pedigree, a systematic physical examination for the presence of tendon and tuberous xanthomas and corneal arcus must be performed. Sonographic evaluation of the Achilles tendons increases the rate of xanthoma detection.

Although total cholesterol levels are typically ≥ 8 mmol/L (≥ 6 mmol/L in children), triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are generally unremarkable. The presence of hypertriglyceridaemia does not exclude the FH diagnosis; other reasons for hypertriglyceridaemia should, however, be evaluated and treated if necessary.

The Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria are recommended to establish the clinical diagnosis of FH. Among individuals with a definite or probable diagnosis of FH (DLCN > 5), and particularly those with an obvious clinical diagnosis with xanthoma and/or high cholesterol plus a family history of premature CHD, molecular genetic testing is strongly recommended. When a causative mutation is found in the index case, a genetic test should be offered to all first-degree relatives.

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^115gXjkW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by markedly elevated LDL-C levels from birth, leading to early-onset coronary artery disease (CAD). Early diagnosis is critical as it provides an opportunity to initiate potentially lifesaving and inexpensive generic pharmacotherapy during childhood. Despite multiple guidelines advocating for universal screening starting in childhood, it is estimated that only 10% of the 1.3 million Americans living with FH are aware of their condition, resulting in many cases being diagnosed in adulthood following a cardiac event.

FH is highly treatable with currently available lipid-lowering therapies, including statins, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, PCSK9 inhibitors, and, in more severe cases, lipoprotein apheresis. However, achieving significant reductions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) morbidity and mortality requires the early initiation of aggressive LDL-C-lowering treatments. Additional promising experimental lipid-lowering agents are in clinical development and may enhance treatment efficacy. Until these treatments are widely available, increasing awareness of FH among healthcare professionals and patients is essential for preventing early-onset ASCVD events and mortality.

### Estimated yield of screening for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with and without genetic testing in US adults [^111nWve9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder causing premature cardiovascular disease. Despite this, there is no national screening program in the United States to identify individuals with FH or likely pathogenic FH genetic variants.

Methods and results: The clinical characteristics and FH variant status of 49,738 UK Biobank participants were used to develop a regression model to predict the probability of having any FH variants. The regression model and modified Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria were applied to 39,790 adult participants (aged ≥ 20 years) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate the yield of FH screening programs using Dutch Lipid Clinic Network clinical criteria alone (excluding genetic variant status), genetic testing alone, or a combination of clinical criteria with genetic testing.

The regression model accurately predicted FH variant status in UK Biobank participants (observed prevalence, 0.27%; predicted, 0.26%; area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve, 0.88). In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the estimated yield per 1,000 individuals screened (95% CI) was 3.7 (3.0–4.6) FH cases with the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network clinical criteria alone, 3.8 (2.7–5.1) cases with genetic testing alone, and 6.6 (5.3–8.0) cases by combining clinical criteria with genetic testing.

In young adults aged 20 to 39 years, using clinical criteria alone was estimated to yield 1.3 (95% CI, 0.6–2.5) FH cases per 1,000 individuals screened, which was estimated to increase to 4.2 (95% CI).

### Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: New insights and guidance for clinicians to improve detection and clinical management. A position paper from the Consensus Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolaemia of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^112DPQ8K]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) is a rare, life-threatening condition characterized by markedly elevated circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and accelerated, premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD). Given recent insights into the heterogeneity of genetic defects and clinical phenotype of HoFH, as well as the availability of new therapeutic options, the Consensus Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolaemia of the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) critically reviewed available data to provide clinical guidance for the recognition and management of HoFH.

- **Methods and results**: Early diagnosis of HoFH and prompt initiation of diet and lipid-lowering therapy are critical. While genetic testing may provide a definitive diagnosis, if unavailable, markedly elevated LDL-C levels together with cutaneous or tendon xanthomas before 10 years, or untreated elevated LDL-C levels consistent with heterozygous FH in both parents, are suggestive of HoFH. We recommend that patients with suspected HoFH are promptly referred to specialist centers for a comprehensive ACVD evaluation and clinical management. Lifestyle intervention and maximal statin therapy are the mainstays of treatment, ideally started in the first year of life or at an initial diagnosis, often supplemented with ezetimibe and other lipid-modifying therapy. As patients rarely achieve LDL-C targets, adjunctive lipoprotein apheresis is recommended where available, preferably started by age 5 and no later than 8 years.

### Developing and optimizing innovative tools to address familial hypercholesterolemia underdiagnosis: Identification methods, patient activation, and cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolemia [^111CaVPt]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Implementation of evidence-based research into practice relies on passive diffusion, is inconsistent, and can take upwards of 17 years. This gap between evidence-based guidelines and their implementation into routine clinical practice is one of the most critical issues facing health care and public health today. Multiple barriers and facilitators to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) diagnosis and cascade testing have been identified and exist at the patient, provider, and health care system levels. These barriers include low levels of lipid screening of pediatric individuals, diagnostic criteria that are not optimized to facilitate FH identification in electronic health records (EHRs), suboptimal self-reported family history data, and proband concerns about having the appropriate communication skills to inform family members about their risks. This results in low FH identification and recruitment of at-risk relatives to cascade testing.

According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, addressing barriers and gaps in care related to the underdiagnosis of FH creates an opportunity to expand translational research agendas in genomics, precision medicine, and implementation science. To address these gaps, IMPACT-FH partners researchers with expertise in genetics, clinical lipidology, health communication, and implementation science with stakeholders from the FH Foundation. This includes individuals with FH, those with expertise in technology-based tools for FH identification, and health care providers dedicated to improving FH care. Through qualitative and implementation science methodologies, IMPACT-FH will use patient-engagement strategies to advance these efforts.

### Cardiovascular risk stratification in familial hypercholesterolaemia [^115h36Qx]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common autosomal-dominant disorder in most European countries. Patients with FH are characterized by raised levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a high risk of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Currently, there is no consensus regarding the clinical utility of predicting future coronary events or testing for the presence of subclinical atherosclerotic disease in asymptomatic patients with FH.

Family screening of patients with FH, as recommended by the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline, would result in identifying many young individuals with a diagnosis of FH who are clinically asymptomatic. The traditional CHD risk scores, such as the Framingham score, are insufficient for risk prediction in this group of young individuals. Additionally, a better understanding of the genetic etiology of the FH phenotype and CHD risk in monogenic FH and polygenic hypercholesterolaemia is needed.

Non-invasive imaging methods, such as carotid intima-media thickness measurement, might provide more reliable information in identifying high-risk patients with FH. The potential market authorization of novel therapeutic agents, such as PCSK9 monoclonal inhibitors, makes it essential to develop a better screening program to prioritize candidates for treatment with the most severe form of FH and those at higher risk of coronary events. The utility of new imaging techniques and new cardiovascular biomarkers remains to be determined in prospective trials.

### Universal screening for familial hypercholesterolemia in 2 populations [^116NvPcc]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In Europe, more than 2 million individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are currently undiagnosed. Effective screening strategies for FH diagnosis in childhood are urgently needed. We assessed the overall performances of two different FH screening programs in children: a universal screening program with opt-out and opt-in type participation.

We analyzed the data from two independent populations, based on more than 166,000 individuals screened for hypercholesterolemia. Genetic analyses of FH-related genes were conducted on 945 children and 99 parents. A total of 305 (32.3%) children were genotyped as positive or with a variant of uncertain significance in FH-related genes. For low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 3.5 mmol/L (135.3 mg/dL), the overall sensitivity and specificity for confirming FH were 90.5% and 55.3%, respectively. As part of the child-parent screening, in more than 90% of the families, the parent with reported higher cholesterol levels was positive for the familial genetic variant. The cohort-based prevalence of FH from the opt-out universal screening program was estimated to be 1 in 431 individuals (95% CI = 1/391–1/472).

The universal three-step FH screening approach in children enabled detection of most children and their parents in every generation screened at reasonable costs. The opt-out screening strategy might be preferable over the opt-in screening strategy.

### Clinical genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia: JACC scientific expert panel [^114byJ2i]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

Although awareness of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is increasing, this common, potentially fatal, and treatable condition remains underdiagnosed. Despite FH being a genetic disorder, genetic testing is rarely used. The Familial Hypercholesterolemia Foundation convened an international expert panel to assess the utility of FH genetic testing. The rationale includes the following:

- **Facilitation of definitive diagnosis**: Pathogenic variants indicate higher cardiovascular risk, which implies the potential need for more aggressive lipid lowering.
- **Increase in initiation of and adherence to therapy**: Cascade testing of at-risk relatives is also a consideration.

The Expert Consensus Panel recommends that FH genetic testing become the standard of care for patients with definite or probable FH, as well as for their at-risk relatives. Testing should include the genes encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9). Other genes may also need to be considered for analysis based on patient phenotype. Expected outcomes include greater diagnoses, more effective cascade testing, initiation of therapies at earlier ages, and more accurate risk stratification.

### Cascade testing in familial hypercholesterolaemia: how should family members be contacted [^113qZXhX]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Cascade testing or screening provides an important mechanism for identifying people at risk of a genetic condition. For some autosomal dominant conditions, such as familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), identifying relatives allows for significant health-affecting interventions to be administered, which can significantly extend a person's life expectancy. However, cascade screening is not without ethical implications. In this paper, we examine one ethically contentious aspect of cascade screening programmes, namely the alternative methods by which relatives of a proband can be contacted.

Should the proband be invited to contact his or her family members, or should the screening programme contact family members directly? We argue that direct contact is an ethically justifiable method of contact tracing in cascade screening for FH. Not only has this method already been utilised without adverse effects, but an examination of the ethical arguments against it shows these are unsubstantiated. We describe several criteria that, if met, will allow an appropriate balance to be struck between maximising the efficiency of family tracing and respecting the interests of probands and their relatives.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population: Guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease: Consensus statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^111Y6gye]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Probands (index cases) should be identified according to the following criteria: plasma total cholesterol ≥ 8 mmol/L (≥ 310 mg/dL) in an adult or adult family member(s) (or > 95th percentile by age and gender for country), premature coronary heart disease (CHD) in the subject or family member(s), tendon xanthomas in the subject or family member(s), and sudden premature cardiac death in a family member.

For child probands, criteria #(ii)–(iv) are identical to those of adults, but criterion #(i) should be a plasma total cholesterol ≥ 6 mmol/L (≥ 230 mg/dL) in a child or child family member(s) (or > 95th percentile by age and gender for country). The highest likelihood of detecting familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is in those with very high LDL cholesterol levels, tendon xanthomas, and/or premature CHD in a family member.

Drawing a family pedigree is essential to evaluate the likelihood of FH. In cases of probable or definite FH, cascade screening using LDL cholesterol measurement in the family should be conducted, and the subject referred for genetic testing if available, with subsequent cascade testing in the family if a causative mutation is found. Initial family members to be tested are biological first-degree relatives, namely parents, siblings, and children. Biological second-degree relatives including grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and half-siblings should also be considered. 'Premature CHD' signifies CHD before age 55 in male first-degree relatives and before age 60 in female first-degree relatives. For second-degree relatives, the corresponding ages apply.

### Metabolic systems approaches update molecular insights of clinical phenotypes and cardiovascular risk in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^115vFFnh]. BMC Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia was established by means of the diagnostic criteria of the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) and the HoFH International Clinical Collaborators (HICC) registry, enrolling only patients with a DLCN score ≥ 6. The main criteria included untreated LDL-C ≥ 4.7 mmol/L, either xanthomas or corneal arcus, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or premature ASCVD in first-degree relatives, and genetically confirmed FH. All HoFH subjects in this study were genetically confirmed to have two mutant alleles at the genes encoding LDLR, APOB, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), or LDLR adaptor protein 1.

Genotyping was obtained from patients if it had been performed or tested according to our previously reported methods. Genetically diagnostic HoFH individuals can be either true homozygotes, compound heterozygotes, or double heterozygotes. LDLR functionality was annotated as previously described and categorized as either null (< 2%) or defective (2% to 25%). LDLR status was classified as at least one null mutation (null/null or null/defective) or not (defective/defective). Non-FH was defined as subjects with lower levels of untreated LDL-C than 4.7 mmol/L.

Blood samples for sample collection and clinical laboratory lipid profiles were collected from the antecubital vein of patients who met the requirements of an overnight fasting state of 10–12 hours. Serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 minutes and then stored at − 80 °C until analysis. The serum levels of LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Lp(a), and APOB were analyzed.

### Yield of familial hypercholesterolemia genetic and phenotypic diagnoses after electronic health record and genomic data screening [^1162KgBH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is underdiagnosed worldwide, despite the high known risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the known ability to prevent adverse outcomes with lipid-lowering treatment. To improve the identification of those likely to have an FH diagnosis, many studies have used strategies based on clinical characteristics (e.g. low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] levels, premature heart attacks) or more complex machine learning algorithms (e.g. flag, identify, network, deliver [FIND] FH) to search electronic health records (EHRs) to find at-risk individuals. However, other than studies in the UK Biobank, these efforts have not generally been performed in cohorts with both phenotypic EHR data and genomic information on the entire cohort, including those with and without FH.

The purpose of this study was to apply two recognized EHR screening algorithms (Mayo Clinic and FIND FH) to the Geisinger MyCode Community Health Initiative (MyCode) data set. The study aimed to determine the yields for (1) a genetic diagnosis of FH based on the presence of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant identified via genomic screening, or (2) by phenotypic criteria, using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) score. Additional analyses examined the clinical characteristics of those identified by each algorithm, the relationship of variants of unknown significance on study covariates, and the relationship of the gene involved (e.g. LDLR or APOB) to results.
