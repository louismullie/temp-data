## Question

Rabies post exposure prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why PEP is time-critical. Then, I should verify exposure categories and risk assessment. Next, I will review core PEP components and dosing, including RIG and vaccine schedules. After that, I need to check special populations and deviations from schedule. Finally, I will consider cost, access, and alternatives like monoclonal antibodies, and synthesize a practical decision framework with key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and urgency. Rabies is nearly 100% fatal once symptomatic, but PEP is uniformly effective when administered correctly and promptly, so delays in wound care, RIG, or vaccine can be catastrophic; PEP is a medical urgency, not an emergency, but decisions should not be delayed, and incubation can extend beyond a year in rare cases, which underscores the need for timely action even after delayed presentations [^111UMYVa] [^112svAq7] [^116qy8aN].

> I need to check exposure categories next. WHO and ACIP define Category I as touching or feeding animals with intact skin, Category II as nibbling, minor scratches, or abrasions without bleeding, and Category III as single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches, contamination of mucous membranes with saliva, or exposures to bats; these categories guide RIG use and the number of vaccine doses, so I should confirm the category before deciding on RIG [^112h2A7P] [^117XAeDF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about RIG for everyone. For previously unvaccinated persons with Category II exposures, vaccine alone is sufficient; for Category III exposures, RIG plus vaccine is indicated, and RIG should be infiltrated locally into wounds when anatomically feasible with any remainder given IM at a site distant from vaccine; RIG is not repeated and is omitted in previously vaccinated individuals, so I should double-check prior vaccination status before ordering RIG [^117XAeDF] [^116QjUNq] [^114NTGDs].

> Next, I should review the vaccine regimen. For immunocompetent, previously unvaccinated patients, the standard is 4 IM doses of HDCV or PCECV (1.0 mL) on days 0, 3, 7, and 14; if immunocompromised, a 5-dose regimen with a day 28 dose is recommended, and I need to ensure the deltoid is used in adults and older children, avoiding the gluteal site; if the schedule is delayed, minor deviations can be corrected by resuming where left off, but substantial delays warrant serologic testing 7–14 days after completion [^114srid8] [^113TZdRa] [^111Girs7].

> Wait, let me verify the WHO intradermal alternative because it changes logistics. The 2-visit ID regimen uses 4-site ID injections on day 0 and 2-site ID on day 7, with an optional day 28 dose for immunocompromised patients; observational data show protective titers by day 7 and no added benefit from a fourth visit, supporting feasibility and cost savings, though I should confirm local training and vial-sharing logistics before adopting ID protocols [^1167ksaM] [^112r71Ca] [^116DzycN].

> I should confirm special populations and deviations. Pregnancy is not a contraindication to PEP, and the same regimen applies; children receive the same vaccine and RIG doses by weight; for immunocompromised hosts, use the 5-dose schedule and consider serology 1–2 weeks after completion to verify response; if RIG is delayed beyond day 7, it is generally not recommended, but if exposure is high risk and RIG is obtained within 7 days of starting vaccine, it can still be added, so I need to balance risk and timing carefully [^115wHEZw] [^111b5aCH] [^1115fJcz] [^1112A2En].

> Let me consider pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) because it changes PEP. Previously vaccinated persons (PrEP or prior PEP) should receive only 2 IM vaccine doses on days 0 and 3 without RIG; recent ACIP updates allow a 2-dose PrEP series (days 0 and 7) for travelers, with titer checks or a booster if risk persists beyond 3 years, which can simplify future exposures and reduce RIG needs in endemic settings [^114NTGDs] [^111r3JSp] [^113AebxQ].

> I will now examine cost and access, since these drive real-world outcomes. In many LMICs, patients pay out-of-pocket for PEP, averaging over $100 per case, which is unaffordable for many; modeling shows that expanding free access to WHO-recommended intradermal regimens could avert 489,000 additional deaths from 2020–2035 at roughly $635 per death averted and $33 per DALY averted, with minimal increase in vial demand due to dose-sparing ID use; Gavi investment and standardized procurement can mitigate stockouts and improve equity [^117K6LeT] [^112s5eJ1] [^117XAeDF].

> But wait, what if RIG is unavailable or in short supply. Monoclonal antibody cocktails are emerging alternatives to RIG; a phase 4 randomized trial in India showed that RmAb plus vaccine was safe and immunogenic with no rabies cases during 1-year follow-up, and observational studies report good tolerability; while not yet universally available, RmAb addresses supply and safety concerns with equine or human RIG and aligns with WHO's interest in alternatives where RIG is scarce [^114TMUCJ] [^11183iHr] [^117XAeDF].

> Next, I should review why PEP fails when it does, to avoid preventable errors. Breakthrough infections are rare and usually reflect deviations: inadequate wound care, delayed initiation, improper RIG administration, missed or truncated vaccine courses, or immunosuppression; severe head/neck bites have shorter incubation and can outpace immunity, so meticulous technique and adherence are critical, and I should double-check each element at the bedside [^111Giubu] [^111GsLw7].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. First, confirm exposure category and prior vaccination. Second, cleanse wounds thoroughly with soap and water for at least 15 minutes and irrigate with a virucidal agent if available. Third, give RIG for Category III or if there is uncertainty and the patient is unvaccinated, infiltrating locally when feasible. Fourth, start the vaccine series immediately and schedule remaining doses. Fifth, adapt the regimen for immunocompromise or prior vaccination. Sixth, address cost and access barriers when they threaten completion. And seventh, document the product, schedule, and site of administration for continuity and public health tracking [^113CyorF] [^114srid8] [^117XAeDF].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check that I'm not overstating this: PEP is nearly 100% effective when given correctly and on time, but effectiveness hinges on immediate wound care, appropriate RIG use, and complete vaccination; in resource-limited settings, switching to WHO-endorsed intradermal regimens and addressing financing can massively expand access and save lives without increasing vaccine demand, and emerging monoclonal antibodies may further transform RIG-restricted contexts [^111UMYVa] [^117K6LeT] [^114TMUCJ].

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a **time-sensitive, life-saving regimen** that prevents rabies after exposure to a potentially rabid animal. It consists of **immediate wound cleansing**, **rabies vaccine**, and **rabies immunoglobulin (RIG)** for high-risk exposures [^116QjUNq]. PEP is **highly effective when given promptly** [^111UMYVa] but is often delayed or inaccessible in low-resource settings, contributing to ongoing deaths [^1168i2ES]. WHO-endorsed intradermal regimens reduce cost and visits, improving access and adherence [^1167ksaM] [^112h2A7P].

---

## Indications for rabies PEP

PEP is indicated based on the **category of exposure** and the animal involved:

| **Category** | **Type of exposure** | **Examples** | **Pep required?** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Category I | Touching or feeding animals; no break in skin | Petting a dog, feeding a cat | No |
| Category II | Minor scratches or abrasions without bleeding; licks on broken skin | Superficial scratch from a cat, lick on a cut | Yes (vaccine only) |
| Category III | Single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches; contamination of mucous membranes with saliva | Deep bite from a dog, bat bite, saliva in eyes or mouth | Yes (vaccine + RIG) |

---

## Components of rabies PEP

Rabies PEP comprises three essential components:

---

### 1. Wound cleansing

Immediate and thorough cleansing of all wounds with soap and water for at least 15 minutes is critical [^113CyorF]; if available, a virucidal agent such as povidone-iodine should be used to irrigate the wounds [^113CyorF]. This step alone significantly reduces the risk of rabies transmission [^111b5aCH].

---

### 2. Rabies vaccine

- **Previously unvaccinated individuals**: A 4-dose intramuscular regimen (days 0, 3, 7, 14) using human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV) is recommended [^111pwWbg] [^114srid8]. Immunocompromised patients require a fifth dose on day 28 [^113TZdRa].
- **Previously vaccinated individuals**: Two doses on days 0 and 3, without RIG [^114NTGDs] [^114srid8].
- **Intradermal regimens**: WHO-endorsed 2-visit intradermal regimens (e.g. 2–1–1) are cost-effective and immunogenic, particularly useful in resource-limited settings [^1167ksaM] [^112h2A7P].

---

### 3. Rabies immunoglobulin (RIG)

RIG is indicated for Category III exposures or high-risk Category II exposures in previously unvaccinated individuals [^116QjUNq]. The recommended dose is **20 IU/kg** for human RIG or **40 IU/kg** for equine RIG, infiltrated around the wound site; any remaining volume should be administered intramuscularly at a site distant from the vaccine [^116QjUNq] [^115VbK26]. RIG should be given as early as possible, ideally at the first visit, but can be administered up to day 7 after the first vaccine dose if delayed [^1112A2En].

---

## Timing and effectiveness

PEP should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure; however, it is effective even if started days or weeks after exposure, as the incubation period can be prolonged [^1112A2En]. Delays in seeking care or incomplete adherence to the regimen significantly reduce effectiveness and increase the risk of rabies [^111Giubu].

---

## Barriers to effective PEP implementation

Despite its effectiveness, several barriers limit access to and completion of PEP:

- **Cost**: High out-of-pocket expenses for vaccines and RIG, particularly in low-resource settings [^117K6LeT].
- **Access**: Limited availability of vaccines and RIG, especially in rural areas [^1124KyqS].
- **Awareness**: Lack of public awareness and healthcare provider knowledge about rabies risk and PEP protocols [^112t3coq].
- **Adherence**: Multiple clinic visits required by traditional regimens reduce adherence [^1167ksaM].

---

## Recent advancements and WHO recommendations

Recent WHO guidelines emphasize **simplified, cost-effective regimens** to improve access and adherence:

- **Intradermal regimens**: Reduced dose and visits, maintaining immunogenicity and effectiveness [^1167ksaM] [^114QVVg5].
- **Monoclonal antibodies**: Emerging alternatives to RIG, offering consistent potency and improved safety profiles [^114TMUCJ] [^11183iHr].
- **Integrated bite case management (IBCM)**: Combining animal observation, risk assessment, and targeted PEP administration to optimize resource use [^117K6LeT].

---

## Conclusion

Rabies PEP is a **highly effective intervention** that prevents rabies when administered promptly and correctly. Addressing barriers such as cost, access, and adherence — particularly through WHO-endorsed intradermal regimens and integrated bite case management — is essential to reduce the global burden of rabies deaths [^1168i2ES].

### The potential effect of improved provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study [^1168i2ES]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Background

Tens of thousands of people die from dog-mediated rabies annually. Deaths can be prevented through post-exposure prophylaxis for people who have been bitten, and the disease eliminated through dog vaccination. Current post-exposure prophylaxis use saves many lives, but availability remains poor in many rabies-endemic countries due to high costs, poor access, and supply.

Methods

We developed epidemiological and economic models to investigate the effect of an investment in post-exposure prophylaxis by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. We modelled post-exposure prophylaxis use according to the status quo, with improved access using WHO-recommended intradermal vaccination, with and without rabies immunoglobulin, and with and without dog vaccination. We took the health provider perspective, including only direct costs.

Findings

We predict more than 1 million deaths will occur in the 67 rabies-endemic countries considered from 2020 to 2035, under the status quo. Current post-exposure prophylaxis use prevents approximately 56000 deaths annually. Expanded access to, and free provision of, post-exposure prophylaxis would prevent an additional 489000 deaths between 2020 and 2035. Under this switch to efficient intradermal post-exposure prophylaxis regimens, total projected vaccine needs remain similar (about 73 million vials) yet 17.4 million more people are vaccinated, making this an extremely cost-effective method, with costs of US$635 per death averted and $33 per disability-adjusted life-years averted. Scaling up dog vaccination programmes could eliminate dog-mediated rabies over this time period; improved post-exposure prophylaxis access remains cost-effective under this scenario, especially in combination with patient risk assessments to reduce unnecessary post-exposure prophylaxis use.

Interpretation

Investing in post-exposure vaccines would be an extremely cost-effective intervention that could substantially reduce disease burden and catalyse dog vaccination efforts to eliminate dog-mediated rabies.

### Vaccinating children in high-endemic rabies regions: what are we waiting for? [^116TcTDr]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) vaccination is life-saving, if given as soon as possible after exposure. It requires several vaccination sessions and the availability of immediately acting but costly immunoglobulins (RIG). However, if individuals bitten by a rabid animal are 'primed' with PrEP, they only need as PEP a single-visit intradermal booster vaccination of 0.1 mL at four anatomical sites (figure 1: 1 4 ID, schedule 2. A). Two clinical trials showed that even lower doses (single-site 0.1 mL or two-sites 2×0.1 mL) during a single-visit booster session can activate memory cells and trigger the immune cascade in primed individualsand induce an accelerated immune response compared with those who receive PEP alone. Additionally, primed individuals do not require RIG, which is complex to administer and mostly unavailable in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). In short, PEP without PrEP is slower-acting, time-sensitive and time-consuming, while PrEP increases the likelihood of survival in bitten individuals, particularly in case of so-called 'category 3 exposure' (eg, transdermal bites/scratches) when RIG is unavailable. Some authors even argued that PrEP might provide sufficient protection, if exposure goes unrecognised, or when PEP is delayed, incomplete or unavailable.

Traditionally, PrEP required three vaccinations spread over 1 month. Since 2018, the WHO recommends a simplified two-visit schedule, with two intradermal microinjections of 0.1 mL in each arm, on days 0 and 7 (figure 1: 2²ID). This schedule shows a robust immune response with a good safety profile in all age groups and the potential of high adherence. The (2018) WHO guidelines also recommend a simplified PEP (without PrEP) schedule with six intradermal microinjections of 0.1 mL at days 0, 3 and 7 (figure 1: 3²ID, schedule 1. A) instead of the current four to five visits over 21–28 days in combination with RIG. However, these conventional PEP schedules are still the first recommended strategy in LMICs where PrEP does not exist.

### The potential effect of improved provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study [^1124KyqS]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Timely post-exposure prophylaxis prevents the fatal onset of rabies, which causes an estimated 60 000 human deaths each year, mostly in Africa and Asia and among children. Domestic dogs are responsible for 99% of human cases. Although mass dog vaccination is required for elimination of dog-mediated rabies, the disease burden could be substantially reduced through improved access to post-exposure prophylaxis.

WHO recommendations for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis have been updated in line with new evidence. Procedures depend on the type of contact with the suspect rabid animal, with administration of rabies immunoglobulin recommended for high-risk exposures. Intradermal multisite vaccination regimens have been developed, which are more economical than intramuscular administration because they use reduced vaccine volumes. While the use of post-exposure prophylaxis at current levels saves many lives, access to post-exposure prophylaxis is poor in many parts of the world, particularly rural areas where most rabies exposures occur. Even if people who have been bitten get to a treatment centre and post-exposure prophylaxis is available, its cost is often unaffordable.

### The potential effect of improved provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study [^112TWSnM]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Increasing timely access to rabies vaccines for post-exposure prophylaxis, free at point-of-care, would save many lives, is highly cost-effective, and is feasible under the current vaccine production capacity, with the switch to the dose-sparing abridged 1-week intradermal regimen. In combination with scaled-up mass dog vaccination, an investment to improve access to post-exposure prophylaxis could be transformative for rabies prevention and could catalyse the global campaign Zero by 30 to eliminate human deaths from dog-mediated rabies.

Enhancing access to rabies post-exposure prophylaxis was considered by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in their vaccine investment strategy in 2008 and 2013. In 2013, post-exposure prophylaxis was estimated to avert almost 200 000 future deaths between 2015 and 2030 at a low cost per death averted, and that investment could stimulate the shift to more economical intradermal vaccination. However, knowledge gaps were recognised and observational studies were recommended to reduce uncertainties about implementation feasibility. Subsequently, Gavi supported field studies on rabies burden, treatment seeking, post-exposure prophylaxis compliance, and vaccine efficacy as part of their learning agenda. Gavi will reconsider the rabies vaccine investment case in December, 2018.

We model the epidemiological and economic effect of changes in policy and practice for the provision of post-exposure prophylaxis, which Gavi investment could support.

### WHO's new rabies recommendations: implications for high incidence countries [^112h2A7P]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Rabies is virtually always fatal; however, it is nearly 100% preventable with timely and appropriate prophylactic immunization. This review summarizes the recently revised WHO guidelines for rabies prophylaxis published in 2018, following a scientific review by a strategic advisory group of experts on immunization. The scientific basis for the major changes and its implications for countries with high disease burden are also discussed.

Recent Findings

The key changes in the updated WHO 2018 guidelines for rabies prophylaxis include abbreviated vaccination regimens for pre and postexposure prophylaxis. These cost and dose-sparing regimens allow equitable sharing of vaccines, necessitate fewer clinic visits and thus can enhance patient compliance. The recommendations on rabies immunoglobulin administration permit prioritization and optimal use of this life-saving biologic, especially in areas with scarcity. However, there is a need for additional evidence to support the abridgment of some regimens and need for data on the safety and immunogenicity of these regimens in special groups such as infants and the immunocompromised.

Summary

National health authorities in high incidence countries need to develop consensus for effective implementation of simplified, cost-effective, and logistically feasible regimens for rabies prophylaxis, on the basis of the revised WHO guidelines.

### Revised 4-dose vaccine schedule as part of postexposure prophylaxis to prevent human rabies [^115fUumX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

There is overwhelming evidence that the 4-dose vaccine schedule as part of postexposure prophylaxis to prevent human rabies for previously unvaccinated persons, as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States in 2009, is safe and effective. When used appropriately with timely wound care and administration of human rabies immune globulin, the administration of 4 doses of vaccine on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 is likely to induce an adequate, long-lasting antibody response that is able to neutralize rabies virus and prevent disease in exposed patients. There has been no change in the recommended regimen for pre-exposure prophylaxis and for postexposure prophylaxis of previously vaccinated persons or for immunosuppressed patients.

### Risk of rabies and implications for postexposure prophylaxis administration in the US [^113DgRrM]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

In the US, rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is often administered without a comprehensive and regionally appropriate rabies risk assessment. For low-risk exposures, this can result in patients incurring out-of-pocket expenses or experiencing adverse effects of PEP unnecessarily.

Objective

To use a model to estimate (1) the probability that an animal would test positive for rabies virus (RABV) given that a person was exposed, and (2) the probability that a person would die from rabies given that they were exposed to a suspect rabid animal and did not receive PEP, and to propose a risk threshold for recommending PEP according to model estimates and a survey.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this decision analytical modeling study, positivity rates were calculated using more than 900 000 animal samples tested for RABV between 2011 and 2020. Other parameters were estimated from a subset of the surveillance data and the literature. Probabilities were estimated using Bayes' rule. A survey was administered among a convenience sample of state public health officials in all US states (excluding Hawaii) plus Washington, DC and Puerto Rico to determine a risk threshold for PEP recommendation. Respondents were asked whether they would recommend PEP given 24 standardized exposure scenarios while accounting for local rabies epidemiology.

Main Outcomes and Measures

A quantitative and regionally appropriate approach for helping health care practitioners and public health professionals determine whether to recommend and/or administer rabies PEP.

Results

A total of 1728 unique observations were obtained from the model for the probability that an animal would test positive for RABV given that a person was exposed, and 41 472 for) the probability that a person would die from rabies given that they were exposed to a suspect rabid animal and did not receive PEP. The median probability that an animal would test positive for RABV given that a person was exposed ranged from 3×10–7 to 0.97, while the probability that a person would die from rabies given that they were exposed to a suspect rabid animal and did not receive PEP ranged from 1×10–10 to 0.55. Fifty public health officials out of a target sample size of 102 responded to the survey. Using logistic regression, a risk threshold was estimated for PEP recommendation of 0.0004; PEP may not be recommended for exposures with probabilities below this threshold.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this modeling study of rabies in the US, the risk of death|exposure was quantified and a risk threshold was estimated. These results could be used to inform the decision-making process as to the appropriateness of recommending rabies PEP.

### Safety and tolerability of a novel monoclonal antibody cocktail for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis [^11183iHr]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

Future research should focus on large-scale, multi-center trials to further establish safety and efficacy across diverse populations and geographic regions. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to assess the duration of protection provided by this novel treatment. Studies optimizing post-exposure prophylaxis protocols, particularly regarding the intradermal vaccination regimen recommended by WHO, are warranted. Research modeling PEP requirements based on variables such as the population of free-roaming dogs and the incidence of dog bites in specific areas would provide valuable insights for public health planning. Additionally, investigations into the use of this mAb cocktail in special populations, such as pregnant women or immunocompromised individuals, are necessary to ensure comprehensive safety profiles.

This study offers strong evidence supporting the safety and tolerability of a new monoclonal antibody cocktail for rabies post-exposure treatment. Among 159 participants, we observed mostly mild to moderate local side effects and found that the treatment was well-tolerated across all age groups. Importantly, there were no serious adverse reactions or systemic issues, and all side effects resolved without lasting problems. This suggests that the cocktail could be a safe alternative to traditional rabies immunoglobulins. Its high potency, requiring smaller doses, is a key advancement, particularly for cases involving multiple bites or sensitive areas. While we didn't directly measure efficacy, the absence of rabies cases during follow-up indirectly is an encouraging observational finding. Moving forward, incorporating this monoclonal antibody cocktail into standard treatment protocols could make rabies prevention more accessible, affordable, and easier to administer. This aligns with the World Health Organization's goal to eliminate dog-mediated human rabies deaths by 2030. However, more research — especially larger studies with long-term follow-up — is needed to fully confirm its safety, efficacy, and broader impact across various populations and regions.

### The potential effect of improved provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study [^113BQown]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

A global framework to reach zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 was developed by WHO and partners in 2015. A strategic plan covering human and animal vaccine demand was developed for the implementation of this framework. In 2016, WHO established a Strategic Advisory Group of Experts Working Group on rabies vaccines and rabies immunoglobulins, aiming to increase the public health effect of rabies biologics through practical and feasible recommendations. This effort resulted in a recommendation of a dose-sparing abridged 1-week intradermal regimen, requiring only three clinic visits, and guidance for more prudent use of rabies immunoglobulin.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed for papers published from Jan 1, 1980, to May 31, 2018, with the terms "rabies" AND "burden" AND ("global" OR "Africa" OR "Asia") and identified two previous modelling studies that suggested around 60 000 deaths from rabies occur each year. Post-exposure prophylaxis after a suspected rabies exposure is a safe and effective way of preventing human deaths from rabies and has long been promoted by WHO. However, human deaths from rabies remain high in many low-income and middle-income countries because access to post-exposure prophylaxis is poor. Although mass dog vaccination is required for elimination of dog-mediated rabies, improved provision and use of post-exposure prophylaxis would also prevent deaths. Dose-sparing intradermal vaccine regimens are known to be much more economical than intramuscular regimens but have not been adopted everywhere.

Added value of this study

This is the first paper to consider the effect of an investment in rabies post-exposure prophylaxis across all 67 countries that are, or have previously been, Gavi-eligible and where rabies is endemic. Although data are still scarce in many areas, we used information from studies supported by the Gavi learning agenda. Improving provision of rabies vaccines for post-exposure prophylaxis is a highly cost-effective intervention that could prevent an additional 489 000 deaths from rabies from 2020 to 2035. Our analyses suggest that investments should prioritise vaccines for post-exposure prophylaxis rather than rabies immunoglobulin, which is costly and has more marginal health benefits. Even with expanding dog vaccination efforts and associated reductions in the risk of human exposure over the 2020–35 time period, improved access to post-exposure prophylaxis remains a highly cost-effective intervention.

### Human rabies prevention – United States, 2008: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^114wnFwb]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis — rationale: Pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis is administered for several reasons, including simplifying management after an exposure by eliminating the need for RIG and decreasing the number of vaccine doses needed, which is particularly important for persons at high risk in areas where modern products might not be available or where crude, less safe biologics might be used. Pre-exposure prophylaxis might offer partial immunity if postexposure prophylaxis is delayed and might provide some protection to persons at risk for unrecognized exposures.

### Human rabies prevention – United States, 2008: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^115jGsmq]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) — rationale and decision framework emphasizes that ACIP and WHO "recommend that prophylaxis for the prevention of rabies in humans exposed to rabies virus should include prompt and thorough wound cleansing followed by passive vaccination with HRIG and vaccination with cell culture rabies vaccines", and that "Administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis is a medical urgency, not a medical emergency". A "risk assessment weighing potential adverse consequences associated with administering postexposure prophylaxis along with their severity and likelihood versus the actual risk for the person acquiring rabies should be conducted in each situation involving a possible rabies exposure", and recommendations are "dependent upon associated risks including 1) type of exposure, 2) epidemiology of animal rabies in the area where the contact occurred and species of animal involved, and 3) circumstances of the exposure incident". "The decision of whether to initiate rabies postexposure prophylaxis also depends on the availability of the exposing animal for observation or rabies testing (Table 3)". For nonroutine situations, "Clinicians should seek assistance from local or state public health officials for evaluating exposures or determining the need for postexposure management", and "State and local officials have access to CDC rabies experts for particularly rare situations or difficult decisions".

### Safety and tolerability of a novel monoclonal antibody cocktail for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis [^117XAeDF]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

Recognizing the severity of the global rabies situation, the WHO set an ambitious goal in 2015 to achieve zero human rabies deaths by 2030, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 –. However, despite the availability of effective vaccines for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), access to these medical interventions remains limited in many regions, particularly where rabies is endemic. The global burden of rabies extends far beyond mortality, with estimated costs exceeding $8.6 billion annually, encompassing lost lives, medical expenses, and profound psychological trauma. The financial strain of PEP, averaging $108 per case, presents a significant barrier for individuals in affected communities, many of whom subsist on as little as $1 to $2 per day.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a critical intervention that must be initiated immediately following a suspected rabies exposure to prevent the virus from causing infection. According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, PEP involves several key steps depending on the severity of the wound. First, thorough washing of the wound with soap and water for at least 15 minutes is essential to remove the virus from the site of exposure. This is followed by the application of virucidal agents to further reduce the viral load. In Category II exposures, which involve minor scratches or abrasions without bleeding, a full course of rabies vaccination is recommended. For more severe Category III exposures, such as deep bites or scratches, vaccination is combined with the local infiltration of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) or monoclonal antibodies (RmAb) directly into the wound to neutralize the virus. This step is crucial as it provides immediate passive immunity while the rabies vaccine triggers the body's immune response. However, concerns regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and variability of RIG preparations, whether derived from human (HRIG) or equine (ERIG) sources, have prompted research into alternative solutions. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which offer consistent potency and a lower risk of adverse reactions, are emerging as a promising alternative for rabies PEP.

### Rabies postexposure prophylaxis: what the U.S. emergency medicine provider needs to know [^112t3coq]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Approximately 55,000 patients per year in the United States are exposed to potentially rabid animals and receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and these patients commonly present to the emergency department (ED) for wound care and PEP. Despite the number of rabies exposures seen in EDs each year, there appears to be a knowledge gap among health care providers with regard to prescribing and administering rabies PEP. The following review aims to bridge that knowledge gap by discussing the importance of obtaining a comprehensive exposure history to determine the category of the encounter, the type of animal, and the location of the bite and of consulting outside expert resources to determine whether the rabies PEP series is indicated. In addition, this article will discuss dosing, administration, and schedule of the rabies vaccine and human rabies immune globulin to ensure patients are fully protected from developing rabies. Lastly, this article discusses the potential cost associated with rabies PEP and provides information on managing this barrier.

Introduction

Rabies is one of the world's deadliest diseases, with a fatality rate near 100%. It is endemic in most countries, including the US, where main reservoirs are wildlife species. Rabies virus (RABV) is transmitted to humans via direct contact with the saliva, brain, or nervous system tissue of an infected animal. The virus enters the body through broken skin or mucous membranes. Rabies can be prevented by avoiding animal bites and through timely administration of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) following exposure to a suspect rabid animal.

Most physicians in the US will never treat a human rabies case. However, animal bites from pets and wildlife are a common cause of injury, resulting in hundreds of thousands of primary care and emergency department visits each year and requiring physicians to routinely make decisions about whether to administer PEP. Rabies PEP for immune competent and previously unvaccinated persons consists of 4 doses of rabies vaccine and 1 dose of immune globulin administered over a 2-week period.PEP prevents the disease in nearly every case if given before the onset of symptoms. An estimated 55 000 (range 45 453–66 000) people in the US received treatment for potential RABV exposures each year from 2017 to 2018, at an estimated cost of more than $3800 per person treated.

Rabies PEP guidelines are published by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. In addition, most public health jurisdictions have their own guidelines for rabies risk assessments and testing suspect rabid animals, which typically consist of a static flowchart posted on the agency website. Both retrospective and prospective studies in the US have found that guidelines for when to administer PEP are often not followed. Common reasons for inappropriate PEP administration include (1) the animal tested negative for RABV,(2) the patient had no known animal contact, and (3) the bite was low risk for rabies. In this study, we focus on issues related to the third reason.

Providing PEP when it is not warranted is costly for patients, health systems, and public health departments. Additionally, rabies vaccine has been associated with rare adverse events, including injection site reactions, systemic hypersensitivity reactions, and neurological complications. There have also been supply chain disruptions of rabies biologics in the US, particularly in the mid-2000s, due to unexpected decreases in supply. For these reasons, rabies PEP should be used judiciously and only after a risk assessment has been conducted by a health care professional.

### The potential effect of improved provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study [^117BqWJW]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

An investment in rabies vaccine in Gavi-eligible countries is likely to save many lives at a very low cost per death averted. Improving access to post-exposure prophylaxis alongside a switch to the newly-recommended intradermal 1-week regimen is feasible because vaccine vial requirements do not increase. Moreover, shifting costs from bite victims to donors and governments overcomes the primary barrier limiting access to life-saving vaccines and enables more efficient dose-sparing practices. To reduce an indefinite and escalating requirement for post-exposure prophylaxis, mass dog vaccination is essential to control and eliminate rabies in the reservoir population.

Rabies postexposure prophylaxis for previously vaccinated persons — definition, regimen, and what to avoid: Previously vaccinated persons are those who received recommended pre‑exposure or postexposure regimens of HDCV, PCECV, or RVA or another vaccine with a documented neutralizing antibody titer; these persons should receive 2 intramuscular doses (1.0 mL each in the deltoid), one immediately and one 3 days later, and administration of rabies immune globulin (RIG) is unnecessary and should not be administered. Determining neutralizing antibody titers to guide prophylaxis is inappropriate for at least three reasons, including that several days are required to obtain results and that no "protective" titer is known.

### Human rabies prevention – United States, 2008: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^111UMYVa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies — burden, urgency, effectiveness, and safety are described as follows: Approximately 16,000–39,000 persons come in contact with potentially rabid animals and receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis each year. Administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis is a medical urgency, not a medical emergency, but decisions must not be delayed. Studies indicated that postexposure prophylaxis combining wound treatment, local infiltration of rabies immune globulin (RIG), and vaccination is uniformly effective when appropriately administered, though rabies has occasionally developed among humans when key elements were omitted or incorrectly administered. Prophylaxis is occasionally complicated by adverse reactions, but these reactions are rarely severe, and practical and accurate health education, domestic animal vaccination and responsible pet care, modern stray animal control, and prompt diagnosis can minimize unnecessary animal exposures and prevent many circumstances that result in the need for rabies prophylaxis.

### Human rabies prevention – United States, 2008: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^116QjUNq]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Rabies postexposure prophylaxis — vaccination and human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) use are specified as follows: Postexposure antirabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine, with the exception of persons who have ever previously received complete vaccination regimens or those with a documented rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer, who should receive only vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and nonbite exposures for persons who have never been previously vaccinated for rabies, and if appropriate laboratory diagnostic testing indicates the exposing animal was not rabid, postexposure prophylaxis can be discontinued. HRIG is administered only once at the beginning of antirabies prophylaxis to previously unvaccinated persons; if not given when vaccination was begun (i.e., day 0), it can be administered up to and including day 7, after which HRIG is not indicated. Because HRIG can partially suppress active antibody production, the dose administered should not exceed the recommended dose, which is 20 IU/kg (0.133 mL/kg) body weight for all age groups, including children. If anatomically feasible, the full dose of HRIG should be infiltrated in and around wounds, with any remaining volume injected intramuscular (IM) at a site distant from vaccine administration; HRIG should never be administered in the same syringe or in the same anatomical site as the first vaccine dose, and subsequent doses of vaccine in the 5-dose series can be administered at the same anatomical location where the HRIG dose was administered if that is the preferable site.

Discussion

The burden of dog-mediated rabies is considerable; from 2020 to 2035 under the status quo, we estimate over 1 million deaths will occur in the 67 countries considered. Although post-exposure prophylaxis saves many lives, improved access, free of cost at point-of-care, and following the latest WHO recommendations for intradermal vaccination, would avert 1 388 000 deaths (ie, an additional 489 000 deaths) and 68 010 000 DALYs over this time period. This improvement in access is highly cost-effective at only $635 per death averted and $33 per DALYs averted and is feasible under current vaccine production with a switch to economical intradermal regimens through a Gavi investment. Interventions that avert one DALY for less than the national average annual per-capita income are considered highly cost-effective.

Improving access to rabies immunoglobulin (mostly unavailable in rabies-endemic countries), in addition to vaccines, was not cost-effective. Benefits of rabies immunoglobulin were shown when used with nerve tissue vaccines, but this benefit is likely to be much less with the highly immunogenic purified cell culture and embryonated egg-based rabies vaccines recommended nowadays. Reported deaths among patients who initiate post-exposure prophylaxis appear to be related to treatment delays and poor compliance, rather than a lack of rabies immunoglobulin availability. Investments to improve timely vaccine access are therefore likely to save many more lives than investment in rabies immunoglobulin.

WHO and partners launched the global strategic plan to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies (Zero by 30) to eliminate human deaths from dog-mediated rabies through both mass dog vaccination and improved access to post-exposure prophylaxis. Cost-effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis decreases as elimination of canine rabies approaches, because genuine exposures become increasingly rare, whereas precautionary post-exposure prophylaxis provision continues. Nonetheless, our models suggest that in this context, improved access to post-exposure prophylaxis remains cost-effective (with a cost per DALYs averted less than gross domestic product per capita), particularly if implemented in conjunction with IBCM. Operational research on IBCM is warranted since it is a compelling strategy to curtail post-exposure prophylaxis demand while enhancing surveillance during the endgame.

Scenarios

We investigated the following scenarios (assumptions detailed in the panel): (1) status quo, with countries delivering post-exposure prophylaxis according to current provision rates and practices; (2) increased post-exposure prophylaxis access, with free vaccination following the dose-sparing abridged 1-week intradermal regimenand improved health seeking, vaccine provision, and post-exposure prophylaxis completion, considering a base case (2a), low variant (2b), and high variant (2c); (3) as 2, with provision of rabies immunoglobulin, as per the latest recommendations;(4) declining incidence due to scaling up mass dog vaccination (currently negligible in most Gavi-eligible countries), with post-exposure prophylaxis provided according to the status quo (4a), with improved post-exposure prophylaxis access (4b with base case parameter values), and as with the previous point, with integrated bite case management (IBCM) to reduce unnecessary post-exposure prophylaxis for people bitten by healthy animals (4c).

Panel
Parameters and assumptions for modelling scenarios

We used biologically-defined constants for the probability of developing rabies following exposure, p infect, and of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) preventing rabies, p prevent (appendix). Under the status quo (scenario 1) we used country-specific data from health facility use and Gavi Learning Agenda studies to inform parameters for health seeking and PEP provision (appendix gives country-specific estimates and gives cluster averages used when no country-specific data were available). In scenarios with improved PEP access (scenarios 2 and 3), we modelled increased health seeking, PEP provision, and compliance, as detailed here, according to timelines from the Global Strategic Plan (appendix). Dog vaccination is modelled in scenario 4, with Integrated Bite Case Management (IBCM) to reduce unnecessary PEP use for persons bitten by healthy dogs included in scenario 4c.

### Use of a modified preexposure prophylaxis vaccination schedule to prevent human rabies: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^111r3JSp]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Human rabies is an acute, progressive encephalomyelitis that is nearly always fatal once symptoms begin. Several measures have been implemented to prevent human rabies in the United States, including vaccination of targeted domesticated and wild animals, avoidance of behaviors that might precipitate an exposure (e.g., provoking high-risk animals), awareness of the types of animal contact that require postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and use of proper personal protective equipment when handling animals or laboratory specimens. PEP is widely available in the United States and highly effective if administered after an exposure occurs. A small subset of persons has a higher level of risk for being exposed to rabies virus than does the general U.S. population; these persons are recommended to receive preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a series of human rabies vaccine doses administered before an exposure occurs, in addition to PEP after an exposure. PrEP does not eliminate the need for PEP; however, it does simplify the rabies PEP schedule (i.e., eliminates the need for rabies immunoglobulin and decreases the number of vaccine doses required for PEP). As rabies epidemiology has evolved and vaccine safety and efficacy have improved, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations to prevent human rabies have changed. During September 2019-November 2021, the ACIP Rabies Work Group considered updates to the 2008 ACIP recommendations by evaluating newly published data, reviewing frequently asked questions, and identifying barriers to adherence to previous ACIP rabies vaccination recommendations. Topics were presented and discussed during six ACIP meetings. The following modifications to PrEP are summarized in this report: 1) redefined risk categories; 2) fewer vaccine doses in the primary vaccination schedule; 3) flexible options for ensuring long-term protection, or immunogenicity; 4) less frequent or no antibody titer checks for some risk groups; 5) a new minimum rabies antibody titer (0.5 international units [IUs]) per mL); and 6) clinical guidance, including for ensuring effective vaccination of certain special populations.

### Human rabies prevention – United States, 2008: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^116yjm7Y]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Low credibility.

These recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) update the previous recommendations on human rabies prevention (CDC. Human rabies prevention — United States, 1999: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. MMWR 1999;48 [No. RR-1]) and reflect the status of rabies and antirabies biologics in the United States. This statement 1) provides updated information on human and animal rabies epidemiology; 2) summarizes the evidence regarding the effectiveness/efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of rabies biologics; 3) presents new information on the cost-effectiveness of rabies postexposure prophylaxis; 4) presents recommendations for rabies postexposure and pre-exposure prophylaxis; and 5) presents information regarding treatment considerations for human rabies patients. These recommendations involve no substantial changes to the recommended approach for rabies postexposure or pre-exposure prophylaxis. ACIP recommends that prophylaxis for the prevention of rabies in humans exposed to rabies virus should include prompt and thorough wound cleansing followed by passive rabies immunization with human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and vaccination with a cell culture rabies vaccine. For persons who have never been vaccinated against rabies, postexposure antirabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody (HRIG) and vaccine (human diploid cell vaccine [HDCV] or purified chick embryo cell vaccine [PCECV]). Persons who have ever previously received complete vaccination regimens (pre-exposure or postexposure) with a cell culture vaccine or persons who have been vaccinated with other types of vaccines and have previously had a documented rabies virus neutralizing antibody titer should receive only 2 doses of vaccine: one on day 0 (as soon as the exposure is recognized and administration of vaccine can be arranged) and the second on day 3. HRIG is administered only once (i.e., at the beginning of antirabies prophylaxis) to previously unvaccinated persons to provide immediate, passive, rabies virus neutralizing antibody coverage until the patient responds to HDCV or PCECV by actively producing antibodies. A regimen of 5 1-mL doses of HDCV or PCECV should be administered intramuscularly to previously unvaccinated persons. The first dose of the 5-dose course should be administered as soon as possible after exposure (day 0). Additional doses should then be administered on days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after the first vaccination. Rabies pre-exposure vaccination should include three 1.0-mL injections of HDCV or PCECV administered intramuscularly (one injection per day on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28). Modifications were made to the language of the guidelines to clarify the recommendations and better specify the situations in which rabies post- and pre-exposure prophylaxis should be administered. No new rabies biologics are presented, and no changes were made to the vaccination schedules. However, rabies vaccine adsorbed (RVA, Bioport Corporation) is no longer available for rabies postexposure or pre-exposure prophylaxis, and intradermal pre-exposure prophylaxis is no longer recommended because it is not available in the United States.

### Postexposure prophylaxis for common infectious diseases [^113bW8z8]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is effective in preventing illness after potential or documented exposure to a variety of microbial pathogens and in reducing the risk of secondary spread of infection. Guidelines have been published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for proper use of PEP for bloodborne pathogens, for microorganisms transmitted by either airborne or droplet spread or through direct contact, and for infections acquired after traumatic injuries. Depending on the type of exposure, different forms of PEP are available, including vaccines, immune globulins, antibiotics, and antiviral medications. Physicians should assess a patient's potential need for PEP based on several factors, including the type of exposure, the timing and severity of illness in the source patient, the exposed person's susceptibility to infectious diseases of concern, and the relative risks and benefits of the PEP regimen in an individual situation. Immunity to certain infectious diseases can be ensured with prior infection or vaccination, and by serologic testing in patients with a negative or uncertain history. PEP should be given to persons exposed to index cases of pertussis and invasive meningococcal infection regardless of immunization history, and should be given following rabies and tetanus exposure regardless of the length of delay. In general, PEP should be given as soon as possible following a high-risk exposure. Persons exposed to bloodborne pathogens should have baseline testing for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus antibodies, and follow-up testing at six weeks, three months, and six months postexposure.

### Use of a reduced (4-dose) vaccine schedule for postexposure prophylaxis to prevent human rabies: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^111pwWbg]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Low credibility.

This report summarizes new recommendation and updates previous recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent human rabies (CDC. Human rabies prevention---United States, 2008: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. MMWR 2008;57[No. RR-3]). Previously, ACIP recommended a 5-dose rabies vaccination regimen with human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV). These new recommendations reduce the number of vaccine doses to four. The reduction in doses recommended for PEP was based in part on evidence from rabies virus pathogenesis data, experimental animal work, clinical studies, and epidemiologic surveillance. These studies indicated that 4 vaccine doses in combination with rabies immune globulin (RIG) elicited adequate immune responses and that a fifth dose of vaccine did not contribute to more favorable outcomes. For persons previously unvaccinated with rabies vaccine, the reduced regimen of 4 1-mL doses of HDCV or PCECV should be administered intramuscularly. The first dose of the 4-dose course should be administered as soon as possible after exposure (day 0). Additional doses then should be administered on days 3, 7, and 14 after the first vaccination. ACIP recommendations for the use of RIG remain unchanged. For persons who previously received a complete vaccination series (pre- or postexposure prophylaxis) with a cell-culture vaccine or who previously had a documented adequate rabies virus-neutralizing antibody titer following vaccination with noncell-culture vaccine, the recommendation for a 2-dose PEP vaccination series has not changed. Similarly, the number of doses recommended for persons with altered immunocompetence has not changed; for such persons, PEP should continue to comprise a 5-dose vaccination regimen with 1 dose of RIG. Recommendations for pre-exposure prophylaxis also remain unchanged, with 3 doses of vaccine administered on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28. Prompt rabies PEP combining wound care, infiltration of RIG into and around the wound, and multiple doses of rabies cell-culture vaccine continue to be highly effective in preventing human rabies.

### Does a pharmacist-driven protocol increase appropriate prescribing of rabies postexposure prophylaxis? [^113fye4e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Human rabies can be prevented through postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Although the case fatality rate is high, there are only one to three human cases per year in the United States. Despite the low incidence, the cost of rabies diagnostics, prevention, and control is significant. Recommendations exist regarding which patients should receive PEP, though several studies demonstrate a high frequency of unnecessary prescribing of PEP.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to determine if an animal bite protocol improves compliance with state and national recommendations regarding treatment of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Potential cost savings will also be evaluated.

Methods

An institutional review board-approved, single-center, retrospective chart review was conducted from January 1, 2017 to March 18, 2018 to evaluate patients presenting to the ED with an animal bite prior to and after implementation of a protocol. The primary outcome was defined as the percentage of PEP offered as indicated by the protocol. Secondary outcomes included the appropriateness of not offering PEP and estimated cost savings after protocol implementation.

Results

PEP was indicated four times out of 29 offers pre-protocol and three times out of five offers post-protocol (p = 0.0476). There was no difference in the appropriateness of not offering PEP (pre-protocol 105/107 times vs. 29/29 times; p = 0.9998). Cost savings was associated with protocol implementation.

Conclusion

A pharmacist-driven protocol can beneficially influence prescribing habits after potential rabies exposure and is associated with cost savings.

TABLE
Rabies preexposure prophylaxis recommendations — United States, 2022

Abbreviations: IM = intramuscular; IU = international units; PEP = postexposure prophylaxis; PrEP = preexposure prophylaxis.

* Nature of exposure and type of work performed are the most important variables to consider when determining a person's risk category. The examples provided are intended to be a guide, but ultimately categorizations should be done on a case-by-case basis with nature of exposure considered. Some persons might be categorized into a different risk group from those suggested by the provided examples. For example, most veterinarians are in risk category 3 because they are at risk for recognized exposures after direct contact with animals. However, a veterinary pathologist who often performs necropsies on mammals suspected to have had rabies might have risk for rabies virus exposure that is more consistent with risk category 2 than risk category 3; such persons should follow the recommendations for the risk category with which their activities best fit. Similarly, most spelunkers do not often enter high-density bat caves; those who do may follow the recommendations for risk category 2 rather than risk category 3. Persons involved in the diagnosis of rabies virus, but for whom the frequency of handling rabies virus–infected tissues is low, or the procedures performed do not involve contact with neural tissue or opening of a suspected rabid animal's calvarium could consider following the recommendations for risk category 2 rather than those for risk category 1.

† Local or state health departments should be consulted for questions about local disease biogeography.

§ Primary immunogenicity refers to immunogenicity that peaks 2–4 weeks after completing the recommended primary vaccination schedule. Persons without altered immunity are expected to mount appropriate responses, and checking titers is not routinely recommended. Persons with altered immunity are advised to confirm, through laboratory testing, a rabies antibody titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL ≥ 1 week after booster vaccination (but ideally, 2–4 weeks after completing the recommended schedule) and before participating in high-risk activities. Individual laboratories set facility-specific rules about whether acceptable antibody titers should be laboratory-confirmed for all personnel, regardless of whether personnel have altered immunity.

¶ Long-term immunogenicity refers to the ability to mount an anamnestic response to rabies virus > 3 years after completion of the primary rabies vaccination series.

Our model is based on more than 900 000 rabies case investigations. It is also the first national tool, to our knowledge, to account for geographic differences in the rabies risk associated with animal exposures. If implemented correctly, this tool has the potential to prevent unnecessary expenditures and adverse events for individual patients and improve the overall efficiency of PEP delivery in the US.

### Human rabies despite post-exposure prophylaxis: a systematic review of fatal breakthrough infections after zoonotic exposures [^111Giubu]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies is widely administered and highly effective. Nevertheless, sporadic breakthrough infections (ie, rabies in people who have started PEP) have been reported. We conducted a systematic review of articles published between Jan 1, 1980 and June 1, 2022 to characterise breakthrough infections. After reviewing 3380 articles from across all continents, we identified 52 articles, which included a total of 122 breakthrough infections. We classified breakthrough infections on the basis of adherence to core practices (ie, wound cleaning and vaccine administration). Of 86 breakthrough infections with data, median time from exposure to symptom onset was 20 days (IQR 16–24). Most (89 [77%] of 115) participants received PEP within 2 days of an exposure. Severe wounds (defined as those involving multiple wound sites or bites to the head, face, or neck) were common (80 [69%] of 116 [with data]). Deviations from core practices were reported in 68 (56%) of 122 cases. Other possible causes for breakthrough infections included errors in the administration of rabies immunoglobulin, delays in seeking health care, and comorbidities or immunosuppression. Cold-chain integrity assessments and potency testing of PEP biologics were only rarely assessed (8 [7%] of 122 cases), neither of which were found to be a cause of breakthrough infections. Timely and appropriate administration of PEP is crucial to prevent rabies, and although people with high-risk exposures or immunosuppression can develop rabies despite adherence to core practices, this occurrence remains exceedingly rare.

### Rabies postexposure prophylaxis in routine practice in view of the new centers for disease control and prevention and World Health Organization recommendations [^114baAjp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

New recommendations for rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) were published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization in 2010. In view of these new recommendations, we investigated the adequacy of rabies PEP among patients consulting our travel clinic.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of the files of all patients who consulted for rabies PEP at the Travel Clinic of the University Hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, between January 2005 and August 2011 was conducted.

Results

A total of 110 patients who received rabies PEP were identified. The median age of the patients was 34 years (range, 2–79 years), and 53% were women. Ninety subjects were potentially exposed to rabies while travelling abroad. Shortcomings in the management of these patients were (1) late initiation of rabies PEP in travelers who waited to seek medical care until returning to Switzerland, (2) administration of human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) to only 7 of 50 travelers (14%) who sought care abroad and for whom HRIG was indicated, and (3) antibody levels < 0.5 IU/mL in 6 of 90 patients (6.7%) after 4 doses of vaccine.

Conclusions

Patients do not always receive optimal rabies PEP under real-life conditions. A significant proportion of patients did not develop adequate antibody levels after 4 doses of vaccine. These data indicate that the measurement of antibody levels on day 21 of the Essen PEP regimen is useful in order to verify an adequate immune response.

### The potential effect of improved provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study [^113aaTvA]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

We applied our simulated trajectories of rabies incidence under dog vaccination irrespective of country, assuming 1% rabies incidence in unvaccinated dog populations. Dog vaccination has repeatedly been shown to rapidly reduce incidence, although rabies often persists at low levels with incursions and localised wildlife reservoirs (not modelled here) hindering elimination. Moreover, socioeconomic factors influence progress by affecting the delivery of mass dog vaccination programmes. We assume coordinated implementation minimises incursions, thereby generating optimistic timelines for elimination. However, estimates of post-exposure prophylaxis requirements should not be greatly affected by this assumption given the considerable use of post-exposure prophylaxis for people bitten by non-rabid animals. While we considered the cost-effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis in the context of dog vaccination, we did not model dog vaccination costs; previous studies have shown dog vaccination to be very cost-effective.

In 2013, Gavi considered that rabies post-exposure vaccines could avert almost 200 000 future deaths between 2015 and 2030. We believe this outcome was an underestimate and our results suggest 489 000 additional deaths could be averted from an investment in improved post-exposure prophylaxis access. We have taken a more detailed approach using a decision tree informed by recent and relevant data, and we assume improvements in access, health seeking, and compliance.

Key barriers to rabies prevention are the limited supply and high costs of post-exposure prophylaxis, which are largely borne by patients. A Gavi investment in post-exposure prophylaxis should displace personal, but not government expenditure. Free post-exposure prophylaxis provision, with cofinancing between Gavi and national governments, would support the drive for universal health coverage to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and the consensus that rabies prevention should be a free public commodity. Gavi support would promote use of WHO prequalified vaccines and the 1-week intradermal regimen, standardise vaccine prices, and improve forecasting, procurement, and accountability. Stockouts, which are chronic in many rabies-endemic countries, could be prevented. Although post-exposure prophylaxis is outside the Expanded Programme on Immunization, efforts to strengthen this programme (particularly cold chain) greatly benefit post-exposure prophylaxis delivery. Thus, the potential of Gavi to shape the market, ensuring the availability or supply of WHO prequalified vaccines at affordable prices could be transformative for rabies prevention and would require a modest investment in the context of an annual budget in excess of $1 billion for vaccine programme disbursements.

### Post-exposure prophylaxis regimen of rabies monoclonal antibody and vaccine in category 3 potential exposure patients: a phase 4, open-label, randomised, active-controlled trial [^114TMUCJ]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Rabies is almost invariably fatal. A rabies monoclonal antibody (RmAb) was approved in India in 2016 for passive prophylaxis. This post-marketing study aimed to evaluate the long-term safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen containing RmAb.

Methods

This phase 4, open-label, randomised, active-controlled study was conducted at 15 tertiary care hospitals in India. Patients aged 2 years or older with WHO category 3 rabies exposure by a suspected rabid animal were eligible if the exposure occurred less than 72 h before enrolment, or less than 24 h before enrolment for exposures to the face, neck, hand, or fingers. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive either RmAb (Rabishield; Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) plus a purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV; Rabivax-S) or equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG; Equirab) plus PVRV as PEP. In each treatment group, patients were further randomly assigned (1:1) to receive PVRV either intradermally or intramuscularly. Study group allocation was done using a permuted block design with random block sizes of eight. A central randomisation list was generated before the study start and randomisation was performed with an interactive web response system. Participants and site personnel were not masked to group assignment. RmAb (3.33 IU/kg) and ERIG (40 IU/kg) were infiltrated into and around the wounds only on day 0 as per WHO 2018 recommendations. PVRV was administered 1.0 mL intramuscularly (days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28) or 0.1 mL plus 0.1 mL intradermally (days 0, 3, 7, and 28). The primary outcome was treatment-related serious adverse events up to 365 days after immunisation, analysed in the safety analysis set (all participants who received at least one dose of vaccine with treatment). Geometric mean concentrations of rabies virus neutralising antibody were measured in a subset of patients. This study is registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI/2019/06/019622) and is completed.

Findings

4059 participants were enrolled between Aug 21, 2019, and March 31, 2022, and randomly assigned. A total of 3994 participants (3001 male, 993 female) were treated (2996 RmAb plus PVRV, 998 ERIG plus PVRV), of which 3622 (90.7%) participants completed the 1-year follow-up. 11 adverse events were considered causally related to RmAb plus PVRV and 17 were considered causally related to the ERIG plus PVRV regimen. Most adverse events were mild and transient. Seven serious adverse events occurred in the RmAb group and all were causally unrelated. One causally related serious adverse event was reported in the ERIG group. On day 14, the geometric mean concentrations increased to 16.05 IU/mL (95% CI 13.25–19.44) in the RmAb group and 13.48 IU/mL (9.51–19.11) in the ERIG group (point estimate 1.19 [95% CI 0.82–1.72]). No patient developed rabies during the 1-year follow-up period.

Interpretation

RmAb was safe and well tolerated and showed protective efficacy against rabies. A PEP regimen containing RmAb plus PVRV was immunogenic with long-term persistence of immune response.

### Human rabies prevention – United States, 2008: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^1173e8n6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Rabies pre-exposure vaccination — candidate groups and general population guidance: Pre-exposure vaccination should be offered to persons in high-risk groups (e.g., veterinarians, animal handlers, rabies researchers, certain laboratory workers) and should be considered for persons with frequent contact with rabies virus or potentially rabid wildlife or domestic animals; some international travelers may be candidates when animal rabies is enzootic and access to vaccine and immune globulin might be limited, while routine pre-exposure prophylaxis for the general U.S. population or routine travelers to areas where rabies is not enzootic is not recommended.

### A 1-week intradermal dose-sparing regimen for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (RESIST-2): an observational cohort study [^1167ksaM]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Background

The international health authorities are backing an effort to eliminate canine-mediated rabies in humans by 2030. This effort will require improving access to adequate and timely rabies post-exposure prophylaxis as compliance is low with WHO-recommended regimens (given in four to five visits over 1 month). Access could be substantially improved by an abridged regimen to reduce doses, direct and indirect costs, and improve vaccine equity by better sharing of available vaccine. We aimed to compare rabies virus neutralising antibody titres before and after the fourth visit to determine whether that session was needed or the current regimen could be abridged.

Methods

In this observational cohort study, we measured rabies virus neutralising antibody titres using rapid fluorescent focus inhibition tests in 116 people bitten by dogs with laboratory-confirmed rabies and 20 control individuals. Percentages of circulating plasmablasts were determined by flow cytometry. All individuals had been referred to the rabies prevention clinic at Institut Pasteur in Cambodia and received two intradermal injections of post-exposure prophylaxis on days 0, 3, 7, and 28 (Thai Red Cross regimen) with or without equine rabies immunoglobulin, as per 2010 WHO recommendations.

Findings

All individuals had rabies virus neutralising antibody titres considered protective (≥ 0.5 IU/mL) and plasmablast activation on day 28 before the last injection. The median rabies virus neutralising antibody concentration in the group of individuals bitten by rabies virus-positive dogs was 1.08 IU/mL (IQR 0.37–3.09) on day 7, 26.86 (22.68–49.50) on day 28, and 26.74 (11.78–49.06) on day 42. No significant differences were observed in titres between days 28 and 42, after titres reached a plateau. These titres were reached notwithstanding equine rabies immunoglobulin use, age, sex, nutrition status as indicated by upper-arm circumference in children or BMI in adults, or dog infection status. Titres or plasmablast percentages did not increase between the day of the last injection and 2 weeks later. All patients were alive 1 year after post-exposure prophylaxis.

Interpretation

The fourth vaccine session on day 28 provides no additional benefit. Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis can be abridged to a two-dose, three-session, 1 week regimen to improve post-exposure prophylaxis coverage and equity at no risk to patients.

### Seroconversion after three doses of intramuscular rabies vaccine as a post-exposure treatment [^111dTTAi]. Virus Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Rabies is still threatening half of the world's population with the global burden of canine rabies being estimated as 59,000 human deaths, annually. With no cure existing for clinical rabies, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the only certain means to save lives of the exposed people. In Iran, bite incidences exceed 180,000 per year, where all victims receive 5 vaccine doses for PEP, conforming to the Essen regimen. More than two-thirds of the exposed individuals stop receiving treatments after day 7, for the reason of being exposed to a non-rabid dog or cat. According to the national standard protocols, these individuals should re-start a complete 5-dose PEP course upon the re-exposure. New WHO recommendations based on scientific data is encouraging revisions to the existing prophylaxis programs. In order to know if an incomplete Essen regimen can provide adequate immunity, in the present study, 5 groups of individuals who had only received 3 first doses of the Essen regimen within the previous 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months were examined for immunity against rabies. Our results indicated sufficient anti-rabies neutralizing antibody in all individuals, before and after receiving two standard booster doses (i.e. days 0 and 3). This might also suggest the adequacy of the 3 first doses of vaccination, as a one-week long post-exposure vaccination program.

### Bats in the bedroom, bats in the belfry: reanalysis of the rationale for rabies postexposure prophylaxis [^116cUL7L]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We assessed the scientific basis and practical implications of recommendations made since the late 1990s to offer rabies postexposure prophylaxis (RPEP) for occult bat encounters, including recommendations to offer RPEP to persons with bedroom exposure to a bat while sleeping without evidence of direct physical contact.

Methods

The number needed to treat after bedroom exposure to a bat was calculated as the percentage of population exposed multiplied by the inverse of crude rabies incidence. Bedroom exposure was estimated in a population survey of 14,453 households. Incidence was based on reported human cases in Canada and the United States, 1990–2007.

Results

In the population surveyed, bedroom bat exposure while sleeping and without known physical contact occurred at an annual rate of 0.099%. We estimate that < 5% of eligible persons with bedroom exposure receive RPEP as recommended. The incidence of human rabies due to bedroom bat exposure without recognized contact was 1 case per 2.7 billion person-years. The number needed to treat to prevent a single case of human rabies in that context ranges from 314,000 to 2.7 million persons. A total of 293–2500 health care professionals working full-time for a full year would be required to prevent a single human case of bat rabies due to bedroom exposure without recognized contact. Amounts of Can $228 million to Can $2.0 billion are additionally required for associated material costs.

Conclusions

Human rabies acquired through bedroom exposure to a bat while sleeping and without recognized contact is rare. Conversely, such exposures are not uncommon in the population, and the resources required for associated RPEP are orders of magnitude higher than those required for most interventions that are considered to be reasonable. Current RPEP recommendations related to occult bat contact should be reconsidered.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 4 travel-associated infections and diseases [^114srid8]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) dosing by immunization status — For people not previously vaccinated, give rabies immune globulin (RIG) 20 IU/kg body weight as 1 dose on day 0 with local infiltration of the bite and the remainder IM at a separate site, and administer vaccine (HDCV or PCEC) 1.0 mL IM for 4 doses on days 0, 3, 7, 14 (and 28 if immunocompromised). For previously vaccinated people, give vaccine (HDCV or PCEC) 1.0 mL IM for 2 doses on days 0 and 3, and RIG is not recommended. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 4 post-exposure vaccine doses unless the patient is immunocompromised, in which case a fifth dose is given at day 28, and "previously vaccinated" is defined as prior HDCV or PCEC pre-exposure immunization or prior PEP, or prior vaccination with another rabies vaccine with documented positive rabies virus–neutralizing antibody response.

### The potential effect of improved provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study [^112s5eJ1]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

With improved post-exposure prophylaxis access (scenario 2; base case) projected annual deaths and DALYs more than halved from 2020 to 2035 (table), equating to a total of 1 388 000 deaths averted or 68 010 000 DALYs averted over this period. Bite victims initiating post-exposure prophylaxis from 2020 to 2035 increase from 27.8 million under the status quo to 45.2 million (figure 3) with improved post-exposure prophylaxis access. Switching to the dose-sparing abridged 1-week intradermal regimen means that overall vaccine demand does not change very much (stays around 73 million vials at a [undiscounted] cost of about $11.1 billion). Annual costs with improved access (scenario 2; base case) would be $69.2 million in Gavi-67 or $29.3 million in Gavi-46 countries (appendix). Under the status quo, costs of post-exposure prophylaxis are mainly borne by patients (48 of 67 countries). From 2020 to 2035, assuming Gavi investment displaces personal but not government expenditure (appendix), $975.1 million (undiscounted costs) would be required to deliver improved access in all Gavi-67 countries and $403.7 million to Gavi-46 countries.

### Human rabies prevention – United States, 2008: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^115MhKBr]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Post-vaccination serologic testing — In CDC studies, all healthy persons tested 2–4 weeks after completion of pre-exposure and postexposure rabies prophylaxis demonstrated an adequate antibody response; therefore, no testing after completion is necessary to document seroconversion unless the person is immunosuppressed. Immunosuppressed persons should postpone pre-exposure vaccinations and consider avoiding indicated-risk activities; if avoidance is not possible, they should be vaccinated and have virus neutralizing antibody titers checked, and failure to seroconvert after the third dose should be managed in consultation with appropriate public health officials. When titers are obtained, specimens collected 1–2 weeks after prophylaxis should completely neutralize challenge virus at a 1:5 serum dilution by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT); antibody titers might decline over time, and tests not approved by FDA are not appropriate substitutes for RFFIT in suspect human rabies antemortem testing.

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and vaccine scheduling — clinician and traveler guidance includes acceptable alternative vaccines, documentation, and adherence to recognized schedules. Commercially available purified Vero cell rabies vaccine is an acceptable alternative, if available, but other rabies vaccines or PEP regimens could require additional prophylaxis or confirmation of adequate rabies virus-neutralizing antibody titers. Encourage travelers to take photos of the rabies PEP products they receive and to be conscious of the vaccine storage conditions and corresponding administration schedule, because this information is necessary for healthcare professionals to determine whether additional vaccines or titers are indicated. Healthcare professionals are justifiably concerned about getting everything right when trying to prevent a disease that is virtually 100% fatal, yet modern-day cell culture rabies vaccines are highly immunogenic and post-exposure rabies vaccine schedules have been developed to provide the quickest onset of endogenous antibodies. Make every effort to adhere to a recognized ACIP or WHO schedule; variations of days to weeks are unlikely to diminish the immune response to vaccination but could delay the onset of protection, and numerous schedules and routes of administration have been recognized by international health authorities and have been shown to be highly effective at preventing rabies.

### The potential effect of improved provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study [^114fWLV9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Given inadequate rabies surveillance, studies of human rabies deaths rely upon model-derived estimates. We use an economic model of post-exposure prophylaxis demand linked to an epidemiological model characterising rabies dynamics in domestic dog populations (the primary reservoir).

We included countries that are currently (n = 46), or have ever been, Gavi-eligible (n = 67) and are endemic for rabies (appendix), henceforth denoted as Gavi-46 and Gavi-67. We did all analyses using R version 3.4.1. We used GATHERand CHEERSchecklists to improve reporting quality (appendix).

Economic model

We adopted the static decision tree (characterised in figure 1; appendix), informed by literature-derived parameter estimates and available data.

Figure 1
Decision tree covering rabies exposure, health seeking, and health outcomes, including death due to rabies or prevention through PEP

PEP provided to individuals bitten by healthy animals results in costs but does not avert deaths. For the full decision tree, see appendix. PEP = post-exposure prophylaxis.

We took the perspective of the health provider and considered direct medical costs only. Currently, individuals bear post-exposure prophylaxis costs in many countries (appendix); with investment, post-exposure prophylaxis costs would be borne by Gavi with cofinancing from national governments. Health benefits were measured in terms of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted; rabies is universally fatal and we did not consider acute disability so DALYs are equal to years of life lost. Individuals in the model were aged 0–99 years. The time horizon was 2020–35 and our analysis accounts for human population growth over this timescale. We converted all costs to US$, 2016, using inflation indicators from the World Bank. All scenarios were run with discounting at 3% (0% as alternative). We calculated the cost per death and per DALYs averted and, as appropriate, incremental costs and benefits.

Epidemiological model

Human rabies exposures depend on dog rabies incidence and rabid dog biting behaviour. We used a stochastic dynamic transmission model to characterise rabies in dog populations accounting for the effect of mass dog vaccination. Coverage achieved wanes between vaccination campaigns because of turnover in the dog population, so we incorporate dog demography. We ignore wildlife, which have a negligible role in maintenance of canine rabies. We model an endemic scenario with and without mass dog vaccination to generate typical dog rabies incidence and trajectories to elimination (appendix).

Rabies postexposure prophylaxis schedule — United States, 2008 — For persons not previously vaccinated, all postexposure prophylaxis should begin with immediate thorough cleansing of all wounds with soap and water; if available, a virucidal agent such as povidone-iodine solution should be used to irrigate the wounds. Administer 20 IU/kg body weight of rabies immune globulin (RIG); if anatomically feasible, the full dose should be infiltrated around the wound(s) and any remaining volume should be administered intramuscularly (IM) at an anatomical site distant from vaccine administration, and RIG should not be administered in the same syringe as vaccine; because RIG might partially suppress active production of antibody, no more than the recommended dose should be given. Vaccine for unvaccinated persons is human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV) 1.0 mL, IM (deltoid area), one each on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. For previously vaccinated persons, wound cleansing is again specified; RIG should not be administered, and HDCV or PCECV 1.0 mL, IM (deltoid area), is given one each on days 0 and 3. These regimens are applicable for all age groups, including children, the deltoid area is the only acceptable site of vaccination for adults and older children (for younger children, the outer aspect of the thigh can be used), vaccine should never be administered in the gluteal area, and day 0 is the day the first dose of vaccine is administered.

### Serologic response of 2 versus 3 doses and intradermal versus intramuscular administration of a licensed rabies vaccine for preexposure prophylaxis [^116Q8zWX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization recommends intradermal (ID) administration of rabies vaccine for preexposure prophylaxis.

Methods

In a randomized trial in adults assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups (ID vs intramuscular [IM], 2 vs 3 doses, and controls), rabies neutralizing antibody titers were measured to 1 year postvaccination.

Results

ID vaccination produced acceptable antibody levels in all subjects (2- and 3-dose groups). At day 365, acceptable levels were 40% for IM and 50% for ID 2-dose schedule, and 70% for IM and 60% for ID 3-dose schedule.

Conclusions

ID rabies vaccination induces acceptable antibody titers at a fraction of the dose.

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) administration and management — Begin all PEP with immediate, thorough cleansing of all wounds. Equine rabies immune globulin is dosed at 40 IU/kg. Use a series of 4 injections of rabies vaccine over 14 days, with immunocompromised patients receiving 5 doses over a 1-month period. After cleaning the wound, inject as much of the dose-appropriate volume of RIG as is anatomically feasible at wound sites and avoid administering RIG into the same anatomical site as the vaccine because the 2 products neutralize each other. If substantial schedule deviations occur, assess immune status by serologic testing 7–14 days after the final dose. Once initiated, rabies PEP should not be interrupted or discontinued because of local or mild systemic reactions; if an adverse event occurs with one vaccine type, consider switching to the alternative cell culture vaccine, and antihistamines or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications taken before vaccination can help reduce mild adverse reactions in people with a history of such reactions.

### Noninferiority study of purified vero rabies vaccine-serum free in 3-dose and 2-dose preexposure prophylaxis regimens in comparison with licensed rabies vaccines [^111AVFeD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Rabies virus is present across most regions worldwide, although the associated burden is almost entirely in tropical countries of Asia and Africa. Most cases of rabies are the result of dog bites. Rabies is almost always fatal, and it is estimated that dog bite–related rabies causes 59 000 deaths worldwide each year.

Potential exposure to rabies necessitates immediate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), including vaccination. A preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) vaccination series is recommended for those at high risk of exposure to rabies because of factors such as their occupation and travel to regions where rabies is enzootic; in addition, PrEP should be considered for individuals living in areas where rabies is endemic and timely access to PEP limited. Although PrEP does not obviate the need for PEP following suspected rabies exposure, it allows the use of a simplified PEP regimen with fewer vaccine doses and without rabies immunoglobulin.

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) — contraindications and vaccine selection: Pregnancy is not a contraindication to receiving PEP. In infants and children, the dose of HDCV (human diploid cell vaccine) or PCECV (purified chick embryo cell vaccine) for PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) or PEP is the same as that recommended for adults, and the PEP RIG dose is based on body weight. Brain-derived vaccines can often be identified by a daily large-volume injection (5 mL) for approximately 14–21 days, and because of potency variability and risk for severe adverse reactions, advise travelers to decline these vaccines and to travel to a location where acceptable vaccines and RIG are available.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends reducing the number of doses from 5 to 4 of human diploid cell vaccine or purified chick embryo cell vaccine required for postexposure prophylaxis to prevent rabies in humans. The vaccine doses should be given on day 0 (first day of prophylaxis) and days 3, 7, and 14 after the first dose. For persons with immune suppression, the 5-dose regimen should continue to be used. Recommendations for the use of human rabies immunoglobulin remain unchanged. The American Academy of Pediatrics endorses these recommendations.

### Rabies: changing prophylaxis and new insights in pathophysiology [^111xUegf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite great progress in decoding disease mechanisms, rabies remains one of the leading causes of human death worldwide. Towards the elimination of human rabies deaths by 2030, feasible and affordable post (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) must be available with expansion to rural areas in rabies endemic countries. Vaccination and population control of dogs, principal reservoirs and transmitters, must be done in concert.

Recent Finding

Advances in the understanding of rabies neuropathogenesis and pathophysiology are reviewed, including recent experimental findings on host- and virus-specific mechanisms mediating neuronal survival and explaining clinical differences in furious and paralytic rabies. The forthcoming World Health Organization guide on rabies based on pathogenesis and immunization mechanisms data with support by clinical evidence provide new accelerated 1 week intradermal PrEP and PEP schedules. Rabies immunoglobulin injected into the wound only is endorsed at amounts not exceeding the dose interfering with active immunization. Potential therapeutics as designed in accord with rabies neuro-pathophysiology are plausible.

Summary

Clinical practice and rabies awareness can be leveraged by transboundary collaboration among different areas. Advancement in prophylaxis and perspectives on animal control offer a new path to conquer rabies by 2030.

### Preventative childhood vaccination to rabies [^112jEnGB]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rabies is prevented by post-exposure vaccination with several doses of vaccine given over 4–14 weeks. In case of severe exposure, the first dose of vaccine is combined with passive transfer of a rabies virus-specific immunoglobulin preparation. Preventative vaccination for rabies, also referred as pre-exposure vaccination, is reserved for humans at high risk. Although available vaccines are efficacious in preventing disease, rabies still claims the lives of an estimated 55,000 humans residing in Africa and Asia each year. Half of the death occurs in children under the age of 15.

Areas Covered

This paper discusses whether preventative vaccination of all children in Africa and Asia, which was deemed non-cost-effective compared to post-exposure vaccination using currently licensed vaccines in Thailand, could be cost-effective using more immunogenic novel vaccines.

Expert Opinion

At least in theory, novel one-dose rabies vaccines may be cost-effective for preventative childhood immunization, which in turn should reduce the incidence of this disease. Further clinical testing of such vaccines with the goal to develop a low-cost vaccine that can be incorporated into childhood immunization programs for areas with a high incidence of rabies-related death should be strongly encouraged.

Evidence for Updated Vaccine Schedule and Recommendations for Booster Doses and Titer Checks

Although there is no established correlate of protection for rabies, induction of a peak antibody response at or above the minimum acceptable antibody titer level (≥ 0.5 IU/mL) in response to rabies vaccine is an indirect measure of protection (i.e. immunogenicity). Primary immunogenicity refers to immunogenicity that peaks 2–4 weeks after completing the recommended vaccination or vaccinations and elicits an anamnestic response to rabies virus exposures. Since publication of the 2008 ACIP recommendations, scientists have been evaluating data concerning the efficacy of shorter rabies PrEP dosing regimens.

Subject matter experts performed a systematic review of scientific evidence published during 1965–2019 for a 2-dose primary vaccination series (doses administered on days 0 and 7) compared with the 3-dose series (doses administered on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28), which is indicated in the 2008 ACIP recommendations. Data showed that an anamnestic response after the 2-dose series occurs at 3 years; however, an anamnestic response > 3 years after the 2-dose series has not been evaluated. In the absence of data confirming an anamnestic response, the Work Group evaluated methods of inferring long-term immunogenicity (i.e. an anamnestic response > 3 years after the 2-dose primary vaccination series). Checking a titer or titers was considered one way of inferring long-term immunogenicity as described in the PrEP schedule and long-term immunogenicity section that follows. As an alternative to a titer check, a second systematic review was conducted to evaluate a booster dose after the 2-dose series compared with no booster dose. The Work Group used an adapted Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to determine the certainty of evidence for immunogenicity rated on a scale of 1 (high certainty) to 4 (very low certainty). Within the evidence to recommendations (EtR) framework, ACIP considered the importance of rabies as a public health problem; the benefits and harms (including GRADE-assessed evidence); the target populations' values and preferences; and issues of resource use, acceptability to stakeholders, feasibility of implementation, and anticipated impact on health equity.

Table 6 — Rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) guide for the United States, 2008 — risk categories, typical populations, and schedules are as follows: Continuous risk (e.g., rabies research laboratory workers and rabies biologics production workers) requires the primary course with serologic testing every 6 months and booster vaccination if antibody titer is below acceptable level. Frequent risk (e.g., rabies diagnostic laboratory workers, cavers, veterinarians and staff, and animal-control and wildlife workers in areas where rabies is enzootic; all persons who frequently handle bats) requires the primary course with serologic testing every 2 years and booster vaccination if antibody titer is below acceptable level. Infrequent risk (e.g., veterinarians and animal-control staff working with terrestrial animals in areas where rabies is uncommon to rare; veterinary students; travelers visiting areas where rabies is enzootic and immediate access to appropriate medical care including biologics is limited) requires the primary course with no serologic testing or booster vaccination. Rare risk (U.S. population at large, including persons in areas where rabies is epizootic) indicates no vaccination necessary. The minimum acceptable antibody level is complete virus neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test, and a booster dose should be administered if the titer falls below this level.

### The potential effect of improved provision of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study [^112RXMXA]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Post-exposure prophylaxis delivery

We estimated post-exposure prophylaxis use for each scenario. Vials of rabies immunoglobulin and vaccines for intradermal use contain multiple doses but opened vials must be discarded at the end of the day. A modelling analysis informed our assumptions for projected vial sharing under different clinic throughputs. We assumed use of 1 mL vials with an average of 2.2 vials per complete 1-week intradermal post-exposure prophylaxis in rural settings, 0.67 vials per complete post-exposure prophylaxis in urban settings, and 1.47 vials per incomplete post-exposure prophylaxis in rural settings and 0.45 vials in urban settings (ie, < three visits; appendix).

Immunoglobulin use in virtually all Gavi-eligible countries is negligible (with some notable exceptions — eg, Sri Lanka, India, and Bhutan); therefore, it was not included in the status quo. In scenario 3, we assume administration of rabies immunoglobulin only in urban clinics, and then only to high-risk patients — ie, with multiple or deep bites, bites to the head or hands, bites by confirmed rabid dogs, or to immunocompromised patients. Around 15% of patients fit these criteria from reviews of clinic data from different countries. We modelled 0.32 rabies immunoglobulin vials per patient on average (appendix).

We used reported costs of post-exposure prophylaxis (appendix) to model the status quo and assumed that upon Gavi investment, rabies vaccine would be purchased for $5 per vial and rabies immunoglobulin at $45 per vial (similar to current prices of equine-derived immunoglobulin from the Pan American Health Organization revolving fund). We assumed fixed introductory costs of $100 000 per country to facilitate training and implementation of improved post-exposure prophylaxis access.

### Immunogenicity of three-session intradermal rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in Indian children and adolescents [^1116dEEV]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rabies is a uniformly fatal but vaccine-preventable disease. In India, the standard 4-session intradermal rabies post-exposure prophylaxis is currently administered. The World Health Organization has recommended a shortened 3-session regimen. Pediatric and adolescent-specific data for this abbreviated protocol remain sparse.

Objectives

To evaluate the immunogenicity of the 3-session intradermal rabies post-exposure prophylaxis regimen among children and adolescents under 18 years of age in India and to assess its adequacy for potential policy adoption.

Methods

A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at the Animal Bite Clinic of a tertiary teaching hospital in New Delhi, India. Eighty-two children and adolescents presenting for the 4th rabies vaccine dose were enrolled. Blood samples were collected before administration of the fourth dose, and IgG anti-rabies virus glycoprotein antibody values were estimated using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Values ≥ 0.5 EU/mL were considered seroprotective. Participants were followed up for 1 year for any development of rabies.

Results

Of the 82 participants, 79 (96.3%) had seroprotective values. The geometric mean value was 2.67 EU/mL. Three participants (3.7%) had values < 0.5 EU/mL. Follow-up assessment post-4th dose confirmed seroconversion in 2 of them. The use and type of rabies immunoglobulin had no significant effect on seroconversion. No participants developed rabies over a 1-year follow-up.

Conclusions

Although seroconversion was achieved in 96.3% of participants after 3 sessions, the 3.7% with nonprotective values raise concerns. Given the fatal nature of rabies and infrastructural variability in Indian healthcare, continuation of the 4-session regimen is recommended until broader validation is conducted in a representative pediatric population via multicentric studies.

### Side-by-side comparative study of the immunogenicity of the intramuscular and intradermal rabies post-exposure prophylaxis regimens in a cohort of suspected rabies virus exposed individuals [^114QVVg5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Rabies is a zoonotic encephalitis caused by rabies virus (RABV), which is transmitted through saliva of infected animals. Annually, RABV infections cause estimated 59 000 human deaths with half of cases occurring in children under 15 years old in Africa and Asia. Cambodia is 1 of the countries with the highest rabies incidence with over 800 human rabies cases annually. Although rabies is 100% lethal and there is no effective treatment, the disease is preventable by post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) when given before clinical symptoms appear. All World Health Organization (WHO) pre-qualified rabies vaccines for human use are inactivated tissue culture RABV formulations that are produced for intramuscular (IM) administration. However, due to costs and vaccine shortages, dose-saving intradermal (ID) administration is encouraged as it reduces the amount of total vaccine from several milliliters (2–4 mL depending on vaccination scheme) for IM administration to under 1 mL for ID administration. The ID use of the purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV, commercial name Verorab, Sanofi, Lyon, France) was intensively studied in the last decades (reviewed in). However, these clinical trials either simulated a PEP treatment by enrolling healthy people rather than actual bite case victims or used extensive vaccination regimens with more than 2-site injections per visit and/or a PEP regimen that requires more than 3 visits.

Rabies neutralizing antibodies (nAb) are a proxy for protection and vaccination efficacy. According to WHO recommendations, an nAb concentration of ≥ 0.5 IU/mL measured at 14 and 28 or 30 days after vaccination start is considered as adequate immune response. The role of T cells after RABV infection in humans remains unclear. CD4 + T cells are considered to play a protective role, as they enhance blood-brain barrier permeability in response to neurotrophic infection due to interferon (IFN)-γ expression. The primary response to rabies vaccination is mediated by CD4 + T cells, with peak at day 7 after the last vaccination dose scheme. These cells are functional with preserved ability to produce IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-2 after peptide stimulation. CD8 + T cells seem to have an insignificant role in the cellular immune response, as their frequencies tend to decrease after vaccination. A previous study showed that the magnitude of type 1 and type 2 cytokine responses did not differ among the intramuscular and intradermal routes of PEP.

Types of exposure — definitions and implications for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) are described. "Under most circumstances, two categories of exposure (bite and nonbite) should be considered". "Indirect contact and activities (e.g., petting or handling an animal, contact with blood, urine or feces, and contact of saliva with intact skin) do not constitute exposures; therefore, postexposure prophylaxis should not be administered in these situations". "Any penetration of the skin by teeth constitutes a bite exposure". "Nonbite exposures from animals very rarely cause rabies", though "The contamination of open wounds or abrasions (including scratches) or mucous membranes with saliva or other potentially infectious material (e.g., neural tissue) from a rabid animal also constitutes a nonbite exposure". "Human-to-human transmission occurs almost exclusively as a result of organ or tissue transplantation". Regarding rare aerosol or airborne events, "Two cases of rabies have been attributed to probable aerosol exposure in laboratories, and two cases have been attributed to possible airborne exposures in caves containing millions of free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) in the Southwest", and "Similar airborne incidents have not occurred in approximately 25 years". "In general, if the suspect material is dry, the virus can be considered noninfectious". "Clinicians should contact local or state public health officials for assistance in determining the likelihood of a rabies exposure in a specific situation".

### Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis… [^111b5aCH]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Rabies Post-exposure Prophylaxis includes wound washing, human rabies immune globulin, and a four-dose series of vaccines.
- Never administer HRIG and the first dose of rabies vaccine into the same anatomical site.
- People with a confirmed or suspected immune disorder require a fifth dose of vaccine and serological confirmation that an adequate response to vaccination occurred. Wound cleansing is especially important in rabies prevention since, in animal studies, thorough wound cleansing alone without other medical treatments has been shown to markedly reduce the likelihood of rabies. Decisions regarding the use of antibiotics and primary wound closure should be made together with the patient. Post-exposure prophylaxis for non-immunized Individuals Treatment Regimen
- All PEP should begin with immediate thorough cleansing of all wounds with soap and water.

If available, a virucidal agent such as a povidone-iodine solution should be used to irrigate the wounds.
- If possible, the full dose should be infiltrated around any wound and any remaining volume should be administered IM at an anatomical site distant from vaccine administration. Also, HRIG should not be administered in the same syringe as a vaccine. Because HRIG might partially suppress the active production of antibodies, no more than the recommended dose should be given.
- HDCV or PCECV 1. 0 mL, intramuscularly in the deltoid area, one each on days 0, 3, 7, and
14. A fifth dose on day 28 is recommended for persons with a confirmed or suspected immune disorder. Vaccines should never be administered in the gluteal area.

Post-exposure prophylaxis for previously immunized individuals Treatment Regimen
- All post-exposure prophylaxis should begin with immediate thorough cleansing of all wounds with soap and water. If available, a virucidal agent such as a povidone-iodine solution should be used to irrigate the wounds.
- RIG should NOT be administered.
- HDCV or PCECV 1. 0 mL, intramuscularly in the deltoid area, one each on days 0 and
3. Vaccines should never be administered in the gluteal area.

Rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis — The number of recommended doses of rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis was adjusted downward in 2021, from 3 to 2 doses, administered at an interval of at least 7 days. Because there are no data on the duration of protection afforded by this 2-dose series, travelers with a sustained risk for rabies exposure (i.e., > 3 years after receipt of the 2-dose series) should, within 3 years of the 2-dose series either: (1) have a titer drawn to determine if it is > 0.5 IU/mL (and receive a booster dose if it is < 0.5 IU/mL; but no vaccination if > 0.5 IU/mL); or (2) pre-emptively receive a third dose of vaccine. Travelers unlikely to visit an at-risk destination after 3 years require no further titers or boosters unless they have a subsequent risk of exposure. Immunocompromised persons should have a titer drawn 1–2 weeks after completion of the 2-dose series to ensure that the titer is ≥ 0.5 IU/mL.

### Rabies control in high-burden countries: role of universal pre-exposure immunization [^113aCZYM]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Rabies is a fatal zoonotic encephalitis that is responsible for approximately 59,000 deaths worldwide every year. A significant portion of these deaths, about one-third, occur in India alone. In order to meet the World Health Organization's objective of eliminating dog-mediated rabies by 2030, India has made considerable progress in this regard. However, implementing the current strategies of canine immunization, sterilization, and providing post-exposure prophylaxis to exposed individuals is challenging in a large and diverse country like India. This article aims to highlight the limitations of relying solely on post-exposure prophylaxis for the prevention of human rabies. Moreover, it presents the necessity and rationale for including pre-exposure immunization in India's national immunization schedule.

Effectiveness of rabies postexposure prophylaxis: animal studies — vaccine and antibody combinations across species. Experimental work over decades supported cell culture–based vaccines for protection after infection, including a 1971 rhesus monkey experiment showing that a single tissue-culture vaccine administration after exposure provided substantial protection, with seven of eight animals protected, while serum alone yielded 63%–88% mortality. Subsequent studies documented limited protection in goats receiving ERA vaccine with or without antirabies goat serum, superiority of tissue culture vaccine over brain-origin vaccine in cattle, and in sheep the best outcome with vaccine plus polyclonal IgG. In dogs, a 1989 evaluation found that combining serum and vaccine provided nearly complete protection versus vaccine-only and untreated controls. For emerging lyssaviruses, four novel bat lyssaviruses were tested in a Syrian hamster model; conventional rabies postexposure prophylaxis provided little or no protection against all four, with protection inversely related to genetic distance from traditional rabies viruses.

As an alternative to the one-time titer check for risk category 3, the systematic review identified observational data from two studies that showed a booster dose triggered an anamnestic response up to 3 years after the 2-dose series. Because the third dose of the PrEP series recommended in the 2008 ACIP recommendations is given as early as day 21 and is known to provide long-term immunogenicity, a booster dose administered from day 21 to year 3 after the primary series was considered. Using the GRADE methodology, the Work Group concluded with low (level 3) certainty that a one-time booster dose of rabies vaccine during day 21–year 3 after the primary vaccination series provides better long-term immunogenicity than no booster dose; low certainty was determined because the data were not from randomized controlled trials comparing the booster with no booster. †† After evaluating these data, ACIP considered an IM booster dose of rabies vaccine during day 21–year 3 after completing the 2-dose series as an alternative to a titer check, for persons with sustained and elevated risk for recognized rabies exposures (i.e. those in risk category 3) from day 21 to year 3 after completing the 2-dose series. The rationale for the recommendation §§ within the EtR framework included the public health importance of rabies, moderately substantial desirable anticipated effect from administering a booster dose, minimal anticipated undesirable effects, acceptability to stakeholders, and feasibility of implementing the booster dose.

A simple plan is proposed for all PEP using the same first dose (Table 2). For previously vaccinated patients, the WHO has long recommended a 4-site ID single-day postexposure booster regimen. Therefore, a 4-site ID dose on day 0 could be given to all patients exposed to a possibly rabid mammal. If they have never had vaccine before, a second 2-site ID dose is given on day 7. Immunosuppressed patients would be given an additional single-site ID dose on or around day 28.

Deviations from recommended postexposure vaccination schedules: Every attempt should be made to adhere to schedules; once vaccination is initiated, delays of a few days are unimportant, but the effect of longer lapses of weeks or more is unknown. Most interruptions do not require reinitiation, and minor deviations can be managed by resuming the schedule as if on time; for example, if the day 7 dose is missed and the patient presents on day 10, give the day 7 dose then and continue at the same interval, resulting in remaining doses on days 17 and 31. With substantial deviations, immune status should be assessed by serologic testing 7–14 days after the final dose.

Rabies exposure evaluation and access to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) — a healthcare professional should evaluate travelers bitten or scratched by any animal to assess the need for rabies PEP. If a suspected rabies exposure has occurred, travelers should stop their journey and seek care at a reliable place where they can obtain appropriate PEP; this could require traveling to another country, and during the pre-travel consultation, suggest countries where PEP is available and most accessible.

### Boostability after single-visit pre-exposure prophylaxis with rabies vaccine: a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial [^116zMKKL]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

After rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) vaccination, scarcely available rabies immunoglobulins are not required for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). However, PrEP is not sufficiently accessible as it is cost-intensive and time-intensive. This study investigates whether rabies PrEP schedules can be shortened to one visit, removing some of these barriers.

Methods

In a block-randomised (2:2:2:1) controlled, multicentre non-inferiority trial, healthy adult travellers (aged 18–50 years and > 50 years) were randomly assigned to (A) single-visit intramuscular (1.0 mL); (B) single-visit intradermal (0.2 mL); (C) standard two-visit intramuscular (1.0 mL; day 0 and 7) PrEP; or (D) no rabies vaccination. 6 months later, participants received simulated intramuscular rabies PEP (1.0 mL; day 0 and 3). Rabies virus neutralising antibody (RVNA) concentrations were measured repeatedly. The primary outcome was the fold increase in geometric mean RVNA concentrations between day 0 and 7 after simulated PEP for all participants. The two main comparisons of this primary outcome are between the standard two-visit schedule and the one-visit intramuscular schedule, and between the standard two-visit schedule and the one-visit intradermal schedule. The non-inferiority margin was 0.67. This study is registered with EudraCT, 2017-000089-31.

Findings

Between May 16, 2018, and March 26, 2020, 288 healthy adult travellers were randomly assigned and 214 participants were evaluated for the primary outcome. Single-visit intramuscular rabies PrEP induced an anamnestic antibody response non-inferior compared with the two-visit intramuscular schedule; single-visit intradermal PrEP did not. The fold increases in the single-visit intramuscular and the single-visit intradermal schedule were 2.32 (95% CI [1.43–3.77]) and 1.11 (0.66–1.87) times as high as the fold increase in the standard schedule, respectively. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were observed. Adverse events related to vaccination were mostly mild.

Interpretation

Single intramuscular rabies vaccination can effectively prime travellers (aged 18–50 years), and potentially other populations, and could replace current standard two-visit rabies vaccination as PrEP.

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) — timing of rabies immune globulin (RIG) and wound infiltration is specified as follows: If access to RIG is delayed but modern cell culture vaccine is available, start the vaccine series as soon as possible, and add RIG to the regimen ≤ 7 days after the first dose of vaccine was administered. After day 7 (e.g., 3 doses of vaccine), RIG is unlikely to provide benefit, and if a patient experiences deviations in the vaccination schedule, including HRIG deviations, expert consultation should be sought. Because rabies virus can persist in tissue, a previously unimmunized traveler who sustained a bite suspicious for rabies should receive full PEP, including RIG, even if a considerable length of time has passed; if there is a scar or the patient remembers where the bite occurred, an appropriate amount of RIG should be injected in the area.

### Simplification of rabies postexposure prophylaxis: a new 2-visit intradermal vaccine regimen [^116DzycN]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

A 2-visit multiple-site intradermal (ID) vaccine protocol would be the most economical, immunogenic, and practicable regimen for postexposure rabies prophylaxis (PEP) in clinics seeing few patients a month. This regimen with an additional day 28 dose is now recommended by the WHO. The difficulties surrounding ID rabies vaccination have hindered progress in provision of prophylaxis, especially in rural Asia and Africa. Although the latest WHO recommendations include 1-week ID postexposure vaccine regimens, these are unlikely to prove economical where rabies vaccination is presently unavailable. The new protocol uses a whole vial of vaccine divided between 4-sites ID on the first day and half a vial at 2-sites ID on day 7. Gavi has recently approved support for rabies PEP. This 2-visit 4-site ID regimen, with or without a day 28 dose, should be considered for implementation in this remarkable new initiative.

### Rabies control in high-burden countries: role of universal pre-exposure immunization [^111GsLw7]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

PEP failure

Reported cases of PEP failure are often not due to true vaccine failure but rather deviations from the WHO-recommended PEP guidelines, such as omission or improper administration of RIg, lack of primary wound care, inadequate vaccine doses, inappropriate site of vaccination etc.

True PEP failures are usually linked to bites in highly innervated regions like the face, neck, arms, fingers, or multiple bites. Direct virus inoculation into a nerve results in a shorter incubation period, compromising the efficacy of active and passive immunization.

Psychological and mental health impact of animal bite

In cases of animal bites, despite adequate PEP, the fear and anxiety associated with the possibility of contracting a fatal illness like rabies can be distressing for the victim and their families, specially in remote or low-resource areas where access to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may be delayed. The waiting period until receiving PEP can be a time of heightened stress and anxiety, as individuals worry about their health and the potential consequences of the bite.

Rabies pre-exposure booster doses and serologic monitoring — risk-category schedules: Persons in the continuous risk category (e.g., research laboratories or vaccine production facilities) should have serum tested for rabies virus neutralizing antibody every 6 months; frequent-risk persons (e.g., diagnostic laboratory workers, cavers, veterinarians and staff, animal‑control and wildlife officers in enzootic areas, and persons who frequently handle bats) should be tested every 2 years and receive a single booster dose if the titer is less than complete neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). Infrequent exposure groups and certain at‑risk international travelers who completed a full pre-exposure series do not require routine serologic verification or routine pre-exposure boosters; if later exposed, they simply require postexposure prophylaxis for a person previously vaccinated (i.e., days 0 and 3 vaccination).

Limitations

An assumption of our model is that animal health status and exposure circumstances are independent. To avoid this assumption, we would need data on how those parameters vary together. These data exist for other countries (for example, through the Rabies Exposure Assessment and Contact Tracing App [REACT]); however, the distribution of animals in those countries that use REACT App, such as Haiti and Vietnam, are heavily skewed toward dogs and may not be generalizable to the US. Additionally, our estimates do not apply to situations where the person was potentially exposed to a bat but had no known contact with the bat. More careful consideration is due for these circumstances as bites or scratches from a bat can go unnoticed or be trivialized due to the small size of their teeth.

Although we know that unprovoked bite events from apparently ill animals increase the suspicion for rabies, the quantifiable increase in risk has not been described in North American wildlife. These key risk assessment variables are rarely reported to the NRSS; therefore, the data used to obtain the estimates for these 2 risk assessment criteria could be biased due to lack of geographic and species representativeness. Also, evaluation of health status and circumstances of the exposure often requires the expertise of a public health professional who is familiar with veterinary medicine and animal behavior. Misclassification of these variables by laypeople is common and could result in miscalculation of risk. Indeed, when there is uncertainty surrounding these variables, users of the tools should select the riskier response.

Furthermore, there is likely bias in some estimates due to the probability that certain species are more (or less) frequently captured and submitted for RABV testing. Animals that are considered low risk and cause fairly atraumatic bite wounds are likely only submitted for testing if there is a strong suspicion for RABV infection. For example, most health authorities would rarely recommend rabies testing or PEP after a bite from a small rodent. Our model estimates are consistent with this guidance for normal-acting rodents; however, if the small rodent is considered strange-acting and the bite was unprovoked, the model would suggest that PEP is recommended. This discrepancy highlights the importance of rabies experts to interpret the exposure scenario before initiating PEP and considering a higher threshold for "health status" and "provoked" for low-risk species. This potential bias also likely explains the moderate correlation between survey responses and Pr(rabid|exposure) (along with individual variation in experience and risk tolerance).

### World Health Organization guidelines on postexposure prophylaxis for HIV: recommendations for a public health approach [^116ehyzU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) developed recommendations for PEP irrespective of exposure source in recognition of the need to simplify eligibility assessment and prescribing practices. Traditionally, separate PEP guidelines have been developed according to exposure type, with difference guidelines for occupational exposure, nonoccupational exposure, and sexual assault. Recognizing the need to improve uptake and completion rates for PEP, the WHO 2014 guideline does not differentiate between exposure sources, but rather provides recommendations across all exposures. Recommendations for simplifying prescribing approaches and supporting adherence are also provided. In translating this guidance into national PEP guidelines, countries are encouraged to consider the need to provide PEP in a way that maximizes uptake and completion rates.

Effectiveness of PrEP in prevention of rabies

There is abundant evidence supporting the safety and immunogenicity of pre-exposure vaccination for rabies in children. In contrast to the several deaths reported despite PEP, PrEP failure has never been documented, except a single case in 1983, which was attributed possibly to concurrent chloroquine administration. Pre-exposure prophylaxis for rabies provides long-lasting protection and is capable of eliciting an adequate immunological response even with a single booster dose for several years after the initial vaccination.

RIg is mandatory and lifesaving in individuals with Category III exposures. However, using RIg has various challenges, including availability, cost, and proper administration. If a previously immunized person (PrEP) experiences a rabid exposure, RIg is unnecessary, and the vaccination schedule can be shortened. Additionally, for previously vaccinated individuals, post-exposure vaccination is not an urgent life-saving measure, allowing for some delay if PEP is not immediately accessible.

While the current WHO recommendation for PrEP is a two-visit intradermal or intramuscular regimen, there is evidence that a single-visit intramuscular or intradermal vaccine provides similar protection. Intradermal vaccination, a cost and dose-saving alternative to intramuscular vaccination, is already being used for PEP in several public sector ARCs in various Indian states. Implementing such approaches could potentially serve as a simple and inexpensive means of incorporating routine rabies vaccination into the national immunization program.

Challenges in administration of PrEP

As discussed in the preceding sections, relying solely on PEP for controlling human rabies has drawbacks, which can be overcome by implementing PrEP. However, this introduces new challenges, particularly regarding the cost and logistics of such a program. Allocating existing vaccine stocks for PrEP raises concerns about shortages for PEP, a critical intervention. These challenges can be addressed by developing a clear vaccination strategy, expanding vaccine production, and creating a dedicated PrEP stockpile.

ID vaccination is dose- and cost-sparing, but only if the required number of individuals are vaccinated at a time to utilize the entire vial. Successful administration of ID vaccines may also require some skill and training for the healthcare workers.

For successful implementation of a large-scale rabies PrEP program, establishing a strong, sustainable funding pipeline is crucial. This can only be achieved through significant policy changes that integrate rabies control into existing national health programs. Additionally, public awareness campaigns are essential to promote vaccine acceptance and uptake while also generating political determination to combat rabies.

### Rabies postexposure prophylaxis, new york, 1995–2000 [^114nMgRe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Combined with effective human rabies prophylaxis, canine rabies control programs were responsible for the steady decline of human rabies in the United States, from 20–25 annual cases in the 1940s to < 3 annual cases in the 1990s. Although the current incidence of human rabies in the United States is negligible compared to that of other infectious diseases, the number of persons seeking rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is high; 18,238 persons received PEP in New York (excluding New York City) from 1993 to 1998. No proven curative treatment has been documented for rabies once clinical disease begins. Human rabies can be prevented by following the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations of local wound care and prompt administration of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG, 20 IU/kg) on day 0 and vaccine on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. For persons who have been previously vaccinated, the recommended prophylaxis consists of a vaccine dose on days 0 and 3.

Studies addressing rabies PEP incidence indicate a rising trend since the 1970s. Estimates of annual PEP incidence in Georgia increased from 1.94 cases/100,000 in 1970 to an estimated 6.17 cases/100,000 from 1995 to 2001 (1, S.J. Onufrak, Source-specific risks among patients receiving rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in Georgia [master's thesis]. Atlanta: Emory University; 2003). At the national level, incidence was most recently estimated at 8.69 cases/100,000 in 1980. Increases are probably attributable to an expanding raccoon rabies epizootic in the mid-Atlantic states and changes in PEP consideration after potential bat exposure. We describe demographic and animal exposure data associated with PEP in upstate New York several years after the establishment of the raccoon rabies variant and compare them with 1993–1994 data from the same area.

### Vaccinating children in high-endemic rabies regions: what are we waiting for? [^113dWUqy]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

On September 28 this year, the World Rabies Day came as a reminder that a fully preventable viral encephalitis still claims at least 59 000 victims per year in over 150 countries; and particularly in rural Africa and Asia, where over 40% of individuals bitten by a suspect rabid animal are children. Sadly, these figures are probably underestimated.

Rabies is one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) announced by the WHO, that is, a diverse group of communicable diseases that particularly affect poor populations, without adequate sanitation, and living in close contact with infectious vectors. In 2013, the World Health Assembly called to intensify measures against NTDs. In 2015, the WHO called for action to achieve zero dog-mediated rabies deaths in humans by 2030. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance prevention, diagnosis, control and treatment through an integrated One Health approach. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with rabies vaccine plays an important role in prevention but is almost unavailable in high-endemic settings.

Methods

Study Design

This study was a prospective, observational study conducted at the Anti-rabies Clinic of Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) Hospital and Research Centre, Bangalore, India. The study spanned from October 2021 to December 2022. It aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a novel monoclonal antibody cocktail in patients with severe animal bites requiring post-exposure prophylaxis. The study design was chosen to observe the real-world effectiveness and safety profile of the mAb cocktail in a clinical setting, thereby providing valuable data that could inform broader public health strategies (Fig. 3).

This flowchart illustrates the inclusion and exclusion criteria for study participants and outlines the post-exposure prophylaxis protocol, including wound management, vaccination, and monoclonal antibody administration.

Study Participants

A total of 159 participants were included in the study. These participants were selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria required participants to be animal bite victims who voluntarily sought PEP at the Anti-rabies Clinic, were willing to provide informed consent, and were available for follow-up. The exclusion criteria included victims who had already initiated post exposure prophylaxis, those with a history of previous pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies, and those who were unavailable for follow-up due to travel or other reasons. Special attention was given to ensure that bite victims under the age of 18 were accompanied by a parent or guardian who could provide consent. Participants were monitored throughout the study period to assess the outcomes of the prophylaxis and the occurrence of any adverse events.

Ethical Considerations

The study was conducted in full compliance with the ethical guidelines set forth by the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonization's (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of KIMS Hospital (Ref. KIMS/IEC/D-06/2021) prior to the commencement of the study.

Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal guardians before their inclusion in the study. For participants aged 2–17 years, written informed consent was obtained from their parents or legal representatives, and written informed assent was obtained from participants aged 7–17 years. The consent process included a detailed explanation of the study's purpose, procedures, potential risks, and benefits.
