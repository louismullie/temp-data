## Question

How does Atripla compare with Biktarvy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Atripla compares with Biktarvy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacologic compositions and dosing characteristics of each single-tablet regimen. Then, I should compare head-to-head and indirect efficacy data, including rapid-initiation and long-term durability results. Next, I will evaluate safety and tolerability with emphasis on CNS, renal, bone, and metabolic domains. After that, I should assess resistance barriers and patterns. I will then consider special populations such as pregnancy, HBV coinfection, and those with renal risk. I need to synthesize cost-effectiveness considerations. Finally, I will align conclusions with contemporary guideline positioning and translate this into practical prescribing recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the core drug characteristics to ensure we are comparing like with like; Atripla combines efavirenz with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as a once-daily single-tablet NNRTI-based regimen, whereas Biktarvy coformulates bictegravir with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide as a once-daily INSTI-based regimen; wait, I should verify the exact approved Biktarvy tablet strength and indication, which are 50/200/25 mg for adults per the FDA, and note that TDF is the tenofovir moiety present in Atripla-era regimens mentioned in FDA documents that reference Atripla in drug–drug interaction sections, confirming the historical EFV/FTC/TDF construct in clinical use [^116DcsGN] [^112So7Q7].

> Next, I will examine comparative efficacy; hold on, I should be precise that the modern randomized rapid-initiation trial compared BIC/FTC/TAF to EFV 400 mg plus 3TC and TDF, not the exact Atripla formulation which uses FTC rather than 3TC, but mechanistically this still reflects an efavirenz plus TDF backbone and informs relative performance; at 48 weeks, viral suppression to less than 50 copies/mL favored Biktarvy 95.9% versus 79.2% with the EFV-based regimen, with greater CD4 gains and markedly fewer discontinuations for adverse effects, death, or loss to follow-up (0.7% vs 16.1%), supporting superior effectiveness and tolerability with the Biktarvy platform in rapid start settings [^115sZQbk].

> Let me now consider long-term durability and resistance protection; I should double-check the 5-year outcomes for bictegravir, which demonstrate maintenance of suppression in 98.6% of those with on-treatment data at Week 240 and, importantly, no treatment-emergent resistance across both pivotal Phase 3 programs and their extensions, with only 1.6% discontinuations due to adverse events over five years, lending strong support to durability and a high genetic barrier with B/F/TAF [^114fE8HM].

> I will now examine CNS tolerability since this often drives real-world persistence; wait, let me verify older Atripla discontinuation data, which show that approximately one-fifth of individuals initiating Atripla switched therapy by 12 months and that CNS toxicity was the leading cause of discontinuation (71% of switches), with prominent symptoms including nightmares, insomnia, and depression and incomplete resolution in many cases; by contrast, Biktarvy trials did not identify a prominent CNS signal and had very low AE-related discontinuation, and comparative NNRTI data further underscore EFV's neuropsychiatric liabilities relative to newer agents, reinforcing that efavirenz-based STRs carry a substantial CNS burden compared with INSTI-based therapy [^1124ePHs] [^114fE8HM] [^112YnpWG].

> Turning to renal and bone safety, I need to check the tenofovir prodrug differences; TAF reduces plasma tenofovir exposure by about 90% versus TDF, which mechanistically explains improved renal and bone safety; pooled analyses across 26 trials found zero cases of proximal renal tubulopathy on TAF versus 10 on TDF and fewer renal discontinuations on TAF, with consistent advantages in proteinuria and tubular biomarkers, all of which translate clinically into a safer renal and bone profile for Biktarvy than for TDF-containing regimens like Atripla [^111VEwvz] [^112Ucu7F] [^113zXGDU].

> On metabolic effects, let me reconsider how best to anchor the comparison; efavirenz is associated with less favorable lipid changes relative to newer NNRTIs, and trials demonstrate higher LDL-C and non–HDL-C with EFV-containing regimens compared with doravirine-based therapy, indirectly highlighting EFV's dyslipidemic profile; meanwhile, B/F/TAF trials report low rates of discontinuation for adverse events over years without a specific lipid toxicity signal, though I should avoid overgeneralization and simply note the absence of a comparable metabolic penalty observed with EFV [^112YnpWG] [^114fE8HM].

> I should now synthesize discontinuation data; hold on, I should confirm that Biktarvy had only 1.6% AE-related discontinuations over five years in Phase 3 programs and open-label extensions, contrasted with 19% overall discontinuation by 12 months in the Atripla cohort study and the much higher attrition for the EFV-based arm in the rapid-initiation trial, recognizing these are different designs but directionally consistent in favor of Biktarvy for persistence and tolerability in practice [^114fE8HM] [^1124ePHs] [^115sZQbk].

> Assessing resistance, I need to ensure I do not overstate; NNRTIs like efavirenz have a lower genetic barrier, with common EFV-associated mutations such as K103N and Y188L emerging with suboptimal adherence, and NRTI-associated substitutions including M184V and K65R can also be selected with TDF/FTC backbones; by contrast, bictegravir with two NRTIs has shown a high barrier in trials with no emergent resistance through 240 weeks, consistent with the INSTI class's superior robustness in first-line settings [^112QZJw4] [^114fE8HM] [^114CzpDj].

> For special populations, let me check pregnancy and HBV considerations carefully; IMPAACT 2010 showed that dolutegravir-based regimens, including those with TAF, outperformed efavirenz-based regimens initiated in pregnancy on composite outcomes, supporting the broader preference for integrase-based therapy in this setting, while for HBV coinfection both regimens contain FTC and a tenofovir prodrug that have HBV activity and discontinuation of these agents can precipitate HBV flares, necessitating careful monitoring and continuity of HBV-active therapy when switching or stopping, and in those with renal risk TAF's superior renal safety profile relative to TDF is a decisive advantage [^117GmQYG] [^116WGJBz] [^112Ucu7F].

> I should now consider costs; document-level cost-effectiveness modeling suggests that TAF's renal and bone safety may justify a modest premium over TDF on toxicity-avoidance grounds, but I must acknowledge that generic EFV/TDF/FTC can be less expensive upfront; however, higher discontinuation rates, CNS adverse events, and renal monitoring needs with EFV/TDF/FTC can offset some apparent savings when considered in a real-world, longitudinal care model [^112A5j2o].

> Next, I will align with guidelines; hold on, let me verify that contemporary guidance prefers INSTI-based single-tablet regimens such as B/F/TAF as initial therapy due to efficacy, tolerability, and high resistance barrier, which places Biktarvy in the preferred category for most treatment-naive adults, whereas efavirenz-based STRs like Atripla have largely moved out of preferred status due to tolerability concerns and availability of better options [^114CzpDj] [^111huDs7].

> Putting this together into a practical recommendation, I should confirm that starting with Biktarvy is appropriate for most people initiating therapy or switching from older regimens, including those on EFV/TDF/FTC who are suppressed but experiencing tolerability or safety concerns, with switch studies demonstrating maintained suppression and favorable safety on B/F/TAF, while ensuring HBV-active therapy continuity and monitoring for potential flares if any tenofovir- or FTC-containing regimen is stopped [^114CzpDj] [^116WGJBz].

> Final synthesis: Biktarvy demonstrates higher effectiveness in rapid initiation, superior long-term durability without emergent resistance, substantially improved renal and bone safety via TAF, far better CNS tolerability than efavirenz-based STRs, and lower discontinuation rates, making it the clinically superior and guideline-preferred choice over Atripla for the vast majority of patients, with Atripla reserved, if at all, for highly selected scenarios where cost is the dominant constraint and no CNS or renal risk factors are present [^115sZQbk] [^114fE8HM] [^112Ucu7F] [^1124ePHs] [^114CzpDj].

---

Biktarvy is preferred over Atripla for most patients due to **higher efficacy**, **fewer side effects**, and a **higher barrier to resistance** [^115sZQbk] [^114fE8HM]. It is a **once-daily, single-tablet regimen** [^116DcsGN] with minimal drug interactions [^114CzpDj] and **improved renal and bone safety**, making it suitable for patients with comorbidities or those at risk for renal or bone complications [^112Ucu7F]. Atripla is now less commonly used due to its **neuropsychiatric side effects** [^112YnpWG], lower resistance barrier, and greater renal and bone toxicity.

## Composition and mechanism of action

| **Regimen** | **Components** | **Mechanism of action** |
|-|-|-|
| Atripla [^112YnpWG] | - Efavirenz (NNRTI) <br/> - Emtricitabine (NRTI) <br/> - Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (NRTI) | - Efavirenz inhibits reverse transcriptase <br/> - Emtricitabine and tenofovir inhibit reverse transcriptase, preventing viral DNA synthesis |
| Biktarvy | - Bictegravir (INSTI) <br/> - Emtricitabine (NRTI) <br/> - Tenofovir alafenamide (NRTI) | - Bictegravir inhibits integrase, preventing viral DNA integration <br/> - Emtricitabine and tenofovir inhibit reverse transcriptase |

## Clinical efficacy

### Virologic suppression

Atripla effectively achieves virologic suppression [^114iLBFk] but has a lower resistance barrier and a higher risk of virologic failure than newer regimens [^115sZQbk]. Biktarvy achieves **high suppression rates** (> 98% at 240 weeks) [^116Wvvnf] with no treatment-emergent resistance reported in clinical trials [^114fE8HM].

---

### Resistance barrier

Atripla has a lower resistance barrier, largely driven by efavirenz [^112QZJw4], increasing the risk of resistance. Biktarvy has a **high resistance barrier** [^111huDs7], with no treatment-emergent resistance reported in clinical trials [^114fE8HM].

---

## Safety and tolerability

### Neuropsychiatric side effects

Atripla is associated with significant neuropsychiatric adverse effects — insomnia, vivid dreams [^112YnpWG], depression, and anxiety — leading to discontinuation in approximately 20% of patients [^1124ePHs]. Biktarvy has **minimal neuropsychiatric side effects** and is generally better tolerated in patients with psychiatric comorbidities [^111huDs7].

---

### Renal and bone safety

Atripla is associated with renal toxicity and bone mineral density loss attributable to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^112ctKeY] [^111VEwvz]. Biktarvy, containing tenofovir alafenamide, has an **improved renal and bone safety profile** with significantly fewer renal and bone adverse events [^111VEwvz] [^112Ucu7F].

---

## Drug interactions

Atripla has significant drug–drug interactions because efavirenz potently induces cytochrome P450 enzymes, often requiring monitoring and dose adjustments. Biktarvy has **minimal drug interactions**, making it suitable for patients taking multiple medications [^114CzpDj].

---

## Patient adherence and quality of life

Atripla is dosed once daily, but adherence can be compromised by neuropsychiatric side effects [^1124ePHs] and the need to take it on an empty stomach. Biktarvy is **once daily with no dietary restrictions**, has minimal side effects, and is associated with improved adherence and quality of life [^115sZQbk].

---

## Special populations

### Pregnant women

Atripla is **less suitable in pregnancy** due to teratogenicity concerns with efavirenz. Biktarvy has limited pregnancy data but is **generally considered safer** than efavirenz-containing regimens.

---

### Patients with renal impairment

Atripla is not recommended for significant renal impairment because it contains tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Biktarvy is **suitable for patients with renal impairment** given tenofovir alafenamide's improved renal safety profile [^112Ucu7F].

---

## Cost and accessibility

Atripla is **available as a generic**, improving affordability and access in resource-limited settings. Biktarvy is currently available only as a branded product, which increases cost and may limit accessibility in some settings [^112A5j2o].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Atripla is no longer recommended as a first-line regimen because of safety and tolerability concerns [^114CzpDj]. Biktarvy is **recommended as a first-line regimen** by major guidelines due to its efficacy, safety, and tolerability [^111huDs7].

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Parameter** | **Atripla** | **Biktarvy** |
|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | High, but lower barrier to resistance | High, with no reported resistance |
| Neuropsychiatric side effects | Significant | Minimal |
| Renal and bone safety | Lower | Higher |
| Drug interactions | Significant | Minimal |
| Adherence | Compromised by side effects | High adherence |
| Cost | Lower (generic) | Higher (branded) |
| Clinical guidelines | Not recommended first-line | Recommended first-line |

---

Biktarvy is **generally preferred** over Atripla due to its superior efficacy, safety, and tolerability [^114fE8HM]. It is particularly suitable for patients with psychiatric comorbidities, renal impairment, or those taking multiple medications [^112Ucu7F]. Atripla may still be considered in resource-limited settings due to its lower cost and accessibility [^112A5j2o].

### Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as initial treatment for HIV-1: five-year follow-up from two randomized trials [^114fE8HM]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a single-tablet regimen recommended for HIV-1 treatment. The safety and efficacy of B/F/TAF as initial therapy were established in two Phase 3 studies: 1489 (vs dolutegravir [DTG]/abacavir/lamivudine) and 1490 (vs DTG + F/TAF). After 144 weeks of randomized follow-up, an open-label extension evaluated B/F/TAF to 240 weeks.

Of 634 participants randomized to B/F/TAF, 519 completed the double-blinded treatment, and 506/634 (80%) chose the 96-week open-label B/F/TAF extension, which was completed by 444/506 (88%) participants. Efficacy was based on the secondary outcome of the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 by missing = excluded and missing = failure methods. All 634 participants who were randomized to B/F/TAF and received at least one dose of B/F/TAF were included in efficacy and safety analyses (Study 1489: EudraCT 2015–004024–54; Study 1490: EudraCT 2015–003988–10).

Of those with available virologic data, 98.6% (95% CI [97.0%–99.5%], 426/432) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 (missing = excluded); when missing virologic data were considered as failure, 67.2% (95% CI [63.4%–70.8%], 426/634) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. The mean (SD) change in CD4+ count from baseline was +338 (236.2) cells/μL. No treatment-emergent resistance to B/F/TAF was detected. Adverse events led to drug discontinuation in 1.6% (10/634) of participants (5 with events considered drug-related).

### Discontinuation of Atripla as first-line therapy in HIV-1 infected individuals [^1124ePHs]. AIDS (2012). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) adverse events are common with the initiation of efavirenz, but these are often described as transient. We aimed to describe the outcomes of individuals commencing Atripla (Gilead Sciences Inc, Foster City, California; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, New Jersey, USA) as a first-line regimen.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective case-based analysis of all individuals within our HIV cohort who had received Atripla as their first antiretroviral combination. In individuals who discontinued Atripla, data was collected on the evolution of adverse events.

- **Results**: Four hundred seventy-two individuals commenced Atripla as first-line therapy. At 12 months, 383 individuals (81%) remained on Atripla, with 98% achieving HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml (on-treatment analysis). CNS toxicity was the most common reason for switching therapy in 63 (71%) cases. The median duration of first reported CNS toxicity was 27 days (IQR 7–104 days), and the most commonly reported symptoms were nightmares or vivid dreams in 28 (44%), insomnia in 27 (43%), and depression in 22 (35%). In those with CNS toxicity, six (10%) switched at 0–4 weeks, four (6%) at 4–12 weeks, 30 (48%) at 12–52 weeks, and 23 (36%) changed regimen 52–96 weeks after commencing Atripla. Among those with available documentation, 25 of 63 (40%) reported improvement or resolution of their CNS side effects.

- **Discussion**: One-fifth of all individuals commencing Atripla will need to switch therapy, often due to adverse events. The most common reason for switching in our cohort was CNS toxicity, which although i

### Tenofovir alafenamide versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, coformulated with elvitegravir, cobicistat, and emtricitabine, for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection: Two randomised, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority trials [^111VEwvz]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can cause renal and bone toxic effects due to high plasma tenofovir concentrations. Tenofovir alafenamide is a novel tenofovir prodrug that reduces plasma tenofovir concentrations by 90%. Regimens containing tenofovir alafenamide can provide improved renal and bone safety compared to those containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

- **Methods**: In these two controlled, double-blind phase 3 studies, we recruited treatment-naive, HIV-infected patients with an estimated creatinine clearance of 50 mL per min or higher from 178 outpatient centres across 16 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily oral tablets containing 150 mg elvitegravir, 150 mg cobicistat, 200 mg emtricitabine, and 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/tenofovir alafenamide) or 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (E/C/F/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) with matching placebo. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size of 4) and stratified by HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 count, and region (USA or ex-USA). Investigators, patients, study staff, and those assessing outcomes were blinded to the treatment group.

	- All participants who received at least one dose of the study drug were included in the primary intention-to-treat efficacy and safety analyses. The main outcomes were the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm (with a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 12%) and pre-specified renal and bone endpoints at 48 weeks.

### Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as initial treatment for HIV-1: five-year follow-up from two randomized trials [^114CzpDj]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are recommended in initial antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection in multiple guidelines, including those from the Department of Health and Human Services, the International Antiviral Society-USA, and the European AIDS Clinical Society. The recommended INSTIs, bictegravir (B or BIC) and dolutegravir (DTG), have excellent efficacy and tolerability, once-daily dosing, few drug interactions, and high barriers to resistance.

BIC is available as a co-formulated single-tablet regimen with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and emtricitabine (F or FTC). This combination, B/F/TAF, was compared to two guidelines-recommended DTG-based three-drug regimens when these studies were initiated in two Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials. B/F/TAF was compared to DTG/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC) in one study and to DTG plus F/TAF in the other. Both studies found B/F/TAF to be non-inferior to the DTG-based regimens, with high rates of viral suppression and no treatment-emergent resistance through 144 weeks.

After all participants completed at least 144 weeks of blinded study drug, unblinding occurred, and participants were offered the opportunity to switch to open-label B/F/TAF for an additional 96 weeks, totaling 240 weeks of follow-up on study. To inform the safety and efficacy profile of B/F/TAF over five years, we report the results of this long-term study for those originally assigned to B/F/TAF, including the percentage of participants randomized to B/F/TAF who maintained HIV-1 suppression < 50 copies/mL.

### Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is non-inferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-naive adults with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection: Week 48 results of the DRIVE-AHEAD trial [^112YnpWG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

In summary, DOR/3TC/TDF demonstrated robust antiretroviral efficacy that was statistically non-inferior to that of EFV/FTC/TDF, immunologic efficacy similar to that of EFV/FTC/TDF, and a low rate of treatment-emergent viral drug resistance. DOR/3TC/TDF was superior to EFV/FTC/TDF for neuropsychiatric AEs and changes in LDL-C and non–HDL-C, and was associated with lower rates of rashes, drug-related AEs, and discontinuation due to AEs. The favorable safety profile of DOR/3TC/TDF may reduce the likelihood of non-compliance and treatment discontinuation. Overall, DOR/3TC/TDF is a promising new treatment option for adults with HIV-1 infections.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^112QZJw4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In Study 934 involving treatment-naïve subjects, the comparison was between tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets + EMTRIVA + efavirenz and zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) + efavirenz [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Genotypic analysis was performed on HIV-1 isolates from all confirmed virologic failure subjects with more than 400 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA at week 144 or upon early discontinuation. The analysis showed that the development of efavirenz resistance-associated substitutions occurred most frequently and was similar between the two treatment arms. The M184V substitution, associated with resistance to EMTRIVA and lamivudine, was observed in 2 out of 19 analyzed subject isolates in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets + EMTRIVA group and in 10 out of 29 analyzed subject isolates in the zidovudine/lamivudine group. Through 144 weeks of Study 934, no subjects developed a detectable K65R substitution in their HIV-1 as analyzed through standard genotypic analysis.

- **Cross resistance**: Cross-resistance among certain reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been recognized. The K65R and K70E substitutions selected by tenofovir are also selected in some HIV-1 infected subjects treated with abacavir or didanosine. HIV-1 isolates with this substitution also show reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine and lamivudine. Therefore, cross resistance among these drugs may occur in patients whose virus harbors the K65R or K70E substitution. HIV-1 isolates from subjects (N = 20) whose HIV-1 expressed a mean of three zidovudine-associated reverse transcriptase substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N), showed a 3.1-fold decrease.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^114iLBFk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The clinical efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was evaluated in treatment-naïve adult patients in Study 903, a double-blind, active-controlled multicenter trial. This study compared tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets (300 mg once daily) combined with lamivudine and efavirenz to a regimen of stavudine (d4T), lamivudine, and efavirenz in 600 antiretroviral-naïve subjects. These subjects had a mean age of 36 years, ranging from 18 to 64 years old. Among them, 74% were male, 64% were Caucasian, and 20% were Black. The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 279 cells/mm³, with a range of 3 to 956, and the median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 77,600 copies/mL, varying from 417 to 5,130,000. Subjects were stratified based on baseline HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ cell count, with 43% having baseline viral loads greater than 100,000 copies/mL and 39% with CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm³.

- **Treatment outcomes**: Outcomes through weeks 48 and 144 are documented. Specifically, subjects achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 400 copies/mL through these time points.

This data underscores the efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in managing HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral-naïve adults.

### Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy with coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide versus efavirenz, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in HIV-positive men who have sex with men in China: Week 48 results of the multicenter, randomized clinical trial [^115sZQbk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Most international treatment guidelines recommend rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, but experiences with rapid ART initiation remain limited in China. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of efavirenz (400 mg) plus lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EFV + 3TC + TDF) versus coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) in rapid ART initiation among men who have sex with men (MSM) who have been diagnosed with HIV.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolled MSM aged ≥ 18 years to start ART within 14 days of confirmed HIV diagnosis. The participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive EFV (400 mg) + 3TC + TDF or BIC/FTC/TAF. The primary endpoint was viral suppression (< 50 copies/mL) at 48 weeks per US Food and Drug Administration Snapshot analysis.

- **Results**: Between March 2021 and July 2022, 300 participants were enrolled; 154 were assigned to receive EFV + 3TC + TDF (EFV group) and 146 BIC/FTC/TAF (BIC group). At week 48, 118 (79.2%) and 140 (95.9%) participants in the EFV and BIC group, respectively, were retained in care with viral suppression, and 24 (16.1%) and 1 (0.7%) participant in the EFV and BIC group, respectively, discontinued treatment because of adverse effects, death, or loss to follow-up (P < .001). The median increase of CD4 count was 181 and 223 cells/μL, respectively, for the EFV and BIC group, at week 48 (P = 0.020). The overall incidence of adverse effects was noted in the study but appears cut off.

### Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as initial treatment for HIV-1: Five-year follow-up from two randomized trials [^116Wvvnf]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a single-tablet regimen recommended for HIV-1 treatment. The safety and efficacy of B/F/TAF as initial therapy were established in two Phase 3 studies: 1489 (vs dolutegravir [DTG]/abacavir/lamivudine) and 1490 (vs DTG + F/TAF). After 144 weeks of randomized follow-up, an open-label extension evaluated B/F/TAF to 240 weeks.

- **Methods**: Of 634 participants randomized to B/F/TAF, 519 completed the double-blinded treatment, and 506/634 (80%) chose the 96-week open-label B/F/TAF extension, which was completed by 444/506 (88%) participants. Efficacy was based on the secondary outcome of the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 by missing = excluded and missing = failure methods. All 634 participants who were randomized to B/F/TAF and received at least one dose of B/F/TAF were included in efficacy and safety analyses (Study 1489: ClinicalTrials.govNCT02607930; EudraCT 2015–004024–54. Study 1490: ClinicalTrials.govNCT02607956; EudraCT 2015–003988–10).

- **Findings**: Of those with available virologic data, 98.6% (95% CI [97.0%-99.5%], 426/432) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 (missing = excluded); when missing virologic data were considered as failure, 67.2% (95% CI [63.4%-70.8%], 426/634) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. The mean (SD) change in CD4+ count from baseline was +338 (236.2) cells/μL. No treatment-emergent resistance to B/F/TAF was detected. Adverse events led to drug discontinuation in 1.6% (n = 10/634) of participants, with n = 5 events considered drug-related.

### Switching to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^111huDs7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Bictegravir (B)/emtricitabine (F)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a guideline-recommended treatment for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We evaluated whether people receiving dolutegravir (DTG) plus F/TAF or F/TDF (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) with viral suppression can switch to B/F/TAF without compromising safety or efficacy, regardless of preexisting nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, active-controlled, noninferiority trial, we enrolled adults who were virologically suppressed for ≥ 6 months before screening (with documented/suspected NRTI resistance) or ≥ 3 months before screening (with no documented/suspected NRTI resistance) on DTG plus either F/TDF or F/TAF. We randomly assigned (1:1) participants to switch to B/F/TAF or DTG + F/TAF once daily for 48 weeks, each with matching placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL at week 48 (snapshot algorithm); the prespecified noninferiority margin was 4%.

- **Results**: Five hundred sixty-seven adults were randomized; 565 were treated (284 B/F/TAF, 281 DTG + F/TAF). At week 48, B/F/TAF was noninferior to DTG + F/TAF, as 0.4% (1/284) vs 1.1% (3/281) had HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL (difference, −0.7% [95.001% confidence interval {CI}, −2.8% to 1.0%]). There were no significant differences in efficacy among participants with suspected or confirmed prior NRTI resistance (n = 138). No participant had treatment-emergent drug resistance. Median weight change from baseline…

### The epi-TAF for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^112A5j2o]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Approximately 84% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected US residents on antiretroviral therapy currently receive some form of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as part of their HIV treatment regimen. The TDF analogue tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has demonstrated equal efficacy but with decreased renal injury and bone mineral density loss compared with TDF. We examine how much more society ought to be willing to pay for TAF over TDF, in exchange for its improved toxicity profile. Using cost-effectiveness methods, we find that conditions warrant an annual premium of up to $1000 over the average wholesale price (AWP) of TDF. Once generic coformulations of tenofovir/lamivudine become accessible, however, the appropriate premium for TAF will likely merit a downward adjustment, using generic TDF-based costs as the benchmark.

### Renal safety of tenofovir alafenamide vs. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: a pooled analysis of 26 clinical trials [^112ctKeY]. AIDS (2019). High credibility.

Methods

- **Study design and participants**: We included 26 phase 2 and 3 multicenter, multinational clinical studies of TAF-containing regimens in PLH, including adults, adolescents, and children (aged ≥ 6 years) who were either ART-naive or virologically suppressed on a stable ART regimen containing TDF. These studies were conducted between 28 December 2011 and 4 December 2017. The study design and inclusion criteria, including minimum renal function of each trial, are described in Appendix Table 1. Of the 26 studies, 14 were double-blind and randomized, six were open-label and randomized, and six were single-arm. All trials were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by central or site-specific review boards or ethics committees. All participants or their legal guardians (if minors) provided written, informed consent.

- **Procedures**: Postbaseline study visits were conducted at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48, and every 12 weeks thereafter until week 96. Renal laboratory tests included serum creatinine (SCr), CrCl by Cockcroft–Gault, treatment-emergent proteinuria by dipstick, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and tubular proteinuria [urine retinol binding protein-to-creatinine ratio (RBP: Cr) and β2-microglobulin-to-creatinine ratio (β2M: Cr)] (Covance Laboratories, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA).

Renal safety was assessed by recording adverse events, which were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, version 18.1–19.1; see Appendix Table 2).

### Efficacy and safety of dolutegravir with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate HIV antiretroviral therapy regimens started in pregnancy (IMPAACT 2010/VESTED): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^117GmQYG]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy is important for both maternal health and prevention of perinatal HIV-1 transmission; however, adequate data on the safety and efficacy of different ART regimens that are likely to be used by pregnant women are scarce. In this trial, we compared the safety and efficacy of three antiretroviral regimens started in pregnancy: dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

- **Methods**: This multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted at 22 clinical research sites in nine countries (Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, the United States, and Zimbabwe). Pregnant women (aged ≥ 18 years) with confirmed HIV-1 infection and at 14–28 weeks' gestation were eligible. Women who had previously taken antiretrovirals were excluded (up to 14 days of ART during the pregnancy was permitted), as were women known to be pregnant with multiple fetuses, or those with known fetal anomaly or a history of psychiatric illness. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using a central computerised randomisation system. Randomisation was done using permuted blocks (size six) stratified by gestational age (14–18, 19–23, and 24–28 weeks' gestation) and country. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg and once-daily oral fixed-dose combination emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate.

### Renal safety of tenofovir alafenamide vs. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: a pooled analysis of 26 clinical trials [^112Ucu7F]. AIDS (2019). High credibility.

Compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has been associated with improvement in markers of renal dysfunction in individual randomized trials; however, the comparative incidence of clinically significant renal events remains unclear.

- **Design**: We used a pooled data approach to increase the person-years of drug exposure analyzed, maximizing our ability to detect differences in clinically significant outcomes.

- **Methods**: We pooled clinical renal safety data across 26 treatment-naive and antiretroviral switch studies to compare the incidence of proximal renal tubulopathy and discontinuation due to renal adverse events between participants taking TAF-containing regimens vs. those taking TDF-containing regimens. We performed secondary analyses from seven large randomized studies (two treatment-naive and five switch studies) to compare incidence of renal adverse events, treatment-emergent proteinuria, changes in serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and urinary biomarkers (albumin, beta-2-microglobulin, and retinol binding protein-to-creatinine ratios).

- **Results**: Our integrated analysis included 9322 adults and children with HIV (n = 6360 TAF, n = 2962 TDF) with exposure of 12519 person-years to TAF and 5947 to TDF. There were no cases of proximal renal tubulopathy in participants receiving TAF vs. 10 cases in those receiving TDF (P < 0.001), and fewer individuals on TAF (3/6360) vs. TDF (14/2962) discontinued due to a renal adverse event (P < 0.001). Participants initiating TAF-based vs. TDF-based regimens had more favorable changes in renal health markers.

### Switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir-based therapy [^117Y2gJF]. AIDS (2024). High credibility.

Participants in studies 1489 and 1490 who switched to B/F/TAF from a DTG-containing regimen maintained high rates of virologic suppression, with no emergent resistance. The treatment was well tolerated, and there were no new safety signals reported during medium-term B/F/TAF treatment. These results provide further medium-term evidence of B/F/TAF safety and efficacy in people with HIV who switch from a DTG-based therapy.

### Biktarvy [^116WGJBz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine (FTC) and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). These exacerbations may also occur with the discontinuation of Biktarvy. It is essential to closely monitor hepatic function with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued Biktarvy. If appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^1114AsBz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Subjects who were responders at Week 48 or Week 96 (HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL) but did not consent to continue the trial after Week 48 or Week 96 were excluded from analysis.

- **Subjects who achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL**: Through Weeks 48 and 144, subjects in the emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and the zidovudine/lamivudine group achieved and maintained these levels. Specifically, 84% and 73% of subjects in the respective groups maintained HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL through Week 48 (71% and 58% through Week 144). This difference largely results from higher numbers of discontinuations due to adverse events and other reasons in the zidovudine/lamivudine group in this open-label trial.

- **Subjects who achieved and maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL**: At Week 48, 80% and 70% of subjects in the emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and the zidovudine/lamivudine group, respectively, maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (64% and 56% through Week 144).

- **Mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count**: At Week 48, the mean increase was 190 cells/mm³ in the emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and 158 cells/mm³ in the zidovudine/lamivudine group (312 and 271 cells/mm³ at Week 144).

These results highlight the efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in maintaining viral suppression and increasing CD4+ cell counts in individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Through Week 48, confirmed viral rebound and failure to achieve confirmed < 400 copies/mL were evaluated, including cases of lost to follow-up, subject withdrawal, noncompliance, protocol violation, and other reasons.

### Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is non-inferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-naive adults with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection: Week 48 results of the DRIVE-AHEAD trial [^116bVk5F]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DOR/3TC/TDF) was non-inferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF) on the primary efficacy endpoint. In the DOR/3TC/TDF group, 84.3% (307/364) of participants achieved HIV-1 RNA of < 50 copies/mL by week 48, compared to 80.8% (294/364) in the EFV/FTC/TDF group. For participants with a baseline HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies/mL, 81.2% (56/69) in the DOR/3TC/TDF group and 80.8% (59/73) in the EFV/FTC/TDF group achieved HIV-1 RNA of < 50 copies/mL at week 48.

Similar results were observed for other virologic endpoints: 83.8% of participants in the DOR/3TC/TDF group achieved HIV-1 RNA of < 40 copies/mL, compared to 79.7% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group (difference, 4.1%; 95% CI, -1.5, 9.7). Additionally, virologic outcomes for HIV-1 RNA of < 200 copies/mL were comparable between groups. The mean change in CD4+ T-cell count from baseline to week 48 was similar, with an increase of 198 cells/mm³ in the DOR/3TC/TDF group and 188 cells/mm³ in the EFV/FTC/TDF group (difference, 10.1; 95% CI, -16.1, 36.3).

A phase 2, randomized, active-controlled study of initial antiretroviral therapy with bictegravir or dolutegravir in combination with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide showed excellent efficacy. After 60 weeks of blinded treatment, participants switched to a single-tablet regimen of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. Switching maintained viral suppression in all participants who remained on the study through 12 weeks in the open-label phase, and was safe and well tolerated.

### Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is non-inferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-naive adults with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection: Week 48 results of the DRIVE-AHEAD trial [^115KYS8D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 infection has been successfully treated with a wide array of antiretroviral therapies, which can vastly improve life expectancy and reduce the risk of HIV-1 transmission, but cannot eradicate the infection. Because lifelong treatment is required, safeguarding against toxicity and comorbidity is important. Adverse events that may lead to treatment discontinuation include neuropsychiatric toxicities, skin rashes, gastrointestinal toxicities, abnormal serum lipid levels, abnormal renal or bone parameters, and drug-drug interactions. Therefore, new antiretroviral therapies with fewer unwanted side effects are needed.

Doravirine (DOR), a novel non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV-1, is active in vitro against both wild-type virus and the most common NNRTI-resistant variants at concentrations achieved with 100 mg once-daily (QD) dosing and has a favorable in vitro resistance profile that is unique among NNRTIs. Because it is not a metabolic inducer or inhibitor, DOR is not a perpetrator of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. No clinically meaningful interactions were observed when DOR was co-administered with atorvastatin, an oral contraceptive, a magnesium-based antacid, or a proton-pump inhibitor in healthy volunteers. As a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4, exposure to DOR is reduced in the presence of moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A4. DOR can be taken once daily without regard to food, and its bioavailability is not affected by age, gender, or moderate hepatic impairment.

### Changes in renal function associated with oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate use for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^113YK221]. AIDS (2014). Low credibility.

Creatinine elevations confirmed at consecutive visits were more frequent in the treatment arm (7 vs. 1), but were rare overall (7/1248 or 0.6%). The number needed to harm, defined as a confirmed creatinine elevation including elevations that remain in the normal range, was approximately 166. The risk of adverse renal outcomes was readily managed with every 12-week serum creatinine testing. This study indicates that TDF use in PrEP may lead to mild and subclinical decline in CrCl without proximal tubular dysfunction.

These findings support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention interim guidance that oral FTC/TDF PrEP should include monitoring of serum creatinine. Monitoring BUN, serum phosphate, and urine-derived parameters of proximal tubulopathy had no discernible value. We advise repeating the abnormal serum creatinine measurements on a separate specimen before discontinuing FTC/TDF because the majority of elevations are self-limited. The safety and optimal monitoring frequency for oral FTC/TDF PrEP users having risk factors for renal dysfunction warrants evaluation.

### Switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir-based therapy [^114RGSrc]. AIDS (2024). High credibility.

The number of people with HIV accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART) is increasing, from 7.8 million in 2010 to 28.7 million in 2021. Furthermore, increased longevity on HIV therapy means that people will require decades of ART. Managing emerging comorbidities and drug interactions as people age on ART is an increasing challenge. Simplification of treatment regimens and treatment switches to optimize care may be needed. There are many different reasons why a provider or patient may want or need to switch their ART regimen. Evaluating medium and long-term clinical trial outcomes, where available, can guide decisions on optimal treatment options for specific subpopulations.

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a three-drug, fixed-dose, single-tablet regimen containing an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, bictegravir, and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, emtricitabine and TAF. Clinical trial results have shown that B/F/TAF is highly effective and well tolerated in adults. There is also growing evidence supporting the use of B/F/TAF in routine clinical practice.

B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) is approved for adults in many countries around the world and is recommended in international HIV guidelines in high-income countries, both as first-line and as a switch regimen for those with virologic suppression.

Study 1489 and Study 1490 are randomized, double-blinded, phase 3 clinical trials that evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of either dolutegravir (DTG)-based treatment or B/F/TAF over 144 weeks. Here, we report the eff

### High efficacy of switching to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide in people with suppressed HIV and preexisting M184V/I [^115vhJRA]. AIDS (2022). Low credibility.

The single tablet regimen bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a guideline-recommended initial therapy for HIV. It is also approved as a replacement regimen when switching therapies in virologically suppressed people with HIV (PWH) who have no known substitutions associated with resistance to its individual components. Given the high prevalence of M184V/I and the widespread use of B/F/TAF in clinical practice, whether suppressed PWH with this substitution can be switched to B/F/TAF is of interest. We summarize here the results of a comprehensive review of PWH enrolled in clinical trials of switching therapy to B/F/TAF, with a focus on those with M184V/I.

### Potential kidney toxicity from the antiviral drug tenofovir: New indications, new formulations, and a new prodrug [^116JjKDp]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

The antiviral agent tenofovir is highly effective for the treatment of HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. The older prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), is also a component of daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV infection in high-risk populations. Although TDF is well tolerated, the potential for kidney and bone toxicity has important public health implications given the large number of individuals exposed to TDF worldwide. This review summarizes recent literature on kidney and bone health in individuals treated with TDF and the newer prodrug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).

- **Recent findings**: Risk factors for TDF toxicity appear to be similar in patients treated for HIV or hepatitis B virus and in HIV-uninfected PrEP users, although drug-drug interactions are a more important concern in HIV-positive individuals. The risk of toxicity appears to be lower with TAF; however, further studies are needed to confirm the safety of long-term use and evaluate the efficacy of TAF-based PrEP.

- **Summary**: Nephrologists should be aware of the potential kidney and bone toxicity of TDF, as well as unique situations in which the newer prodrug TAF may contribute to kidney injury.

### Randomized clinical trial on efficacy of fixed-dose efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine on alternate days versus continuous treatment [^116816RL]. AIDS (2019). Low credibility.

Antiretrovirals with long half-lives, such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) and efavirenz (EFV), are suitable for reduced frequency dosing, with potential for improved adherence and reduced toxicity and costs. The objective of this study was to investigate the non-inferiority of the TDF/FTC/EFV fixed-dose combination on alternate days versus the standard regimen in virologically suppressed patients.

- **Design**: A randomized-controlled open-label noninferiority trial enrolling HIV-1-infected patients treated for at least 6 months with the TDF/FTC/EFV fixed-dose combination, who were virologically suppressed (< 40 HIV-RNA copies/ml) with EFV plasma concentrations greater than 1000 ng/ml. Patients were randomized to maintain the TDF/FTC/EFV standard-of-care regimen (SOC, Arm A) or to switch to TDF/FTC/EFV on alternate days (ATAD, Arm B).

- **Methods**: The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with less than 40 HIV-RNA copies/ml at week 48.

- **Results**: One hundred and ninety-seven patients were randomized (98 in the SOC and 99 in the ATAD arm). Among these, 179 (90.3%) were men with a median age of 43.2 years, and 133 (67.5%) were MSM. The CD4+ T-cell count at baseline was 706 cells/μl in the SOC and 632 cells/μl in the ATAD arm. At week 48, 95 (96.9%) patients in the SOC and 93 (93.9%) in the ATAD demonstrated a virological response, with a -3.0% overall risk difference (95% CI: -8.86%/2.86%). The median change from baseline at week 48 in CD4+ T-cell count was 29.4 cells/μl (95% CI: 2.5/56.4) in SOC (P = 0.008) and 61.0 cells/μl (95% CI: 32.1/89.9) in ATAD (P < 0.001).

### Switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed patients with chronic hepatitis B: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, multicentre non-inferiority study [^111FibiR]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been associated with renal toxicity or reductions in bone mineral density, or both, in some patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Tenofovir alafenamide is a tenofovir prodrug with high intrahepatic concentrations of active drug and reduced systemic tenofovir exposures compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In patients with chronic HBV, tenofovir alafenamide has shown efficacy non-inferior to that of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with improved renal and bone safety. With this non-inferiority study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tenofovir alafenamide in patients with HBV infection switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate who are virally suppressed.

- **Methods**: Patients with chronic HBV infection who had been receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 48 weeks or more and who had HBV DNA less than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for at least 12 weeks were recruited to this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority study. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg once a day or to continue tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once a day. The primary efficacy endpoint was loss of virological control, defined as the proportion of patients who received at least one dose of study drug who had HBV DNA of at least 20 IU/mL at week 48 by the modified US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm. Key safety endpoints were changes in hip and spine bone mineral density and estimated creatinine clearance.

### Tenofovir alafenamide vs. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: an updated meta-analysis of 14 894 patients across 14 trials [^111aqnTk]. AIDS (2020). Low credibility.

Both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/emtricitabine demonstrate excellent efficacy and safety overall. However, concerns remain over specific changes in markers of bone and renal function. Lower plasma tenofovir concentrations are observed with TAF and in unboosted regimens. We assess TAF vs. TDF safety with and without booster coformulation.

- **Methods**: A previous systematic review was updated with recent clinical trials. TAF vs. TDF efficacy and safety were compared in boosted and unboosted subgroups. Efficacy was measured by viral suppression. Key safety endpoints included all adverse events, serious adverse events, Grades 3–4 adverse events, and adverse event discontinuation. Further specific renal and bone markers were also assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 14 clinical trials comparing TDF and TAF regimens were identified. A significant difference (P = 0.0004) in efficacy was shown in the boosted subgroup in favour of TAF, while no difference was seen in the unboosted subgroup. There were no significant differences between TAF and TDF for any of the key safety endpoints analyzed. No differences were observed for the bone markers analyzed. No difference was found for renal tubular events. There was a difference in risk for discontinuation due to renal adverse events when boosted (P = 0.03), but none when unboosted.

- **Conclusion**: Across all main safety endpoints, no differences between TAF and TDF are seen. Boosted TDF regimens were associated with lesser comparative efficacy than boosted TAF and a higher risk of renal event discontinuation.

### Renal safety of tenofovir alafenamide vs. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: A pooled analysis of 26 clinical trials [^113zXGDU]. AIDS (2019). Low credibility.

Changes in renal biomarkers in virologically suppressed people living with HIV

For virologically suppressed PLH, there was a greater reduction in median SCr from baseline in the TAF group compared with the TDF group (difference in LSM −0.03 mg/dl, P ≤ 0.001 for week 96). Median CrCl increased in the TAF group while no change was seen in the TDF group (difference in LSM 5.2 ml/min, P ≤ 0.001 for week 96).

In virologically suppressed PLH, we observed that treatment-emergent proteinuria at week 96 (defined as 1+ or greater proteinuria by dipstick on any occasion) was reported for fewer people in the TAF group compared with those in the TDF group [636/2287 (28%) vs. 561/1794 (31%); P = 0.04].

In virologically suppressed participants switching from TDF to TAF, TAF-based regimens had greater decreases or smaller increases from baseline through week 96 in median renal biomarkers (UACR, RBP: Cr, β2M: Cr) compared with TDF. Median UACR decreased by 5.4% on TAF and increased by 27.0% on TDF (P ≤ 0.001). Median RBP: Cr decreased by 2.3% on TAF and increased 61.2% on TDF (P ≤ 0.001). Median β2M: Cr decreased by 25.8% with TAF and increased by 53.0% on TDF (P ≤ 0.001).

### Switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir-based therapy [^117R1QWx]. AIDS (2024). Low credibility.

Although one case of new-onset HBV infection was reported in the DTG/ABC/3TC group during the blinded phase, no cases were reported in participants on B/F/TAF, consistent with the prophylactic activity of TAF against HBV.

This study has several limitations. While the first 144 weeks of studies 1489 and 1490 were blinded, the data presented here are based on an optional OLE of those studies. This open-label design may have introduced some bias into the study results. Although a 96-week treatment period allows us to monitor medium-term efficacy and safety, we cannot exclude the possibility of adverse events or complications that can only be detected with longer follow-up; however, the efficacy and safety results were consistent with outcomes during the first 144 weeks.

The timing of the switch was protocol-defined in this study, so it may not reflect how people chose to switch regimens in real life. A proportion of data was also missing for some participants, and some of the follow-up visits did not take place because of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, similar rates of discontinuation were observed in other antiretroviral studies conducted during this time period. In our study, the most common reasons for discontinuation were participant decision, loss to follow-up, and investigator's decision. There was also a very low percentage of participants who discontinued due to an adverse event (2% in those who switched from DTG/ABC/3TC; 0% in those who switched from DTG+F/TAF). However, M = E and M = F analyses of viral suppression should sufficiently account for any missing data.

### Switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir-based therapy [^117XkJ3c]. AIDS (2024). Low credibility.

- **Discontinuations**: Across both studies, 2 of 519 participants (0.4%) experienced a drug-related adverse event that led to discontinuation of the study drug after switching (weight gain and obesity, respectively); both switched from DTG/ABC/3TC. Other reasons for discontinuation included participant's decision (n = 30), loss to follow-up (n = 16), investigator's discretion (n = 7), protocol violation (n = 1), lack of efficacy (n = 1), and pregnancy (n = 1). There were no discontinuations due to renal adverse events.

In total, five deaths occurred during the OLE: two in participants who switched from DTG/ABC/3TC (one due to seizures and one of unknown cause in a participant with known cardiovascular disease and risk factors) and three in participants who switched from DTG+F/TAF (one due to malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder and two of unknown cause, including one in a participant with known cardiovascular disease and risk factors and one in a participant with no history of cardiovascular disease or risk factors). None of the participants who died had emergent hypertension, emergent diabetes, or initiated statins after the switch to B/F/TAF.

### Improvements in patient-reported outcomes after 12 months of maintenance therapy with cabotegravir + rilpivirine long-acting compared with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide in the Phase 3b SOLAR study [^116vzmii]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Low credibility.

The top three reasons for participation in SOLAR were: interest in research into new treatments for HIV (43%, 289/670), interest in a more convenient treatment option for HIV (17%, 112/670), and to stop being worried about forgetting to take HIV medication every day (13%, 89/670; Fig. 4a).

For participants switching to CAB + RPV LA Q2M from BIC/FTC/TAF in the Extension Phase, the most frequently cited reasons for switching included: interest in new therapies (25%, 36/142), to stop being worried about forgetting to take HIV medication every day (25%, 36/142), and interest in a more convenient treatment option for HIV (15%, 22/142) (Fig. 4b).

- **Figure 4**: Reasons for participation (a) and reasons for switch (b). One participant in the BIC/FTC/TAF arm had missing data. BIC/FTC/TAF, bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide; CAB, cabotegravir; LA, long-acting; Q2M, every 2 months; RPV, rilpivirine.

### Coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide after initial treatment with bictegravir or dolutegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide [^111iAJo4]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

A phase 2, randomized, active-controlled study of initial antiretroviral therapy with bictegravir or dolutegravir in combination with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide showed excellent efficacy. After 60 weeks of blinded treatment, participants switched to a single-tablet regimen of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. Switching maintained viral suppression in all participants who remained on the study through 12 weeks in the open-label phase, and was safe and well tolerated.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^112JLUjR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the study, confirmed viral rebound and failure to achieve viral suppression (≤ 100,000 copies/mL) were examined, as well as CD4+ cell count thresholds (< or ≥ 200 cells/mm³). Through 144 weeks of therapy, 62% of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets arm, and 58% in the stavudine arm, achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA levels of < 50 copies/mL. The mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count was 263 cells/mm³ in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets arm, compared to 283 cells/mm³ in the stavudine arm.

Through the 144-week period, 11 subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group, and 9 subjects in the stavudine group, experienced a new CDC Class C event.

Data through 144 weeks are reported for Study 934, a randomized, open-label, active-controlled multicenter trial. This study compared emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets administered with efavirenz, versus a zidovudine/lamivudine fixed-dose combination administered with efavirenz in 511 antiretroviral-naïve subjects. From Weeks 96 to 144, subjects received a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF with efavirenz, in place of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets with efavirenz.

### Switching to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^111ruGng]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines recommend an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) as preferred initial therapy. Among INSTIs, the agents dolutegravir (DTG) and bictegravir (BIC, B) have a low incidence of treatment-emergent resistance. This higher resistance barrier is evident in results of prospective clinical trials, which demonstrate no incident resistance among those experiencing virologic failure if they received either DTG or BIC plus two NRTIs. Based in part on these results, International AIDS Society (IAS)–USA guidelines only recommend BIC or DTG as INSTIs for initial therapy.

- **Advantages in treatment-experienced individuals**: This resistance benefit translates into advantages in treatment-experienced individuals as well. In the DAWNING study of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) failing first-line treatment with a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two NRTIs, the strategy of DTG plus at least one active NRTI was superior to lopinavir/ritonavir plus one active NRTI. Many participants in this study had extensive NRTI resistance. In an earlier study, DTG was superior to raltegravir in treatment-experienced people failing treatment; some of these participants also had extensive NRTI resistance but were still successfully treated with DTG plus NRTIs. These results demonstrate that individuals who harbor some NRTI resistance can achieve and maintain viral suppression with DTG plus two NRTIs, even if not all NRTIs in the regimen are fully active.

Bictegravir is a novel INSTI coformulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide.

### Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is non-inferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-naive adults with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection: Week 48 results of the DRIVE-AHEAD trial [^1116sKpP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

In a phase 2b study involving treatment-naive adults, doravirine (DOR) at 100 mg once daily, combined with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), demonstrated comparable efficacy to efavirenz with FTC/TDF. It had a favorable safety profile, exhibiting lower rates of drug-related adverse events and central nervous system (CNS) events than efavirenz.

Furthermore, in the phase 3 DRIVE-FORWARD trial, DOR at 100 mg once daily showed non-inferior efficacy and a superior lipid profile compared to darunavir-ritonavir after 48 weeks of combination treatment with two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).

DOR is in development both as a single-entity tablet and as a combination tablet containing DOR at 100 mg, lamivudine at 300 mg, and TDF at 300 mg (DOR/3TC/TDF; MK-1439A). This report presents the results of a phase 3 trial comparing the combination tablet, DOR/3TC/TDF, to ATRIPLA (efavirenz at 600 mg, FTC at 200 mg, and TDF at 300 mg; EFV/FTC/TDF) in adults with previously untreated HIV-1 infections.

### Genvoya [^116JdyYn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In Study 109, the efficacy and safety of switching from Atripla, Truvada plus atazanavir (given with either cobicistat or ritonavir), or Stribild to Genvoya once daily were evaluated in a randomized, open-label trial of virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) HIV-1 infected adults (N = 1436). Subjects had to be suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on their baseline regimen for at least 6 months and have no known resistance-associated substitutions to any of the components of Genvoya prior to study entry. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either switch to Genvoya at baseline (N = 959) or stay on their baseline antiretroviral regimen (N = 477). Subjects had a mean age of 41 years (range 21–77), 89% were male, 67% were White, and 19% were Black. The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 697 cells per mm³ (range 79–1951).

Subjects were stratified by prior treatment regimen. At screening, 42% of subjects were receiving Truvada plus atazanavir (given with either cobicistat or ritonavir), 32% were receiving Stribild, and 26% were receiving Atripla.

- **Treatment outcomes**: Treatment outcomes of Study 109 through 96 weeks are presented in Table 17. The results were similar across subgroups receiving Atripla, Truvada plus atazanavir (given with either cobicistat or ritonavir), or Stribild prior to randomization. In Study 109, the mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 96 was 60 cells per mm³ in subjects treated with Genvoya and 42 cells per mm³ in subjects who remained on their baseline regimen.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

At week 96, the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA levels less than 50 copies/mL was assessed. Participants were generally under 31 years of age, which was the median age, though this trend was not observed at week 96. In the subgroup with high baseline HIV-1 RNA levels (greater than 100,000 copies/mL), 49 out of 69 participants (71.0%) in the DOR/3TC/TDF group and 51 out of 64 participants (79.7%) in the EFV/FTC/TDF group achieved HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 50 copies/mL at week 96. The treatment difference was −8.1% with a 95% confidence interval of −22.9% to 6.7%, as observed in the observed failure approach (Figure 4).

### Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is non-inferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-naive adults with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection: Week 48 results of the DRIVE-AHEAD trial [^115NXk1D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Of the 734 participants assigned to DOR/3TC/TDF (n = 368) or EFV/FTC/TDF (n = 366), 364 in each group received study therapy and were included in the analyses. Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally similar between the treatment groups. By week 48, 14% of the DOR/3TC/TDF group and 17% of the EFV/FTC/TDF group had discontinued study treatment, primarily due to lack of efficacy, adverse events, withdrawal of consent, and loss to follow-up.

- **Details on participant disposition**: Disposition of participants through week 48 showed that the abbreviations DOR/3TC/TDF refer to doravirine at 100 mg, lamivudine at 300 mg, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at 300 mg. The EFV/FTC/TDF refers to efavirenz at 600 mg, emtricitabine at 200 mg, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at 300 mg. The most common reasons for screen failure were a documented or known resistance to any study drug (n = 139) and plasma human immunodeficiency virus–1 RNA of < 1000 copies/mL at screening (n = 62). Of 992 participants screened, approximately 2.4% were excluded due to doravirine-associated mutations (Y188L and V106I) and approximately 4.0% were excluded due to efavirenz-associated mutations (Y188L, K103N, L100I, K101, V108I, G190, and Y181C). In error, one participant was randomized who did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. Lack of efficacy was determined by investigator assessment, not a specific HIV-1 RNA level.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 in people with HIV infection [^112PGJuD]. AIDS (2022). High credibility.

Effective, safe, and affordable antivirals are needed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several lines of research suggest that tenofovir may be effective against COVID-19, but no large-scale human studies with appropriate adjustment for comorbidities have been conducted.

- **Methods**: We studied HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2020 at 69 HIV clinics in Spain. We collected data on sociodemographics, ART, CD4+ cell count, HIV-RNA viral-load, comorbidities, and outcomes. These outcomes included laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. We compared the 48-week risks for individuals receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/FTC, abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC), and other regimens. All estimates were adjusted for clinical and sociodemographic characteristics via inverse probability weighting.

- **Results**: Of 51,558 eligible individuals, 39.6% were on TAF/FTC, 11.9% on TDF/FTC, 26.6% on ABC/3TC, and 21.8% on other regimens. There were 2,402 documented SARS-CoV-2 infections, with 425 hospitalizations, 45 ICU admissions, and 37 deaths. Compared with TAF/FTC, the estimated risk ratios (RR) (95% confidence interval) of hospitalization were 0.66 (0.43, 0.91) for TDF/FTC and 1.29 (1.02, 1.58) for ABC/3TC. The RRs of ICU admission were 0.28 (0.11, 0.90) for TDF/FTC and 1.39 (0.70, 2.80) for ABC/3TC. The RRs of death were 0.37 (0.23, 1.90) for TDF/FTC and 2.02 (0.88, 6.12) for ABC/3TC.

### Switching to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^115yn9XW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

In summary, our study demonstrated that people with HIV who are virologically suppressed on DTG plus F/TAF or F/TDF can safely switch to the simpler single-tablet regimen of B/F/TAF. By including participants regardless of treatment or resistance history, other than INSTI resistance, these data continue to support the high resistance barrier of both BIC and DTG when they are combined with 2 NRTIs, and the safety of switching to B/F/TAF in individuals with viral suppression.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^1149iHud]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets are nucleotide analog HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors and HBV reverse transcriptase inhibitors. These tablets are indicated for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. Additionally, they are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.

- **HIV-1 infection**: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for treating HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. When initiating therapy, it is important to note that these tablets should not be used in combination with ATRIPLA®, BIKTARVY®, COMPLERA®, DESCOVY®, GENVOYA®, ODEFSEY®, STRIBILD®, TRUVADA®, or VEMLIDY® [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Chronic hepatitis B**: These tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. It is essential to consider that the indication in adults is based on safety and efficacy data from the treatment of subjects who were nucleoside-treatment-naïve, as well as subjects who had been previously treated.

### Renal safety of tenofovir alafenamide vs. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: a pooled analysis of 26 clinical trials [^116qwwVB]. AIDS (2019). Low credibility.

Tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is highly efficacious and generally well tolerated. However, TDF is associated with renal adverse events, including proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT), which occurs in less than 1% of individuals. TFV alafenamide (TAF), a TFV prodrug, is associated with a mean 91% lower plasma TFV exposure compared with TDF. As higher plasma TFV levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity, reduced circulating TFV levels are hypothesized to result in fewer renal adverse events.

In phases 2 and 3 clinical trials of both treatment-naive and virologically suppressed adults and children, TAF-containing regimens have demonstrated high efficacy and favorable changes in renal biomarkers including creatinine clearance (CrCl), total and tubular proteinuria, and albuminuria compared with a variety of unboosted and ritonavir (RTV)-boosted or cobicistat (COBI)-boosted TDF-containing regimens. It has been more challenging to determine whether the favourable biomarker profile of TAF translates into improved renal clinical outcomes due to the low rates of renal events in individual trials. However, the 144-week follow-up of the pooled pivotal trials for elvitegravir (EVG)/COBI/emtricitabine (FTC)/TAF had zero cases of PRT and zero renal discontinuations compared with four cases of PRT and 12 renal discontinuations in the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF group.

To better understand the renal clinical outcomes in TAF vs. TDF-containing HIV regimens, we conducted a large integrated analysis of people living with HIV.

### Switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir-based therapy [^1165vS6H]. AIDS (2024). High credibility.

During the blinded phase of studies 1489 and 1490, B/F/TAF demonstrated non-inferior efficacy and safety compared to DTG/ABC/3TC or DTG+F/TAF in people on first-line ART over 144 weeks. The open-label extension (OLE) phase of these studies evaluated the impact of switching from DTG-based treatment to B/F/TAF at the end of the 144-week blinded treatment phase. In the OLE phase, we observed consistent efficacy and safety results after 96 weeks of B/F/TAF treatment in participants who had initially been randomized to DTG-based treatment.

During the follow-up, adults who switched from DTG-based treatment to B/F/TAF in studies 1489 and 1490 maintained high rates of virologic suppression with no treatment-emergent resistance to B/F/TAF during 96 weeks of treatment. Two participants with M184V had HIV-1 RNA of at least 200 copies/ml at the time of switching from DTG/ABC/3TC. Both participants subsequently had sustained resuppression on B/F/TAF. Consistent with findings seen in other clinical trials, there were no cases of treatment-emergent resistance with B/F/TAF. These data confirm and extend the previous 144- and 240-week follow-up results of B/F/TAF in the blinded and open-label phases, respectively, and 48-week follow-up results of B/F/TAF switch from DTG/ABC/3TC.

### Fixed-dose combination bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in adolescents and children with HIV: Week 48 results of a single-arm, open-label, multicentre, phase 2/3 trial [^115juPxs]. The Lancet. Child & Adolescent Health (2021). High credibility.

Bictegravir is a potent integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI) with a high genetic barrier to resistance. Bictegravir, coformulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, is recommended by key European and US HIV treatment guidelines as the preferred single-tablet regimen for adults and adolescents. The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of switching to this regimen in virologically suppressed children and adolescents with HIV.

- **Methods**: In this single-arm, open-label trial, we enrolled virologically suppressed children and adolescents (aged 6 to < 18 years) with HIV at 22 hospital clinics in South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, and the United States. Eligible participants had a bodyweight of at least 25 kg, were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies per mL) on a stable ART regimen for at least 6 months before screening, had a CD4 count of at least 200 cells per μL, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 90 mL/min per 1.73 m² by the Schwartz formula at screening. All participants received the fixed-dose regimen of coformulated bictegravir 50 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg once daily. Pharmacokinetic analysis was used for dosing confirmation, and results were compared with adult values. The primary outcomes were area under the curve at the end of the dosing interval (AUC tau) and concentration at the end of the dosing interval (C tau) of bictegravir, and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and laboratory abnormalities at week 24. Efficacy and safety analyses included…

### Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide plus doravirine in highly treatment-experienced men with multidrug-resistant HIV [^115Fu2ZG]. AIDS (2023). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching highly treatment-experienced people with HIV (HTE PWH) from rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (RPV/FTC/TAF) plus dolutegravir (DTG) to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) plus doravirine (DOR). A pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was conducted to assess the potential interaction between BIC and DOR.

- **Design and methods**: This open-label switch trial enrolled HTE PWH from a primary care private practice in the United States. Eligible participants were male, aged ≥ 45 years, with documented viral resistance to protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and/or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors but no resistance to RPV or DOR, and no K65R or T69 insertion mutations. Virologic suppression (≤ 50 copies/ml) while on RPV/FTC/TAF plus DTG for ≥ 6 months was required prior to enrollment. The primary endpoint of the study was virologic suppression (< 50 and < 200 copies/ml) at 48 weeks. Secondary endpoints included safety, tolerability, changes in body mass index (BMI), and identification of PK parameters of BIC and DOR.

- **Results**: Twenty males [median age: 65 years (range, 46–74), median time since HIV diagnosis: 37 years (range, 12–42)] completed the study. BIC/FTC/TAF plus DOR was well tolerated with no serious or treatment-related adverse events reported and no appreciable changes in BMI from baseline to week 48. At week 48, 100% of participants had < 50 viral copies/ml. PK parameters for BIC and DOR (n = 10) were consistent with published data.
