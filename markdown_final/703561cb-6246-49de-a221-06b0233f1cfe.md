## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and diagnostic framework. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria evolution and their implications. Next, I will review the positive diagnostic strategy versus exclusion, including alarm features and minimal testing. After that, I need to classify subtypes accurately. Then, I will examine pathophysiology to guide treatment. Finally, I will outline evidence-based management, including diet, pharmacotherapy, and brain-gut behavioral therapies, and close with special populations and a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the core definition and clinical construct. IBS is a chronic disorder of gut–brain interaction characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits, typically diarrhea, constipation, or mixed patterns, often with bloating, and without structural disease on routine evaluation, which aligns with contemporary Rome IV and ACG/BSG guidance and the broader literature base [^114xtCxg] [^115DgFY5] [^115YXMbN].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria evolution because this materially affects prevalence and trial enrollment. Rome III required abdominal pain or discomfort at least 2–3 days per month over 3 months, whereas Rome IV requires abdominal pain at least 1 day per week over 3 months and removes "discomfort", making Rome IV more restrictive and reducing prevalence estimates from roughly 9–12% under Rome III to about 4–5% under Rome IV in population studies, which has implications for both epidemiology and clinical trial generalizability [^113NikGp] [^114PwBRW] [^113XfEs6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis being "by exclusion". I should confirm the shift toward a positive diagnostic strategy. High-quality guidelines recommend a positive diagnosis based on compatible symptoms, careful history and exam, absence of alarm features, and minimal, targeted testing, which accelerates appropriate therapy and reduces unnecessary procedures; in patients under 45 without alarm signs, routine colonoscopy is not recommended, and in those with diarrhea-predominant symptoms, celiac serology and fecal calprotectin (or CRP) are suggested to exclude celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively [^113xgX7a] [^1123Jp9g] [^117QvHb7] [^112XdoBy].

> I need to check the performance characteristics of symptom-based criteria to ensure we are not overpromising. Rome III criteria show modest sensitivity and improved specificity when combined with clinical and laboratory enhancements, and in a randomized primary care cohort, a positive diagnostic strategy was noninferior to exclusion-based approaches while reducing costs and test utilization; importantly, in patients without alarm features, the positive predictive value of Rome-type criteria for IBS is high, supporting a positive diagnosis in typical presentations [^1123Jp9g] [^115htQ4u].

> Next, I should review subtype classification because treatment is phenotype-driven. Let me verify the Rome IV subtyping thresholds using the Bristol Stool Form Scale: IBS-C is > 25% hard stools (types 1–2) with < 25% loose stools (types 6–7), IBS-D is > 25% loose stools with < 25% hard stools, IBS-M is > 25% both hard and loose stools, and IBS-U applies when habits cannot be categorized. Accurate subtype assignment should be based on abnormal stool days off therapies that alter bowel pattern, ideally using 2-week diaries for precision [^113Eg7nD] [^114vkBZD].

> I will now examine pathophysiology to align treatments with mechanisms. IBS reflects dysregulated brain–gut interactions with contributions from visceral hypersensitivity, altered motility, low-grade immune activation and barrier dysfunction, microbiome alterations, and central processing differences; post-infectious IBS and bile acid malabsorption are clinically relevant subsets, and recognizing these mechanisms supports targeted choices such as neuromodulators, antibiotics in selected cases, and microbiome-directed strategies where appropriate [^115ZmPFx] [^112M21Uj] [^117Tft8s].

> Let me think about first-line management and start with diet, since that is often foundational. I should confirm that a limited, structured low-FODMAP diet is recommended by major guidelines and expert updates; it is implemented in three phases with dietitian support, and soluble fiber (for example, psyllium) has supportive evidence for global symptom improvement, whereas insoluble fiber may worsen symptoms in some patients; I need to ensure we screen for disordered eating before prescribing restrictive diets and set time-limited trials with exit criteria if ineffective [^117RztFg] [^117QUSp1] [^116VkHsn].

> But wait, what if diet alone is insufficient? I should review pharmacologic options by subtype. For IBS-C, guanylate cyclase-C agonists (linaclotide, plecanatide) and the chloride channel activator lubiprostone are recommended. For IBS-D, rifaximin has repeatable benefit and is guideline-endorsed, with eluxadoline as an option where available and alosetron reserved for severe, refractory cases due to safety constraints. For pain-predominant symptoms, low-dose tricyclic antidepressants and neuromodulators can be effective, and antispasmodics may help episodically. I should double-check that recommendations are aligned with AGA and ACG guidance and note the high placebo response in trials when counseling on expectations [^113XfEs6] [^114PwBRW] [^117RztFg] [^113jP2YM].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of brain–gut behavioral therapies because they are often underused. CBT and gut-directed hypnotherapy have robust evidence and are recommended across guidelines; a recent network meta-analysis shows several behavioral modalities outperform waitlist controls, though risk of bias and publication bias temper certainty, reinforcing the need for access and proper referral pathways in routine care [^117RztFg] [^115XKvAp] [^113FRmND].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated probiotics. I initially thought guidelines broadly endorsed them, but I should correct that. The AGA advises that evidence is insufficient to recommend routine probiotic use in IBS outside of trials, whereas BSG suggests considering a 12-week trial with discontinuation if no benefit, and CAG allows consideration; given heterogeneity of strains and modest effect sizes, shared decision-making and time-limited trials are prudent, and I need to emphasize that any benefit is likely modest and strain-specific [^111Jewiz] [^113qRUK6] [^113Z16oo].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In patients with IBD in biochemical remission, IBS-like symptoms are common and should be distinguished from active inflammation using objective markers; in older adults or those with alarm features, colonoscopy is appropriate to exclude structural disease; in refractory or atypical cases, I need to reconsider the diagnosis and consider targeted testing such as anorectal physiology for pelvic floor dysfunction or bile acid testing when diarrhea persists despite standard therapy [^111kVHoR] [^112suvfd] [^113MgNPi] [^117QvHb7].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic and therapeutic flow to ensure internal consistency. Start with a careful history focused on pain–bowel habit coupling, chronicity, and impact. Apply Rome IV criteria pragmatically while acknowledging Rome III captures more cases for epidemiology. Exclude alarm features. Perform minimal testing tailored to phenotype (celiac serology and fecal calprotectin/CRP for diarrhea). Classify subtype using stool form on abnormal days. Educate about IBS as a brain–gut disorder. Initiate diet and soluble fiber. Layer pharmacotherapy by subtype and most bothersome symptom. Integrate brain–gut behavioral therapy. Reassess at defined intervals, escalating or reconsidering the diagnosis if refractory, which aligns with ACG, AGA, and BSG guidance [^113xgX7a] [^117QvHb7] [^112XdoBy].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit. IBS is positively diagnosed using symptom-based criteria plus limited testing rather than by exhaustive exclusion. Rome IV's stricter pain frequency lowers prevalence but improves specificity. Accurate subtype classification guides targeted therapy. Management is multimodal, prioritizing diet, phenotype-directed pharmacotherapy, and brain–gut behavioral therapies. And ongoing re-evaluation for refractory disease or red flags maintains diagnostic vigilance while avoiding unnecessary procedures [^1123Jp9g] [^113NikGp] [^113Eg7nD] [^117RztFg].

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a **chronic disorder of gut–brain interaction** [^115DgFY5] characterized by recurrent abdominal pain with altered bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or mixed) and bloating, without structural disease [^115DgFY5]. Diagnosis is **symptom-based** [^113xgX7a] using Rome IV criteria [^114xtCxg], with minimal testing to exclude alarm features [^117QvHb7]. Management is individualized: start with diet (low FODMAP, soluble fiber) [^117QUSp1] [^116VkHsn], then add pharmacotherapy by subtype (rifaximin for IBS-D [^117RztFg]; linaclotide/plecanatide for IBS-C [^117RztFg]), and consider psychological therapies (CBT, gut-directed hypnotherapy) [^115XKvAp] for refractory symptoms. Probiotics may help some patients [^113qRUK6], but evidence is mixed [^111Jewiz]. IBS is common (≈4–10% globally) [^113NikGp] and impacts quality of life [^11391cZQ]; a positive diagnostic approach improves care and reduces unnecessary testing [^1123Jp9g].

---

## Clinical features and subtypes

IBS presents with **recurrent abdominal pain** associated with altered bowel habits and bloating [^115DgFY5]; subtypes are defined by stool form: IBS-D (diarrhea), IBS-C (constipation), IBS-M (mixed), and IBS-U (unclassified) [^113Eg7nD].

---

## Pathophysiology

IBS reflects **multifactorial mechanisms**, including abnormal gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, altered gut microbiota, low-grade inflammation, and dysregulation of the brain–gut axis [^115ZmPFx] [^112M21Uj].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and approach

Diagnosis is **symptom-based** per Rome IV: recurrent abdominal pain ≥ 1 day/week in the last 3 months, with ≥ 2 of pain related to defecation, change in stool frequency, or change in stool form; symptoms ≥ 6 months [^114xtCxg]. A positive diagnostic strategy — history, exam, and limited testing — is preferred over exclusion [^113xgX7a] [^1123Jp9g]; test for celiac disease in diarrhea-predominant cases [^117QvHb7] and use fecal calprotectin/CRP to exclude IBD when indicated [^117QvHb7].

---

## Management strategies

### Dietary modifications

- **Low FODMAP diet**: effective for global symptoms and bloating; use with dietitian guidance [^117QUSp1] [^115j8fCT].
- **Soluble fiber**: psyllium improves global symptoms and pain [^116VkHsn].
- **Gluten-free diet**: consider only if celiac disease is confirmed [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological treatments

| **Subtype** | **First-line pharmacotherapy** | **Second-line pharmacotherapy** |
|-|-|-|
| IBS-D | Rifaximin [^117RztFg] | - Eluxadoline <br/> - Loperamide [^notfound] |
| IBS-C | - Linaclotide <br/> - Plecanatide [^117RztFg] | - Polyethylene glycol <br/> - Lubiprostone |
| IBS-M | - Rifaximin <br/> - Linaclotide (based on predominant symptoms) | - Antispasmodics <br/> - TCAs [^116NQEXy] |

---

### Psychological therapies

CBT and gut-directed hypnotherapy reduce symptoms and improve quality of life; consider for refractory cases or with significant psychosocial comorbidity [^115XKvAp] [^111sRRnD].

---

### Probiotics

Probiotics may improve global symptoms and pain in some patients; evidence is mixed, so trial and discontinuation is reasonable [^113qRUK6] [^111Jewiz].

---

## Impact on quality of life and healthcare utilization

IBS significantly impairs quality of life [^117RztFg] and increases healthcare use and costs; a positive diagnostic approach reduces unnecessary testing and improves care [^1123Jp9g].

---

## Recent advances and emerging therapies

- **Microbiome-targeted therapies**: under investigation; no definitive clinical role yet [^111Jewiz].
- **Digital therapeutics**: CBT-based apps show promise for symptom control [^115XKvAp].
- **Personalized medicine**: biomarker-driven strategies are being explored [^114QVSAr].

---

IBS is a common, chronic disorder of gut–brain interaction; a positive, symptom-based diagnosis with individualized, stepwise management — diet, pharmacotherapy by subtype, and psychological therapies — achieves the best outcomes [^115YXMbN].

### Validation of symptom-based diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome: a critical review [^1175GsgW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

This article reviews the evidence for validity of symptom-based criteria (Manning, Rome I, Rome II, and Rome III) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Two kinds of validations are reported: (i) studies testing whether symptom criteria discriminate patients with structural disease at colonoscopy from patients without structural disease; and (ii) studies testing whether symptom criteria discriminate patients presumed to have IBS by positive diagnosis from healthy subjects or patients with other functional and structural disorders. The first study type addresses an important clinical management question but cannot provide meaningful information on the sensitivity or positive predictive value because IBS is defined only by exclusion of structural disease. Specificity is modest (about 0.7) but can be improved to 0.9 by the addition of red flag signs and symptoms. The second type of study judges validity by whether the symptom criteria consistently perform as predicted by theory. Here, factor analysis confirms consistent clusters of symptoms corresponding to IBS; symptom-based criteria agree reasonably well (sensitivity, 0.4–0.9) with clinical diagnoses made by experienced clinicians; and patients with a clinical diagnosis of IBS who fulfill Rome II criteria have greater symptom severity and poorer quality of life than patients with a clinical diagnosis of IBS who do not fulfill Rome criteria. There are no consistent differences in sensitivity or specificity between Manning, Rome I, and Rome II. Both study types support the validity of symptom-based IBS criteria. Tests of Rome III are needed.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: new and emerging treatments [^114hQr3D]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders in developed nations. It is characterized by abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and bloating. Several non-pharmacological and pharmacological agents, which target the peripheral gastrointestinal system and central nervous system, are used to treat the syndrome. The individual and societal impact of investigating and managing the syndrome is substantial, and despite newer treatments, many patients have unmet needs. Intense research at many international sites has improved the understanding of pathophysiology of the syndrome, but developing treatments that are effective, safe, and that have tolerable side effects remains a challenge. This review briefly summarizes the currently available treatments for irritable bowel syndrome then focuses on newer non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies and recent evidence for older treatments. Recent guidelines on the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are also discussed.

### Information-and health-care seeking behaviors in patients with irritable bowel syndrome [^111sEmTi]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common and clinically heterogeneous gastrointestinal disorder that can be divided into 4 subtypes: IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS with mixed bowel habits, and unclassified IBS. IBS decreases quality of life 1 and imposes a substantial economic burden on the healthcare system. 2 To develop efficient approaches to address the individual needs of IBS patients while minimizing healthcare resource overutilization, it is important to identify the factors that drive patients to seek care, to clarify the burden associated with distinct IBS subtypes, and to be aware of the resources from which IBS patients seek health-related information. We aimed to compare healthcare and information seeking between individuals with IBS-C and IBS-D.

### New insights into irritable bowel syndrome: from pathophysiology to treatment [^1159mGsg]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

IBS is a very common disease. However, its pathophysiology is still not fully understood. Usually, treatment for IBS is based on the predominant symptoms, with many options for each subtype. FMT is a promising new option for patients with IBS and seems to have a beneficial effect. However, treating the pathophysiological causative agent responsible for the symptoms is an emerging approach. Hence, before choosing the appropriate therapeutic option for treating IBS, clinical judgement on its pathophysiology should be made.

### The efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review [^115GrZbV]. Gut (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Probiotics may benefit irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conflicting; therefore a systematic review was conducted.

Methods

MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), EMBASE (1988 to May 2008) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2008) electronic databases were searched, as were abstracts from DDW (Digestive Diseases Week) and UEGW (United European Gastroenterology Week), and authors were contacted for extra information. Only parallel group RCTs with at least 1 week of treatment comparing probiotics with placebo or no treatment in adults with IBS according to any acceptable definition were included. Studies had to provide improvement in abdominal pain or global IBS symptoms as an outcome. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Data were synthesised using relative risk (RR) of symptoms not improving for dichotomous data and standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data using random effects models.

Results

19 RCTs (18 papers) in 1650 patients with IBS were identified. Trial quality was generally good, with nine reporting adequate methods of randomisation and six a method of concealment of allocation. There were 10 RCTs involving 918 patients providing outcomes as a dichotomous variable. Probiotics were statistically significantly better than placebo (RR of IBS not improving = 0.71; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88) with a number needed to treat (NNT) = 4 (95% CI 3 to 12.5). There was significant heterogeneity (chi(2) = 28.3, p = 0.001, I(2) = 68%) and possible funnel plot asymmetry. Fifteen trials assessing 1351 patients reported on improvement in IBS score as a continuous outcome (SMD = -0.34; 95% CI -0.60 to -0.07). There was statistically significant heterogeneity (chi(2) = 67.04, p < 0.001, I(2) = 79%), but this was explained by one outlying trial.

Conclusion

Probiotics appear to be efficacious in IBS, but the magnitude of benefit and the most effective species and strain are uncertain.

### Efficacy of behavioural therapies for irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115XKvAp]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) management guidelines recommend that behavioural therapies, particularly brain-gut behaviour therapies, should be considered as a treatment. Some, such as IBS-specific cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or gut-directed hypnotherapy, have specific techniques and, therefore, are in their own class of brain-gut behaviour therapy, while others, such as stress management or relaxation training, are common or universal techniques that are present in most classes of brain-gut behaviour therapy. In addition, there are other behavioural therapies or treatment options, including digital therapies, which are not classed as brain-gut behaviour therapies. We aimed to evaluate relative efficacy of the available behavioural therapies in IBS.

Methods

For this systematic review and network meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMBASE Classic, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to April 23, 2025, to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of behavioural therapies for adults with IBS with each other, or a control intervention. We judged efficacy using dichotomous assessments of improvement in global IBS symptoms. We pooled data with a random effects model, with efficacy of each intervention reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs. We ranked behavioural therapies according to their P score, which is the mean extent of certainty that one treatment is better than another, averaged over all competing behavioural therapies.

Findings

We identified 67 eligible RCTs, comprising 7441 participants. After completion of treatment, and compared with waiting list control, behavioural therapies with the largest numbers of trials, and patients recruited, that showed efficacy were: minimal contact CBT (RR for global IBS symptoms not improving at first point of follow-up post-treatment 0·55 [95% CI 0·39–0·76], P score 0·78; two RCTs, 511 patients), telephone disease self-management (0·57 [0·41–0·80], P score 0·75; two trials, 746 patients), dynamic psychotherapy (0·59 [0·43–0·80], P score 0·72; three RCTs, 303 patients), CBT (0·65 [0·53–0·80], P score 0·64; nine trials, 1150 patients), disease self-management (0·68 [0·50–0·92], P score 0·58; three RCTs, 375 patients), internet-based minimal contact CBT (0·77 [0·61–0·96], P score 0·43; five RCTs, 705 patients), and gut-directed hypnotherapy (0·79 [0·66–0·95], P score 0·39; 12 trials, 1507 patients). After completion of treatment, among trials recruiting only patients with refractory symptoms, telephone disease self-management and contingency management were both superior to attention placebo control (0·52 [0·28–0·94] and 0·50 [0·26–0·96], respectively) and routine care (0·46 [0·31–0·69] and 0·45 [0·24–0·85], respectively), and group CBT (0·50 [0·29–0·86]), internet-based minimal contact disease self-management (0·58 [0·40–0·86]), and dynamic psychotherapy (0·61 [0·44–0·86]) were all superior to routine care. Analyses for global IBS symptoms at first point of follow-up post-treatment, and for global IBS symptoms at first point of follow-up post-treatment when behavioural therapies were studied according to treatment class, showed evidence of publication bias when compared with waiting list control. The Cochrane risk of bias tool indicated that no RCT was at low risk of bias across all domains.

Interpretation

Several behavioural therapies are efficacious for global symptoms in IBS, although the most evidence exists for those classed as brain-gut behaviour therapies. However, certainty in the evidence for all direct and indirect comparisons across the network were rated as either low or very low confidence, due in part to publication bias and the risk of bias of the included trials.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^117RztFg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent, chronic disorder that significantly reduces patients' quality of life. Advances in diagnostic testing and in therapeutic options for patients with IBS led to the development of this first-ever American College of Gastroenterology clinical guideline for the management of IBS using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Twenty-five clinically important questions were assessed after a comprehensive literature search; 9 questions focused on diagnostic testing; 16 questions focused on therapeutic options. Consensus was obtained using a modified Delphi approach, and based on GRADE methodology, we endorse the following: We suggest that a positive diagnostic strategy as compared to a diagnostic strategy of exclusion be used to improve time to initiating appropriate therapy. We suggest that serologic testing be performed to rule out celiac disease in patients with IBS and diarrhea symptoms. We suggest that fecal calprotectin be checked in patients with suspected IBS and diarrhea symptoms to rule out inflammatory bowel disease. We recommend a limited trial of a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disacchardies, monosaccharides, polyols (FODMAP) diet in patients with IBS to improve global symptoms. We recommend the use of chloride channel activators and guanylate cyclase activators to treat global IBS with constipation symptoms. We recommend the use of rifaximin to treat global IBS with diarrhea symptoms. We suggest that gut-directed psychotherapy be used to treat global IBS symptoms. Additional statements and information regarding diagnostic strategies, specific drugs, doses, and duration of therapy can be found in the guideline.

### Genetics of irritable bowel syndrome [^116RLUCT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common diagnoses made by gastroenterologists and primary care providers alike, and yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Family and twin studies suggest that IBS may have a genetic basis. Several candidate gene association studies have been performed, but thus far, they have failed to clearly identify an "IBS gene". Epidemiological studies are needed to facilitate phenotype definition and identify relevant environment risk factors that will need to factor in gene and environment interactions in all future genetic studies. As genetic research in IBS is relatively nascent, much opportunity, as well as many challenges, exists in identifying the genes responsible for IBS.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^11391cZQ]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Epidemiology and burden of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) — worldwide prevalence among adults is between 4.1% (Rome IV criteria) and 10.1% (Rome III criteria). IBS affects people regardless of race, age, or sex, but it is most common in women and younger individuals and is associated with decreased quality of life and high economic costs. The impact on daily functioning includes absenteeism with an average of 13.4 days of work or school per year compared with 4.9 days for those without IBS and presenteeism with 87% reporting reduced productivity at work in the past week resulting in nearly 14 hours per week of lost productivity.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of irritable bowel syndrome [^114o5hXB]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for irritable bowel syndrome, more specifically with respect to general counseling, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to educate patients about the diagnosis of IBS, its underlying pathophysiology and the natural history of the condition, including common symptom triggers. Introduce the concept of IBS as a disorder of gut-brain interaction, together with a simple account of the gut-brain axis and how this is impacted by diet, stress, cognitive, behavioral and emotional responses to symptoms, and postinfectious changes.

### Diagnosis and management of IBS [^115PVfkn]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

IBS is a common gastrointestinal condition characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. IBS is considered a functional bowel disorder (that is, not defined by structural or biochemical abnormalities) and is diagnosed using symptom-based criteria. Limited and judicious use of diagnostic testing is recommended, particularly in patients with typical symptoms of IBS without alarm signs and symptoms. Management of IBS is based on a multifactorial approach and includes establishment of an effective patient-provider relationship, education, reassurance, dietary alterations, pharmacotherapy, behavioral and psychological treatment. Patient-centered care is recommended, in which management is focused on the patient's most bothersome and impactful symptoms, their preferences and previous experiences with treatment, and addressing factors associated with the onset and exacerbation of symptoms. Pharmacotherapy is typically targeted against the predominant symptom. This Review discusses the current evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of IBS. An improved understanding of the recommended diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for IBS will lead to greater patient satisfaction, as well as reduced health-care costs.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^115DgFY5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) — definition, core symptoms, and epidemiology are summarized as follows: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, often debilitating, and highly prevalent disorder of gut-brain interaction (previously called functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders). In clinical practice, IBS is characterized by symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain and disordered defecation. Although bloating is a commonly reported symptom, its presence is not mandatory to accurately diagnose IBS. IBS is a common source of referrals to gastroenterologists with a prevalence of approximately 4.4%–4.8% in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada and affects most commonly women and individuals younger than 50 years.

### Pain in irritable bowel syndrome: does anything really help? [^116j2dH4]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

Pain relief remains a significant challenge in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): "Does anything really help relieve the pain in patients with IBS?". Interventions aimed at pain relief in patients with IBS include diet, probiotics or antibiotics, antidepressants, antispasmodics, and drugs targeting specific gastrointestinal receptors such as opioid or histamine receptors. In the systematic review and meta-analysis published in this journal, Lambarth et al. examined the literature on the role of oral and parenteral anti-neuropathic agents in the management of pain in patients with IBS. This review article appraises their assessment of the efficacy of the anti-neuropathic agents amitriptyline, pregabalin, gabapentin, and duloxetine in the relief of abdominal pain or discomfort, and impact on overall IBS severity and quality of life. This commentary provides an update of current evidence on the efficacy of the dietary and pharmacological treatments that are available or in development, as well psychological and cognitive behavioral therapy for pain in IBS. Advances in recent years augur well for efficacious treatments that may expand the therapeutic arsenal for pain in IBS.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea [^113GeHAj]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome outcomes and endpoints — evidence gaps are noted for IBS-mixed type and abdominal pain–targeted therapies: An FDA-approved IBS patient-reported outcome for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) was completed recently, and the FDA recommended enrollment criteria and interim primary end points for IBS-C but not IBS-mixed type; there continues to be a lack of studies focusing on IBS-mixed type and no consensus on the optimal primary end point for this subgroup; for therapeutic agents that target abdominal pain relief without significant effects on bowel habits, there is no established consensus on the inclusion and exclusion criteria regarding bowel symptoms and treatment that normalizes bowel habits without an effect on abdominal pain (eg, antidiarrheals and laxatives).

### Microbial influences on irritable bowel syndrome [^117Tft8s]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Since the description of postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a role for gut microbes in the pathogenesis of IBS has been proposed. Molecular microbiological tools have now been applied to IBS, though data are largely derived from fecal samples with attendant limitations. Metagenomics, metabolomics, and other 'omics facilitate a comprehensive picture of the microbiome and its metabolic activity. Has a microbial signature characteristic of IBS been identified? The answer is no; this should not be a surprise given the heterogeneity of the phenotype and each individual's microbiome profile.

### Intestinal permeability and irritable bowel syndrome [^1128Vzrr]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2007). Low credibility.

Based on a systematic PubMed search, this short review addresses why intestinal permeability may be important in the pathobiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the evidence of abnormal permeability in patients with IBS, and the pros and cons of the different probe molecules available to assess intestinal permeability. While a subgroup of patients with IBS appears to have evidence of increased intestinal permeability, improvements in the methods and validation are key to further research in this field in order to better understand intestinal barrier functions in IBS.

### Diagnostic criteria in IBS: useful or not? [^116yxUU6]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

There are a number of reasons to establish the accurate diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): to relieve patient uncertainty; to avoid adverse effects of unnecessary medications or treatments; to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures and surgeries; to conserve limited healthcare resources; and, of course, to initiate the most appropriate treatment. However, making the diagnosis of IBS remains difficult because it is clinically heterogeneous, no biological marker to detect it exists, many other diseases share the same clinical manifestations and it is often difficult for both physicians and patients to accept the uncertainty of a symptom-based diagnosis. Different diagnostic criteria have been developed during the last 4decades but none have proved to be an ideal method of accurately diagnosing IBS. Just as importantly, physicians are frequently unaware of published guidelines or consciously ignore these diagnostic criteria. Most clinicians still believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion and not a positive diagnosis based on history, physical examination, use of published diagnostic criteria such as the Rome III criteria, and the absence of alarm features. In the sections to follow we will address the inherent difficulties of diagnosing IBS, highlight the importance of symptom-based diagnoses to help reign in soaring healthcare costs, and discuss future strategies that may enable a more cost-efficient diagnosis of IBS.

### The relationship between irritable bowel syndrome and metabolic syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 49, 662 individuals [^113UoFGN]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects approximately 9%–23% of the world population and accounts for 12% of primary care visits. The precise pathogenesis of this condition is still not fully understood; Numerous mechanisms have been proposed, including dysmotility, heightened visceral sensation, disrupted brain‐gut interaction, and psychosocial distress. Due to its high prevalence, significant impact on the quality of life, and lack of curative therapy, irritable bowel syndrome has the capacity to exert substantial economic strain on the healthcare system.

The metabolic syndrome is a complex of interrelated risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. These factors include dysglycemia, raised blood pressure, elevated triglyceride levels, low high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and obesity (particularly central adiposity). Remarkably, metabolic syndrome has emerged as a global epidemic, with prevalence rates reaching as high as 40% in certain regions Substantial evidence indicates that dietary factors play a pivotal role in preventing and treating metabolic syndrome.

IBS can influence dietary patterns, food digestion, and nutrient absorption, all of which are crucial factors in preventing and treating metabolic syndrome (MS) and its individual components. As a result, there is speculation that IBS might represent a potential risk factor for the development of MS. Nevertheless, no study has actually explored this association between IBS status and MS, as well as its components, in adult populations. This study aimed to determine whether IBS, as well as its subtypes, is associated with metabolic syndrome and/or its individual components.

### Pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome [^112M21Uj]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on irritable bowel syndrome:

- Definition: IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea or both), often with associated bloating.
- Pathophysiology: The etiology of IBS is poorly understood. Potential etiological mechanisms include genetic factors (most notably an identified mutation of SCN5A); post-infectious changes, chronic infections and disturbances in the intestinal microbiota; low-grade mucosal inflammation, immune activation, and altered intestinal permeability; disordered bile salt metabolism (in 10–20% of patients with diarrhea); abnormalities in serotonin metabolism; and alterations in brain function.
- Epidemiology: In the US, the incidence of IBS is estimated at 196 cases per 100,000 person-years, with an estimated prevalence of 5–12% based on Rome II criteria.
- Disease course: Key clinical manifestations include abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: There is no evidence that IBS is associated with an increased risk of mortality. However, patients with IBS exhibit a poorer QoL and utilize the healthcare system to a greater degree than patients without the diagnosis.

### Editorial: clinical implications of diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome: Do all roads need to lead to Rome? [^112BHEm1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common diagnoses made by healthcare providers. Yet the majority of patients with IBS are undiagnosed. The study by Sayuk et al. allows insight into the characteristics of different patient groups, e.g., with and without a formal diagnosis of diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D). We discuss the questions raised by this study regarding the importance of making a confident diagnosis, conveying it to patients and their implications for clinical practice.

### Subgroups of irritable bowel syndrome: a new approach [^111AWnf8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The newly revised Rome criteria for the definition of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), derived from the consensus of experts in the field, were developed in order to identify subgroups of IBS patients for research. The criteria have, to our knowledge, never been validated. Both when trying to include IBS patients in studies and in clinical practice we found it difficult to apply the Rome 2 supportive criteria.

Aim

To study the variation of stool consistency and defecatory symptoms in IBS patients prospectively with diary cards and to validate the Rome 2 supportive criteria.

Methods

Sixty IBS patients, included by interview according to the Rome 1 criteria, recorded their bowel symptoms on diary cards over 40 days. Four subgroups were found, characterised by loose-stool-predominant, hard-stool-predominant, alternating stool consistency, and loose stools only. Urgency, straining and feeling of incomplete evacuation occurred in all but seven individuals, irrespective of subgroup.

Results

The Rome 2 criteria could subclassify seven patients into diarrhoea-predominant IBS based on stool consistency and absence of straining and could subclassify no patients into constipation-predominant IBS, as urge was present in nearly all patients. Fifty-three patients could not be classified according to the Rome 2 criteria, as they had defecatory symptoms of all kinds.

Conclusion

As the Rome 2 supportive criteria use the presence or absence of specific defecatory symptoms as an instrument for categorising IBS patients into diarrhoea- and constipation-predominant subgroups, these criteria could not be used for the majority of IBS patients in this study and should be reconsidered.

### Common misconceptions and controversies in the management of irritable bowel syndrome [^1178GNFp]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Despite an increase in our understanding of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), in the context of abnormal gut-brain axis communication, and advances in both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of the disorder, there remain areas in which there are misconceptions and controversies in the clinical management of IBS. This Perspective aims to highlight some of the most common misconceptions and controversies in IBS management, including those that the scientific literature has resolved, but for which further education of clinicians dealing with patients with IBS might be required to implement the findings from medical research. Areas of remaining contention are also discussed, as are suggestions as to how these issues could be addressed, both by advances in clinical practice and by further research.

### The intestinal microbiota and irritable bowel syndrome [^111n859S]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent and the best studied functional gastrointestinal disorder. The etiology and the pathogenesis of IBS are still not clear; however, recent studies have implicated a role for alterations in the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) in the pathophysiology of the disorder. Epidemiological observations have demonstrated that the development of IBS symptoms is often preceded by a disruption of the individual's normal intestinal microbiota, and microbiological studies have demonstrated compositional differences in the intestinal microbiota between patients with IBS patients and healthy controls. In addition, animal studies and a few recent human clinical studies have demonstrated that compositional changes in the intestinal microbiota in IBS are associated with relevant abnormal gastrointestinal and brain-gut axis functions that are often observed in patients with IBS. This article discusses points of interest from the current research on the microbiota-gut-brain interactions in IBS and highlights the relevance of the emerging data to our understanding of the disorder and the clinical implications for patients' care.

### Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome… [^115aSody]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Increasing dietary fiber has long been recommended as a treatment for IBS. The proposed mechanism of action is the enhancement of the stool's water-holding properties, gel formation to provide lubrication, bulking of the stool, and binding of agents such as bile. 7 A systematic review 8 of 13 randomized controlled trials found no convincing evidence that bulking agents relieve global symptoms of IBS. However, a second systematic review 9 did find significant improvement in the ease of stool passage and in general satisfaction with bowel movements. These studies showed that tricyclic antidepressants improve global symptoms, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. On average, for every three patients treated with a tricyclic antidepressant, one experiences a significant benefit. 16 Side effects may cause patients to discontinue use, particularly because tricyclic antidepressants may worsen constipation.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are being examined for the treatment of IBS. The evidence is limited, but one RCT. 17 found that patients taking 10 to 40 mg of paroxetine per day were more likely than those taking placebo to have a clinically significant improvement in overall well-being. This benefit also was present in the subset without depression. Given the limited evidence, SSRIs are not recommended as routine or first-line therapy for IBS except in patients who also have comorbid depression. Although anxiolytics may be beneficial in patients with comorbid anxiety disorders, they are not recommended routinely for treatment of IBS because of adverse effects, dependence potential, and interactions with alcohol and other medications.
18. 3) reduces noxious stimuli perception, increases colonic compliance, and decreases gastrocolonic reflexes.

Alosetron, the first IBS-specific medication approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, is a highly selective central penetrating 5-HT 3 antagonist. Alosetron did show a clinically significant, although modest, gain over placebo in alleviating IBS symptoms such as bloating and pain. Approach to the Patient Given the variability of IBS, the most successful treatment will be comprehensive, involving multiple strategies. 3 antagonist. In pain-predominant IBS, use an antispasmodic; a tricyclic antidepressant; and, if severe with diarrhea, consider a serotonin 5-HT 3 agonist.

### Therapeutic advances in functional gastrointestinal disease: irritable bowel syndrome [^112rFyA2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Reported prevalence rates of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are between 8% to 20% in the US general population with an average medical expenditure of US$1.35 billion direct and US$205 million indirect costs. Current pathophysiologic theories are based on abnormalities of both the brain and gut, thus setting a new stage for current and future therapeutic approaches. There are numerous treatment options in IBS acting centrally and peripherally by influencing motility and visceral sensitivity. Clinical evidence is variable; however, newer emerging treatments are being evaluated using better-designed clinical trials. Accurate assessment of IBS drug efficacy is still hampered by heterogeneity of the IBS population. Novel methods such as pharmacogenomics or brain imaging may be helpful in the future to better understand and characterize IBS patient subtypes, and this in turn will lead to more specific and efficient therapeutic options. Patient subpopulation measurement of side effects is also a clinical challenge and further understanding could improve treatment efficacy enhancing the patient compliance.

### Effects of probiotic type, dose and treatment duration on irritable bowel syndrome diagnosed by Rome III criteria: a meta-analysis [^111zrvD6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Literature search

We systematically searched the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases up to October 2015 for studies that investigated the efficacy of probiotic therapy in IBS patients. We used the terms "probiotics" and "irritable bowel syndrome" both as medical subject heading (Mesh) and free text terms. The exact search strategy in Medline was ("probiotics"[MeSH Terms] OR "probiotics"[All Fields]) AND ("irritable bowel syndrome"[MeSH Terms] OR "irritable bowel syndrome"[All Fields]). All eligible studies were retrieved, and the bibliographies were manually checked to identify additional potential studies.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were considered eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) the studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared probiotics with placebo; (2) the diagnosis of IBS was made according to the Rome III criteria; (3) the treatment duration was > 7 days; and (4) dichotomous data on the overall syndrome response to the therapy or continuous score data on the effect on individual IBS symptoms or quality of life (QoL) could be extracted or obtained from the authors. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies with only an abstract; (2) studies in which probiotics were mixed with other drugs; (3) studies in which data were still unavailable after contacting the authors; and (4) studies in which the control group received probiotics.

Data extraction

Two authors independently extracted the data from each of the eligible articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data included the first author, publication year, country, criteria used to diagnose IBS, dose of probiotic, treatment duration and follow-up time, number of patients, mean after-treatment scores along with the standard deviation (s.d.) of individual IBS symptoms (abdominal pain and bloating), and QoL. All data were extracted for intention to treat (ITT) analysis, whereby all dropouts were assumed to be treatment failures. Only the data associated with the longest duration of therapy and largest dose were used to compare the efficacy between probiotic types.

Assessment of risk of bias

Two authors independently performed the assessment of bias risk, with disagreements resolved by discussion. The risk of bias was assessed as described in the Cochrane handbook by recording the method used to generate the randomization schedule and the method used for allocation concealment, whether blinding was implemented, the completeness of follow-up, whether there was evidence of selective reporting of outcomes, and other biases.

### FDA and EMA end points: which outcome end points should we use in clinical trials in patients with irritable bowel syndrome? [^116boMkK]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Trial design and endpoints for the evaluation of drug efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) underwent major changes over the last two decades. A systematic review in the early 1990s concluded that there were few well-designed and well-executed treatment trials in IBS. Over the next decade, the so-called binary endpoints were used in several clinical trials in IBS in the US, Europe and other parts of the world. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a general guidance for the evaluation of symptom benefit in clinical trials based on patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, which had a major impact on trial design in IBS. In May 2012, the FDA recommended to use as provisional endpoint the quantification of two major IBS aspects, abdominal pain and disordered defecation, to assess the efficacy of pharmacological treatments in IBS. In the present issue of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, the performance of the FDA Responder Endpoint for clinical trials in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation was evaluated using data from two large Phase III clinical trials of linaclotide. The FDA interim endpoints are clinically relevant as they are also able to capture the smallest patient-reported difference in the domain of Abdominal Pain intensity and Abnormal Defecation with good diagnostic accuracy. The FDA responder definition and the European Medicines Agency responder definitions generate similar response rates, while binary endpoints generate higher responder rates. The implications for optimalization and harmonisation are discussed.

### Epidemiology of IBS [^114HC56k]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder. Because not everyone needs to seek care, population-based studies are needed to truly understand the epidemiology of IBS. About 10% of the population has IBS at any one time and about 200 people per 100,000 will receive an initial diagnosis of IBS over the course of a year. IBS patients are more frequently younger in age, and a female predominance has been observed in Western countries and tertiary care settings. IBS patients commonly report overlapping upper GI, as well as a variety of non-GI, complaints.

### All in my head or all in my gut? An update on irritable bowel syndrome [^115Z9a6y]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has a considerable impact on patients and healthcare systems. IBS is a disorder of brain-gut interaction with numerous biopsychosocial factors involved, including early life experiences, previous gastrointestinal infections, and coexisting mood disorders. An understanding of the role of the gut-brain axis in symptom generation is vital to enable delivery of holistic care.

Recent Findings

We explore psychological mechanisms, such as coexisting anxiety and depression, adverse life experiences, and somatisation and how these impact symptom severity. There is evidence for psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy or gut-directed hypnotherapy, in IBS. We go on to summarise gut-based mechanisms, such as abnormal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, inflammation, and dysbiosis. Efficacious treatments targeting these include antidiarrhoeals, laxatives, antispasmodics, drugs acting on ion channels or serotonin, gut-brain neuromodulators, and treatments targeting the microbiota or inflammation. Finally, we consider emerging evidence from models describing distinct IBS phenotypes and their potential to facilitate a more integrated approach to identify best treatment options.

Summary

For many patients with IBS, both brain and gut mechanisms must be considered within the context of the biopsychosocial model to enable effective delivery of holistic and personalised care.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: food as a friend or foe? [^111UvaK4]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 10% to 15% of the population and often is difficult to treat with available pharmacologic agents. Dietary therapies for IBS are of particular interest because up to 90% of IBS patients exclude certain foods to improve their gastrointestinal symptoms. Among the available dietary interventions for IBS, the low FODMAP diet has the greatest evidence for efficacy. Although dietary therapies rapidly are becoming first-line treatment of IBS, gastroenterologists need to be aware of the negative effects of prescribing restrictive diets and red flag symptoms of maladaptive eating patterns.

### Gastrointestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome: their role in its pathogenesis and treatment [^114bvJ1D]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, and bloating. It has traditionally been viewed as a disorder of visceral hypersensitivity heavily influenced by stress, and therefore therapeutic strategies to date have largely reflected this. However, more recently, there is good evidence for a role of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in its pathogenesis. Changes in fecal microbiota, the use of probiotics, the phenomenon of postinfectious IBS, and the recognition of an upregulated host immune system response suggest that an interaction between the host and GI microbiota may be important in the pathogenesis of IBS. This article explores the role of the GI microbiota in IBS and how their modification might lead to therapeutic benefit.

Conclusion

Probiotics may have a role in alleviating some of the symptoms of IBS, a condition for which currently evidence of efficacy of drug therapies is weak. Longer term trials are recommended as IBS is a condition that is chronic and usually intermittent. However, further research should focus on the type, optimal dose of probiotics and the subgroups of patients who are likely to benefit the most.

### Making a positive diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [^1141Hg7B]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The traditional diagnostic approach for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is to exclude other gastrointestinal conditions, which has led to patients being subjected to excessive testing. However, the development of consensus guidelines, such as Rome III, has enabled physicians to make a positive diagnosis of IBS based on the pattern and nature of symptoms. It is now possible to employ a more rational diagnostic strategy with a reduced need for laboratory testing based on symptom-based approaches aimed at standardizing IBS patient subgroups. Patient outcomes in IBS can be further improved by careful consideration of several diagnostic issues including differentiating between disorders (IBS is 1 of > 20 functional gastrointestinal disorders), practical aspects of testing, the indications for colonoscopy, and the need to improve the physician-patient relationship and enhance the patient's adherence to treatment.

### New insights into irritable bowel syndrome: from pathophysiology to treatment [^116wB9aP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common reason to visit a gastroenterologist and the second most common reason, after common flu, to be absent from work. It is estimated that around 15% of the general population is affected, with some studies even reporting up to 45%. Usually, women are more commonly affected than men, in a ratio of 2:1, and the peak of the disease often starts in early adulthood. In general, patients are evenly distributed among 3 subtypes (diarrhea-predominant [IBS-D], constipation-predominant [IBS-C], or mixed [IBS-M]) but studies from specific geographical areas such as Europe found fewer patients with IBS-D than in the other 2 categories. Women more commonly suffer from IBS-C and men from IBS-D. It is believed that more than 20 billion dollars per year are spent on IBS treatment in the USA alone.

### AGA clinical practice update on the role of diet in irritable bowel syndrome: expert review [^117QUSp1]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal disorder that can have a substantial impact on quality of life. Most patients with IBS associate their gastrointestinal symptoms with eating food. Mounting evidence supports dietary modifications, such as the low-fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet, as a primary treatment for IBS symptoms. The aim of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to provide best practice advice statements, primarily to clinical gastroenterologists, covering the role of diet in IBS treatment.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA CPU Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPU Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. The best practice advice statements were drawn from reviewing existing literature combined with expert opinion to provide practical advice on the role of diet in treating patients with IBS. Because this was not a systematic review, formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations was not performed. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Dietary advice is ideally prescribed to patients with IBS who have insight into their meal-related gastrointestinal symptoms and are motivated to make the necessary changes. To optimize the quality of teaching and clinical response, referral to a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) should be made to patients who are willing to collaborate with a RDN and patients who are not able to implement beneficial dietary changes on their own. If a gastrointestinal RDN is not available, other resources can assist with implementation of diet interventions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with IBS who are poor candidates for restrictive diet interventions include those consuming few culprit foods, those at risk for malnutrition, those who are food insecure, and those with an eating disorder or uncontrolled psychiatric disorder. Routine screening for disordered eating or eating disorders by careful dietary history is critical because they are common and often overlooked in gastrointestinal conditions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Specific diet interventions should be attempted for a predetermined length of time. If there is no clinical response, the diet intervention should be abandoned for another treatment alternative, for example, a different diet, medication, or other form of therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: In preparation for a visit with a RDN, patients should provide dietary information that will assist in developing an individualized nutrition care plan. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Soluble fiber is efficacious in treating global symptoms of IBS. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: The low-FODMAP diet is currently the most evidence-based diet intervention for IBS. Healthy eating advice as described by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Guidelines, among others, also offers benefit to a subset of patients with IBS. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The low-FODMAP diet consists of the following 3 phases: 1) restriction (lasting no more than 4–6 weeks), 2) reintroduction of FODMAP foods, and 3) personalization based on results from reintroduction. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Although observational studies found that most patients with IBS improve with a gluten-free diet, randomized controlled trials have yielded mixed results. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: There are limited data showing that selected biomarkers can predict response to diet interventions in patients with IBS, but there is insufficient evidence to support their routine use in clinical practice.

### Emerging pharmacological therapies for the irritable bowel syndrome [^113tViYc]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a symptom-based disorder defined by the presence of abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Clinical presentations of IBS are diverse, with some patients reporting diarrhea, some constipation, and others a mixture of both. Like the varied clinical phenotypes, the pathogenesis of IBS is also diverse. IBS is not a single disease entity, but rather likely consists of several different disease states. This fact has important implications for the choices and efficacy of IBS treatment. This article reviews the IBS drugs that have reached phase II or III clinical trials.

### Efficacy of dietary interventions in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115j8fCT]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are often interested in dietary interventions as a means of managing their symptoms. However, the relative efficacy of available diets for the management of IBS is unclear. We aimed to examine the relative efficacy of various dietary interventions in IBS.

Methods

For this systematic review and network meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMBASE Classic, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to Feb 7, 2025, to identify randomised controlled trials comparing an active dietary intervention requiring changes to the intake of more than one food in IBS with either a control intervention, such as a habitual diet, sham diet, a high fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet, or alternative miscellaneous dietary advice, or any other active dietary intervention requiring changes to the intake of more than one food. We assessed efficacy using dichotomous assessments of improvement in global IBS symptoms or improvement in individual IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating or distension, and bowel habit. We pooled data using a random-effects model, with the efficacy of each intervention reported as pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs. We ranked interventions according to their P-score, which measures the mean extent of certainty that one intervention is better than another, averaged over all competing interventions.

Findings

We identified 28 eligible randomised controlled trials (comprising 2338 patients) of 11 different dietary interventions compared with four control interventions, of which six (low FODMAP diet, British Dietetic Association/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [BDA/NICE] diet, lactose-reduced diet, starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet, a personalised diet, and a Mediterranean diet) were studied in more than one trial. For global IBS symptoms, assessed in 28 randomised controlled trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one trial, a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet ranked first (RR of global IBS symptoms not improving 0·41 [95% CI 0·26–0·67]; P-score 0·84; two trials), a low FODMAP diet ranked fourth (0·51 [0·37–0·70]; P-score 0·71; 24 trials), and a BDA/NICE diet ranked tenth (0·62 [0·43–0·90]; P-score 0·44; eight trials), versus a habitual diet. For abdominal pain, assessed in 26 trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one randomised controlled trial, a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet ranked second (RR of abdominal pain not improving 0·54 [95% CI 0·33–0·90]; P-score 0·73; two trials), and a low FODMAP diet ranked fifth (0·61 [0·42–0·89]; P-score 0·64; 23 trials), versus a habitual diet. For abdominal bloating or distension, assessed in 26 trials and when considering only the dietary interventions studied in more than one randomised trial, only a low FODMAP diet (RR of abdominal bloating or distension not improving 0·55 [95% CI 0·37–0·80]; P-score 0·64; 23 trials) was superior to a habitual diet and ranked fourth. For bowel habit, assessed in 23 randomised trials, none of the dietary interventions was superior to any of the control interventions, but a low FODMAP diet was superior to a BDA/NICE diet (RR of bowel habit not improving 0·79 [95% CI 0·63–0·99]). All comparisons across the network were rated as low or very low confidence, except for direct comparisons between a low FODMAP diet or a starch-reduced and sucrose-reduced diet and habitual diet, both of which were rated as moderate confidence.

Interpretation

In terms of dietary interventions for IBS, the most evidence exists for a low FODMAP diet, but other promising therapies are emerging and should be the subject of further study.

Funding

None.

### Diet in the irritable bowel syndrome [^116Fnrrh]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often request dietary recommendations. They must eat, and they want to know what to eat. Present national guidelines recommend dietary treatment with fiber for IBS patients with constipation. Diet recommendations are made based on symptoms. There may be different dietary recommendations for constipation, diarrhea, and pain or bloating. This article reviews the relationship of foods to IBS and issues of food intolerances and hypersensitivities, and recommendations for diet therapy. The role of dietary fiber, both soluble and insoluble, is reviewed. Although there are few studies to substantiate exact diets, broad dietary plans are recommended for the different symptoms of IBS. In addition, the recent literature on probiotics and prebiotics pertinent to IBS is reviewed.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) — positive diagnostic strategy versus diagnosis of exclusion: We recommend a positive diagnostic strategy as compared to a diagnostic strategy of exclusion for patients with symptoms of IBS to improve cost-effectiveness. Strong recommendation; high quality of evidence. A careful clinical history with key symptoms and their duration (> 6 months), plus examination and minimal testing, is described as sufficient to diagnose IBS. Diagnostic performance data note Rome III criteria performed modestly (69.6% sensitivity and 82.0% specificity), and adding clinical and laboratory enhancements increased to 95.9% specificity. In randomized primary care patients believed to have IBS and without alarm signs, 300 were randomized; none of the patients meeting Rome III criteria at baseline were reclassified at 1 year, and a positive diagnostic strategy was determined to be noninferior to a diagnosis of exclusion. Practice and cost observations show more than 70% of community-based providers believed IBS to be a diagnosis of exclusion, and these providers ordered nearly twice the number tests per patient and consumed $400 more per patient than those using a positive diagnostic strategy. In an employer-based claims study among patients with IBS-D, within the first 2 years after diagnosis, nearly 80% of health care costs were associated with a diagnosis of exclusion, whereas only about 20% of patient costs could be related to treatment specifically.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea [^112zPJGC]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) guideline — interpretation of strong versus conditional recommendations using the GRADE approach explains stakeholder implications as follows: For patients, strong recommendations mean "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", whereas conditional recommendations mean "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". For clinicians, strong recommendations indicate "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while conditional recommendations state "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with his or her values and preferences. Use shared decision making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For policy makers, strong recommendations imply "The recommendation can be adapted as policy or performance measure in most situations", whereas conditional recommendations note "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess whether decision making is appropriate". Strong statements are signaled by "we recommend", and conditional statements by "we suggest".

### Irritable bowel syndrome: modern concepts and management options [^114HePgq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder, manifesting as abdominal pain/discomfort and altered bowel function. Despite affecting as many as 20% of adults, a lack of understanding of etiopathogenesis and evaluation strategies results in diagnostic uncertainty, and in turn frustration of both the physician and the patient. This review summarizes the current literature on the diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome, with attention to evidence-based approaches. A 4-step treatment strategy that has been used successfully in our tertiary referral practice is presented and should lead to successful therapeutic outcomes in the majority of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

### Latest insights on the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome [^115ZmPFx]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome is multifactorial and complex. Our understanding of its pathophysiology has evolved, but remains incompletely understood. Symptoms result from a dysregulation of brain-gut interactions. Evidence has identified alterations in central and peripheral (gut) mechanisms in irritable bowel syndrome and the bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut. Pertinent mechanisms include disturbed gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, altered mucosal and immune function, altered gut microbiota, and altered central nervous system processing. This review addresses factors that increase the risk of irritable bowel syndrome and the central and peripheral mechanisms thought to underlie its symptoms.

### Reduction in IBS symptom severity is not paralleled by improvement in quality of life in patients with irritable bowel syndrome [^1151swib]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a brain‐gut disorder characterized by a chronic relapsing‐remitting nature of symptoms, including abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Global prevalence, based predominantly on the Rome III criteria, is estimated at 5%‐20%, 1 with varying rates according to geographical area and diagnostic criteria used. 2 Recent studies using the more restrictive Rome IV criteria point to lower prevalence rates of 5%‐6%. 3, 4

Although the exact pathophysiology of IBS remains incompletely understood, a multifactorial origin is generally recognized, in which dysregulation of the brain‐gut axis has a central role. Other factors include aberrant neuroimmune interactions, visceral hypersensitivity, genetic susceptibility, microbiome alterations, and psychosocial factors. 5, 6 As interference of IBS with patients' everyday lives is extensive 7 and treatment results are often unsatisfactory, quality of life is low and comparable to chronic somatic diseases. 8

Given the heterogeneous nature of the disorder, symptom patterns vary widely both between and within IBS patients and predicting individual disease courses remains challenging. IBS is known as a chronic, in many patients lifelong, condition with fluctuating gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea are known to occur in episodes of several days followed by days without symptoms. 9 In addition, transitions from one predominant bowel habit type to the other are common and occur in up to 75% of patients. 10, 11, 12 Quality of life, on the other hand, has been shown to be relatively stable over a 3‐month period. 13 With regard to long‐term symptom variability, several studies have investigated the disease course of IBS and have shown varying results with respect to symptom severity and quality of life. The majority of the prospective studies had a follow‐up period of approximately 1 year, which is relatively short for a condition such as IBS. In addition, there is a lack of follow‐up data for the Dutch population. As implications of IBS on quality of life have shown to vary considerably between different countries, 14 it is of added value to expand earlier findings and investigate the natural history of IBS in a Dutch, well‐characterized population.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^114vkBZD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — IBS subtype determination: We suggest that categorizing patients based on an accurate IBS subtype improves patient therapy. Consensus recommendation; unable to assess using GRADE methodology. To accurately categorize a patient with IBS by subtype, we recommend the following: Predominant stool consistency can be determined based on the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS). Determine patient's primary stool consistency only on the days s/he reports abnormal bowel movements, make this determination when the patient is off therapy(ies) that could affect bowel pattern, and use daily diaries for 2 weeks for the most accurate assessment. Subtype decisions according to Rome IV are: IBS-C: > 25% of bowel movements associated with BSFS 1 or 2 with BSFS 6 or 7 occurring less than 25%; IBS-D: > 25% of bowel movements associated with BSFS 6 or 7 with less than 25% of bowel movements with BSFS 1 or 2; IBS-M: > 25% of bowel movements associated with BSFS 1 or 2 and > 25% of bowel movements associated with BSFS 6 or 7; and IBS-U: cannot be determined.

### Centrally acting therapies for irritable bowel syndrome [^115Kyync]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders typically defy traditional diagnostic methods based on structural abnormalities, and has led to the emergence of the discipline of neurogastroenterology or the study of the "brain-gut axis", which is based on dysregulation of neuroenteric pathways as a key pathophysiological feature of IBS. Centrally acting treatments can influence these pathways and improve the clinical manifestations of pain and bowel dysfunction associated with this disorder. To successfully implement these treatment strategies, it is important to recognize their dual effects on brain and gut, understanding the nature and severity of the GI symptoms and their psychosocial concomitants, and applying them within the context of the patient's understanding of their value.

### Treating irritable bowel syndrome through an interdisciplinary approach [^115i2XFF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is described as a chronic functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder because of the lack of underlying damage and the absence of structural changes on endoscopic examination. Symptomatic characteristics form the basic diagnostic criteria, primarily abdominal pain associated with defecation, changes in the frequency and/or rhythm of bowel movements, and changes in stool consistency. According to the predominant stool pattern, 4 different IBS subtypes can be distinguished: diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), constipation-predominant (IBS-C), mixed typed (IBS-M), or unclassified (IBS-U) when stool abnormalities are present, but insufficient to meet the criteria of other IBS subtypes. IBS does not cause lifethreatening complications, but reduces the quality of life significantly, impairing daily functioning and contributing to high work absenteeism, hospitality and physician visit rates. Management of heavy IBS also imposes a financial burden. Nowadays, IBS is considered as one of the most common medical disorders encountered by all healthcare providers and its prevalence in developed countries reaches as much as 20% of the population. Therefore, a significant challenge currently faced by physicians is to introduce an appropriate treatment, which has often been ineffective so far.

### Prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome based on Rome IV criteria in patients in biochemical and endoscopic remission from newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease: one-and three-year results (the IBSEN III cohort) [^111kVHoR]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common disorders of the gut-brain interaction, affecting an estimated 4%-5% of the global population when based on the Rome IV criteria for IBS. Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms are similar to those of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and include abdominal discomfort or pain, changes in stool frequency and form, and bowel urgency. Unlike IBD, however, IBS does not involve significant bowel inflammation. Moreover, individuals with IBS report lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores than healthy individuals, and IBS contributes significantly to healthcare costs.

Irritable bowel syndrome may also develop in patients with established IBD, complicating the differentiation between IBS and active inflammation as the cause of bowel symptoms. Consequently, reported prevalence estimates of IBS in patients with IBD vary, even among those in remission from IBD. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported IBS prevalence rates ranging from 11.2% to 63.6% in patients with IBD, suggesting differences in study methodology and/or populations. These variations may also be influenced by the different versions of the Rome criteria used to diagnose IBS. To date, only a few studies have used the latest Rome IV criteria to investigate the prevalence of IBS in patients in remission from IBD.

### Making a confident diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [^112WJGFd]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is among the most common diagnoses made by medical providers and its symptoms are common causes for health care consultation. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain associated with abnormal stool consistency and/or frequency and is widely considered a diagnosis of exclusion, despite abundant evidence contradicting such an approach. A positive diagnosis is achieved through application of symptom-based clinical criteria, careful history and physical examination, evaluation for alarm sign/symptoms, and judicious use of diagnostic testing. This article reviews the symptom-based criteria for IBS and utility of diagnostic tests commonly included in the evaluation of IBS symptoms.

### Effects of probiotic type, dose and treatment duration on irritable bowel syndrome diagnosed by Rome III criteria: a meta-analysis [^115Zkdo2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastroenterological diseases, affecting 11.2% of people worldwide. Previous studies have shown that probiotic treatment may benefit IBS patients. However, the effect of probiotics and the appropriate type, dose, and treatment duration for IBS are still unclear. The aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy of different probiotic types, doses and treatment durations in IBS patients diagnosed by Rome III criteria via a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to October 2015 were searched. RCTs including comparisons between the effects of probiotics and placebo on IBS patients diagnosed by Rome III criteria were eligible. Dichotomous data were pooled to obtain the relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI), whereas continuous data were pooled using a standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% CI.

Results

Twenty-one RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. Probiotic therapy was associated with more improvement than placebo administration in overall symptom response (RR: 1.82, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.60) and quality of life (QoL) (SMD: 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.50), but not in individual IBS symptoms. Single probiotics, a low dose, and a short treatment duration were more effective with respect to overall symptom response and QoL. No differences were detected in individual IBS symptoms in the subgroup analyses.

Conclusion

Probiotics are an effective pharmacological therapy in IBS patients. Single probiotics at a low dose and with a short treatment duration appear to be more effective in improving overall symptom response and QoL, but more evidence for these effects is still needed.

### The role of genetics in IBS [^113nCYQj]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that has been shown to aggregate in families and to affect multiple generations, but not in a manner consistent with a major Mendelian effect. Relatives of an individual with IBS are 2 to 3 times as likely to have IBS, with both genders being affected. To date, more than 100 genetic variants in more than 60 genes from various pathways have been studied in a number of candidate gene studies, with several positive associations reported. These findings suggest that there may be distinct, as well as shared, molecular underpinnings for IBS and its subtypes.

### New insights into irritable bowel syndrome: from pathophysiology to treatment [^117V47ym]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common reason to visit a gastroenterologist. IBS was believed to be a functional disease, but many possible pathophysiologic mechanisms can now explain the symptoms. IBS patients are classified into subtypes according to their predominant bowel habit, based on the Rome IV criteria. These include diarrhea-predominant and constipation-predominant IBS, as well as the mixed type, a combination of the two. Usually, IBS treatment is based on the predominant symptoms, with many options for each subtype. A new promising treatment option, fecal microbiota transplantation, seems to have beneficial effects on IBS. However, treating the pathophysiological causative agent responsible for the symptoms is an emerging approach. Therefore, before the appropriate therapeutic option is chosen for treating IBS, a clinical evaluation of its pathophysiology should be performed.

### Intestinal microbiota and diet in IBS: causes, consequences, or epiphenomena? [^11513SVf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

With a prevalence of approximately 10–15%, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in the industrialized world. The high prevalence together with the reduced quality of life and associated co-morbidities in patients suffering from IBS put a significant negative burden on both patients and society. IBS is a heterogeneous functional disorder and commonly subtyped according to the prevailing bowel habit into IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), mixed IBS with both constipation and diarrhea and unsubtyped IBS with neither constipation nor diarrhea using the Rome III criteria.

Although the etiology of IBS is incompletely understood, it is generally regarded as a multifactorial disorder involving the interplay of both host and environmental factors, including diet. The host factors include central factors, such as aberrant stress responses, psychiatric co-morbidity, and cognitive dysfunctions, whereas intestinal functions are also involved, e.g. dysmotility, visceral hypersensitivity, low-grade immune activation, altered barrier function, and the intestinal microbiota composition.

During recent years, perturbations in the intestinal microbiota are increasingly being linked to the pathophysiology of IBS. The increased risk of new onset IBS after an episode of gastroenteritis and the association with prior antibiotic use support the importance of the intestinal microbiota in IBS. Numerous studies have demonstrated altered microbial profiles in (specific subgroups of) IBS patients compared with healthy individuals. The intestinal microbiota strongly interacts with exogenous factors, in particular diet, which may also directly or indirectly provoke IBS symptoms.

In this review, we describe the current evidence regarding the impact of diet and the intestinal microbiota and their (inter)relation on the pathophysiology of IBS.

### Economic burden of moderate to severe irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in six European countries [^115UrMmZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional bowel disorder (FBD) characterised by symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain accompanied by altered bowel function. The prevalence of IBS varies between region and country, however pooled prevalence estimates IBS to occur in 5–20% of the global population. The Rome criteria are the global standards developed by experts in functional bowel disorders which enable physicians to identify and diagnose disorders such as IBS. Rome characterises IBS into subtypes based on the predominant bowel habit: IBS with predominant diarrhoea (IBS-D), IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C), IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M), and IBS unclassified (IBS-U). Nevertheless, the clinical continuum of symptoms has been shown to result in short-term subtype instability with around 40% of patients alternating between subtypes on a monthly basis.

Influence by the nervous system adds to the clinical complexity of this FBD as it results in fluctuating symptoms, both temporally (waxing and waning cycle of high disease activity and remission) and by severity. Yet despite severity fluctuations, moderate-severe IBS is estimated to account for around 60% of all IBS cases and has been shown to impose a considerable burden on patients. This burden is manifested into a health economic burden through direct medical costs to healthcare systems (HS) and indirect costs related to work absenteeism or work impairment. Studies suggest that the burden of illness for IBS is quite substantial with all IBS subtypes requiring similar levels of healthcare resource utilisation.

Continued research and re-evaluation of diagnostic criteria have greatly improved physicians' ability to differentiate IBS from other FBDs and enhance the accuracy of subtype classification. For example, IBS-C and chronic constipation are often confused due to their similarity in defecation patterns, despite IBS-C symptomatology being dominated by abdominal pain. It is estimated that IBS-C accounts for around 30% of IBS cases. Treatment revolves around the use of therapies which are not specifically approved for treating IBS-C, such as laxatives, antispasmodics, prokinetics, and bulking agents (e.g. dietary fibres). Although useful for treating constipation, in some patients these therapies show poor efficacy, tolerability and are unable to treat all key IBS-C symptoms when used individually. In Europe, the guanylate cyclase-C agonist linaclotide is the only pharmacological treatment approved for the treatment of IBS-C and has been shown to be cost-effective compared to antidepressants.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: straightening the road from the Rome criteria [^115WB1rB]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Medium credibility.

A sequence of consensus-based Rome criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been published since 1989. The fundamental definition based on abdominal pain in association with bowel dysfunction has been consistent. However, two major changes occurred in the Rome II and IV criteria. The former change involved "splitting off" of symptoms that were not consistently associated with pain, such as functional, constipation, diarrhea, and bloating. In Rome IV, the main changes were the exclusion of discomfort (in contrast to pain) and the more stringent frequency criteria for the pain to be eligible for diagnosis of IBS (specifically, on average, at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months). Validation studies of the consensus, symptom-based criteria have identified multiple deficiencies that question the rationale for "splitting" the different syndromes, and favor a simpler identification of the classical symptoms of abdominal pain, bowel dysfunction, and bloating, and exclusion of alarm symptoms. Advances in the identification of actionable biomarkers related to the symptoms suggestive of functional gastrointestinal disorders have the potential to usher a change in practice from positive diagnosis of symptom complexes followed by empirical treatment to identification of the mechanisms causing the symptoms and targeted therapy.

### Irritable bowel syndrome [^115YXMbN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder, with a prevalence of 4% to 10%. It is a chronic condition characterized by abdominal pain in conjunction with altered bowel habits, abdominal distention, or bloating. IBS can present with 3 different defecation patterns: IBS with constipation, IBS with diarrhea, or mixed IBS. Recent advances in IBS include a positive diagnosis based on symptom-based criteria and a treatment plan based on IBS subtype and bothersome symptoms. In addition to diet and lifestyle modifications, this article discusses the role of new pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options for the management of IBS.

### Comparison of symptoms, healthcare utilization, and treatment in diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome [^11194Hy9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by chronic or recurrent symptoms of abdominal pain that is associated with altered bowel function (i.e. pain related to defecation, changes in stool frequency, or appearance). Additional symptoms of IBS may include straining, fecal urgency, and bloating. IBS can further be subdivided by stool consistency, namely, constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), or mixed bowel habit pattern (IBS-M). Importantly, patients with IBS report reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) compared with individuals without IBS.

As many as 48 million individuals in the United States are thought to be affected by IBS annually, yet up to 75% of patients with IBS may lack a formal medical diagnosis of IBS. Although diagnostic symptom criteria exist for IBS, they are mainly used in clinical research studies, rather than used routinely in clinical practice. In a US study using a large health insurance database, patients with IBS were most likely to receive a diagnosis from an internist (68%) rather than a gastroenterologist (13%). Hungin et al. conducted a European study that surveyed 3,880 participants with IBS symptoms and suggested that primary care physicians may have an even greater role in IBS diagnosis and management; the authors found that most patients with medically diagnosed IBS sought medical care from primary care physicians (90%) rather than gastroenterologists (28%). Of symptomatic individuals lacking a medical diagnosis of IBS, Hungin et al. found, for a European population, that 37% did not receive care, whereas 55 and 12% sought medical care from primary care physicians and gastroenterologists, respectively. A comparable, but smaller, US community survey study conducted by the same group found similar results. The reasons for the lack of a formal diagnosis of IBS for many individuals are not entirely clear, but likely are multifactorial. Individuals with IBS symptoms often describe a range of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including reflux-like symptoms, dyspepsia, and IBS-related symptoms (e.g. fecal urgency, bloating). IBS-D may pose a relatively greater diagnostic challenge than the other bowel habit subtypes, as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, among other conditions, need to be considered in patients with chronic or recurrent diarrhea. In fact, current evidence suggests that celiac serologies and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin should be obtained in these patients.

### Psychological treatments for the management of irritable bowel syndrome [^111sRRnD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

No consensus exists on the optimal treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Psychological treatments are increasingly advocated but their effectiveness is unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of psychological interventions for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.

Search Strategy

A computer assisted search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and Google Scholar was performed for the years 1966–2008. Local databases were searched in Europe.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing single psychological interventions with either usual care or mock interventions in patients over 16 years of age. No language criterion was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The search identified 25 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), number needed to treat (NNT) and standardized mean difference (SMD) along with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random effects model for each outcome.

Main Results

Psychological interventions as a group The SMD for symptom score improvement at 2 and 3 months was 0.97 (95% CI 0.29 to 1.65) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.79) respectively compared to usual care. Against placebo, the SMDs were 0.71 (95% CI 0.08 to 1.33) and -0.17 (95% CI -0.45 to 0.11) respectively. For improvement of abdominal pain, the SMDs at 2 and 3 months were 0.54 (95%CI 0.10 to 0.98) and 0.26 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.45) compared to usual care. The SMD from placebo at 3 months was 0.31 (95% CI -0.16 to 0.79). For improvement in quality of life, the SMD from usual care at 2 and 3 months was 0.47 (95%CI 0.11 to 0.84) and 0.31 (95%CI -0.16 to 0.77) respectively. Cognitive behavioural therapy The SMD for symptom score improvement at 2 and 3 months was 0.75 (95% CI -0.20 to 1.70) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.79) respectively compared to usual care. Against placebo, the SMDs were 0.68 (95% CI -0.01 to 1.36) and -0.17 (95% CI -0.45 to 0.11) respectively. For improvement of abdominal pain, the SMDs at 2 and 3 months were 0.45 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.91) and 0.22 (95% CI -0.04 to -0.49) compared to usual care. Against placebo the SMD at 3 months was 0.33 (95% CI -0.16 to 0.82). For improvement in quality of life, the SMDs at 2 and 3 months compared to usual care were 0.44 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.85) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.07 to 1.77) respectively. Interpersonal psychotherapy The RR for adequate relief of symptoms was 2.02 (95% CI 1.13 to 3.62), RD 0.30 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.46), NNT 4 for comparison with care as usual. The SMD for improvement of symptom score was 0.35 (95% CI -0.75 to 0.05) compared with usual care. Relaxation/Stress management The SMD in symptom score improvement at 2 months was 0.50 (95%CI 0.02 to 0.98) compared with usual care. The SMD in improvement of abdominal pain at 3 months was 0.02 (95%CI -0.56 to 0.61) compared with usual care. Long term results Very few long term follow-up results were available. There was no convincing evidence that treatment effects were sustained following completion of treatment for any treatment modality.

Authors' Conclusions

Psychological interventions may be slightly superior to usual care or waiting list control conditions at the end of treatment although the clinical significance of this is debatable. Except for a single study, these therapies are not superior to placebo and the sustainability of their effect is questionable. The meta-analysis was significantly limited by issues of validity, heterogeneity, small sample size and outcome definition. Future research should adhere to current recommendations for IBS treatment trials and should focus on the long-term effects of treatment.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria context for trials notes that the Rome IV criteria differ from Rome III by deleting abdominal discomfort and requiring abdominal pain to be present at least 1 day per week on average during the preceding 3 months, resulting in fewer individuals meeting Rome IV than Rome III. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that generally measure changes in abdominal pain, Rome IV criteria are described as more applicable, but it is not known whether these diagnostic changes would alter the efficacy and safety of IBS treatments in RCTs.

### Rome IV-functional GI disorders: disorders of gut-brain interaction [^115Giqfi]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Rome IV diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome" for irritable bowel syndrome and chronic diarrhea.

The Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a clinical calculator used to diagnose IBS, a common gastrointestinal disorder. This calculator is applicable to patients who present with chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, which are the primary symptoms of IBS.

The Rome IV criteria stipulate that for a diagnosis of IBS, patients must have recurrent abdominal pain, on average, at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months, associated with two or more of the following criteria: related to defecation, associated with a change in frequency of stool, and associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool. These criteria should be fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to provide a standardized, symptom-based approach to diagnose IBS, which can be a challenging condition to diagnose due to the lack of specific biomarkers or imaging findings. It helps clinicians to identify patients with IBS, guide treatment decisions, and potentially avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria for IBS. However, it is important to note that these criteria should be used in conjunction with a thorough medical history and

The Rome IV diagnostic criteria tool for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) utilizes four specific inputs related to abdominal pain and its association with bowel habits. Each input is evaluated to compute a total score which helps interpret if the criteria for IBS are met. The key inputs include whether the user experiences recurrent abdominal pain at least one day per week in the last three months, whether the pain is related to defecation, if the onset of pain is associated with a change in stool frequency, and if there is a change in stool form or appearance.

The scoring system assigns the following values to each input:

- Recurrent abdominal pain ≥ 1 day/week in the last 3 months: 4 points
- Pain related to defecation: 1 point
- Onset of pain with a change in stool frequency: 1 point
- Onset of pain with a change in stool form/appearance: 1 point

These inputs are converted into a score by summing the assigned values based on the user's responses. This score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 7.

Interpretation of the total score is as follows:

- If the score is 6 or greater, the interpretation is "Meets criteria for IBS"
- If the score is less than 6, the interpretation is "Criteria not met"

| Input Parameter | Score |
|-|-|
| Recurrent abdominal pain ≥ 1 day/week in the last 3 months | 4 |
| Pain related to defecation | 1 |
| Onset of pain associated with a change in stool frequency | 1 |
| Onset of pain associated with a change in stool form/appearance | 1 |

### Quantifying Rome symptoms for diagnosis of the irritable bowel syndrome [^115AbeVU]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder, diagnosed on symptom-based criteria. Many have reported discrepancies between formal Rome criteria and diagnoses made in clinical practice. The aim of the study was to explore whether a quantitative version of the Rome criteria would better represent a clinical diagnosis of IBS than the current dichotomous criteria for symptom measure.

Methods

As part of a large, case-control study, participants completed a validated bowel disease questionnaire. Rome criteria were analyzed based on 15 individual symptoms. Penalized logistic regression model with stepwise selection was used to identify significant symptoms of IBS which were independently associated with case-control status.

Key Results

In cases with a clinical diagnosis of IBS, 347 (70%) met Rome criteria for IBS. Increasing number of Rome symptoms were found related to the odds of being diagnosed with IBS. Nearly half of the Rome-negative case group experienced infrequent symptoms suggesting milder disease. Five of 15 Rome symptoms were associated with predicting case-control status in the final model, with 96% correctly classified among Rome-positive cases, 76% for Rome-negative cases, and 91% for controls.

Conclusions and Inferences

Irritable bowel syndrome appears to be a spectrum disorder. Quantifying individual symptoms of Rome criteria has greater utility than the current application in representing the degree of IBS affectedness and appears to better reflect a clinical diagnosis of IBS applied by physicians. The use of a quantitative diagnostic Rome "score" may be helpful in clinical practice and research studies to better reflect the degree an individual is affected with IBS.

### Intestinal microbiota and diet in IBS: causes, consequences, or epiphenomena? [^1133crUV]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous functional disorder with a multifactorial etiology that involves the interplay of both host and environmental factors. Among environmental factors relevant for IBS etiology, the diet stands out given that the majority of IBS patients report their symptoms to be triggered by meals or specific foods. The diet provides substrates for microbial fermentation, and, as the composition of the intestinal microbiota is disturbed in IBS patients, the link between diet, microbiota composition, and microbial fermentation products might have an essential role in IBS etiology. In this review, we summarize current evidence regarding the impact of diet and the intestinal microbiota on IBS symptoms, as well as the reported interactions between diet and the microbiota composition. On the basis of the existing data, we suggest pathways (mechanisms) by which diet components, via the microbial fermentation, could trigger IBS symptoms. Finally, this review provides recommendations for future studies that would enable elucidation of the role of diet and microbiota and how these factors may be (inter)related in the pathophysiology of IBS.

### Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [^115htQ4u]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common disorder seen in gastroenterology practice. It is also a large component of primary care practices. Although the classic IBS symptoms of lower abdominal pain, bloating, and alteration of bowel habits is easily recognizable to most physicians, diagnosing IBS remains a challenge. This is in part caused by the absence of anatomic or physiologic markers. For this reason, the diagnosis of IBS currently needs to be made on clinical grounds. A number of symptom-based diagnostic criteria have been proposed over the last 15 years. The most recent of these, the Rome II criteria, seem to show reasonable sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing IBS. However, the role of the Rome II criteria in clinical practice remains ill defined. A review of the literature shows that, in patients with no alarm symptoms, the Rome criteria have a positive predictive value of approximately 98%, and that additional diagnostic tests have a yield of 2% or less. Diagnostic evaluation should also include a psychosocial assessment specifically addressing any history of sexual or physical abuse because these issues significantly influence management strategies and treatment success.

### Placebo response rates in trials of licensed drugs for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation or diarrhea: meta-analysis [^113jP2YM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

There are several licensed drugs for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that have proven efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but placebo response rates are high. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of licensed drugs to estimate magnitude of placebo response rate according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended endpoints and to assess how this varies with stringency of the endpoint used to define response.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE CLASSIC and EMBASE, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (through January 2021) to identify RCTs comparing licensed drugs with placebo in adult IBS patients. Studies assessed efficacy according to at least one of composite response, abdominal pain response, or stool response. Data were extracted as intention-to-treat analyses, with dropouts assumed to be treatment failures and pooled using a random-effects model.

Results

There were 17 RCTs of licensed drugs versus placebo in IBS with constipation (4603 patients placebo) and 17 trials in IBS with diarrhea (3908 patients placebo). In IBS with constipation, according to FDA criteria, pooled composite, abdominal pain, and stool response rates with placebo over ≥ 6 of 12 weeks were 18.9%, 34.6%, and 30.1%, respectively. Evaluating response rates over ≥ 9 of 12 weeks led to placebo response rates of 4.3% for the composite endpoint, 24.5% for abdominal pain, and 7.7% for stool. In IBS with diarrhea, pooled placebo response rates according to FDA criteria were 16.2% for the composite endpoint, 40.2% for abdominal pain, and 16.2% for stool. Increasing the threshold used to define abdominal pain response from ≥ 30% improvement to ≥ 40% or ≥ 50% led to lower placebo response rates of 34.5% and 23.4%.

Conclusions

Future RCTs should adhere to current FDA-recommended endpoints for IBS because these lead to lower placebo response rates. However, consideration should be given to further refining some of these to better differentiate between active drug and placebo.

### Do published guidelines for evaluation of irritable bowel syndrome reflect practice? [^116KeGie]. BMC Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The only US guidelines listed in the National Guideline Warehouse for the diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are the expert opinion guidelines published by The American Gastroenterology Association. Although the listed target audience of these guidelines includes family physicians and general internists, the care recommended in the guidelines has not been compared to actual primary care practice. This study was designed to compare expert opinion guidelines with the actual primary care provided and to assess outcomes in the 3 years following the IBS diagnosis.

Methods

This is a retrospective medical record review study using a random sample of incident IBS cases from all Olmsted County, Minnesota providers diagnosed between January 1, 1993 and December 31, 1995. Data was collected on all care and testing provided to the subjects as well as 3-year outcomes related to the IBS diagnosis.

Results

Of the 149 IBS patients, 99 were women and the mean age was 47.6 years. No patient had all of the diagnostic tests recommended in the guidelines. 42% had the basic blood tests of CBC and a chemistry panel. Sedimentation rate (2%) and serum thyroxine level (3%) were uncommon. Colon imaging studies were done in 41% including 74% of those over the age of 50. In the 3 years following the diagnosis, only one person had a change in diagnosis and no diagnoses of gastro-intestinal malignancies were made in the cohort.

Conclusions

Primary care practice based diagnostic evaluations for IBS differ significantly from the specialty expert opinion-based guidelines. Implementation of the specialty guidelines in primary care practice would increase utilization with apparent limited improvement in diagnostic outcomes.

### The role of fiber supplementation in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VkHsn]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder associated with a wide variety of clinical symptoms. The use of fiber in treatment of IBS is well established, but recent reviews have shown conflicting evidence. The aim of our review was to study the effects of fiber (soluble and insoluble) on the symptoms of IBS. Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for appropriate studies. Two reviewers screened the title/abstract and full text against the inclusion criterion - that is, randomized control trials/crossover studies that compare fiber with placebo for its effect on IBS in an outpatient setting. Independent double data extraction was performed across multiple fields. An assessment of the risk of bias and tests for heterogeneity were carried out, along with a meta-analysis of the outcomes of interest. The search yielded 4199 unique records: 121 were selected after title/abstract screening and 22 after full screening. There was moderate clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity across studies, with a moderate risk of bias. Overall, there was a significant improvement in global assessment of symptoms among those randomized to fiber [risk ratio: 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05–1.54]. Soluble fiber improved assessment of symptoms (risk ratio 1.49; 95% CI: 1.09–2.03), as well as the abdominal pain score (mean difference: -1.84; 95% CI: -2.72 to -0.97), with insoluble fiber not showing improvement in any outcome. Soluble fiber appears to improve symptoms of IBS, whereas there is no evidence for recommending insoluble fiber for IBS.

### The place of eluxadoline in the management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea [^111bvDBa]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated with defecation with altered stool frequency or stool form. The global prevalence of IBS ranges from 10% to 15% and total healthcare cost attributable to IBS is significant. Among individuals with IBS, the condition has dramatic effects on health-related quality of life, work and school productivity, and activities of daily living. It may be diagnosed with confidence, based on symptom-based diagnostic criteria, exclusion of alarm features and directed diagnostic testing. Management of IBS typically begins with dietary and lifestyle modifications, progressing to over-the-counter therapies, and then to prescription medications, both approved and nonapproved for IBS. This narrative summarizes the efficacy and safety of three US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription therapies for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), with a focus on the most recently marketed agent, eluxadoline, and its role in the treatment IBS-D.

### Assessing diagnostic performance of modifications to the Rome IV criteria for irritable bowel syndrome [^114bjsx4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The gold standard symptom-based criteria for diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are the Rome IV criteria. 1 These are more restrictive than their predecessor, Rome III, because the cardinal feature required to meet criteria for IBS was changed to presence of abdominal pain alone, rather than abdominal pain or discomfort. 2 This change was made because discomfort was believed to be an ambiguous term, with no equivalent in some languages. In addition, symptom frequency required for the presence of abdominal pain was increased to 1 day per week from 2 to 3 days per month. This has led to reduced sensitivity for detecting IBS and a 50% decrease in the prevalence of the disorder in the community. 3,4 In a cross-sectional survey applying both Rome IV and III criteria to people living with IBS, 89% of those with Rome III-defined IBS not meeting Rome IV criteria did not meet Rome IV criteria because of this change in pain frequency. 5 Previous iterations of the Rome criteria have performed only modestly in predicting a diagnosis of IBS. 6–8 However, in a validation study, the Rome IV criteria outperformed Rome III, 9 largely because their more restrictive nature made them more specific than Rome III. We assessed whether modifications to the Rome IV criteria led to a better trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

### Global prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome according to Rome III or IV criteria: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113NikGp]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional bowel disorders, but community prevalence appears to vary widely between different countries. This variation might be due to the fact that previous cross-sectional surveys have neither applied uniform diagnostic criteria nor used identical methodology, rather than being due to true global variability. We aimed to determine the global prevalence of IBS.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from all population-based studies using relatively uniform methodology and using only the most recent iterations of the Rome criteria (Rome III and IV). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Embase Classic (from Jan 1, 2006, to April 30, 2020) to identify cross-sectional surveys reporting the prevalence of IBS in adults (≥ 90% of participants aged ≥ 18 years) according to the Rome III or Rome IV criteria. We also hand-searched a selection of conference proceedings for relevant abstracts published between 2006 and 2019. We extracted prevalence data for all studies, according to the criteria used to define the presence of IBS. We did a meta-analysis to estimate pooled prevalence rates, according to study location and certain other characteristics (eg, sex and IBS subtype).

Findings

We identified 4143 citations, of which 184 studies appeared relevant. 57 of these studies were eligible, and represented 92 separate adult populations, comprising 423362 participants. The pooled prevalence of IBS in 53 studies that used the Rome III criteria, from 38 countries and comprising 395385 participants, was 9·2% (95% CI 7·6–10·8; I² = 99·7%). By contrast, pooled IBS prevalence among six studies that used the Rome IV criteria, from 34 countries and comprising 82476 individuals, was 3·8% (95% CI 3·1–4·5; I² = 96·6%). IBS with mixed bowel habit (IBS-M) was the most common subtype with the Rome III criteria, reported by 33·8% (95% CI 27·8–40·0; I² = 98·1%) of people fulfilling criteria for IBS (ie, 3·7% [2·6–4·9] of all included participants had IBS-M), but IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D) was the most common subtype with the Rome IV criteria (reported by 31·5% [95% CI 23·2–40·5; I² = 98·1% 61·6%] of people with IBS, corresponding to 1·4% [0·9–1·9] of all included participants having IBS-D). The prevalence of IBS was higher in women than in men (12·0% [95% CI 9·3–15·0] vs 8·6% [6·3–11·2]; odds ratio 1·46 [95% CI 1·33–1·59]). Prevalence varied substantially between individual countries, and this variability persisted even when the same diagnostic criteria were applied and identical methodology was used in studies.

Interpretation

Even when uniform symptom-based criteria are applied, based on identical methodology, to define the presence of IBS, prevalence varies substantially between countries. Prevalence was substantially lower with the Rome IV criteria, suggesting that these more restrictive criteria might be less suitable than Rome III for population-based epidemiological surveys.

Funding

None.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis: probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome [^111ZN5i5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder and the evidence for efficacy of most drug therapies in the treatment of IBS is weak. A popular alternative is probiotics, which have been used in several conditions. including IBS. Probiotics are live microbial food supplements. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials study was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in alleviating symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. We searched Ovid versions of MEDLINE (1950–2007), EMBASE (1980–2007), CINAHL (1982–2007), AMED (1985–2007), the Cochrane library and hand searched retrieved papers.

Results

We identified 14 randomized placebo controlled trials. Combined data suggested a modest improvement in overall symptoms after several weeks of treatment: for dichotomous data from seven trials the overall Odds Ratio (OR) was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2); for continuous data from six trials the standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.38). For individual symptoms the results differed between the pooled dichotomous and pooled continuous data. Trials varied in relation to the length of treatment (4–26 weeks), dose, organisms and strengths of probiotics used.

Conclusion

Probiotics may have a role in alleviating some of the symptoms of IBS, a condition for which currently evidence of efficacy of drug therapies is weak. However, as IBS is a condition that is chronic and usually intermittent longer term trials are recommended. Such research should focus on the type, optimal dose of probiotics and the subgroups of patients who are likely to benefit the most.

### Report from the multinational irritable bowel syndrome initiative 2012 [^116R5Cxo]. Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

In 2012, a group of 29 internationally recognized experts in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) convened to audit the current state of IBS research. The meeting was preceded by a comprehensive online survey that focused on research needs for IBS diagnosis (particularly the strengths and shortcomings of current criteria), definitions used in clinical trials for IBS patients and "healthy controls", potential biomarkers for IBS, and outcome measures in drug trials. While the purpose of the meeting was not to make binding recommendations, participants developed a framework for future questions and research needs in IBS. First, participants indicated the need for revised criteria for the diagnosis of IBS; in particular, inclusion of bloating and de-emphasis of pain as criteria were considered critical needs. Second, participants noted that definitions of normal, healthy controls varied widely among clinical trials; these definitions need to be standardized not only to improve the reliability of results, but also to better facilitate inter-trial comparisons and data synthesis. Third, participants highlighted the need for accurate biomarkers of disease. Fourth and finally, participants noted that further defining outcome measures, so that they are functionally relevant and reflect normalization of bowel function, is a critical need. Together, the discussions held at this workshop form a framework to address future research in IBS.

### Non-pharmaceutical treatments for irritable bowel syndrome [^113FRmND]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of gut-brain interaction that impacts a significant portion of the population and is associated with substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life, and economic impact globally. The pathophysiology of IBS is complex and incompletely understood, and the heterogeneity of IBS is reflected in the variety of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical therapies utilized for the management of IBS. Given limitations with pharmaceutical treatments, many patients with IBS seek non-pharmaceutical options. Several non-pharmaceutical treatments such as the low FODMAP diet and brain-gut behavior interventions such as gut directed hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy are now considered standard of care and are part of all major guidelines for the treatment of IBS. However, challenges with access to and optimal implementation of these therapies remain. This review focuses on the current evidence for common non-pharmaceutical treatments for IBS, including the latest advances in dietary and brain-gut behavioral care, in addition other complementary and integrative health practices and emerging therapies.
