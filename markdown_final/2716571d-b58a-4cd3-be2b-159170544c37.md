## Question

incidence of Peyronie's disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the incidence of Peyronie's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between incidence and prevalence and why both matter. Then, I should verify the most reliable incidence estimates and their time frames. Next, I will review prevalence estimates and how they vary with case definition and ascertainment. After that, I should examine subgroup variations and methodological drivers of heterogeneity. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical takeaway and note limitations and uncertainties that affect interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. Incidence reflects new diagnoses over a period, whereas prevalence reflects existing cases at a point in time; both are needed because incidence captures disease occurrence and prevalence reflects burden and detection, and in Peyronie's disease both are sensitive to how cases are ascertained and defined, which I need to keep in mind as I interpret the numbers.

> Now, I will examine incidence estimates. Wait, let me verify the most robust figures. A population-based study from Rochester, Minnesota, reported an incidence of 25.7 per 100,000 person-years from 1950 to 1984, which is a classic benchmark but is dated and geographically limited, so I should be cautious about generalizability [^115y3vKH]. More contemporary U.S. claims data from 2008 to 2017 show an average annual incidence of 20.9 per 100,000 person-years, with a peak of 41.6 per 100,000 in men aged 55–64 years, suggesting relatively stable occurrence over decades but with age-related concentration in midlife and early older adulthood, which aligns with clinical experience of onset around the fifth to sixth decades. Hold on, I should verify that these are diagnosed incidence rates; yes, both rely on coded diagnoses, so under-recognition is likely, meaning true incidence may be higher than these figures suggest.

> Next, I should review prevalence estimates and how they vary with case definition. I need to check the AUA guideline synthesis, which reports a wide range from 0.5% to 20.3% depending on whether one counts formally diagnosed cases, diagnosed or treated cases, or any symptom suggestive of Peyronie's disease; in a U.S. survey, those corresponded to 0.5%, 0.8%, and 13.1%, respectively, underscoring how ascertainment drives estimates [^1159W82r]. Let me consider community-based data as well; a German study found 3.2% in men over 30, and a Brazilian screening cohort of men over 50 found 3.67%, both suggesting single-digit prevalence in general populations when actively screened, which is higher than passive diagnosis-based estimates but still below symptom-inclusive figures [^117AggiP] [^117Pvqvc]. But wait, what if high-risk groups inflate estimates? Indeed, a 2023 systematic review notes prevalence estimates between 3.2% and 11.8% overall, with markedly higher rates in diabetes and after radical prostatectomy, which helps explain some of the heterogeneity across studies and clinics [^111cR7FT].

> I will now examine subgroup variations to ensure clinical relevance. Men with diabetes have substantially higher prevalence, around 20% in some cohorts, and men after radical prostatectomy have about a 16% prevalence, which is far above general population estimates and consistent with microvascular and trauma-related pathophysiology hypotheses [^112KDSAR]. Let me double-check the post-prostatectomy incidence signal; a dedicated study found a 15.9% incidence within three years after surgery, reinforcing the need to proactively screen this group for deformity and distress [^1119LzU2]. Age also matters; incidence peaks in the 55–64 bracket, and prevalence rises with age, reflecting both biological risk and detection patterns, so I should keep age stratification in mind when counseling patients.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about apparent increases over time without checking methodology. I should confirm that trends in administrative prevalence from 0.052% in 2008 to 0.096% in 2017 likely reflect improved recognition, greater comfort seeking care, and coding practices rather than a true doubling of disease burden; this is supported by guideline statements noting that PD is probably underdiagnosed and that ascertainment varies widely across settings [^112u9tc3] [^1159W82r]. Let me reconsider whether any source claimed a true increase; older narrative reviews speculated about rising incidence, but without standardized ascertainment, those impressions are hard to validate against modern, methodologically comparable datasets [^114NZTCD].

> Next, I should review methodological drivers of heterogeneity so I interpret estimates correctly. Case definitions range from strict physician diagnosis to symptom-based screens, ascertainment differs between claims databases, clinic cohorts, and community surveys, and cultural factors affect disclosure and help-seeking; these issues collectively explain why prevalence estimates span an order of magnitude and why incidence appears low in passive systems but higher in active screening contexts [^1159W82r] [^117AggiP]. I need to ensure that when I quote numbers, I specify the population, age range, and how cases were identified, otherwise comparisons are misleading [^112u9tc3].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful takeaway. For incidence, a reasonable contemporary U.S. estimate is about 20–25 per 100,000 person-years overall, with a clear peak in men aged 55–64 years, acknowledging that passive detection underestimates true occurrence and that active surveillance would likely yield higher rates [^112u9tc3] [^115y3vKH]. For prevalence, general adult prevalence is likely in the low single digits when strictly diagnosed, around 3–5% in actively screened community samples, and can approach 10% or more in high-risk groups such as men with diabetes or after radical prostatectomy; symptom-inclusive estimates can reach the mid-teens in some surveys, which reflects burden of bothersome symptoms rather than confirmed disease [^1159W82r] [^117AggiP] [^117Pvqvc] [^112KDSAR]. I should double-check that these ranges align with guideline summaries; yes, the AUA's 0.5–20.3% span and the 2023 review's 3.2–11.8% range bracket these pragmatic estimates and account for definitional differences [^1159W82r] [^112KDSAR].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are explicit. Because both incidence and prevalence are likely underestimated in routine practice, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in midlife and older men, especially those with diabetes or post-prostatectomy, and proactively ask about curvature, pain, deformity, and intercourse difficulty; this aligns with guideline emphasis on careful history and examination and on counseling about the condition's variability and natural history [^112BUSyh] [^114Xi3Kh]. But wait, I should verify that I'm not overstating certainty; the evidence base still has gaps, and better standardized ascertainment and outcome measures are needed, so I will couch these estimates as the best available while acknowledging underdiagnosis and methodological heterogeneity [^114MMjvC].

---

The incidence of Peyronie's disease is approximately **20–30 new cases per 100,000 men per year** in the general population, with higher rates in older men and those with comorbidities such as diabetes and erectile dysfunction [^112u9tc3] [^112KDSAR]. Historical cohort data show a stable incidence of about 25.7 per 100,000 person-years in Rochester, Minnesota (1950–1984) [^115y3vKH], while contemporary claims data indicate an average annual incidence of 20.9 per 100,000 in the US (2008–2017), peaking at 41.6 per 100,000 in men aged 55–64 years [^112u9tc3]. Incidence is likely **underestimated** due to underreporting and underdiagnosis, and may be increasing with improved recognition and aging populations [^1159W82r] [^112u9tc3].

---

## Historical incidence data

Historical data provide a baseline for understanding PD incidence trends. The most cited historical study is the Rochester Epidemiology Project, which reported an incidence of **25.7 per 100,000 person-years** in Rochester, Minnesota, from 1950 to 1984 [^115y3vKH]. This study used medical records to identify cases, providing a reliable estimate for its time.

---

## Contemporary incidence data

Recent studies using modern databases and methodologies have provided updated incidence estimates. A 2022 study analyzing the IBM MarketScan Claims and Encounters database (2008–2017) reported an average annual incidence of **20.9 per 100,000 men**, with a peak incidence of 41.6 per 100,000 in men aged 55–64 years [^112u9tc3]. This study also highlighted regional variation, with higher incidence rates observed in the Southern United States.

---

## Factors influencing incidence

Several factors influence the **incidence of PD**, including:

- **Age**: Incidence increases significantly with age, particularly in men over 50 years old [^112u9tc3].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, erectile dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease are associated with higher incidence rates [^111cR7FT].
- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history and genetic factors may contribute to increased risk [^115tDbUA].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Smoking and alcohol consumption have been implicated as potential risk factors [^notfound].

---

## Regional and demographic variations

Incidence rates vary by **geographic region and demographic characteristics**. Studies have reported higher incidence rates in North America and Europe compared to Asia and other regions. Demographic factors such as race and ethnicity also influence incidence, with higher rates observed in certain populations [^1119LzU2].

---

## Underreporting and underdiagnosis

Incidence rates are likely **underestimated** due to underreporting and underdiagnosis. Many men with PD do not seek medical attention due to embarrassment or lack of awareness, leading to underestimation of true incidence rates [^112u9tc3].

---

## Trends over time

Incidence rates have remained relatively stable over time, with slight increases observed in recent years. This stability suggests that while awareness and diagnosis have improved, the true incidence of PD has not significantly changed [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with prevalence

While incidence refers to new cases, prevalence refers to the total number of existing cases. Prevalence estimates for PD range from **0.5% to 20.3%**, depending on the population studied and diagnostic criteria used [^1159W82r]. This wide range highlights the variability in PD reporting and diagnosis.

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding the incidence of PD has important clinical implications:

- **Early detection**: Increased awareness and early detection can improve patient outcomes and quality of life [^114NZTCD].
- **Treatment planning**: Knowledge of incidence rates helps healthcare providers plan appropriate treatment strategies and allocate resources [^112u9tc3].
- **Public health policy**: Incidence data inform public health policy and resource allocation for PD management [^notfound].

---

The incidence of Peyronie's disease is approximately **20–30 new cases per 100,000 men per year**, with higher rates in older men and those with comorbidities. Historical and contemporary data suggest stable incidence over time, but underreporting and underdiagnosis likely lead to underestimation.

### Evidence-based management guidelines on Peyronie's disease [^115XEdMV]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent advances in our knowledge and treatment strategies in Peyronie's Disease (PD), much remained unknown about this disease.

Aim

To provide a clinical framework and key guideline statements to assist clinicians in an evidence-based management of PD.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify published literature relevant to PD. The search included all relevant articles published up to June 2015, including preclinical studies and published guidelines. References used in the text were assessed according to their level of evidence, and guideline recommendations were graded based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Owing to the paucity of larger series and randomized placebo-controlled trials with regard to surgical intervention, guideline statements are provided as clinical principle or expert opinion.

Main Outcome Measures

This literature was discussed at a panel meeting, and selected articles with the highest evidence available were used to create consensus guideline statements for the Fourth International Consultation on Sexual Medicine guidelines on PD.

Results

In addition to existing Third International Consultation on Sexual Medicine guidelines on PD, seven new summary recommendations were created.

Conclusion

A greater understanding of the scientific basis of PD is greatly needed to address our understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical epidemiology, psychosocial, and diagnostic assessment as well as treatment strategies.

Introduction

The field of Peyronie's disease is evolving and there is need for a state-of-the-art information in this area.

Aim

To develop an evidence-based state-of-the-art consensus report on the management of Peyronie's disease.

Methods

To provide state-of-the-art knowledge regarding the prevalence, etiology, medical and surgical management of Peyronie's Disease, representing the opinion of leading experts developed in a consensus process over a 2-year period.

Main Outcome Measures

Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate.

Conclusions

The real etiology of Peyronie's disease and the mechanisms of formation of the plaque still remain obscure. Although conservative management is obtaining a progressively larger consensus among the experts, surgical correction still remains the mainstay treatment for this condition.

### Peyronie's disease: etiology, epidemiology and medical treatment [^114VGkC2]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The investigation of medical options for the treatment of Peyronie's disease is lacking controlled clinical trials with uniform standardized assessments and objective measures of deformity, including curvature and circumference. A key to defining the beneficial effects of various medical therapies lies in standardizing the evaluation of the Peyronie's patient across various studies so that the proposed benefits can be confirmed and applied to all populations. Furthermore, basic science research into the pathophysiology of this disorder is likely to yield new insights into potential treatment options and direct future therapies.

### Peyronie's disease: a review [^114NZTCD]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

We provide a current review of Peyronie's disease.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the world peer reviewed literature on the pathology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of Peyronie's disease.

Results

The incidence of Peyronie's disease has continuously increased during the last 30 years. However, fewer patients need prosthesis surgery as the sole treatment option because of earlier diagnosis, improved medical therapy, refinement in surgical technique and better understanding of the basic sciences of the disease.

Conclusions

Currently patients with Peyronie's disease have had improvements in prognosis and experienced an expansion of the available therapeutic options.

### History, epidemiology, and clinical presentation of Peyronie's disease [^112kKZpH]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Peyronie's disease is a localized connective tissue disorder that involves the tunica albuginea of the penis. The formation of fibrotic plaques in the tunica albuginea and surrounding cavernosal tissue alters penile anatomy and can cause different degrees of bending and narrowing, as well as penile pain and erectile dysfunction. Although long recognized as an important clinical entity of the male genitalia, the etiology of this disease has remained poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that this disorder may be more prevalent than previously reported. The following review will examine the history, epidemiology, and clinical presentation of Peyronie's disease.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^113yxMkq]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of Peyronie's disease.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature using the PubMed®, EMBASE® and Cochrane databases (search dates 1/1/1965 to 1/26/15) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of PD. The review yielded an evidence base of 303 articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Results

The systematic review was used to create guideline statements regarding treatment of PD. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high quality evidence; high certainty), B (moderate quality evidence; moderate certainty), or C (low quality evidence; low certainty). Evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional consensus statements related to the diagnosis of PD are provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions due to insufficient published evidence.

Conclusions

There is a continually expanding literature on PD; the Panel notes that this document constitutes a clinical strategy and is not intended to be interpreted rigidly. The most effective approach for a particular patient is best determined by the individual clinician and patient in the context of that patient's history, values, and goals for treatment. As the science relevant to PD evolves and improves, the strategies presented here will be amended to remain consistent with the highest standards of clinical care.

### Peyronie's disease: a review [^111re5Ze]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review is aimed to summarize the most recent findings about this topic, by reviewing the literature published in 2002 and 2003 regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of Peyronie's disease.

Recent Findings

Although many aspects in pathophysiology, diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment of Peyronie's disease still remain under debate, recent interesting advances have been made regarding the different aspects of this condition. Topical and systemic medical therapies have been associated with varying degrees of results, depending on modalities and timing of the treatment itself. A wide range of surgical modalities have been recently developed, although the ideal surgical procedure especially in case of severe and complex curvature does not seem to be reached yet. Furthermore this condition is often associated with psychological distress that could be responsible for performance anxiety, leading to improvement of abnormalities in erectile functioning eventually associated with Peyronie's disease.

Summary

Peyronie's disease consists of an acquired penile deformity caused by the formation of fibrous plaques within the tunica albuginea, leading to bio-mechanical and vascular abnormalities. In the last decade numerous advances have been made regarding pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of this condition, allowing for improved patient clinical prognosis. Nevertheless, although improvements in medical and surgical therapies have substantially increased the successful patients' outcome rate, Peyronie's disease is still not completely understood and its treatment remains often frustrating for the practicing urologist. Clinical presentations of this disease include penile deformities or shortening during erection, painful erection, palpable plaque or induration throughout the length of the penile shaft and erectile dysfunction.

### New advances in Peyronie's disease [^115HAtTx]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The formation of Peyronie's disease plaques is a process that seems to involve a cascade of genetic, structural and immunologic events. Clinical manifestations include penile deformity and possible erectile dysfunction. Rational strategies have been forthcoming, with both minimally invasive and surgical treatments of Peyronie's disease available. This article reviews and updates current scientific and clinical advances in Peyronie's disease.

### Expanding the paradigm for plaque development in Peyronie's disease [^115tDbUA]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Despite centuries of recognition, Peyronie's disease remains somewhat of an enigma. Conventional wisdom suggests that trauma to the erect or semierect penis is the inciting event that sets off a cascade of events at the cellular level that results in localized fibrosis of the tunica albuginea. However, many questions remain unanswered at this juncture among the most important of which are why do so few men manifest this condition? Why is there such an ethnic predilection? What are the cofactors that along with penile trauma lead to plaque development. Historically, cytokine overexpression, autoimmune and genetic factors have been cited as contributors. This treatise endeavors to conduct an evidence-based assessment of the literature as it pertains to the pathophysiology of Peyronie's disease. Furthermore, an effort is made to evaluate contemporary literature pertaining to novel concepts in Peyronie's disease pathogenesis including NOS alterations, free radical generation, microarray analysis, pathogen involvement and animal model development. In conclusion, it is likely that in the near future we will see dramatic developments in our understanding of this condition.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^111RGfsd]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Research needs and future directions — knowledge gaps and priorities: Given its prevalence and its significant psychosocial impact, better understanding of the pathophysiology of Peyronie's disease is greatly needed; the absence of knowledge regarding what causes PD means it is not possible to advise men regarding risk factors and how the disease may be prevented and treatments remain focused on symptom alleviation rather than causal mechanisms; research endeavors in this field should continue to address multiple disciplinary areas including epidemiology, risk associations, pathophysiology, psychosocial assessment, diagnostics, clinical pharmacology and therapeutics, and health-related outcomes, and basic scientific investigation effort should be geared toward elucidating the biologic mechanisms of PD including inflammatory factors, cytokines, growth factors and other molecular factors involved in tissue injury, fibrosis and abnormal wound healing, with ongoing scientific investigation expected to suggest molecular sites that can be targeted therapeutically.

### Peyronie's disease (CME) [^111zq8ZP]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

The management of Peyronie's disease (PyD) presents several challenges to the clinician. Despite progress in the understanding of PyD on several fronts, it remains a physically and psychologically devastating condition for the affected patient and partner.

Aim

The purpose of this Continuing Medical Education article is to review contemporary knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of PyD, thus enabling best-practice management.

Methods

An English-language MEDLINE review was performed from 1990 to present-day for PyD.

Main Outcome Measure

Current state of, and new developments in, PyD.

Results

Recent studies have established a new paradigm for the natural history and epidemiology of PyD. Prevalence approaches 5%, while less than 20% of men report spontaneous resolution of deformity. The psychological sequelae on both patient and partner are underrepresented in literature; data gleaned from select Internet websites have better established Peyronie's effects on psyche and relationships. For the majority of patients, evaluation, information, and reassurance is sufficient. Few medical treatment options are supported by data from well-designed placebo-controlled trials. For men unresponsive to nonoperative therapies, plication, grafting, or implantation of a penile prosthesis are surgical management options.

Conclusions

PyD does not invariably progress to a complete loss of the ability for sexual intercourse. Should deformities preclude intercourse, well-established medical or surgical options may be considered; indeed, using one or more of the treatment approaches outlined can, in most cases, result in adequate restoration of sexual function.

### Clinical presentations of Peyronie's disease [^111wHnLo]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with Peyronie's disease usually present soon after the onset of the disease with penile pain and deformity when they develop an erection. They are middle-aged men and a palpable plaque is usually present. A good clinical history and examination are all that are necessary to manage most patients with Peyronie's disease. Further investigation is only required in those men with erectile dysfunction or where surgery is indicated.

### Comparing and contrasting Peyronie's disease guidelines: points of consensus and deviation [^111BANrA]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Peyronie's disease (PD) is a challenging clinical entity. To assist clinicians with diagnosis and management, four separate organizations have published PD guidelines over the past five years, but there remains a lack of consensus and data-driven recommendations for many aspects of diagnosis and treatment.

Aim

To compare and contrast PD guidelines, highlighting key similarities and differences among the guideline panel recommendations and identify areas for further research.

Methods

We performed an extensive review to compare and contrast diagnosis and treatment recommendations from publically available published PD guidelines from four different organizations: American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, Canadian Urologic Association, and the International Society of Sexual Medicine.

Outcomes

Key similarities and differences with regards to definition, evaluation, nonsurgical and surgical treatments were compared.

Results

Points of general consensus among the guideline panels included: History is adequate for diagnosis of PD, and intracavernosal injection is a gold standard to evaluate penile deformity prior to invasive intervention. Careful counseling with shared decision-making is required prior to treatment. In general, plication and incision and/or grafting surgery is reserved for patients with preserved erectile function whereas penile prosthesis implantation is the only surgical option for PD patients with erectile dysfunction. Overall, nonsurgical treatments have inferior evidence of efficacy with these being the main area of controversy; however, all societies recognize that intralesional injections may be used. 0Further research into the pathophysiology of PD may direct novel treatments targeted towards early intervention and rigorous outcomes research may direct best practices for the surgical treatment of PD in the future.

Clinical Implications

PD is a challenging clinical entity. Direct comparison of the published PD guidelines highlights clear standards of care as well as areas where more research is needed to promote higher levels of evidence-based practice.

Strengths & Limitations

To our knowledge this is the first report to directly compare and contrast published guidelines pertaining to the diagnosis and management of PD. Limitations include the lack of evidence-quality review pertaining to individual guideline recommendations, although this was not the aim of this review.

Conclusion

We highlight consensus of major urologic societies on many aspects of work up and management of PD with notable exceptions which may guide further research. Manka MG, White LA, Yafi FA, et al.

### Standard operating procedures for Peyronie's disease [^113bYyjt]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Peyronie's disease (PD) refers to a penile deformity that is associated with sexual dysfunction.

Aim

To provide recommendations and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) based on best evidence for diagnosis and treatment of PD.

Methods

Medical literature was reviewed and combined with expert opinion of the authors.

Main Outcome Measures

Recommendations and SOPs based on grading of evidence-based medical literature.

Results

PD is a fibrotic wound-healing disorder involving the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa. The resulting scar is responsible for a variety of deformities, including curvature, shortening, narrowing with hinge effect, and is frequently associated in the early phase with pain. Patients frequently experience diminished quality erections. All of these conditions can compromise sexual function for the affected male. The etiopathophysiology of PD has yet to be clarified and as a result, effective, reliable, mechanistic directed non-surgical therapy is lacking.

Conclusions

The management of PD consists of proper diagnosis and treatment, ranging from non-surgical to surgical interventions. The main state of treatment for PD rests at this time on surgical correction that should be based on clear indications, involve surgical consent, and follow a surgical algorithm that includes tunica plication, plaque incision/partial excision and grafting, and penile prosthesis implantation.

### Peyronie's disease [^113ggHfh]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

Peyronie's disease is a sexual medicine condition that may adversely affect male sexual function.

Aim

To provide expert opinions/recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge for the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of Peyronie's disease.

Methods

An International Consultation in collaboration with the major urology and sexual medicine associations assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topic represent the opinion of experts from five continents developed in a scientific and debate process. Concerning the Peyronnie's disease committee, there were 10 experts from six countries.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinions/recommendations are based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, extensive internal committee discussion over 2 years, public presentation and deliberation.

Results

Peyronie's disease is characterized by an inflammatory response beneath the tunica albuginea with fibroblast proliferation forming a thickened fibrous plaque that may cause penile pain, penile curvature and erectile dysfunction. Medical treatments have been described but few prospective controlled trials have revealed significant clinical benefits. Surgical treatments (penile plication, Nesbit excision, plaque incision and grafting and penile prosthesis insertion) should be considered after Peyronie's disease has stabilized. Surgical outcome studies reveal that a stable deformity is best corrected with the least postoperative ED by a Nesbit procedure. Plaque incision and grafting should be reserved for men with good erectile function and marked penile shortening although there is a higher prevalence of postoperative ED. Implantation of a penile prosthesis is an excellent option for men with an accompanying erectile deficit.

Conclusions

Safe and effective treatments for Peyronie's disease examined by prospective, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional clinical trials are needed.

### Risk factors of Peyronie's disease. what does our clinical experience show? [^111cR7FT]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Peyronie's disease (PD) is a localized fibrosis that affects the tunica albuginea of the penis. Its origin can be associated with coital penile trauma in men with autoimmune hypersensitivity and a presumed genetic predisposition.

Aim

To identify clinical and traumatic risk factors in a patient population with PD, when compared to a control group.

Methods

From November 2007 to March 2010, 317 patients sought medical attention for PD. As control group, 147 consecutive patients, who came for a prostate exam, were studied. Clinical, traumatic, and sexual history of these patients was gathered. Risks factors were considered only if they had been present before the onset of PD symptoms.

Main Outcome Measure

The International Index of Erectile Function and the International Prostate Symptoms Score. A univariate logistic regression model (chi-square) (odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals [CI]) was used to estimate the association of risk factors with PD; and the Student's t-test was implemented for age.

Results

The mean age of patients with PD and control group was 56.7 and 58.8, respectively (P < 0.923). The mean evolution time of the disease was 17.7 months (2–48). Erectile dysfunction (ED) and coital trauma constituted the only two independent risk factors for PD compared to the control group (P < 0.05 and 0.002, respectively) with an OR of 1.5 (95% CI 1.0–2.3) and 2.69 (95% CI 1.41–5.21), respectively. Patients with ED and diabetes mellitus and with a mild-to-moderate ED also presented a higher predisposition (P = 0.008 and 0.00001), with an OR of 3.64 (95% CI 1.33–10.79) and 5.58 (95% CI 3.03–10.42), respectively.

Conclusion

Erectile dysfunction and coital trauma have proven to be independent risk factors for the development of PD.

### Nonsurgical management of Peyronie's disease [^115dCmwP]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2019). High credibility.

Peyronie's disease is not a rare disorder, and it can be devastating to the affected man. Although the gold-standard treatment of Peyronie's disease is surgery in the stable phase, nonoperative management is preferred by some men and is the only treatment option in the acute phase of the disease, when surgery is contraindicated. No oral or topical therapy has been shown to be efficacious when administered alone, but some evidence supports their use as part of a combination therapy regimen. Intralesional therapies, particularly collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH), have shown promise. Mechanical therapies can provide benefit when applied for prolonged periods of time, improving penile curvature, indentation, and even restoring length. Regardless of the modality chosen, patient counselling is paramount, as recovery of the penis to its predisease state is highly unlikely. Thus, although many options exist for nonsurgical management of Peyronie's disease, surgery remains the best option for men who desire the most reliable and rapid pathway to a functionally straight, erect penis. The goal of nonsurgical therapy should be a scientifically feasible, safe approach to prevent the progression of, or reduce, deformity and improve sexual function.

### Implications of calcification in Peyronie's disease, A review of the literature [^111PxYLD]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

A common characteristic of Peyronie's Disease (PD) is plaque calcification, which is associated with decreased response to treatments and higher rates of surgical intervention. Despite its prevalence in the PD population, the literature on plaque calcification is limited. While the diagnosis of PD is mostly clinical, imaging modalities such as ultrasound can be used to identify plaque calcification. The proper identification of plaque calcification is crucial for guiding management and setting therapeutic expectations for patients with PD. Herein we discuss what is known about PD plaque calcification, including epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and management.

### A systematic review of non-surgical management in Peyronie's disease [^112KDSAR]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peyronie's disease (PD) is an acquired connective tissue disorder characterised by fibrosis of the tunica albuginea resulting in the development of penile deformity, penile pain and penile shortening. This can lead to not only sexual dysfunction, but also can be distressing for the patient, it can lead to relationship difficulties, increased anxiety over sexual performance and depression. This is compounded by a high estimated prevalence of between 3.2–11.8%, being even greater in certain subgroups such as those with diabetes mellitus (20%) and post radical prostatectomy (16%).

Whilst the exact pathophysiology of PD still remains unclear, it is believed microvascular trauma, initiated by penile damage during sexual activity or due to repetitive minor trauma, leading to increased proliferation of fibroblasts and recruitment of profibrotic mediators leads to an excessive deposition of collagen. This later remodels into a dense fibrotic plaque causing the onset of penile curvature. It is the disruption of this proposed pathway, that a number of the medical therapies have attempted to target.

However, the role of non-surgical treatments in both the acute and chronic setting remains unclear. The mainstay of treatment of PD remains focussed on the surgical correction of the penile deformity that develops once the patient is in the chronic phase. Yet, the desire to modify and influence the development of the plaque in the acute setting, preventing its development and effect on penile form and function is high. A wide range of options have been trialled to date, ranging from mechanical traction devices, intralesional injections, oral medication and atherotic treatment modalities. However, findings for the effectiveness of each remains varied with previous reviews focusing on individual modalities alone. Therefore, this systematic review aims to:
Identify current non-surgical treatment options for PD.
Assess the evidence for the effectiveness of the identified non-surgical therapy.
Provide recommendations for treatment based on the critical analysis of the current evidence base.

### Critical analysis of surgery for Peyronie's disease [^113j87NZ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on the surgical management of Peyronie's disease in the light of recent published reports from 2003 and 2004.

Recent Findings

Although there have been a number of non-surgical innovations in this field, the surgical treatment of Peyronie's disease still remains the only alternative for patients not responding to other therapies. Various surgical modalities have recently been promulgated, however the ideal surgical procedure is still not perfected, particularly in cases of severe and complex penile curvature. The recent results of various surgical approaches have engendered concern about their long term benefits.

Summary

The initial management of the acute presentation of Peyronie's disease is conservative and non-surgical. Surgery for Peyronie's disease is contemplated only after stabilization of the fibrotic process, and is generally reserved for men with severe penile deformities that impede satisfactory sexual intercourse. If there is ample penile length and the deformity is mild to moderate in severity, a variety of plication techniques may be considered to provide a straight and functional penis. In patients with larger plaques, severe curvature, complete or hourglass deformities, then incision or excision of the plaque and the placement of a graft are recommended. Most authorities currently favor non-synthetic graft materials whose properties resemble the anatomy and functionality of the tunica albuginea. The implantation of a penile prosthesis, with or without excision/incision of the diseased tunica albuginea, is reserved for patients with erectile dysfunction who have not responded to medical therapies. Manual modeling of the deformed penis over a penile prosthesis may prevent some patients from needing more complex surgical grafting procedures.

### Peyronie's disease following radical prostatectomy: incidence and predictors [^1119LzU2]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Both prostate cancer and Peyronie's disease (PD) are prevalent in men after their fifth decade of life. The evidence to support or refute a link between radical prostatectomy (RP) and PD is limited.

Aims

To define the incidence of PD in men who had RP and determine possible predictors of PD development after RP.

Methods

A review of a prospectively built sexual medicine database, years 2002–2008, looking at subjects who had RP as a monotherapy for localized prostate cancer. We identified and characterized subjects who developed PD within 3 years after RP and compared them with subjects who did not.

Main Outcome Measures

The incidence of PD among men who attended a sexual medicine clinic after they had RP, predictors of PD development after RP.

Results

The study population included 1,011 subjects, and PD incidence in this population was 15.9%. Mean time to develop PD after RP was 13.9 ± 0.7 months. Mean curvature magnitude was 31 ± 17 degrees. On univariate analysis, younger age (mean age of 59 + 7 in men with PD vs. 60 + 7 years in men without PD, P = 0.006) and white race (vs non-white, 18% vs. 7%, P < 0.001) were predictive of PD development after RP, but post-op erectile function was not a predictor of PD development. On multivariate analysis, younger age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.3, for 5-year decrease in age) and white race (OR = 4.1, vs. non-white) remained independent significant predictors.

Conclusions

Men presenting with sexual dysfunction after RP have higher PD incidence then the general population. Therefore, they should be routinely evaluated for PD. Younger men and men of white race are at increased risk for PD. Prospective controlled studies are needed to elucidate the incidence of PD following RP and to conclude if RP has a causative role in the pathogenesis of PD.

### Epidemiology of Peyronie's disease [^117AggiP]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2002). Low credibility.

Francois Gigot de la Peyronie, surgeon to Louis XV of France, has become synonymous with the rather enigmatic though not uncommon condition of Peyronie's disease (PD), a localized connective tissue disorder of the penile tunica albuginea. The true prevalence of Peyronie's disease is unknown. Therefore, we decided to perform an evaluation of existing epidemiological data. A prevalence rate of 3.2% was determined in male inhabitants of the greater Cologne area. This is much higher than revealed by the data reported up to now, thus rendering the accepted prevalence rates of 0.3% to 1% untenable. The actual prevalence of Peyronie's disease may be even higher, considering many patients' reluctance to report this embarrassing condition to their physicians. Along these lines, most clinicians note that the number of Peyronie's patients has increased since the advent of oral sildenafil. Comparably high prevalences are known for diabetes and urolithiasis, suggesting a greater frequency of this rare disease than formerly believed.

### Regional variation in the incidence and prevalence of Peyronie's disease in the United States-results from an encounters and claims database [^112u9tc3]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In recent years there have been more studies dedicated to Peyronie's disease (PD). However, prevalence and incidence are likely underestimated, with limited information on regional variation in the rate of diagnosis. In this study, we sought to estimate age and regional variation of the annual incidence and prevalence of PD in the United States. We reviewed data from the IBM MarketScan™ Claims and Encounters database between 2008–2017 for men ≥ 18 years. Inclusion required ≥ 1 medical claim with PD, identified by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes or ≥ 1 claim for intralesional injection for PD, identified by Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) code. Overall average annual incidence was estimated at 20.9 cases per 100,000, with the highest rate of 41.6 cases per 100,000 observed in men 55–64 years (RR = 8.2; p < 0.0001). Geographically, the highest incidence rate was observed in the South (23.9 cases per 100,000 men; RR = 1.30; p < 0.0001). Across all ages, overall prevalence of PD showed a general upward trend, from 0.052% in 2008 to 0.096% in 2017. Our findings suggest men in the southern U.S. are diagnosed more with PD compared to other regions. Identification of associated factors may allow for a more proactive approach to diagnosis and management.

### Peyronie's disease: a critical appraisal of current diagnosis and treatment [^112z75QB]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2008). Low credibility.

Peyronie's disease is a fibrotic disorder of the tunica albuginea of the penis resulting in varying degrees of penile curvature and sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis of the disorder is made by detailed sexual history and focused physical examination. A wide range of medical treatments has been employed to treat the disorder. Verapamil treatment administered by intraplaque injection is supported by generally consistent randomized controlled trials (RCT). Some RCT evidence exists to support the use of colchicine, potaba, L-carnitine and liposomal superoxide dismutase. Future studies of medical efficacy should focus on improving RCT design, implementation and results reporting to improve the quality of evidence generated by each study. The surgical treatment of Peyronie's disease is a viable and recommended alternative for men with compromised sexual function due to severe curvature or lesions causing penile instability. The choice of corrective procedure should be tailored to each patient after a detailed evaluation of disease severity and sexual function.

### Establishing a standardized evaluation of the man with Peyronie's disease [^115tMPn9]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

The goal of this article is to encourage development of a standardized approach to the evaluation of the man with Peyronie's disease. An additional aim is to identify those subjective and objective measures of change occurring as a result of treatment which would allow uniform reporting of treatment outcome. Systematic review of current clinical parameters used in assessing the man with Peyronie's disease including demographic data, physical findings, objective measures of penile deformity and erectile function as well as questionnaires employed to gain more reliable subjective data. As there is no accepted standard approach or previously published analysis of existing approaches, a survey of 68 recently published articles is included to query current outcome reporting on Peyronie's disease therapy. Results were as follows. An algorithm is suggested as an initial format for evaluation and outcome analysis. The pros and cons of subjective and objective measures of penile deformity is presented and a standardized questionnaire and penile duplex ultrasound report form is included for current use. The literature survey revealed the broad unscientific approach to outcome reporting making assessment of treatment quite difficult. In conclusion, it is clear that it is time to establish a standardized and globally acceptable evaluation and outcome reporting algorithm. There is interest to develop and validate a specific Peyronie's disease index questionnaire. In the meantime, this article presents specific recommendations to obtaining meaningful objective measures and methods to report them.

### Peyronie's disease intervention trials: methodological challenges and issues [^115u89xG]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Peyronie's Disease (PD) has been studied for more than 260 years since Francois de la Peyronie's description in 1743. Based on the current literature, the prevalence of PD seems 3–9% with an average age of onset in the fifth life decade. Much effort has been spent on developing nonsurgical treatment options to cure or at least prevent disease progression.

Aim

The recent examination of drug trials for erectile dysfunction has led us to assess PD trial methodology more closely.

Methods

An Iinternet search on PubMed was performed using MeSH words PD, clinical trials, oral, transdermal, intralesional and shock wave therapy focusing on 26 representing studies published over the last 15 years. Mean Outcome Measures. A comprehensive review of the current literature on nonsurgical treatment options for PD was conducted to address methodological issues and challenges in PD trials highlighting trial design, patient population, and symptom and sign assessment.

Results

The majority of the reviewed studies are underpowered and the heterogeneity in the methodological approach and patient assessment between the studies is one of the remarkable findings from our review. Studies should use a uniform means of defining the degree and type of penile deformity and a large enough cohort of patients should be studied for adequate study power. An ideally designed PD intervention trial should comprise: (i) a randomized, placebo-controlled design; (ii) with a PD patient set representative of the general PD population; and (iii) a comprehensive symptom and sign assessment before and at the end of treatment which includes an assessment of at least deformity, pain, and sexual function.

Conclusion

A number of challenges exist for the design of PD intervention trials and deciphering the data generated from them. The field would benefit greatly from a consensus statement or guidelines development on the design and conduct of such trials.

Assessment of sexual function is of particular importance and penile sensation, ejaculatory function, erectile function, difficulty/pain with penile penetration, and concerns regarding penile length and girth should be assessed; the goal of the examination is to provide baseline values that document the presence of deformity, the point of maximum curvature, presence/location/size of penile plaque(s), penile length, and areas of tenderness. For patients and/or partners with significant distress, consideration should be given for referral to a mental health professional with expertise in sexuality.

### Oral therapy for Peyronie's disease [^113gtq3g]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2002). Low credibility.

Peyronie's disease (PD) remains a therapeutic dilemma for the urologist. Despite a myriad of medical therapies proposed for PD there have been limited advances in oral medical treatment. Several new approaches are presented which hold promise of success, although a definitive medical therapy for PD has yet to be established. Since early stage disease is reputed to respond better than well-established plaques, an early trial of inexpensive, safe and well-tolerated oral therapy is often initially recommended. This review discusses the historical aspects as well as contemporary oral medical therapy for PD. With advances in the molecular biology of inflammation and wound healing, the management and understanding of this frustrating disease will no doubt improve.

### A contemporary assessment of the evaluation and management of patients presenting to a tertiary medical center with Peyronie's disease [^112jgj4i]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease continues to be poorly understood. We characterize the presenting features of Peyronie's disease within a large cohort and elucidate the factors that correlate with surgical intervention. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on 1483 consecutive patients to assess pre-operative predictors of surgical intervention for Peyronie's disease. Overall, 1263 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 55.4 ± 11.1 years with a mean duration of disease at presentation of 33.2 ± 42.5 months. Mean primary curvature was 49.8 ± 20.8°. Primary ventral curvature was present in 11.4% and 36.5% of patient had a multiplanar curvature. During penile duplex ultrasound evaluation indentation/narrowing deformities were appreciated in 76.0%, hourglass deformity in 10.1%, and hinge effect in 33.0% of patients. Calcification was seen in 30.1% of patients. Operative intervention occurred in 35.3% of patients. Degree of primary curvature (1.03 OR, p < 0.001), hourglass deformity (1.82 OR, p = 0.01), decreased tunical elasticity (1.20 OR, p = 0.03), and prior intralesional collagenase clostridium histolyticum injections (2.94 OR, p < 0.001) predicted surgical correction on multivariate analysis. Compared to historical studies, we found a higher incidence of severe degree of curvature (27.5% > 60°), indentation deformities, hinge-effect, multiplanar curvature and penile calcifications. Ultimately, predictors of surgical intervention included those with worse erectile function and more severe characteristics.

This cohort study assesses the risk of developing auto-immune conditions and common chronic health conditions after a diagnosis of PD. We hypothesize that an increase in auto-immune disease will be evident in men with PD, as has been suggested in smaller studies.

Methods

We determined the longitudinal incidence of 13 auto-immune diseases and 25 common chronic conditions in a cohort from the Truven Health Analytics (Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) database from 2007–2013. The cohort included men with 1 of 3 exposures in 2007: (1) men with PD, (2) men with erectile dysfunction (ED) but not PD, and (3) men without PD or ED, matched on age and follow-up duration.

Outcomes

To assess incidence, we utilized a Cox regression model adjusting for age, smoking, obesity, health care visits per year, urology visits per year, and years of follow-up.

Results

We included 8,728 men with PD; 204,147 men with ED; and 87,280 controls. Men with PD had an increased risk of developing benign prostatic hyperplasia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95% CI 1.16–1.27), prostatitis (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.12–1.31), and lower urinary tract symptoms (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05–1.16) when compared to both men with ED and age-matched controls without ED or PD even when controlling for the number of urology visits per year. Compared to controls, men with PD also had an increased risk of developing keloids. No significant risk for any auto-immune disease was observed.

Clinical Implications

Clinicians should have heightened awareness for these relevant co-morbidities when treating men with PD.

Strengths & Limitations

Utilizing a claims database provides one of the largest cohorts of men with PD ever published but claims databases lack some individual patient data such as risk factors and demographic information relevant to PD, including: penile injury, history of urologic procedures, and other lifestyle factors.

Conclusion

Men with PD had a higher risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, prostatitis, and keloids after a diagnosis of PD, but no increased risk of auto-immune conditions. These findings suggest a common etiology for these conditions that may manifest itself in diseases at different times in men's life cycle. Pastuszak AW, Rodriguez KM, Solomon ZJ, et al.

### The role of imaging in the diagnosis and management of Peyronie's disease [^114SV7Rn]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Several imaging modalities exist for the assessment of Peyronie's disease. However, comprehensive recommendations for using these objective modalities based on large-scale evidence-based studies do not yet exist. Our objective is to evaluate current imaging techniques and provide a model that we follow in our clinic in the workup and management of Peyronie's disease.

Recent Findings

Computed tomography and radiography excellently visualize penile plaque calcifications, and MRI adeptly identifies plaques in complex locations, such as the corporal septum. Ultrasonography has extensive applications in plaque localization and characterization. Used along with color Doppler ultrasound, it is capable of detecting vascular abnormalities. Sonoelastography is an emerging subtype of ultrasongraphy that utilizes elastic properties of tissue to identify penile plaques that may not be visualized with other modalities.

Summary

Ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in Peyronie's disease and noninvasively characterizes penile plaques and monitors plaque response to various treatments. At our center, we perform ultrasonography with intracavernosal injection in all patients with Peyronie's disease to evaluate the degree of curvature, plaque characteristics, and concomitant erectile dysfunction to better guide management decisions.

### Peyronie's disease and risk of depression. A nationwide 25-year cohort study [^112f9ZRG]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Peyronie's disease leads to penile deformities and can cause physical symptoms, for example, penile pain, and erectile dysfunction, along with psychological issues, such as depressive symptoms.

Aim

The aim of this study was to investigate whether men with Peyronie's disease have an increased risk of depression.

Methods

This nationwide cohort study included men with Peyronie's disease (ICD-10 code: N486) from 1997 to 2021 and age-matched (1:10) men without Peyronie's disease. We obtained complete medical history before the Peyronie's disease diagnosis/index date. We followed both cohorts for depression. We computed the cumulative incidence of depression at 5 and 10 years of follow-up and estimated hazard ratios for depression comparing the 2 cohorts while adjusting for selected chronic diseases using Cox regression.

Outcome

The primary outcome, depression, was defined by ICD-10 code: F32, F33 recorded in the Danish National Patient Registry or the Psychiatric Central Research Registry and/or redemption of at least 2 prescriptions for an antidepressant (ATC-code: N06A).

Results

We included 10053 men with Peyronie's disease and 100530 without (median age 55.6 years). At the index date, 19.6% men with Peyronie's disease had depression versus 14.0% men without. At baseline, men with Peyronie's disease had a 5-year risk of depression of 7.0% versus 4.4% in men without, while the 10-year risks were 12.5% and 8.7%, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.42 (95% CI, 1.32, 1.52). Men with Peyronie's disease had a 10-year all-cause mortality of 5.9%, while it was 9.1% in men without.

Clinical Implications

Health professionals should ensure that men with Peyronie's disease are examined for depression.

Strengths and Limitations

A limitation of our study is the potential underdiagnosis of men with Peyronie's disease, which may lead to an incorrect estimation of depression among Peyronie's disease patients. It is a strength that we include a nationwide cohort of men with Peyronie's disease and age-matched controls. Other strengths are that we included information from several Danish medical databases and depression was defined as a clinic diagnosis and/or redemption of at least 2 prescriptions for an antidepressant.

Conclusions

Men with Peyronie's disease had a higher prevalence of depression at the time of diagnosis and a higher risk of depression following diagnosis compared with men without.

### Review of non-surgical treatment options for Peyronie's disease [^114pg8P6]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2011). Low credibility.

Non-surgical treatment of Peyronie's disease (PD) has come a long way since it was first described in 1743. A myriad of treatment options are currently available, including oral, intralesional and external energy therapies. The purpose of this article is to review the contemporary literature on non-surgical therapies for PD, and where possible, focus on randomized, placebo-controlled trials, as well as review the latest guidelines for the management of PD from the International Committee on Sexual Medicine, which conveyed its findings in July 2009. At this time, it appears that a combination of oral agents and/or intralesional injection with traction therapy may provide a synergy between the chemical effects of the drugs and the mechanical effects of traction. Until a reliable treatment emerges, it does appear that some of the non-surgical treatments discussed can be used to stabilize the scarring process and may result in some reduction of deformity with improved sexual function.

Peyronie's disease — American Urological Association (AUA) methodology links recommendation statements to the balance of benefits and risks and to evidence strength. Strong Recommendation indicates "Benefits > Risks/ Burdens (or vice versa)" with "Net benefit (or net harm) is substantial", and applicability/confidence statements include "Applies to most patients in most circumstances and future research is unlikely to change confidence", "Applies to most patients in most circumstances but better evidence could change confidence", and "Applies to most patients in most circumstances but better evidence is likely to change confidence (rarely used to support a Strong Recommendation)". Moderate Recommendation retains "Benefits > Risks/ Burdens (or vice versa)" but with "Net benefit (or net harm) is moderate". Conditional Recommendation reflects "Benefits = Risks/ Burdens" with "Best action depends on individual patient circumstances", for intermediate certainty "Best action appears to depend on individual patient circumstances", and at lowest certainty "Balance between Benefits & Risks/Burdens unclear" and "Alternative strategies may be equally reasonable". Non-evidence–based statement types are defined as follows: Clinical Principle is "A statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature", and Expert Opinion is "A statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there is no evidence".

### Surgical approaches for advanced Peyronie's disease patients [^113Sn7js]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Surgical therapy for Peyronie's disease (PD) is reserved for patients with severe penile deformity that fails to improve with medical treatment and impedes sexual intercourse. The surgical treatment of PD consists of either correction of the penile deformity or insertion of a penile prosthesis in patients with concomitant erectile dysfunction (ED). Plaque incision/excision combined with grafting procedures or plication techniques are suitable in Peyronie's patients having an adequate penile vascular supply. When patients with Peyronie's disease have both penile deformity and ED, penile prosthesis implantation with or without excision or incision of the tunica is the current standard of care.

Peyronie disease (PD) is an incurable, sexually debilitating disease resulting in penile deformity, coital failure, and significant psychological stress for patients and their partners. Appropriate treatment should be individualized and tailored to the patient's goals and expectations, disease history, physical examination findings, and erectile function. After medical therapy is considered and the disease has stabilized, surgical correction, including tunical shortening or lengthening procedures, is an excellent option for patients with functional impairment caused by PD. Outcomes are satisfactory when proper treatment decisions are made, with the goal being expected return to normal sexual function following PD treatment.

### Prevalence of Peyronie's disease in men over 50-y-old from Southern Brazil [^117Pvqvc]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2001). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of Peyronie's disease still remains an enigma and few epidemiological studies are available. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Peyronie's disease in males older than 50 y. From 26 to 30 July 1998, 1071 men attended the 'Prostate Cancer Awareness Week of Santa Casa Hospital, Porto Alegre, Brazil'. In the prostate exam they also consented to be screened for Peyronie's disease. They underwent the 5-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire for evaluation of the erectile condition. The presence of a well-defined plaque in the penis was the diagnostic criterion for Peyronie's disease. The men were examined by five senior residents, under supervision by the staff Urologist. Men younger than 50 y as well as patients under intracavernous injection therapy for erectile dysfunction were excluded from the study. χ² test was used for statistical analysis. Nine hundred and fifty-four (89.1%) out of the 1071 men with a mean age of 62 y (ranging from 52 to 77) were included in the study. Peyronie's disease plaques were found in 35 men (3.67%). Eight hundred and forty-five (88.6%) were Caucasians. There was no significant statistical difference regarding age (P > 0.05). The presence of erectile dysfunction in the men with Peyronie's disease and without this condition, was 68.6% and 53.5%, respectively (P > 0.05). From this data we can conclude that the prevalence of Peyronie's disease is higher than in formerly reported studies. Further observations should be carried out in different communities and in other groups of patients in order to confirm our results.

### A systematic review of non-surgical management in Peyronie's disease [^111C3GNv]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of many non-surgical treatments for Peyronie's disease is unclear. This systematic review aims to critically assess the currently available options and provide a recommendation for treatment based on this. A systematic literature search utilising the Medline (Pubmed), Embase, global health and Cochrane library databases was conducted up to May 2021. All randomised controlled trials assessing non-surgical treatment modalities for Peyronie's Disease were included. Individual study risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane tool and GRADE was used to assess evidence strength. Outcome measures were the change in penile curvature (degrees), plaque size (volume or size), International Index of Erectile Function score, pain scores and change in penile length. Prospero registration number: CRD42017064618. Amongst the 5549 articles identified, 41 studies (42 reports) were included. Seven different oral treatment options including vitamin E supplementation showed evidence for improving outcomes such as penile curvature and plaque size. Of the intralesional treatments, Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum showed evidence for improving penile curvature (Range: 16.3–17 degrees, moderate level certainty of evidence). Intralesional Interferon demonstrated some improvement in curvature (Range: 12–13.5 degrees), plaque size (Range: 1.67–2.2 cm²) and pain, whilst intralesional calcium channel blockers such as Verapamil showed variable evidence for changes in the plaque size and pain. Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy consistently demonstrated evidence for improving penile pain in stable disease, and two mechanical traction devices improved curvature. Iontophoresis, topical medications, and combination therapies did not demonstrate any consistent improvements in outcome measures. Intralesional options demonstrate the best potential. Overall, results varied with few high-quality randomised trials present.

### Superficial radiation therapy in Peyronie's disease: an effective and well-tolerated therapy [^1111SK65]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Peyronie's disease (PD) is a connective tissue disorder that is characterized by the formation of fibrotic plaques in the penile tunica albuginea. The plaques generate typical PD symptoms such as induration, deviation, pain during sexual intercourse, or even erectile dysfunction. Prevalence is estimated between 3.2% and 11% depending on patient age, geographic region, and comorbidities in men. The etiology is not clear, but it is assumed that microtraumas of the penile tunica albuginea, which are acquired during sexual intercourse, can cause the disease. Similar to wound healing disorders and dermatofibrotic disease such as keloids, the pathway of fibrosis is initiated.

Although many therapies have been established, no curative treatment is known and therapy outcome is not satisfactory for the majority of patients. Therapies for early PD including oral medication and penile injections show moderate success and efficacy. In advanced cases, surgical interventions are applied. Currently, surgery and collagenase injections are the most recommended therapy options for patients with PD, but if PD is still in the early stages, superficial radiation therapy is an effective and well-tolerated therapy option.

### Updated recommendations on the therapeutic role of extracorporeal shock wave therapy for Peyronie's disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138p1gc]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Peyronie's disease (PD) is an abnormal fibrotic disease of the tunica albuginea that manifests as the local formation of fibrotic plaques in the penis. The disease causes penile deformities such as curve and shortening, accompanied by sexual intercourse disorder and pain, its prevalence rate is about 3–9% worldwide, and its impact is more significant for men over 40 years old. The disease also affects the quality of life (QoL) of patients and their partners, causing depression. The pathophysiological mechanism of its pathogenesis is still unclear. One widely accepted theory is that repeated sexual intercourse causes slight damage to the tunica albuginea, leading to fibrin deposition, inducing chronic inflammation, and ultimately leading to penile deformity. The uncertainty of the pathogenesis leads to the diversification of treatment options.

Surgical intervention is the main method to correct penis deformity and improve symptoms, but it carries the risks associated with postoperative penile shortening as well as intraoperative anesthesia. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) is a safe nonsurgical modality of treatment that has been used for the first time since 1989. There is evidence that ESWT promotes wound healing in soft tissues. There are multiple hypotheses about the mechanism of its therapeutic effect, the first hypothesis indicates that ESWT may act by directly disrupting and remodeling plaques; the second hypothesis proposes that ESWT may generate heat locally, leading to an active inflammatory response with increased macrophage activity and subsequent plaque dissolution and absorption.

Previous studies have shown that the use of ESWT provides short-term relief of symptoms such as pain and sexual intercourse disorder, but controversy exists regarding the long-term improvement effect of penile curvature as well as plaque. And assessment of the long-term efficacy of ESWT and the progression of the disease course in the stable stage of PD is currently lacking. Only two meta-analyses of this study have been published in recent years, but their evaluation criteria and final conclusions were not consistent, and the included articles were of low quality with insufficient level of evidence and did not clearly state the applicability of ESWT in PD patients. The therapeutic effect of ESWT on some symptoms remains to be verified.

Our aim is to use the updated clinical trial data to reevaluate the efficacy of ESWT in reducing penile curvature, reducing plaque size, improving sexual function and alleviating pain in PD patients compared with placebo (sham treatment), and to assess the risk of complications.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^114MMjvC]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease — clinical research methodology and outcome measurement should address natural history, control groups, placebo effects, sample size/replication, and validated metrics. Studies should recognize that 'PD is characterized by symptoms that change over time and that some symptoms will resolve in the absence of treatment', and that 'In the absence of a control for the natural history of PD, findings from observational studies are of limited value'. For pain, placebo control is crucial because 'some PD symptoms – such as pain — are highly susceptible to placebo effects' and 'It is not possible to know with certainty whether a new therapy reliably decreases pain in the absence of a placebo control group'. Given variability, 'findings from studies that have small sample sizes – even well-designed studies – potentially lack generalizability because of the inherent instability of findings derived from small numbers of patients', and 'Replication of findings is critical before new therapies can be offered with confidence'. For measurement, 'PD studies must use validated measures of objective and subjective outcomes', and 'Objectively measured outcomes, such as degree of curvature or plaque characteristics or penile dimensions or ED, are critically important to establish that a therapy is effective in reducing these manifestations of PD'. Symptom quantification is supported, as 'Pain can be measured validly using visual analog scales'. At the time of guideline development, 'measures of patient symptomatology and distress (i.e., the PDQ) were not fully validated for use in clinical settings', therefore 'the Panel emphasizes the need to query patients regarding distress as part of baseline evaluation and follow-up'. Because patient estimates can be inaccurate, 'patient perceptions of changes in deformity and penile dimensions are not reliable indicators of objective changes', and 'documentation of objective outcomes is critical to provide patients with information regarding actual changes in curvature and penile dimensions'. Finally, 'the assessment of benefit for a proposed therapy should be based on establishing clinically meaningful change measures, whether they are objectively or subjectively measured'.

### Intraoperative methods for residual curvature correction during penile prosthesis implantation in patients with Peyronie's disease and refractory erectile dysfunction [^115jRbip]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease, or fibrous transformations of the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa that cause penile curvature, is estimated to affect 3.2–8.9% of the male population. Treatment options for PD are based on the severity of the penile deformity and erectile function; of which surgical options include manual modeling during penile prosthesis implantation, plication, plaque incision, and grafting. Multiple approaches may be employed; each with its own advantages, limitations, and risk/benefit ratios. In this regard, we sought to review and highlight the current approaches for the management of residual curvature, optimal patient selection, and preoperative planning.

### Review of current nonsurgical management of Peyronie's disease [^116SaoWG]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

The current nonsurgical treatment options for men with Peyronie's disease is reviewed. The treatments currently employed and published in the English literature are discussed. A wide variety of nonsurgical treatment options are available to the practicing physician, including oral and topical medications, intralesional injection therapy, as well as employing external energy sources to drive medicine into the tunica albuginea by iontophoresis or direct stimulation of plaque change by shock wave therapy. Nonsurgical treatment of Peyronie's disease clearly has a place in the armamentarium of the practicing urologist. Oral therapy appears to have little therapeutic benefit. Injection and topical approaches deserve further attention. Yet, no single treatment stands out as the most effective remedy for all men with Peyronie's disease. Further controlled, large-scale studies are necessary to establish the benefits of these nonsurgical approaches. In the meantime, combination therapy appears to make sense in the nonsurgical treatment of men with Peyronie's disease.

### Family practice international… [^112YRxn7]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Peyronie's Disease Patients with Peyronie's disease develop thick plaques on the dorsal shaft of the penis, resulting in painful erection. These plaques can also lead to fibrous scarring and curvature of the penis. The condition occurs in about 1 percent of men, most of whom are middle aged. The most widely-used opioids are codeine and morphine. They should be provided in adequate doses to control pain and scheduled on a regular basis, not given "as needed. " About seven doses are needed to reach the steady-state of effect, depending on whether the formulation is immediate or slow release. Initial nausea often resolves during the first few days, but the patient may need to use antiemetics. Traveling Abroad Safely Physicians should advise prospective travelers to avoid risk-taking behavior while visiting other countries. About 25 percent of all deaths of U. S.

citizens who travel to other countries are caused by accidents. The leading causes of accidental deaths in tourists are motor vehicle crashes, drowning and homicide. The rate of traffic accidents in many developing countries is very high. Exacerbating factors include alcohol use and vehicles that are overloaded and poorly maintained. Unsafe sexual practices while overseas are common among young male tourists and military personnel. In surveys of two military groups, 50 percent of each group reported visiting prostitutes and, of these, only 25 to 50 percent reported consistent use of condoms. The risk of infection with a sexually transmitted disease is particularly high in parts of Asia and in some African and Caribbean countries. Rates of human immunodeficiency virus infection among prostitutes include 81 percent in Kenya, 69 percent in Haiti and 44 percent in Thailand.
