## Question

Zetia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Zetia (ezetimibe), focusing on what it is, how it works, labeled indications and dosing, efficacy including combination therapy and cardiovascular outcomes, safety, contraindications, special populations, and how guidelines position it, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and basic pharmacology. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and its clinical implications. Next, I will review labeled indications and dosing. After that, I need to examine efficacy data, including monotherapy and combination therapy, and confirm cardiovascular outcomes. I will then assess safety, contraindications, and special populations. Finally, I should align the synthesis with guideline-based positioning and provide a concise clinical takeaway with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and core pharmacology. Zetia is the brand name for ezetimibe, a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor that reduces LDL-C by blocking intestinal uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol, with a fixed dose of 10 mg once daily and no dose adjustment needed for renal impairment, which I should double-check against the FDA label to ensure accuracy [^117Lh9gM] [^116SqFdA] [^113qkMvn].

> I will now examine the mechanism of action. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the sterol transporter NPC1L1, decreasing intestinal cholesterol delivery to the liver, which reduces hepatic cholesterol stores and upregulates LDL receptors, thereby increasing plasma LDL clearance; importantly, it does not inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis or increase bile acid excretion, which distinguishes it from statins and supports complementary combination therapy, and I should confirm that this is consistent with both the standalone ezetimibe and fixed-dose combination labels [^113MZDtt] [^113f48CJ] [^117KA4Ci].

> Next, I should review labeled indications and dosing. Ezetimibe is indicated to reduce elevated LDL-C in adults with primary hyperlipidemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, either as monotherapy when additional LDL-C lowering is needed or in combination with a statin; it is also indicated with a statin for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and with fenofibrate for mixed hyperlipidemia, and for homozygous familial sitosterolemia to reduce elevated plant sterols; the recommended dose is 10 mg orally once daily, with or without food, and I need to ensure I note the separation from bile acid sequestrants by at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after to avoid impaired absorption [^116MnKfT] [^117Lh9gM] [^116CtQfz].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric use. For heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, ezetimibe in combination with a statin is indicated in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older, and for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and sitosterolemia, use is supported from age 10 and 9 years, respectively; I should confirm these age thresholds against the label and pediatric guidance to avoid overgeneralization [^116MnKfT] [^117ATaVu].

> Now, I will assess efficacy as monotherapy. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of LDL-C reduction. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that ezetimibe 10 mg daily lowers LDL-C by about 18–20% over 12 weeks, with favorable effects on total cholesterol, Apo B, and modest HDL increases, and the maximal effect is typically achieved within 2 weeks and sustained with continued therapy; I should double-check that the time-to-effect and magnitude are consistent across FDA labeling and meta-analytic data [^1148fV6m] [^115tMsyg] [^112LxuBB].

> Next, I should review combination therapy with statins. Adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy provides an additional LDL-C reduction of roughly 15–25%, with consistent effects across different statins; clinically, this often achieves greater LDL-C goal attainment at lower statin doses, which can mitigate dose-related adverse effects; I need to ensure I cite both mechanistic plausibility and trial data showing incremental reductions and improved goal attainment [^113DbuBg] [^11764zMU] [^1132eMY7].

> I will now examine cardiovascular outcomes. The IMPROVE-IT trial in post–acute coronary syndrome patients showed that adding ezetimibe to simvastatin reduced LDL-C to a median of 53.2 mg/dL versus 69.9 mg/dL with simvastatin alone and produced a modest but statistically significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, aligning with the expectation from LDL-C lowering; broader meta-analyses corroborate reductions in nonfatal MI and nonfatal stroke without clear effects on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, so I should be careful not to overstate mortality benefits [^112BvZ71] [^116kCpeb] [^113UCpzm].

> Let me consider safety next. Common adverse effects include nasopharyngitis, fatigue, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms; clinically important liver enzyme elevations are uncommon but occur more frequently when ezetimibe is combined with statins, so I should confirm that baseline and symptom-triggered liver enzyme checks are reasonable, especially in combination therapy; rare postmarketing reports include myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, typically in the setting of concomitant statins or fibrates, and large safety meta-analyses show little to no increase in serious adverse events versus control, including no signal for cancer, fractures, neurocognitive events, or new-onset diabetes, though I should acknowledge the limitations of rare-event detection [^116nqbfZ] [^111mgnbQ] [^1117en9U] [^112r4wf8].

> But wait, what about hepatic impairment and special populations. I should confirm that ezetimibe is not recommended in moderate to severe hepatic impairment due to unknown effects of increased exposure, whereas no dose adjustment is needed in renal impairment; in older adults, efficacy and safety appear comparable to younger patients, though clinical judgment remains essential, and in pregnancy and lactation, data are limited and risk–benefit discussions are warranted given the lack of robust human data [^116SqFdA] [^111GFgDZ] [^111jcFBW].

> I need to check contraindications and key drug interactions. Ezetimibe is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or excipients, and when used with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-lowering therapy, it is contraindicated in patients for whom those partner therapies are contraindicated; cyclosporine increases ezetimibe exposure, and bile acid sequestrants reduce absorption, necessitating the 2-hour before or 4-hour after separation, which I should explicitly note to avoid practical errors [^116Ccom4] [^117Lh9gM].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning. Contemporary guidelines position ezetimibe as a second-line agent for LDL-C lowering, particularly for patients who are statin intolerant or who fail to reach LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statins; risk-stratified recommendations suggest adding ezetimibe in high and very high cardiovascular risk patients, with shared decision-making emphasized given modest absolute benefits and patient preferences, and I should confirm that this aligns with ACC and ESC/EAS guidance and the BMJ Rapid Recommendation [^113QRWv6] [^112SYNSK].

> Let me synthesize the clinical role. Ezetimibe is a well-tolerated, mechanistically complementary nonstatin that provides approximately 18–20% LDL-C reduction as monotherapy and an additional 15–25% when added to statins, with a modest but real reduction in nonfatal cardiovascular events in secondary prevention populations; it is particularly useful for statin-intolerant patients, those needing incremental LDL-C lowering to reach targets, and selected high-risk primary prevention settings, while avoiding use in moderate to severe hepatic impairment and ensuring appropriate monitoring in combination regimens [^114BHA5T] [^112BvZ71] [^113UCpzm].

> Finally, I should double-check the practical pearls. Use ezetimibe 10 mg once daily, with or without food, separate from bile acid sequestrants by at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after, reassess LDL-C about 4 weeks after initiation or changes, and maintain vigilance for muscle symptoms when combined with statins or fibrates; these steps align with label instructions and common practice patterns and help ensure both efficacy and safety in routine care [^117Lh9gM] [^113rQJgE].

Zetia (ezetimibe) is a **cholesterol absorption inhibitor** that lowers LDL-C by ~18–25% as monotherapy [^114BHA5T] and by an additional ~15–20% when added to statins [^113Pgdw6], with maximal effect within 2 weeks [^1148fV6m]. It is indicated for primary hyperlipidemia, HeFH, HoFH, and sitosterolemia, and is **first-line add-on therapy** when statins are insufficient or not tolerated [^113QRWv6]. Ezetimibe reduces cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, revascularization) in high-risk patients [^116kCpeb] [^113UCpzm] but has minimal effect on mortality [^116kCpeb]. Common adverse effects include nasopharyngitis, myalgia, and elevated liver enzymes; rare myopathy/rhabdomyolysis can occur, especially with statins or fibrates [^116nqbfZ] [^115kJsPt]. No dose adjustment is needed for renal impairment or in older adults, but avoid in moderate–severe hepatic impairment [^116SqFdA]. Ezetimibe is generally well tolerated and is a key nonstatin option for LDL-C lowering [^111ptZxP].

---

## Mechanism of action

Ezetimibe **selectively inhibits the NPC1L1 transporter** in the small intestine, blocking cholesterol and phytosterol absorption and reducing hepatic cholesterol delivery [^113MZDtt]. This increases hepatic LDL receptor expression and clearance of LDL-C from plasma [^113f48CJ].

---

## Clinical indications

Ezetimibe is indicated for:

- **Primary hyperlipidemia**: Monotherapy or with statins to reduce LDL-C [^116MnKfT].
- **Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)**: With statins in adults and children ≥ 10 years [^116MnKfT].
- **Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)**: With statins and other LDL-lowering therapies in adults and children ≥ 10 years [^116MnKfT].
- **Homozygous sitosterolemia**: To reduce sitosterol and campesterol in adults and children ≥ 9 years [^116MnKfT].

---

## Efficacy in lipid lowering

Ezetimibe **reduces LDL-C by ~18–25% as monotherapy** [^114BHA5T] and provides an additional ~15–20% reduction when added to statins [^113Pgdw6], with maximal effect within 2 weeks [^1148fV6m]. It also lowers total cholesterol, Apo B, and non-HDL-C, and has minimal effect on HDL-C and triglycerides [^115tMsyg] [^112LxuBB].

---

## Cardiovascular outcomes

Ezetimibe reduces cardiovascular events in high-risk patients [^113UCpzm]. In IMPROVE-IT, adding ezetimibe to simvastatin after ACS reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 6.4% (HR 0.936) [^112BvZ71] and lowered LDL-C to 53.2 mg/dL vs 69.9 mg/dL with simvastatin alone. Meta-analyses show reductions in nonfatal MI and stroke [^116kCpeb] but **no significant effect on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality** [^113UCpzm].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Ezetimibe is **generally well tolerated** [^111ptZxP]. Common adverse effects include nasopharyngitis, myalgia, and elevated liver enzymes [^116nqbfZ]; serious adverse effects such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are rare, especially when combined with statins or fibrates [^115kJsPt]. No dose adjustment is needed for renal impairment or in older adults, but avoid in moderate–severe hepatic impairment [^116SqFdA].

---

## Drug interactions

Ezetimibe has minimal CYP interactions [^112mBp3d]; however, **bile acid sequestrants reduce its absorption** — separate dosing by ≥ 2 hours before or ≥ 4 hours after [^117Lh9gM]. Cyclosporine increases ezetimibe exposure; monitor lipids and adjust as needed [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend ezetimibe as **first-line add-on therapy** when statins are insufficient or not tolerated [^112SYNSK], especially for high and very high cardiovascular risk patients [^112SYNSK]. It is preferred over PCSK9 inhibitors for cost and convenience, with PCSK9 inhibitors reserved for very high-risk or statin-intolerant patients who do not reach LDL-C goals with ezetimibe [^112SYNSK].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly**: No dose adjustment; comparable safety and efficacy [^116SqFdA].
- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment [^116SqFdA].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Avoid in moderate–severe hepatic impairment [^116SqFdA].
- **Pregnancy**: Use only if benefits outweigh risks; limited data [^111GFgDZ].
- **Lactation**: Use cautiously; presence in rat milk suggests potential transfer [^111jcFBW].

## References

### Ezetimibe for hypercholesterolemia [^111yapaR]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe (Zetia) is a novel, selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor. Ezetimibe blocks the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol within the brush-border enzyme system of the small intestine. Ezetimibe does not appear to alter or decrease the absorption of bile acids, fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, or triglycerides. It is labeled for use in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia, either as monotherapy or in combination with statins. It also is labeled for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in conjunction with statins and as adjunctive therapy to diet in the treatment of homozygous sitosterolemia (a rare, inherited, plant sterol storage disease).

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine.

The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in LDL receptors, resulting in clearance of cholesterol from the blood.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

ZETIA reduces total cholesterol (total-C), LDL-C, apolipoprotein (Apo) B, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) in patients with hyperlipidemia.

In a 2-week clinical trial in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ZETIA inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. ZETIA had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E (in a trial of 113 patients) and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production (in a trial of 118 patients).

Absorption

After oral administration, ezetimibe is absorbed and extensively conjugated to a pharmacologically active phenolic glucuronide (ezetimibe-glucuronide). After a single 10-mg dose of ZETIA to fasted adults, mean ezetimibe peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 3.4 to 5.5 ng/mL were attained within 4 to 12 hours (Tmax). Ezetimibe-glucuronide mean Cmaxvalues of 45 to 71 ng/mL were achieved between 1 and 2 hours (Tmax). There was no substantial deviation from dose proportionality between 5 and 20 mg. The absolute bioavailability of ezetimibe cannot be determined, as the compound is virtually insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection.

Effect of Food

Concomitant food administration (high-fat or non-fat meals) had no effect on the extent of absorption of ezetimibe when administered as ZETIA 10-mg tablets. The Cmaxvalue of ezetimibe was increased by 38% with consumption of high-fat meals.

Distribution

Ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are highly bound (> 90%) to human plasma proteins.

14	CLINICAL STUDIES

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

ZETIA reduces total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia. Maximal to near maximal response is generally achieved within 2 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

Monotherapy

In two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials in 1719 patients (age range 18 to 86 years, 52% females; 91% White, 5% Black or African American, 1% Asian, 3% other races mostly identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) with primary hyperlipidemia, ZETIA significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared to placebo (see Table 6). Reduction in LDL-C was consistent across age, sex, and baseline LDL-C.

Combination with Statins: ZETIA Added to On-going Statin Therapy

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week trial, 769 patients (age range 22 to 85 years, 42% females; 90% White, 6% Black or African American, 1% Asian, 3% other races; and 2% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) with primary hyperlipidemia, known coronary heart disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors who were already receiving statin monotherapy but who had not met their NCEP ATP II target LDL-C goal, were randomized to receive either ZETIA or placebo in addition to their on-going statin.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 2,396 patients who received ZETIA in clinical trials, 669 (28%) were 65 years of age and older, and 111 (5%) were 75 years of age and older. Of the 11,308 patients who received ZETIA in combination with a statin in clinical trials, 3587 (32%) were 65 years of age and older, and 924 (8%) were 75 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies (14)]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of ZETIA have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of ezetimibe were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment of ZETIA is necessary in patients with renal impairment.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

ZETIA is not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) due to the unknown effects of the increased exposure to ezetimibe [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Effects of ezetimibe on atherosclerosis in preclinical models [^111xbWvR]. Atherosclerosis (2011). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe (Zetia(®), Ezetrol(®), Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) is a potent inhibitor of sterol absorption, which selectively blocks the uptake of biliary and dietary cholesterol in the small intestine. Clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of ezetimibe on the reduction of atherogenic lipoproteins and the attainment of guideline-recommended lipid levels. Direct evidence that these improvements translate to a reduction in atherosclerosis or cardiovascular events is limited, although reductions in major atherosclerotic events that are consistent with the LDL-C lowering achieved have recently been presented for patients with chronic kidney disease treated with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20mg in the SHARP trial. Animal models of atherosclerosis have played a central role in defining the mechanisms involved in initiation and development of disease and have been used in drug development to evaluate potential therapeutic efficacy. The effect of ezetimibe on atherosclerosis has been examined in several of these animal model systems. ApoE knockout mice develop severe hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis with features similar to that seen in humans and techniques ranging from gross visualization of plaque to high-resolution MRI have demonstrated the consistent ability of ezetimibe to significantly inhibit atherosclerosis. sr-b1(-/-)/apoE(-/-) double knockout mice exhibit additional characteristics common to human coronary heart disease (CHD), and the one study of ezetimibe in sr-b1(-/-)/apoE(-/-) mice showed a significant reduction in aortic sinus plaque (57%), coronary arterial occlusion (68%), myocardial fibrosis (57%), and cardiomegaly (12%) compared with untreated controls. The effects of ezetimibe have also been evaluated in ldlr(-/-)/apoE(-/-) double knockout mice, demonstrating that functional LDL receptors were not required for ezetimibe-mediated reduction of plasma cholesterol or atherosclerosis. For the few studies that have been conducted in rabbits, ezetimibe has been shown to significantly inhibit diet and vascular-injury-induced atherosclerosis as measured by intima/media thickness, atherosclerotic lesion composition, and thrombosis. The current body of preclinical evidence consistently demonstrates that ezetimibe reduces atherosclerosis in animals, presumably due primarily to the decrease in circulating levels of atherogenic lipoproteins that the drug produces. Demonstration that ezetimibe-mediated lowering of atherogenic lipoproteins in humans has a similar effect on atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk awaits additional results from recently completed and ongoing outcomes trials.

### Ezetimibe (Zetia) [^113DbuBg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

ZETIA, added to on-going statin therapy, significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared with a statin administered alone (see Table 7). LDL-C reductions induced by ZETIA were generally consistent across all statins.

Combination with Statins: ZETIA Initiated Concurrently with a Statin

In four multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials, in 2,382 patients (age range 18 to 87 years, 57% female; 88% White, 5% Black or African American, 2% Asian, 5% other races mostly identified as Hispanic or Latino) with hyperlipidemia, ZETIA or placebo was administered alone or with various doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, or lovastatin.

When all patients receiving ZETIA with a statin were compared to all those receiving the corresponding statin alone, ZETIA significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared to the statin administered alone. LDL-C reductions induced by ZETIA were generally consistent across all statins. (See footnote, Tables 8 to 11 .)

Combination with Fenofibrate

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, 625 patients (age range 20 to 76 years, 44% female; 79% White, 1% Black or African American, 20% other races; and 11% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) were treated for up to 12 weeks and 576 for up to an additional 48 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, ZETIA alone, 160 mg fenofibrate alone, or ZETIA and 160 mg fenofibrate in the 12-week trial. After completing the 12-week trial, eligible patients were assigned to ZETIA coadministered with fenofibrate or fenofibrate monotherapy for an additional 48 weeks.

6	ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:

Liver enzyme abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Rhabdomyolysis and myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Monotherapy

In 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, 2,396 patients with primary hyperlipidemia (age range 9 to 86 years; 50% female, 90% White, 5% Black or African American, 2% Asian, 3% other races; 3% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) and elevated LDL-C were treated with ZETIA 10 mg daily for a median treatment duration of 12 weeks (range 0 to 39 weeks).

Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients treated with ZETIA and at an incidence greater than placebo in placebo-controlled studies of ZETIA are shown in Table 1.

Combination with a Statin

In 28 double-blind, controlled (placebo or active-controlled) clinical trials, 11,308 patients with primary hyperlipidemia (age range 10 to 93 years, 48% female, 85% White, 7% Black or African American, 3% Asian, 5% other races; 4% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) and elevated LDL-C were treated with ZETIA 10 mg/day concurrently with or added to on-going statin therapy for a median treatment duration of 8 weeks (range 0 to 112 weeks).

The incidence of consecutive increased transaminases (≥ 3 × ULN) was higher in patients receiving ZETIA administered with statins (1.3%) than in patients treated with statins alone (0.4%).

Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients treated with ZETIA + statin and at an incidence greater than statin are shown in Table 2.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no information about the presence of ezetimibe in human milk. Ezetimibe is present in rat milk (see Data). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. There is no information about the effects of ezetimibe on the breastfed infant or the effects of ezetimibe on milk production. ZETIA should not be used in nursing mothers unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant.

Data

Ezetimibe was present in the milk of lactating rats. The pup to maternal plasma ratio for total ezetimibe was 0.5 on lactation day 12.

ZETIA coadministered with fenofibrate significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared to fenofibrate administered alone (see Table 12).

The changes in lipid endpoints after an additional 48 weeks of treatment with ZETIA coadministered with fenofibrate or with fenofibrate alone were consistent with the 12-week data displayed above.

HeFH in Pediatric Patients

The effects of ZETIA coadministered with simvastatin (n = 126) compared to simvastatin monotherapy (n = 122) have been evaluated in males and females with HeFH. In a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial followed by an open-label phase, 142 males and 106 postmenarchal females, 10 to 17 years of age (mean age 14.2 years, 43% females, 82% White, 4% Asian, 2% Black or African American, 13% multi-racial; 14% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) with HeFH were randomized to receive either ZETIA coadministered with simvastatin or simvastatin monotherapy. Inclusion in the trial required 1) a baseline LDL-C level between 160 and 400 mg/dL and 2) a medical history and clinical presentation consistent with HeFH. The mean baseline LDL-C value was 225 mg/dL (range: 161 to 351 mg/dL) in the ZETIA coadministered with simvastatin group compared to 219 mg/dL (range: 149 to 336 mg/dL) in the simvastatin monotherapy group. The patients received coadministered ZETIA and simvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) or simvastatin monotherapy (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) for 6 weeks, coadministered ZETIA and 40-mg simvastatin or 40-mg simvastatin monotherapy for the next 27 weeks, and open-label coadministered ZETIA and simvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) for 20 weeks thereafter.

HoFH in Adults and Pediatric Patients

A trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of ZETIA in the treatment of HoFH. This double-blind, randomized, 12-week trial enrolled 50 patients (age range 11 to 74 years, 58% female; 90% White, 2% Black or African American, 8% other races identified as Hispanic or Latino) with a clinical and/or genotypic diagnosis of HoFH, with or without concomitant LDL apheresis, already receiving atorvastatin or simvastatin (40 mg). Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups, atorvastatin or simvastatin (80 mg), ZETIA administered with atorvastatin or simvastatin (40 mg), or ZETIA administered with atorvastatin or simvastatin (80 mg). Due to decreased bioavailability of ezetimibe in patients concomitantly receiving cholestyramine [see Drug Interactions (7)], ezetimibe was dosed at least 4 hours before or after administration of resins. Mean baseline LDL-C was 341 mg/dL in those patients randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg or simvastatin 80 mg alone and 316 mg/dL in the group randomized to ZETIA plus atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg or simvastatin 40 or 80 mg. ZETIA, administered with atorvastatin or simvastatin (40- and 80-mg statin groups, pooled), significantly reduced LDL-C (21%) compared with increasing the dose of simvastatin or atorvastatin monotherapy from 40 to 80 mg (7%). In those treated with ZETIA plus 80-mg atorvastatin or with ZETIA plus 80-mg simvastatin, LDL-C was reduced by 27%.

### Ezetimibe for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality events [^116kCpeb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity, and high levels of blood cholesterol are thought to be the major modifiable risk factors for CVD. The use of statins is the preferred treatment strategy for the prevention of CVD, but some people at high-risk for CVD are intolerant to statin therapy or unable to achieve their treatment goals with the maximal recommended doses of statin. Ezetimibe is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, whether it has a positive effect on CVD events remains uncertain. Results from clinical studies are inconsistent and a thorough evaluation of its efficacy and safety for the prevention of CVD and mortality is necessary.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe for the prevention of CVD and all-cause mortality.

Search Methods

We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science on 27 June 2018, and two clinical trial registry platforms on 11 July 2018. We checked reference lists from primary studies and review articles for additional studies. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ezetimibe versus placebo or ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone in adults, with or without CVD, and which had a follow-up of at least 12 months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and contacted trialists to obtain missing data. We performed statistical analyses according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 26 RCTs randomising 23,499 participants. All included studies assessed effects of ezetimibe plus other lipid-modifying drugs compared with other lipid-modifying drugs alone or plus placebo. Our findings were driven by the largest study (IMPROVE-IT), which had weights ranging from 41.5% to 98.4% in the different meta-analyses. Ezetimibe with statins probably reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with statins alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 0.98; a decrease from 284/1000 to 267/1000, 95% CI 256 to 278; 21,727 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting all-cause mortality used ezetimibe with statin or fenofibrate and found they have little or no effect on this outcome (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.05; 21,222 participants; 8 studies; high-quality evidence). Adding ezetimibe to statins probably reduces the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; a decrease from 105/1000 to 92/1000, 95% CI 85 to 100; 21,145 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence) and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; a decrease 32/1000 to 27/1000, 95% CI 23 to 31; 21,205 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Trials reporting cardiovascular mortality added ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate, probably having little or no effect on this outcome (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 19457 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The need for coronary revascularisation might be reduced by adding ezetimibe to statin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.99; a decrease from 196/1000 to 184/1000, 95% 175 to 194; 21,323 participants; 7 studies); however, no difference in coronary revascularisation rate was observed when a sensitivity analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias. In terms of safety, adding ezetimibe to statins may make little or no difference in the risk of hepatopathy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.35; 20,687 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether ezetimibe increase or decrease the risk of myopathy (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.38; 20,581 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence) and rhabdomyolysis, given the wide CIs and low event rate. Little or no difference in the risk of cancer, gallbladder-related disease and discontinuation due to adverse events were observed between treatment groups. For serum lipids, adding ezetimibe to statin or fenofibrate might further reduce the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and likely increase the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; however, substantial heterogeneity was detected in most analyses. None of the included studies reported on health-related quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate- to high-quality evidence suggests that ezetimibe has modest beneficial effects on the risk of CVD endpoints, primarily driven by a reduction in non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke, but it has little or no effect on clinical fatal endpoints. The cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe might involve the reduction of LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglycerides. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ezetimibe increases the risk of adverse events due to the low and very low quality of the evidence. The evidence for beneficial effects was mainly obtained from individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD, predominantly with acute coronary syndrome) administered ezetimibe plus statins. However, there is limited evidence regarding the role of ezetimibe in primary prevention and the effects of ezetimibe monotherapy in the prevention of CVD, and these topics thus requires further investigation.

### Ezetimibe is an inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis [^113s4rXn]. The American Journal of Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and preclinical observations have suggested a role for one or more products of the mevalonate/cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in the progression of prostate cancer. In this study, we used ezetimibe (Zetia), a specific, FDA-approved, cholesterol uptake-blocking drug, in combination with either a hyper- or hypocholesterolemic diet, to show that elevated circulating cholesterol levels promote, whereas a reduction in circulating cholesterol levels retard, the growth of human prostate cancer xenograft tumors in mice. Circulating cholesterol levels also modified tumor angiogenesis; higher cholesterol levels increased microvessel density and other indicators of vascularity. Consistent with these data, the reduction of cholesterol levels also increased the levels of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 in the xenografts. Our results thus suggest that hypercholesterolemia directly accelerates the growth of prostate carcinomas, and that the pharmacological reduction of serum cholesterol levels may retard prostate cancer growth by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis.

Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies: Refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions. (5.1)
Liver Enzyme Abnormalities and Monitoring: Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ZETIA. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ZETIA if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN persist. (5.2)
Skeletal Muscle Effects (e.g. Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis): ZETIA may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ZETIA and other concomitant medications, as appropriate. (5.3)

5.1 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with a Statin, Fenofibrate, or Other LDL-C Lowering Therapies

If ZETIA is administered with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-C lowering therapies, refer to the Prescribing Information of these products for a description of their risks including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Liver Enzymes

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ZETIA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In controlled clinical combination studies of ZETIA initiated concurrently with a statin, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 × ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was 1.3% for patients treated with ZETIA administered with statins and 0.4% for patients treated with statins alone. Perform liver enzyme testing as clinically indicated and consider withdrawal of ZETIA if increases in ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN persist.

5.3 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis

ZETIA may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In post-marketing reports, most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin or other agents known to be associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibrates. If myopathy is suspected, discontinue ZETIA and other concomitant medications, as appropriate.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin (Vytorin) [^113vs9fo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

VYTORIN

Plasma cholesterol is derived from intestinal absorption and endogenous synthesis. VYTORIN contains ezetimibe and simvastatin, two lipid-lowering compounds with complementary mechanisms of action.

Ezetimibe

Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine. The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols.

Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood.

Simvastatin

Simvastatin is a prodrug and is hydrolyzed to its active β-hydroxyacid form, simvastatin acid, after administration. Simvastatin acid and its metabolites are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

VYTORIN reduces total cholesterol (total-C), LDL-C, apolipoprotein (Apo) B, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) in patients with hyperlipidemia.

Ezetimibe

In a 2-week clinical trial in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production.

Simvastatin

Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by simvastatin acid accelerates the expression of LDL-receptors, followed by the uptake of LDL-C from blood to the liver, leading to a decrease in plasma LDL-C and total cholesterol. Sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver also decreases levels of very-low density lipoproteins. The maximum LDL-C reduction of ZOCOR is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The results of a bioequivalence trial in healthy subjects demonstrated that the VYTORIN (ezetimibe and simvastatin) 10 mg/10 mg to 10 mg/80 mg combination tablets are bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of ezetimibe (ZETIA®) and simvastatin (ZOCOR®) as individual tablets.

Aims

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ezetimibe 10 mg/day in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

Methods and Results

Following dietary stabilization, a 2–12-week washout period, and a 4-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period, 827 patients with baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 3.36 mmol/l (130 mg/dl) to ≤ 6.47 mmol/l (250 mg/dl) and triglycerides ≤ 3.95 mmol/l (350 mg/dl) were randomized 3:1 to receive ezetimibe 10 mg or placebo orally once daily in the morning for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage reduction in direct plasma LDL-C. Ezetimibe reduced direct LDL-C by a mean of 17.7% from baseline to endpoint, compared with an increase of 0.8% with placebo (P < 0.01). Response to ezetimibe was generally consistent across all subgroups analyzed. Ezetimibe also significantly improved levels of plasma total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, high-density lipoprotein(2)-cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), and elicited a trend toward lower triglyceride levels. Ezetimibe did not alter the serum concentrations of lipid-soluble vitamins or significantly affect baseline or stimulated cortisol production. Ezetimibe was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe, which significantly reduces LDL-C and favorably affects other lipid variables, may provide a well tolerated and effective new option for lipid management in the future.

### Safety and efficacy of ezetimibe added to atorvastatin versus up titration of atorvastatin to 40 mg in patients ≥ 65 years of age (from the ZETia in the ELDerly [ZETELD] study) [^116Mb2o3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Few clinical studies have focused on the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies in patients ≥ 65 years of age. The percentage of change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the percentage of patients achieving prespecified LDL cholesterol levels after 12 weeks of ezetimibe 10 mg plus atorvastatin versus up titration of atorvastatin were assessed in subjects ≥ 65 years old with hyperlipidemia and at high risk of coronary heart disease. After stabilization of atorvastatin 10-mg therapy, 1,053 patients, ≥ 65 years old, at high risk of coronary heart disease, with and without atherosclerotic vascular disease and a LDL cholesterol level that was not < 70 or < 100 mg/dl, respectively, were randomized to receive ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 mg for 12 weeks versus up titration to atorvastatin 20 mg for 6 weeks followed by up titration to atorvastatin 40 mg for an additional 6 weeks. Ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater changes at week 6 in LDL cholesterol (p < 0.001), significantly more patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease achieving a LDL cholesterol level of < 70 mg/dl (p < 0.001), and significantly more patients without atherosclerotic vascular disease achieving a LDL cholesterol level of < 100 mg/dl (p < 0.001) at weeks 6 and 12 compared to atorvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg. In addition, ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater changes at week 6 in total cholesterol, triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (all p < 0.001), and HDL cholesterol (p = 0.021) compared with atorvastatin 20 mg and significantly greater changes at week 12 in LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I (p = 0.001), total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (p < 0.030), and HDL cholesterol (p < 0.001) compared with atorvastatin 40 mg. Both treatments were generally well tolerated, with comparable safety profiles. In conclusion, adding ezetimibe to atorvastatin 10 mg produced significantly greater favorable changes in most lipids at 6 and 12 weeks and significantly greater attainment of prespecified LDL cholesterol levels than doubling or quadrupling the atorvastatin dose in patients ≥ 65 years old at high risk for coronary heart disease.

### Ezetimibe – an update [^111Fa8z6]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

### Pharmacology and therapeutics of ezetimibe (SCH 58235), a cholesterol-absorption inhibitor [^112mBp3d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Ezetimibe is the first of a new class of antihyperlipidemic agents, the cholesterol-absorption inhibitors. It is indicated for monotherapy or in combination with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, in combination with simvastatin or atorvastatin in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and as monotherapy in patients with homozygous familial sitosterolemia.

Objective

This article reviews available data on the clinical pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of ezetimibe.

Methods

A literature review was conducted using the search terms ezetimibe and SCH 58235 to identify articles and abstracts indexed in MEDLINE and the Iowa Drug Information Service from 1966 to February 2003. The reference lists of the identified articles were reviewed for additional publications.

Results

In adults, ezetimibe 10 mg PO given once daily has been reported to reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54% from baseline in association with a compensatory increase in endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Within 2 weeks of its initiation, ezetimibe monotherapy produced a 17% to 20% reduction from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); in combination with statins, ezetimibe produced a reduction in LDL-C of up to 40% over the same period. Based on studies performed to date, ezetimibe appears to be well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Because ezetimibe is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation and not by cytochrome P450 (CYP) oxidation, it is subject to minimal drug interactions involving the CYP enzyme system.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe is an option for monotherapy in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia or in those requiring adjunctive drug therapy for reduction of LDL-C levels. It may be useful in patients at risk for adverse events (eg, liver toxicity, myopathy) from other hypocholesterolemic agents. Additive LDL-C-lowering effects of ezetimibe may allow use of lower doses of conventional agents (eg, statins, fibric acid derivatives, niacin) to achieve an equivalent effect, thereby reducing the potential for adverse events and drug interactions. However, because trials have lasted no longer than 12 weeks, the long-term effect of ezetimibe on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains to be determined.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115rfmgz]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dyslipidemia is an important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. In particular, elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels, are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events. According to the meta‐analysis, the lowering of LDL‐C by about 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) with statin regimens safely reduced the major coronary events about a 23%. Consequently, lipid‐lowering therapies are key components in the prevention and treatment of CVD.

Hydroxymethylglutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely prescribed for their effectiveness in reducing LDL‐C levels and improving cardiovascular outcomes. Importantly, aggressive LDL‐C lowering has been shown to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reduce inflammation, and ultimately prevent clinical events. However, despite the proven efficacy of statins, some patients do not achieve their target LDL‐C levels or experience side effects associated with higher doses. The most common adverse effects of high‐intensity statins include myopathy, an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, and new‐onset diabetes.

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study assessed the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe administered with lovastatin in primary hypercholesterolemia. After dietary stabilization, a 2- to 12-week washout period, and a 4-week single-blind placebo lead-in period, 548 patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ≥ 145 mg/dl (3.75 mmol/L) and ≤ 250 mg/dl (6.47 mmol/L) and triglycerides ≤ 350 mg/dl (3.99 mmol/L) were randomized to one of the following, administered daily for 12 weeks: ezetimibe 10 mg; lovastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg; ezetimibe 10 mg plus lovastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg; or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was percentage decrease in direct LDL cholesterol from baseline to end point for pooled ezetimibe plus lovastatin versus pooled lovastatin alone. Ezetimibe plus lovastatin significantly improved concentrations of LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with lovastatin alone (p < 0.01). The coadministration of ezetimibe provided an incremental 14% LDL cholesterol decrease, a 5% HDL cholesterol increase, and a 10% decrease in triglycerides compared with pooled lovastatin alone. Ezetimibe plus lovastatin provided mean LDL cholesterol decreases of 33% to 45%, median triglyceride decreases of 19% to 27%, and mean HDL cholesterol increases of 8% to 9%, depending on the statin dose. The coadministration of ezetimibe 10 mg plus the starting dose of lovastatin (10 mg) provided comparable efficacy to high-dose lovastatin (40 mg) across the lipid profile (LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides). Ezetimibe plus lovastatin was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to both lovastatin alone and placebo. The coadministration of ezetimibe and lovastatin may offer a new treatment option in lipid management of patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### Prediction of clinical irrelevance of PK differences in atorvastatin using PK / PD models derived from literature-based meta-analyses [^116wBHgQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

BE studies. Two BE studies were conducted to cover all dose combinations for ezetimibe and atorvastatin. Each dose combination was evaluated in an open-label, randomized, two-period crossover study to demonstrate the definitive BE after administration of a single dose of the ezetimibe/atorvastatin FDC tablet and coadministration of corresponding doses of ezetimibe (Zetia) and atorvastatin (Lipitor) as individual tablets in healthy adult subjects. Primary end points were atorvastatin AUC 0–∞, atorvastatin C max, unconjugated ezetimibe AUC 0–last, and unconjugated ezetimibe C max, with the true geometric mean ratio of the treatments falling within 0.80 and 1.25. Additional study details and statistical methods are presented in Supplementary Material S1 online.

Literature-based meta-analysis. A database of changes in lipids, safety parameters, imaging outcomes, and cardiovascular outcomes after treatment with statins, fibrates, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, niacin, or combinations thereof reported in controlled clinical trials published in the medical literature or available from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency websites was developed. Search terms and the inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in Supplementary Material S2 online, along with the list of references used in the database. A total of 245 trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria for the current analysis. Model building and simulation were conducted in S-PLUS (version 6.2.1, Insightful, Seattle, WA) using the GNLS and NLME packages.

Dose–response model. The dose response for the fractional change (%/100) in lipid values for statin and ezetimibe monotherapy was characterized using Eq. 1. A different placebo response was estimated for each time point in each trial to account for variability in the time course of the placebo response across the trials (nonparametric placebo model). Base statin and ezetimibe model structures are presented in Eq. 2, and the interaction for coadministration of statins and ezetimibe is presented in Eq. 3.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115ymTH5]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atorvastatin, a widely used statin, has demonstrated significant LDL‐C lowering effects and a reduction in cardiovascular events across various risk populations. Consequently, combination therapies that integrate supplementary lipid‐lowering agents, such as ezetimibe, are gaining interest. Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, has shown promise in further reducing LDL‐C levels when added to statin therapy, providing a potential strategy for patients who do not reach their lipid targets with statin monotherapy. These findings support the complementary mechanisms of action and the potential of combining atorvastatin and ezetimibe to achieve effective LDL‐C lowering and improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Although guidelines recommend a moderate‐intensity statin that can lower LDL‐C level by 30%–49% for effective primary prevention in patients at low to moderate cardiovascular risk, there are limited studies comparing the effectiveness and safety of low‐intensity atorvastatin and ezetimibe combination therapy to moderate‐intensity statin. In the RACING trial, the combination of a moderate‐intensity statin and ezetimibe was non‐inferior to high‐intensity statin therapy on the risk of CVD in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, it is not known whether a low‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe is an alternative to a moderate‐intensity statin in the general population. Thus, in this study, we aimed to compare the lipid‐lowering effect and safety of a combination therapy of atorvastatin 5 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg (A5E10) with monotherapy regimens (atorvastatin 5 mg [A5], ezetimibe 10 mg [E10], or atorvastatin 10 mg [A10]) in patients with dyslipidemia.

### Ezetimibe: rationale and role in the management of hypercholesterolemia [^112vG42B]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. In part, plasma LDL levels are dependent on cholesterol absorption in the intestine and the rate of intrinsic cholesterol synthesis. Therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitors has often proven to be successful in reducing plasma LDL levels. However, a significant number of patients do not reach their target LDL levels despite statin therapy. As is reviewed, drugs that inhibit cholesterol absorption are a useful adjunct to lipid-lowering therapy by statins. This review discusses the mechanisms involved in intestinal absorption of cholesterol and its transport as potential targets of newer agents that affect cholesterol absorption. The use of bile acid sequestrants and esters of plant stanols, as well as other intestinally active agents for reducing plasma LDL levels, has been limited by side effects and difficulties in patient compliance. In contrast, the new selective cholesterol transporter inhibitor ezetimibe has been demonstrated to reduce plasma LDL alone or in combination with statins without significant adverse effects. In spite of the robust lipid-lowering data with ezetimibe, questions about clinical outcomes, safety, and efficacy in various combinations remain.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^115FxbmT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ezetimibe and Simvastatin Tablets

Plasma cholesterol is derived from intestinal absorption and endogenous synthesis. Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets contain ezetimibe and simvastatin, two lipid-lowering compounds with complementary mechanisms of action. Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C, and increases HDL-C through dual inhibition of cholesterol absorption and synthesis.

Ezetimibe

Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine. The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2 week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production.

Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Simvastatin

Simvastatin is a prodrug and is hydrolyzed to its active β-hydroxyacid form, simvastatin acid, after administration. Simvastatin is a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. In addition, simvastatin reduces very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and TG and increases HDL-C.

### Ezetimibe monotherapy for cholesterol lowering in 2, 722 people: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112LxuBB]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the evidence on the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe monotherapy for the treatment of primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hypercholesterolaemia.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

Eleven electronic bibliographic databases covering the biomedical, scientific and grey literature were searched from inception and supplemented by contact with experts in the field. Two reviewers independently determined the eligibility of RCTs, with a minimum treatment duration of 12 weeks, which compared ezetimibe monotherapy (10 mg per day) with placebo.

Results

In the absence of data from clinical outcome trials, surrogate endpoints such as changes in lipid concentrations were used as indicators of clinical outcomes. A meta-analysis of eight randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (all 12 weeks) showed that ezetimibe monotherapy was associated with a statistically significant mean reduction in LDL cholesterol (from baseline to endpoint) of -18.58%, (95% CI: -19.67 to -17.48, P < 0.00001) compared with placebo. Significant (P < 0.00001) changes were also found in total cholesterol (-13.46%, 95% CI: -14.22 to -12.70), HDL cholesterol (3.00%, 95% CI: 2.06–3.94) and triglyceride levels (-8.06%, 95% CI: -10.92 to -5.20). Ezetimibe monotherapy appeared to be well tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo.

Conclusions

In a meta-analysis restricted to short-term trials in hypercholesterolaemia, significant potentially favourable changes in lipid and lipoprotein levels relative to baseline occurred with ezetimibe monotherapy. Further long-term studies with cardiovascular and other clinical outcome data are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe more fully.

### Drug insight: the role of statins in combination with ezetimibe to lower LDL cholesterol [^1176sgGU]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular benefits of therapy with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are well documented. Undertreatment of dyslipidemia remains pervasive, however, and the introduction of more-aggressive optional LDL-cholesterol targets in US guidelines only heightens the challenges of reaching the target values. Combination therapy with a statin and the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe could help in the management of patients who have an inadequate reduction in cholesterol after making changes to lifestyle or taking statins alone. The effects of the combination on cardiovascular risk remain speculative, however, and clinical trials are in development. In this Review we consider the rationale for combination therapy in the context of achieving LDL-cholesterol goals.

### Safety of ezetimibe in lipid-lowering treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^111ptZxP]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Statins are first line cholesterol-lowering drugs for the reduction of cardiovascular risk but can cause adverse effects such as myalgia, muscular pain, and new-onset diabetes. Ezetimibe, an oral cholesterol-lowering drug taken after statins, which inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption and decreases biliary cholesterol secretion, lowers low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 20%. Clinical trials and systematic reviews have established that ezetimibe can reduce cardiovascular events. Guidelines from the European Society of Cardiologyand American Heart Associationrecommend ezetimibe as a second lipid-lowering drug in addition to treatment with statins when LDL-C treatment goals are not met, or as a single drug in case of statin-intolerance. The number of prescriptions of ezetimibe doubled in North America from 2003 to 2006 for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

Although ezetimibe is well tolerated in clinical practice, some studies suggest concerns regarding potential harms such as cancer, neurocognitive events, fractures, gastrointestinal adverse events, myalgia, muscular pain, and new-onset diabetes. The cause and magnitude of adverse events or undesirable effects of ezetimibe remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted a pairwise systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies to evaluate the safety of ezetimibe in people who need lipid-lowering treatment. This systematic review quantitatively informed the potential harms of ezetimibe for a parallel clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations for ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors. This guideline forms part of a BMJ Rapid Recommendation and is a collaborative effort by the MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation and The BMJ (box 1). For the visual abstract of this paper, see figure 1.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

Ezetimibe Tablet reduces total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia. Maximal to near maximal response is generally achieved within 2 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

Monotherapy

In two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials in 1719 patients (age range 18 to 86 years, 52% females; 91% White, 5% Black or African American, 1% Asian, 3% other races mostly identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) with primary hyperlipidemia, ezetimibe tablet significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared to placebo (see Table 6). Reduction in LDL-C was consistent across age, sex, and baseline LDL-C.

### Efficacy and safety of ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy for treatment of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia [^11764zMU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering drug that inhibits the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol by blocking passage across the intestinal wall. The efficacy and safety of adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study group included 769 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with primary hypercholesterolemia who had not achieved National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel II goals with dietary alteration and statin monotherapy. Patients receiving a stable dose of a statin for ≥ 6 weeks were randomized to receive concurrent treatment with placebo (n = 390) or ezetimibe (n = 379), 10 mg/day, in addition to continuing their open-label statin for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the percent change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline with statin monotherapy to end point after intervention (secondary variables: high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglycerides). Ongoing statin therapy plus ezetimibe led to changes of -25.1% for LDL cholesterol (HDL cholesterol +2.7%; triglycerides -14.0%) compared with LDL cholesterol -3.7% (p < 0.001), HDL cholesterol +1.0% (p < 0.05), and triglycerides -2.9% (p < 0.001) for placebo added to ongoing statin therapy. Among patients not at LDL cholesterol goal at on-statin baseline, 71.5% receiving statin plus ezetimibe versus 18.9% receiving statin plus placebo reached goal at end point (odds ratio 23.7; p < 0.001). The co-administration of statin and ezetimibe was generally well tolerated. Adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy led to substantial additional reduction in LDL cholesterol levels, facilitating attainment of NCEP goals. Ezetimibe offers a new therapeutic option for patients receiving statins who require further reduction in LDL cholesterol.

Cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) — discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurs in about 5% of patients and common adverse effects are gastrointestinal with occasional increases in liver enzymes and creatine phosphokinase with muscle symptoms; ezetimibe is administered as a 10 mg tablet once daily; in IMPROVE-IT, ezetimibe with a statin versus a statin alone in 18,144 post-acute coronary syndrome patients produced an additional 16.7 mg/dL (0.4 mmol/L) decrease in LDL-C with on-treatment [1-year] levels of 69.9 and 53.2 mg/dL, respectively, and was associated with a statistically significant 10% reduction in a composite CVD outcome; this reduction aligns with a predicted estimate assuming each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) LDL-C lowering produces a 22% ASCVD event risk reduction (16.7 mg/dL ÷ 38.7 mg/dL = 0.4; 0.4 × 22% = 8.8%).

Intensive statin therapy, as compared with moderate-dose statin therapy, incrementally lowers LDL cholesterol levels and rates of nonfatal cardiovascular events.

### (ezetimibe and atorvastatin) (Lypqozet) [^117KA4Ci]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

LYPQOZET

Plasma cholesterol is derived from intestinal absorption and endogenous synthesis. LYPQOZET contains ezetimibe and atorvastatin, two lipid-lowering compounds with complementary mechanisms of action.

Ezetimibe

Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine. The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. In a 2-week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetimibe inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54%, compared with placebo. Ezetimibe had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production.

Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver or increase bile acid excretion. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Atorvastatin

In animal models, atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell-surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL; atorvastatin also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: a clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8mmol/L (> 70mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

Current Practice

Most guidelines emphasise LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

Recommendations

The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but recommends against adding it in people at low cardiovascular risk. For adults who are intolerant to statins, the panel recommends using a lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but against adding it in those at low cardiovascular risk. When choosing to add another lipid-lowering drug, the panel suggests ezetimibe in preference to PCSK9 inhibitors. The panel suggests further adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe for adults already taking statins at very high risk and those at very high and high risk who are intolerant to statins.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified four risk groups of patients (low, moderate, high, and very high cardiovascular risk) and primarily applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations, though societal issues were a secondary consideration. The panel considered the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of starting a PCSK9 inhibitor and/or ezetimibe, making assumptions of adults' average values and preferences. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multi-layered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that also allows re-use and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (14 trials including 83660 participants) of benefits found that PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe probably reduce myocardial infarctions and stroke in patients with very high and high cardiovascular risk, with no impact on mortality (moderate to high certainty evidence), but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 inhibitors may have similar effects to ezetimibe on reducing non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke (low certainty evidence). These relative benefits were consistent, but their absolute magnitude varied based on cardiovascular risk in individual patients (for example, for 1000 people treated with PCSK9 inhibitors in addition to statins over five years, benefits ranged from 2 fewer strokes in the lowest risk to 21 fewer in the highest risk). Two systematic reviews on harms found no important adverse events for these drugs (moderate to high certainty evidence). PCSK9 inhibitors require injections that sometimes result in injection site reactions (best estimate 15 more per 1000 in a 5 year timeframe), representing a burden and harm that may matter to patients. The MATCH-IT decision support tool allows you to interact with the evidence and your patients across the alternative options: https://magicevidence.org/match-it/220504dist-lipid-lowering-drugs/.

Understanding The Recommendations

The stratification into four cardiovascular risk groups means that, to use the recommendations, physicians need to identify their patient's risk first. We therefore suggest, specific to various geographical regions, using some reliable risk calculators that estimate patients' cardiovascular risk based on a mix of known risk factors. The largely weak recommendations concerning the addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors reflect what the panel considered to be a close balance between small reductions in stroke and myocardial infarctions weighed against the burdens and limited harms. Because of the anticipated large variability of patients' values and preferences, well informed choices warrant shared decision making. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids linked to the recommendations can facilitate such shared decisions. The strong recommendations against adding another drug in people at low cardiovascular risk reflect what the panel considered to be a burden without important benefits. The strong recommendation for adding either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in people at high and very high cardiovascular risk reflect a clear benefit. The panel recognised the key uncertainty in the evidence concerning patient values and preferences, namely that what most people consider important reductions in cardiovascular risks, weighed against burdens and harms, remains unclear. Finally, availability and costs will influence decisions when healthcare systems, clinicians, or people consider adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Consistency in efficacy and safety of ezetimibe coadministered with statins for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in women and men [^11629ndS]. Journal of Women's Health (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Women are often not treated as aggressively as men to control levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), despite evidence that women and men realize comparable cardiovascular benefit from lipid-lowering therapy. Statins are the most effective drugs currently available for treating hypercholesterolemia. Despite the impressive cholesterol-lowering capacity of statins, however, many patients on statin therapy fail to reach established target levels of LDL-C. The cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, blocks the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol, a mechanism of action complementary to that of statins, which inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Ezetimibe coadministered with statins produces significant incremental reductions in LDL-C compared with statin monotherapy.

Methods

Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced-parallel group trials compared the efficacy and safety of statin monotherapy (lovastatin or pravastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg; simvastatin or atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg) vs. ezetimibe 10 mg plus statin (as above). A gender subset analysis (women, n = 1065; men, n = 796) on data pooled across these four trials was carried out to determine whether ezetimibe plus statin for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia is equally efficacious in women and men.

Results

Compared with statin monotherapy, ezetimibe plus statin demonstrated greater efficacy in reducing blood levels of LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides and raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The beneficial effects of ezetimibe were comparable in women and men. The safety profile of subjects receiving ezetimibe plus statin was similar to that of patients receiving statin monotherapy and similar between the two sexes.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe plus statin was more effective than statin alone in improving the lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia and was equally efficacious in women and men. Ezetimibe plus statin was well tolerated and had a favorable safety profile in both patient subgroups. Ezetimibe coadministered with statins, a dual inhibition treatment strategy that targets both cholesterol absorption and synthesis, is an effective therapeutic option for women with hypercholesterolemia.

### Effect of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering by ezetimibe / simvastatin on outcome incidence: overview, meta-analyses, and meta-regression analyses of randomized trials [^113wJ44v]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

This analysis investigated the extent of different outcome reductions from low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering following ezetimibe/simvastatin treatment and the proportionality of outcome to LDL-C reductions. The authors searched PubMed between 1997 and mid-June 2015 (any language) and the Cochrane Library to identify all randomized controlled trials comparing ezetimibe/simvastatin with placebo or less intensive LDL-C lowering. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), standardized to 20 mg/dL LDL-C reduction, were calculated for 5 primary outcomes (fatal and nonfatal) and 4 secondary outcomes (non-cardiovascular [CV] death, cancer, myopathy, and hepatopathy). Five ezetimibe/simvastatin RCTs (30 051 individuals) were eligible, 2 comparing ezetimibe/simvastatin vs placebo and 3 vs less intensive treatment. Outcomes reduced almost to the same extent were stroke (RR: -13%, 95% CI: -21% to -3%), coronary heart disease (CHD; RR: -12%, 95% CI: -19% to -5%), and composite of stroke and CHD (RR: -14%, 95% CI: -20% to -8%). Absolute risk reductions: 5 strokes, 10 CHD events, and 16 stroke and CHD events prevented for every 1000 patients treated for 5 years. Residual risk was almost 7× higher than absolute risk reduction for all the above outcomes. All death outcomes were not reduced, and secondary outcomes did not differ between groups. Logarithmic risk ratios were not associated with LDL-C lowering. Our meta-analysis provides evidence that, in patients with different CV disease burden, major CV events are safely reduced by LDL-C lowering with ezetimibe/simvastatin, while raising the hypothesis that the extent of LDL-C lowering might not be accompanied by incremental clinical-event reduction.

### Where does the interplay between cholesterol absorption and synthesis in the context of statin and / or ezetimibe treatment stand today? [^112D8Giq]. Atherosclerosis (2011). Low credibility.

The evidence of the different concepts underlying the interplay between cholesterol absorption and synthesis in the context of statin and ezetimibe treatment were reviewed in the light of the eight major trials where cholesterol absorption and synthesis were analyzed on a large scale using the plasma levels of precursors of cholesterol and plant sterols. The only concept supported in all studies is a significant and consistent increase of cholesterol absorption with statin (correlated with the inhibition of synthesis) and of cholesterol synthesis with ezetimibe, whereas in combination, statin and ezetimibe reduce both cholesterol synthesis and absorption. In contrast, most of the other concepts failed to be clearly proven. At baseline, the inverse relationship between cholesterol absorption and synthesis (only examined in two studies) was found to be weak. On statin treatment, four studies showed that the changes in cholesterol synthesis and absorption, contributed less than 9% to the variability in cholesterol response to statin therapy. It has not been consistently demonstrated that good absorbers/bad synthesizers are bad responders to statin (6 studies) and good responders for ezetimibe (3 studies). There is also no clear inverse correlation between LDL reduction on statin treatment and that on ezetimibe treatment. Finally, the original idea from the first pioneer study of Miettinen et al. that, the higher the baseline intestinal ability to absorb cholesterol, the lower the benefit on the clinical cardiovascular outcomes was not reproduced in the PROSPER study. In conclusion, with the exception of a reverse effect of statin and ezetimibe on absorption and synthesis, most ideas supporting the interplay between cholesterol absorption and synthesis lacked consistency between studies. At present, the use of the plasma levels of plant sterols and cholesterol precursors as markers of cholesterol absorption and synthesis is far too limited to definitively solve these questions.

### Ezetimibe increases endogenous cholesterol excretion in humans [^116WdojT]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Ezetimibe improves cardiovascular outcomes when added to optimum statin treatment. It lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and percent intestinal cholesterol absorption, but the exact cardioprotective mechanism is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the dominant effect of ezetimibe is to increase the reverse transport of cholesterol from rapidly mixing endogenous cholesterol pool into the stool.

Approach and Results

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel trial in 24 healthy subjects with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 100 to 200 mg/dL, we measured cholesterol metabolism before and after a 6-week treatment period with ezetimibe 10 mg/d or placebo. Plasma cholesterol was labeled by intravenous infusion of cholesterol-d 7 in a lipid emulsion and dietary cholesterol with cholesterol-d 5 and sitostanol-d 4 solubilized in oil. Plasma and stool samples collected during a cholesterol- and phytosterol-controlled metabolic kitchen diet were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Ezetimibe reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption efficiency 30 ± 4.3% (SE, P < 0.0001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 19.8 ± 1.9% (P = 0.0001). Body cholesterol pool size was unchanged, but fecal endogenous cholesterol excretion increased 66.6 ± 12.2% (P < 0.0001) and percent cholesterol excretion from body pools into the stool increased 74.7 ± 14.3% (P < 0.0001), whereas plasma cholesterol turnover rose 26.2 ± 3.6% (P = 0.0096). Fecal bile acids were unchanged.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe increased the efficiency of reverse cholesterol transport from rapidly mixing plasma and tissue pools into the stool. Further work is needed to examine the potential relation of reverse cholesterol transport and whole body cholesterol metabolism to coronary events and the treatment of atherosclerosis.

### Ezetimibe plus moderate-dose simvastatin after acute coronary syndrome: what are we IMPROVEing on? [^115PxKjH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The recent IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) is the first study to demonstrate a significant benefit of another medication (ezetimibe) on top of statin therapy in patients who have recently experienced an acute coronary syndrome. Despite the fact that ezetimibe led to positive results on the primary endpoint, the clinical benefit translated to real-life practice is only modest at best. However, this is the first major trial to demonstrate a significant benefit of a lipid medication in addition to statins. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of IMPROVE-IT in the context of current-day acute coronary syndrome practice, where high-dose statins now are prescribed widely.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^116ehrQt]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

The combination of low‐intensity atorvastatin (5 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) is significantly more effective in reducing LDL‐C levels than low‐intensity atorvastatin (5 mg), ezetimibe (10 mg), or moderate‐intensity atorvastatin (10 mg) monotherapy in patients with dyslipidemia. The combination therapy also shows good efficacy in improving other lipid levels, including non‐HDL‐C and Apo B levels, and the Apo B/Apo AI ratio, with a rapid onset of the effect observed within the first 4 weeks of treatment. This approach offers a viable alternative for patients who are intolerant to high‐intensity statins or who are unable to use or afford PCSK9 inhibitors.

Cholesterol absorption inhibition

Ezetimibe, the only available cholesterol absorption inhibitor, lowers LDL-C by inhibiting Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1 in the upper small intestine. Ezetimibe is available at a single dose of 10 mg daily and specifically lowers LDL-C levels by 18% to 25%; the ezetimibe-statin combination can lower LDL-C by up to 70%. Ezetimibe is well tolerated with minimal side effects. The cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe was demonstrated in the Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial study, which enrolled 18 144 patients with acute coronary syndrome. The study showed that reducing LDL-C from 1.8. to 1.4 mmol/L by adding ezetimibe to statin therapy over 7 years was associated with a further ~7% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, which was even more pronounced among patients with diabetes. Other randomized trials showed cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe when used as monotherapy in patients > 75 years and in combination with a statin in patients with renal impairment. Ezetimibe is a second-line agent in clinical practice guidelines and is often prescribed to statin-intolerant patients.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^113Pgdw6]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe) — mechanism, dosing, efficacy, and pediatric considerations are summarized as follows: Ezetimibe lowers LDL–C levels by upregulating LDL–C receptors, and in adults its effect with statins is additive, giving an additional 20 percent lowering of LDL–C levels with a dose of 10 mg/day recommended. In pediatrics, a recent RCT in ages 10–17 years with FH showed that ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin produced significantly greater LDL–C reductions than simvastatin alone and was safe and well-tolerated for up to 53 weeks. At present, there is no evidence that adding ezetimibe to a statin prevents atherosclerosis or events, and there are no published studies of monotherapy in children. Ezetimibe might be considered for children and adolescents under the care of a lipid specialist who do not meet LDL–C therapeutic targets on a statin alone, and given a 2009 FDA safety alert in adults, ezetimibe should be used only in consultation with a lipid specialist.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^112BvZ71]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Ezetimibe add-on therapy after acute coronary syndromes — Ezetimibe has been shown to produce significant additional improvements in LDL-C levels and goal attainment when added to statin therapy, and in IMPROVE-IT (18,444 patients) 7-year event rates were 32.7% with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus 34.7% with simvastatin alone (hazard ratio, 0.936; confidence interval, 0.887–0.988). Median LDL-C levels at 1 year were 53.2 mg/dL with ezetimibe plus simvastatin vs 69.9 mg/dL with simvastatin alone. According to the reported relationship of a 22% reduction in major vascular events per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction from statin therapies, the predicted reduction with combination therapy would be 9.5%, which is nearly identical to the reported reduction of 10.6%, and the number needed to treat for prevention of the primary end point was 50 using 7-year event rates.

### Effect of ezetimibe coadministered with atorvastatin in 628 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia: a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial [^1132eMY7]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the established efficacy of statins, many patients do not achieve recommended LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) goals. Contributing factors may be inadequate dosing, increased risk for adverse effects with high-dose monotherapy, and increased potential for intolerance and adverse effects with combinations of available agents.

Methods and Results

In a double-blind study, 628 patients with baseline LDL-C 145 to 250 mg/dL and triglycerides ≤ 350 mg/dL were randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following for 12 weeks: ezetimibe (10 mg/d); atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/d); ezetimibe (10 mg) plus atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/d); or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was percentage reduction in LDL-C for pooled ezetimibe plus atorvastatin versus pooled atorvastatin treatment groups. Ezetimibe plus atorvastatin significantly improved LDL-C, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, total cholesterol:HDL-C, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) compared with atorvastatin alone (P < 0.01). Coadministration of ezetimibe provided a significant additional 12% LDL-C reduction, 3% HDL-C increase, 8% triglyceride reduction, and 10% hs-CRP reduction versus atorvastatin alone. Ezetimibe plus atorvastatin provided LDL-C reductions of 50% to 60%, triglyceride reductions of 30% to 40%, and HDL-C increases of 5% to 9%, depending on atorvastatin dose. LDL-C reductions with ezetimibe plus 10 mg atorvastatin (50%) and 80 mg atorvastatin alone (51%) were similar.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe plus atorvastatin was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to atorvastatin alone and to placebo. When coadministered with atorvastatin, ezetimibe provided significant incremental reductions in LDL-C and triglycerides and increases in HDL-C. Coadministration of ezetimibe and atorvastatin offers a well-tolerated and highly efficacious new treatment option for patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### Ezetimibe [^111CWwPr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When all patients receiving ezetimibe tablet with a statin were compared to all those receiving the corresponding statin alone, ezetimibe tablet significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared to the statin administered alone.

### Statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular events [^114Wj6SJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the physiologically normal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the thresholds for development of atherosclerosis and adverse coronary events are in the 30- to 70-mg/dl range. More patients have been studied in randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of statins on outcomes than any other drug class in the history of medicine. This cumulative body of evidence documents that atherosclerosis progression is halted and coronary heart disease events are minimized when statin therapy with or without ezetimibe, and possibly proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, is used to drive down the LDL-C to a range of about 30 to 50 mg/dl. Thus far, these agents appear to be safe even when LDL-C is lowered to about 50 mg/dl, although more robust outcome and safety data are required, particularly for the PCSK9 inhibitors and very low LDL-C levels (e.g., down to 25 mg/dl). In conclusion, the current national guidelines specifying only the use of a high-potency statin without specific LDL-C goals may lead to substantial undertreatment of high-risk patients, leaving them vulnerable to future adverse cardiovascular events.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low / moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UxjEg]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global mortality and disability, with elevated serum lipid levels, particularly low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) as one of its major risk factors. Lowering LDL‐C is crucial in mitigating the negative outcomes of CVD, especially in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins are the first‐line therapy for patients with ASCVD for LDL‐C elevations, but many patients on low/moderate‐intensity statin regimens fail to attain target LDL‐C levels. Contemporary guidelines recommend high‐intensity statins for hyperlipidemia treatment, but they come with challenges such as drug interactions and dose‐dependent adverse events. An alternative approach is combining ezetimibe, a non‐statin drug, with tolerated stain dosage. Ezetimibe has shown efficacy in lowering LDL‐C alongside a more favorable safety profile. However, previous meta‐analyses have shown conflicting information regarding the superiority in efficacy or safety profile of high‐intensity statin monotherapy compared to low/moderate‐intensity statin combined with ezetimibe therapy. Given the recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta‐analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of these two lipid‐lowering strategies in ASCVD patients.

We retrospectively evaluated the effect of ezetimibe in a population of patients with hypercholesterolemia referred to a lipid clinic. Ezetimibe decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 22% in all patients treated with this medication (n = 87). Ezetimibe was also effective in patients treated with this agent alone (-23%, n = 21), with a statin (-23%, n = 28), with a nonstatin (-21%, n = 18), and with both a statin and a nonstatin (-22%, n = 20).

### Comparison of ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin monotherapy on atherosclerosis progression in familial hypercholesterolemia. design and rationale of the ezetimibe and simvastatin in hypercholesterolemia enhances atherosclerosis regression (ENHANCE) trial [^111oKJv9]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Lipid lowering through statin therapy significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. The ENHANCE study is an international 2-year, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to test the hypothesis that treatment of hypercholesterolemia by use of 2 complementary agents, ezetimibe (a specific cholesterol absorption inhibitor) and simvastatin (a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor), will result in larger beneficial effects on carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA IMT) than simvastatin monotherapy.

Methods

The study will recruit 725 men and women with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. After a placebo washout period, participants are randomized to receive daily administration of either simvastatin 80 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg or simvastatin 80 mg and placebo. The ENHANCE trial uses novel state-of-the-art single-frame digital image acquisition and rigorous quality assurance and control.

Results

The primary end point is mean change from baseline to 2 years in CA IMT, using composite measures from the right and left far wall common carotid artery, carotid bulb, and internal carotid artery. Secondary end points include (1) the proportion of participants who exhibit reductions in CA IMT, (2) the change in maximum far wall IMT, (3) the proportion of participants who develop new carotid artery plaques, and (4) the changes in carotid plus common femoral artery IMT.

Conclusions

This study addresses the question of whether a regimen that uses drugs with different mechanisms of action will be of further benefit in terms of atherosclerosis reduction compared to statin monotherapy.

### Bempedoic acid and ezetimibe (Nexlizet) [^117XdauU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

NEXLIZET contains bempedoic acid and ezetimibe. NEXLIZET reduces elevated LDL-C through inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver and absorption in the intestine.

Bempedoic acid

Bempedoic acid is an adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL) inhibitor that lowers LDL-C by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver. ACL is an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Bempedoic acid and its active metabolite, ESP15228, require coenzyme A (CoA) activation by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSVL1) to ETC-1002-CoA and ESP15228-CoA, respectively. ACSVL1 is expressed primarily in the liver. Inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver and lowers LDL-C in blood via upregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptors.

Ezetimibe

Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine. The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in LDL receptors, resulting in clearance of cholesterol from the blood.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Administration of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe in combination with other lipid modifying agents, decreases LDL-C, non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and total cholesterol (TC) in patients with hyperlipidemia.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At a dose of 240 mg (1.3 times the approved recommended dose), bempedoic acid does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

The effect of ezetimibe or NEXLIZET on QT interval has not been evaluated.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^114rWq2X]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Side effects associated with statins can be increased by drug interactions and major comorbidities that are more common in older people. Statin combination preparations may be more beneficial than high‐dose statins in elderly patients. In the age‐stratified post‐hoc analysis of the RACING trial, ezetimibe combination therapy was associated with a lower rate of intolerance related drug discontinuation and new‐onset diabetes than high‐intensity statin monotherapy in patients aged ≥ 75 years. In this respect, low intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy may be a good alternative for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in older people who are not at high risk. Moreover, previous studies have shown that Asian populations tend to achieve comparable LDL‐C reductions with lower statin doses than Western populations. For instance, the Japanese Lipid Intervention Trial (J‐LIT) and the MEGA study demonstrated that low‐dose statin therapy significantly reduced both LDL‐C levels and coronary heart disease risk in Japanese patients, with efficacy similar to that of higher statin doses used in Western cohorts. These findings provide further support for the clinical utility of low‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe therapy in Asian patients with dyslipidemia.

4.2 Time to Effect of the Combination of a Statin Plus Ezetimibe

Most previous randomized trials of statin treatment have assessed on evaluating the extent of LDL‐C reduction after 1 year of treatment. However, the PROVE IT‐TIMI 22 trial demonstrated significant LDL‐C reductions within just 1 month, with reductions of 51% in the atorvastatin 80 mg group and 22% in the pravastatin 40 mg group. This highlights the rapid onset of action of atorvastatin, with another study showing that approximately 90% of the maximum LDL‐C reduction from baseline was achieved within the first 2 weeks of treatment. In our study, the combination therapy (A5E10) produced remarkable lipid‐lowering effects, including 98% of the maximum LDL‐C reduction, 92% of the maximum TG reduction, 95% of the maximum non‐HDL‐C reduction, and 97% of the maximum Apo B reduction in just 1 month. Such a rapid action is critical for patients requiring swift LDL‐C reduction to mitigate cardiovascular risks.

### Comparative effects of lipid-lowering therapies [^117V12kk]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacologic regulation of lipid metabolism in patients with dyslipidemia is unequivocally associated with significant reductions in risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of therapeutic drug classes have been developed in an effort to ever more precisely and intensively modulate lipid metabolism. Statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, and niacin exert their effects via different mechanisms and afford physicians the opportunity to beneficially impact multiple pathways in patients. When used alone or in combination, these drugs decrease risk for the development and progression of atherosclerotic disease. There are strong clinical trial data to support of the use of lipid-lowering therapies in the settings of both primary and secondary prevention. This article (1) discusses the mechanisms of action of antilipidemic medications, (2) reviews dosing regimens and the pharmacokinetic differences among drugs of the same class, (3) assesses risk for drug interactions, and (4) reviews the clinical trial evidence used to support the use of particular antilipidemic medications in specific physiologic settings. The incidence of dyslipidemia is rising worldwide. This trend portends an ever-growing need for the aggressive and judicious use of different antilipidemic medication(s) in patients at risk for all forms of atherosclerotic vascular disease.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^111H67C6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a multicenter, double-blind, 6 week study, 1,902 patients with primary hyperlipidemia, who had not met their NCEP ATP III target LDL-C goal, were randomized to one of eight treatment groups: ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets (10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, 10 mg/40 mg, or 10 mg/80 mg) or atorvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg).

Across the dosage range, when patients receiving ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets were compared to those receiving milligram-equivalent statin doses of atorvastatin, ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin. Only the 10 mg/40 mg and 10 mg/80 mg ezetimibe and simvastatin tablet doses increased HDL-C significantly more than the corresponding milligram-equivalent statin dose of atorvastatin. The effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on TG were similar to the effects seen with atorvastatin (see Table 9).

In a multicenter, double-blind, 24 week, forced-titration study, 788 patients with primary hyperlipidemia, who had not met their NCEP ATP III target LDL-C goal, were randomized to receive coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets (10 mg/10 mg and 10 mg/20 mg) or atorvastatin 10 mg. For all three treatment groups, the dose of the statin was titrated at 6 week intervals to 80 mg. At each pre-specified dose comparison, ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets lowered LDL-C to a greater degree than atorvastatin (see Table 10).

### Treatment of high-risk patients with ezetimibe plus simvastatin co-administration versus simvastatin alone to attain national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals [^113i7wYW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

This study assessed whether the co-administration of ezetimibe and simvastatin would be more effective than simvastatin monotherapy in allowing high-risk patients to achieve a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal of < 100 mg/dl. Men and women with LDL cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl and meeting National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalent were randomized to 1 of 4 daily treatments for 23 weeks: simvastatin 20 mg (n = 253), ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 10 mg (n = 251), ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg (n = 109), and ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 40 mg (n = 97). In all groups, patients not at goal had their simvastatin doses doubled at weeks 6, 12, and/or 18, up to a maximum of 80 mg. The primary efficacy objective was LDL cholesterol goal attainment (< 100 mg/dl) after 5 weeks of treatment. Ezetimibe plus any dose of simvastatin produced greater reductions in LDL cholesterol and allowed more patients to achieve goal after 5 weeks (p < 0.001) and at the end of the study (p < 0.001) than simvastatin 20 mg alone. At 5 weeks, 75%, 83%, and 87% of patients receiving ezetimibe plus simvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg had LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl compared with 46% of patients receiving simvastatin 20 mg. In patients who started on ezetimibe plus simvastatin 10, 20 and 40 mg, 33%, 22%, and 12%, respectively, required simvastatin titration during the study compared with 68% of patients who started on simvastatin 20 mg. The corresponding median simvastatin doses used were 10, 20, 40, and 40 mg, respectively. Ezetimibe plus simvastatin was well tolerated, with an overall safety profile similar to that of simvastatin monotherapy. Thus, through the dual inhibition of cholesterol absorption and synthesis, ezetimibe plus simvastatin allowed more patients to reach LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl at a lower simvastatin dose and with fewer dose titrations than simvastatin monotherapy.

### Effects of ezetimibe added to statin therapy on markers of cholesterol absorption and synthesis and LDL-C lowering in hyperlipidemic patients [^112PcJBA]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis but can upregulate cholesterol absorption, with higher doses producing larger effects. Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol absorption but also upregulates synthesis. We tested whether ezetimibe added to on-going statin therapy would be most effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in subjects on high-potency statins and whether these effects would be related to alterations in cholesterol absorption (β-sitosterol) and synthesis (lathosterol) markers.

Methods

Hypercholesterolemic subjects (n = 874) on statins received ezetimibe 10 mg/day. Plasma lipids, lathosterol, and β-sitosterol were measured at baseline and on treatment. Subjects were divided into low- (n = 133), medium- (n = 582), and high- (n = 159) statin potency groups defined by predicted LDL-C-lowering effects of each ongoing statin type and dose (reductions of ~20–30%, ~31–45%, or ~46–55%, respectively).

Results

The high-potency group had significantly lower baseline lathosterol (1.93 vs. 2.58 vs. 3.17 μmol/l; p < 0.001) and higher baseline β-sitosterol values (6.21 vs. 4.58 vs. 4.51 μmol/l, p < 0.001) than medium-/low-potency groups. Ezetimibe treatment in the high-potency group produced significantly greater reductions from baseline in LDL-C than medium-/low-potency groups (-29.1% vs. -25.0% vs. -22.7%; p < 0.001) when evaluating unadjusted data. These effects and group differences were significantly (p < 0.05) related to greater β-sitosterol reductions and smaller lathosterol increases. However, LDL-C reduction differences between groups were no longer significant after controlling for placebo effects, due mainly to modest LDL-C lowering by placebo in the high-potency group.

Conclusion

Patients on high-potency statins have the lowest levels of cholesterol synthesis markers and the highest levels of cholesterol absorption markers at baseline, and the greatest reduction in absorption markers and the smallest increases in synthesis markers with ezetimibe addition. Therefore, such patients may be good candidates for ezetimibe therapy if additional LDL-C lowering is needed.

### Safety of ezetimibe in lipid-lowering treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^1117en9U]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objective

To determine the harms of ezetimibe in people who need lipid-lowering treatment.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Randomised controlled trials and cohort studies.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Studies comparing ezetimibe with placebo, standard care, or other lipid-lowering agents in people who need lipid-lowering treatment with a follow-up duration of at least six months (or 24 weeks). The relative effects for potential harms of ezetimibe were pooled by use of random effect pairwise meta-analyses for randomised controlled trials and the evidence from observational studies was narratively summarised. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.

Results

48 randomised controlled trials with 28444 participants (median follow-up 34 weeks, range 24–312 weeks) and four observational studies with 1667 participants (median follow-up 282 weeks, range 72–400 weeks) were included. The meta-analyses of randomised trials showed moderate to high certainty that ezetimibe was not associated with cancer (relative risk 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.11), fractures (0.90; 0.74 to 1.10), discontinuation due to any adverse event (0.87; 0.74 to 1.03), gastrointestinal adverse events leading to discontinuation (1.34; 0.58 to 3.08), myalgia or muscular pain leading to discontinuation (0.82; 0.51 to 1.33), neurocognitive events (1.48; 0.58 to 3.81), or new-onset diabetes (0.88; 0.61 to 1.28). The narrative analysis of observational studies provided consistent findings. No credible subgroup effects were identified for the harm outcomes, including shorter versus longer follow-up duration of trials.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe results in little to no difference in adverse events or other undesirable effects compared with placebo, usual care or other lipid-lowering agents.

### Safety of ezetimibe in lipid-lowering treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^111mfWbv]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objective

To determine the harms of ezetimibe in people who need lipid-lowering treatment.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Randomised controlled trials and cohort studies.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Studies comparing ezetimibe with placebo, standard care, or other lipid-lowering agents in people who need lipid-lowering treatment with a follow-up duration of at least six months (or 24 weeks). The relative effects for potential harms of ezetimibe were pooled by use of random effect pairwise meta-analyses for randomised controlled trials and the evidence from observational studies was narratively summarised. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.

Results

48 randomised controlled trials with 28 444 participants (median follow-up 34 weeks, range 24–312 weeks) and four observational studies with 1667 participants (median follow-up 282 weeks, range 72–400 weeks) were included. The meta-analyses of randomised trials showed moderate to high certainty that ezetimibe was not associated with cancer (relative risk 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.11), fractures (0.90; 0.74 to 1.10), discontinuation due to any adverse event (0.87; 0.74 to 1.03), gastrointestinal adverse events leading to discontinuation (1.34; 0.58 to 3.08), myalgia or muscular pain leading to discontinuation (0.82; 0.51 to 1.33), neurocognitive events (1.48; 0.58 to 3.81), or new-onset diabetes (0.88; 0.61 to 1.28). The narrative analysis of observational studies provided consistent findings. No credible subgroup effects were identified for the harm outcomes, including shorter versus longer follow-up duration of trials.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe results in little to no difference in adverse events or other undesirable effects compared with placebo, usual care or other lipid-lowering agents.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low / moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114HeVpa]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The meta‐analysis by Zhu et al. published in 2020 compared high‐intensity statin monotherapy with low/moderate‐intensity statin and ezetimibe combination therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk. Consistent with the present study, it reported that the combination therapy was more efficient in reaching target LDL‐C levels compared to statin monotherapy by including 14 studies. However, in contrast to our findings, a greater reduction in non‐HDL and TC levels was observed in the combination therapy group. The findings of this meta‐analysis have been updated through our meta‐analysis by including a larger number of recent studies. Additionally, the results of the aforementioned study were limited to treatment durations under 1 year, whereas our study demonstrated that the benefits of combination therapy on LDL‐C levels persist even in longer treatment durations. It is worth noting that LDL‐C reduction is the primary treatment goal for patients with CVD. By combining a low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe, clinicians can achieve more LDL‐C reduction, which may translate to improved long‐term cardiovascular outcomes. However, the lack of significant difference in other lipid parameters suggests that the benefits of combination therapy may be primarily driven by the enhanced LDL‐C lowering effect. One reason for this observation is that the regulation of LDL‐C is more directly linked to the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway inhibited by statins. Additionally, patients with different baseline lipid abnormalities may respond differently to statin therapy. For example, individuals with predominantly elevated LDL‐C may experience more robust LDL‐C reduction, whereas those with hypertriglyceridemia may have more variable effects on TG levels.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^115EAQgm]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

4.1 The Benefits of Low‐Intensity Statin Combination Therapy Over Moderate‐Intensity Statin Therapy

Lowering LDL‐C improves clinical outcomes and statins are recommended as the mainstay of lipid‐lowering therapy. Therefore, recent lipid guidelines recommend LDL‐C reduction based on cardiovascular risk. Clinical guidelines recommend moderate‐intensity statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes and at a moderate cardiovascular risk, or in patients with diabetes and aged 40–75 years. Although the initial lowering of LDL‐C levels with statins is effective, further reductions require disproportionately larger dose increases. This is because statin‐induced reductions in serum cholesterol can lead to increased cholesterol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, which diminishes the efficacy of higher statin doses. Typically, doubling the statin dose from the minimum effective dose yields only an additional 6% reduction in serum LDL‐C concentration. In addition, side effects associated with statins include myopathy, new‐onset diabetes, and an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. The SEARCH trial compared the effects of 80 mg versus 20 mg of simvastatin in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. The trial demonstrated a higher risk of myopathy in high‐dose simvastatin (0.9%) compared to the low‐dose group (0.03%). Similarly, the JUPITER trial, which compared rosuvastatin 20 mg to placebo, reported a higher incidence of new‐onset diabetes in the rosuvastatin (3.0% vs. 2.4%). In another meta‐analysis comparing high‐intensity and moderate‐intensity statins, new‐onset DM occurred 12% more often in the high‐intensity statin group compared with the moderate‐intensity statin group. These findings highlight the dose‐dependent manner in which statin‐associated side effects, which are important because they reduce patient adherence, are associated with clinical outcomes. Our study found that combining a low‐intensity statin atorvastatin 5 mg with ezetimibe resulted in a 47.6% reduction in LDL‐C from baseline, a significantly greater reduction than that achieved with atorvastatin 10 mg monotherapy, which is classified as a moderate‐intensity statin. Moreover, in the A5E10 group, 100% of participants with low‐to‐moderate risk achieved their LDL‐C targets. Consistent with the results of previous studies, these findings suggest that adding ezetimibe to a low‐intensity statin can achieve greater LDL‐C reduction than a moderate‐intensity statin alone, potentially offering a more effective and better‐tolerated treatment option by reducing the side effects commonly associated with high‐intensity statin therapy.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe with or without statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113UCpzm]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To compare the impact of ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in adults taking maximally tolerated statin therapy or who are statin intolerant.

Design

Network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library up to 31 December 2020.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors with ≥ 500 patients and follow-up of ≥ 6 months.

Main Outcome Measures

We performed frequentist fixed-effects network meta-analysis and GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) to assess certainty of evidence. Results included relative risks (RR) and absolute risks per 1000 patients treated for five years for non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. We estimated absolute risk differences assuming constant RR (estimated from network meta-analysis) across different baseline therapies and cardiovascular risk thresholds; the PREDICT risk calculator estimated cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. Patients were categorised at low to very high cardiovascular risk. A guideline panel and systematic review authors established the minimal important differences (MID) of 12 per 1000 for MI and 10 per 1000 for stroke.

Results

We identified 14 trials assessing ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors among 83660 adults using statins. Adding ezetimibe to statins reduced MI (RR 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.94)) and stroke (RR 0.82 (0.71 to 0.96)) but not all-cause mortality (RR 0.99 (0.92 to 1.06)) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.97 (0.87 to 1.09)). Similarly, adding PCSK9 inhibitor to statins reduced MI (0.81 (0.76 to 0.87)) and stroke (0.74 (0.64 to 0.85)) but not all-cause (0.95 (0.87 to 1.03)) or cardiovascular mortality (0.95 (0.87 to 1.03)). Among adults with very high cardiovascular risk, adding PCSK9 inhibitor was likely to reduce MI (16 per 1000) and stroke (21 per 1000) (moderate to high certainty); whereas adding ezetimibe was likely to reduce stroke (14 per 1000), but the reduction of MI (11 per 1000) (moderate certainty) did not reach MID. Adding ezetimibe to PCSK9 inhibitor and statin may reduce stroke (11 per 1000), but the reduction of MI (9 per 1000) (low certainty) did not reach MID. Adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins and ezetimibe may reduce MI (14 per 1000) and stroke (17 per 1000) (low certainty). Among adults with high cardiovascular risk, adding PCSK9 inhibitor probably reduced MI (12 per 1000) and stroke (16 per 1000) (moderate certainty); adding ezetimibe probably reduced stroke (11 per 1000), but the reduction in MI did not achieve MID (8 per 1000) (moderate certainty). Adding ezetimibe to PCSK9 inhibitor and statins did not reduce outcomes beyond MID, while adding PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe and statins may reduce stroke (13 per 1000). These effects were consistent in statin-intolerant patients. Among moderate and low cardiovascular risk groups, adding PCSK9 inhibitor or ezetimibe to statins yielded little or no benefit for MI and stroke.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors may reduce non-fatal MI and stroke in adults at very high or high cardiovascular risk who are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy or are statin-intolerant, but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk.

### Inverse relationship between LDL cholesterol and PCSK9 plasma levels in dyslipidemic cynomolgus monkeys: effects of LDL lowering by ezetimibe in the absence of statins [^112MbdZz]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the lipid-lowering efficacy of ezetimibe in dyslipidemic cynomolgus monkeys comparing two dosing methods, and to evaluate PCSK9 plasma levels during dyslipidemia induction by feeding a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HFD), ezetimibe (Zetia(®), Ezetrol(®)) treatment, ezetimibe washout, and HFD washout.

Methods and Results

Twenty dyslipidemic cynomolgus monkeys on HFD for seven months (LDL cholesterol 100–400 mg/dL) were randomized into two groups and treated with ezetimibe for two weeks, either by oral gavage or by using food treats. The lipid-lowering effects of ezetimibe were identical between the two groups. After treatment, mean LDL cholesterol was decreased by 58% (174–72 mg/dL), total cholesterol by 42% (241–138 mg/dL), and PCSK9 levels were increased by 137% (147–314 ng/mL). PCSK9 levels on regular diet before and after HFD were also inversely correlated to LDL cholesterol.

Conclusions

In a cynomolgus dyslipidemia model, PCSK9 levels are inversely correlated with LDL cholesterol in the absence of statin treatment, regardless whether lipid changes are modulated by diet or ezetimibe treatment.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Nonstatin therapy — ezetimibe for LDL-related ASCVD risk — is characterized by the mechanism "Inhibits NPC1L1 protein; reduces cholesterol absorption in small intestine", with dosing "10 mg orally daily, with or without food. Take either ≥ 2 h before or ≥ 4 h after BAS, if used in combination". Mean LDL-C lowering per prescribing information is "Monotherapy — 18%; combination therapy with statin therapy (incremental reduction) — 25%". Additional safety and interactions include "No safety data in humans; avoid use" during pregnancy/lactation and drug–drug interactions with "Cyclosporine, fibrates, BAS". Outcomes evidence notes in IMPROVE-IT that coronary revascularization counted only if " ≥ 30 days after randomization" over "a median follow-up of 6 years", and SHARP reported effects over "a median follow-up of 4.9 years".

### IMPROVE-IT: a final closure to carcinogenicity of ezetimibe? [^1151z98o]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)–lowering strategies are the cornerstone of coronary heart disease prevention and treatment. Therapies to reduce LDL-C such as statins or ezetimibe have significantly improved cardiovascular outcomes; this benefit has been ascribed to pleiotropic effects beyond lowering LDL-C. However, such pleiotropic mechanisms have raised safety concerns about long-term use. A potential carcinogenic effect has been of particular concern as earlier studies suggested an association between baseline low LDL-C levels and incident cancer risk. Thus far, a wealth of outcome data on statin therapies has established no significant cancer risk of statins. The safety of other cholesterol-lowering therapies in regard to their cancer risk has not been well established. Moreover, the threshold for reporting safety analyses and the level of acceptable evidence, including exploratory analyses, are different than that of efficacy analyses.

In 2008, the SEAS (Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis) investigators reported the initial results of their randomized trial investigating the effects of cholesterol-lowering therapies on cardiovascular outcomes among patients with aortic stenosis (AS). Given the association between hyperlipidemia and AS, the study sought to examine potential beneficial effects of intensified cholesterol lowering with combined simvastatin/ezetimibe therapies in AS. Ezetimibe works differently from statins in that it inhibits the biliary and intestinal cholesterol absorption by binding to Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1. The study involved 1,873 patients with mild-to-moderate asymptomatic AS and the patients received either simvastatin/ezetimibe (40/10 mg) or placebo daily. Although the study did not find significant benefits from the intensive lipid-lowering therapy, it reported an incidental finding of increased cancer occurrence (105 vs. 70; p = 0.01) and cancer-associated death (39 vs. 23; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.67; p = 0.05) with simvastatin/ezetimibe compared to placebo. The cancer incidence did not cluster in particular organ sites. As prior studies have shown no significant link between statins and cancer risk, the results raised a concern that adding ezetimibe to statin therapy might increase the risk of cancer. This safety signal needed further investigation.

### Safety of ezetimibe in lipid-lowering treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies [^113bUEqX]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study systematically reviewed all ezetimibe trials and cohort studies from literature and ClinicalTrials.gov and engaged a multidisciplinary panel to contextualise our findings into clinical practice. The GRADE approach based on the absolute effects facilitates the application in clinical practice. In trials, we did not identify credible subgroup effects for any of the harm outcomes regarding different follow-up durations. With the support from observational studies with a median follow-up duration of up to 7.7 years, our study supports the long term safety of the drug. Nevertheless, long term surveillance remains necessary.

The key limitation of this study is that the number of some events (that is, gastrointestinal and neurocognitive events) is rare and therefore findings for these events could be imprecise. Unfortunately, the included observational studies to supplement the trial evidence overall provided very low certainty evidence and were not powered to improve precision for these or other harm outcomes. A large scale, population based study could be helpful in the future. However, such rare events might not alter clinical decision making because of the very low absolute baseline risk. The systematic review did not provide direct evidence for people with characteristics that were not represented by the study population (eg, low LDL-C concentration before treatment). People who might not be represented, therefore, should use when considering the direct evidence.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^116k6MUr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets, which contain a cholesterol absorption inhibitor and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to:

reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia. (1.1)
reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments. (1.2)

Limitations of Use (1.3)

No incremental benefit of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin has been established.
Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets have not been studied in Fredrickson Type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

1.1 Primary Hyperlipidemia

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets are indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hyperlipidemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.

1.2 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets are indicated for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g. LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.

1.3 Limitations of Use

No incremental benefit of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for simvastatin has been established.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets have not been studied in Fredrickson type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^112k1kmJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When patients receiving ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets were compared to those receiving all doses of simvastatin, ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C. The effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on HDL-C were similar to the effects seen with simvastatin. Further analysis showed ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets significantly increased HDL-C compared with placebo (see Table 7). The lipid response to ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets was similar in patients with TG levels greater than or less than 200 mg/dL.

In a multicenter, double-blind, controlled, 23 week study, 710 patients with known CHD or CHD risk equivalents, as defined by the NCEP ATP III guidelines, and an LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL were randomized to one of four treatment groups: coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets (10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, and 10 mg/40 mg) or simvastatin 20 mg. Patients not reaching an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL had their simvastatin dose titrated at 6 week intervals to a maximal dose of 80 mg.

At Week 5, the LDL-C reductions with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets 10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, or 10 mg/40 mg were significantly larger than with simvastatin 20 mg (see Table 8).

Risk of bias

We rated the overall risk of bias as low across all 48 included trials; 29 trials raised concerns (online supplemental file 1). We rated 14 (29%) studies as high risk of bias because the number of missing participants was higher than 20% or the analysis was not done by an intention-to-treat protocol. We rated 18 (38%) trials as high risk of bias owing to inadequate masking of participants and personnel, 14 (29%) trials owing to an open label design, and four (8%) trials because the trial design did not have a matching placebo. The overall scores of the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale were six to seven among the included observational studies, indicating some risks of bias (table 3; online supplemental table S11).

Table 3
Treatments, outcomes, and risk of bias of included observational studies

Meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials

As shown in figure 3, moderate to high certainty evidence indicated that ezetimibe has little to no effect on the risks of cancer (relative risk 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.11), fractures (0.90; 0.74 to 1.10), discontinuation due to any adverse events (0.87; 0.74 to 1.03), discontinuation due to gastrointestinal adverse events (1.34; 0.58 to 3.08), myalgia or muscular pain leading to discontinuation (0.82; 0.51 to 1.33), neurocognitive events (1.48; 0.58 to 3.81), or new-onset diabetes (0.88; 0.61 to 1.28). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate for discontinuation due to any adverse events for indirectness because of the composite nature of the outcome. We also downgraded the certainty of evidence of discontinuation due to any gastrointestinal adverse events and neurodegenerative events for imprecision because of wide 95% confidence intervals, which could not support clinical decision making.
