## Question

Diarrhea in a 2 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage diarrhea in a 2-year-old child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define diarrhea and classify its duration and type. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities, especially dehydration severity and red flags. Next, I will consider likely etiologies in this age group and when to test. After that, I need to outline universal management with oral rehydration, nutrition, and zinc, followed by selective use of antibiotics and other symptomatic therapies. Finally, I should plan follow-up, prevention, and special considerations like C. difficile and functional toddler's diarrhea, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor on a vague symptom description. Diarrhea is best defined as three or more loose or watery stools in 24 hours or more frequent than the child's normal pattern, and I should categorize duration as acute (< 14 days), persistent (14–29 days), or chronic (≥ 30 days), and phenotype as watery versus bloody, because these distinctions drive testing and treatment decisions [^1125KSJb] [^114Vv3mT].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate priorities in the initial assessment. I need to check for dehydration using clinical signs such as thirst, decreased urine output, sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes, and altered mental status, and I should remember that WHO criteria can overestimate dehydration in about 13% and underestimate in about 7% of cases, so I should integrate history of stool frequency, vomiting, and last urination with exam findings and, when available, laboratory markers like low serum bicarbonate or hyperuricemia to improve diagnostic accuracy [^117JU66P]. I also need to screen for red flags that warrant urgent escalation: severe dehydration, lethargy or altered consciousness, persistent vomiting preventing oral intake, blood in stool, high fever with toxicity, severe abdominal pain, immunocompromise, or failure to thrive, since these features change management and disposition [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I consider the age-specific landscape. In children 2–5 years, most acute watery diarrhea is viral, with norovirus now competing with rotavirus where vaccination is widespread, while bacterial causes like Shigella, Campylobacter, ETEC, and EPEC still account for a meaningful minority and carry higher risk of severe outcomes in certain settings [^116b35Ty] [^11494BgB]. I should confirm whether the child is vaccinated against rotavirus, because vaccination status shifts pretest probabilities and community transmission dynamics [^111ndPHx].

> I need to ensure I'm not overtesting. For immunocompetent children with mild-to-moderate, acute, nonbloody watery diarrhea and no red flags, routine stool diagnostics are low yield and generally unnecessary, but I should test if there is dysentery, moderate-to-severe disease, persistent symptoms beyond about a week, immunocompromise, recent antibiotics, travel, outbreak suspicion, or failure to improve as expected, since targeted testing in these scenarios increases diagnostic yield and guides therapy [^116CuDrD] [^1148R2pr]. But wait, what if I suspect C. difficile in a 2-year-old? I should double-check guidance: testing is not recommended routinely in children 1–2 years because asymptomatic colonization is common; testing is reserved for severe, persistent, or unexplained cases after other causes are excluded, and never in infants ≤ 12 months unless very specific severe criteria are met [^115xFU4f] [^116cehL1] [^113ToMpN].

> Next, I should review universal management, starting with oral rehydration. Reduced-osmolarity ORS is first-line for mild-to-moderate dehydration, and I should continue breastfeeding or formula as tolerated throughout the illness. If oral intake is not tolerated, nasogastric ORS is a reasonable bridge, and for severe dehydration I must use IV fluids and correct perfusion and mental status before transitioning to ORS for deficit replacement and maintenance [^116t5QFh] [^112a9xde] [^1117Tzi7] [^116T8iZ1]. I should confirm maintenance strategy by replacing ongoing stool and vomit losses with ORS and resuming age-appropriate diet promptly after rehydration to support recovery and nutrition [^1126Ddg7] [^111Lqkk8].

> I should confirm zinc policy because age matters. In children ≥ 6 months living in settings with zinc deficiency or with malnutrition, oral zinc shortens diarrhea duration by roughly 10–12 hours on average and reduces persistence at day 7. However, in children < 6 months, zinc does not help and may increase vomiting, so I should avoid zinc in infants under 6 months and tailor use to local deficiency prevalence and nutritional status [^116EwJPp] [^111KYhPn] [^115XUxNq].

> Let me consider probiotics carefully, since recommendations have evolved. IDSA suggests considering probiotics to reduce symptom severity and duration in immunocompetent children, but high-quality contemporary evidence shows little to no benefit on key outcomes like duration ≥ 48 hours or hospitalization, with substantial heterogeneity and publication bias; therefore, I should frame probiotics as optional, low-risk, and not a substitute for ORS and zinc, especially in moderate-to-severe dehydrating illness where benefit is unproven [^114dmvXk] [^114vx3r8] [^1112LgJh].

> Now, antibiotics — this is where I need to be precise. IDSA advises against empiric antibiotics for acute watery diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts, with exceptions for ill-appearing young infants or the immunocompromised, and to avoid empiric therapy in persistent watery diarrhea. However, azithromycin is indicated for dysentery or suspected Shigella, and in low-resource settings a large RCT showed no overall mortality benefit from adding azithromycin to WHO care, yet a reanalysis using molecular diagnostics found shorter day-3 diarrhea and fewer 90-day deaths or hospitalizations in children with likely or possible bacterial etiologies, suggesting a targeted benefit that still requires better diagnostics before routine adoption [^111LYwyM] [^115g8TM3] [^111muNpK] [^116tubYj] [^1114YHNr]. Hold on, I should verify dosing if I do treat: azithromycin 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 days is the regimen studied in the ABCD trial and is reasonable when treating confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial watery diarrhea in high-risk children, balancing potential benefit against resistance risks [^111muNpK].

> I will now examine symptomatic therapies I should avoid or restrict. Antimotility agents like loperamide are contraindicated in children, and racecadotril has at best modest, inconsistent benefits and is not routinely recommended outside trials, so I should prioritize rehydration and nutrition and reserve these for exceptional contexts if at all [^113DRoeK] [^1169SWm8]. For vomiting that impedes ORT, ondansetron can facilitate oral rehydration in older children, but I should confirm local protocols and weigh risks like diarrhea and QT prolongation in susceptible patients [^117S7csM].

> Next, I should review follow-up and reassessment. I need to ensure caregivers can recognize worsening dehydration, return precautions, and adhere to ORS and feeding plans, and I should arrange follow-up within 24–48 hours for moderate cases or earlier if red flags emerge. If there is no improvement by day 3–5 or if symptoms persist beyond 14 days, I should re-evaluate for alternative diagnoses, malabsorption, parasitic infection like Cryptosporidium, or noninfectious causes, and consider targeted testing and referral [^111pT2PA].

> I should double-check prevention counseling because it reduces recurrence. Emphasize hand hygiene, safe water, and sanitation. Ensure up-to-date rotavirus vaccination in eligible infants. And in children ≥ 6 months in zinc-deficient settings, consider periodic zinc supplementation as a population-level strategy to reduce diarrheal burden, while recognizing that acute-episode zinc is adjunctive, not a substitute for primary prevention [^115uPKwB] [^117EwKV1] [^115xSAcA].

> But wait, what if this is not infectious diarrhea at all? Functional toddler's diarrhea presents with frequent, painless, large, unformed stools in an otherwise healthy, thriving 1–3-year-old and requires no testing or treatment beyond reassurance and dietary normalization; I should confirm growth trajectory and absence of alarm features before labeling, to avoid unnecessary workups [^111N5c4k] [^117HYu8c].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. For a 2-year-old with acute watery diarrhea, I should classify severity and phenotype, prioritize dehydration assessment and ORS, continue age-appropriate nutrition including breastfeeding or formula, add zinc if ≥ 6 months and risk factors are present, avoid routine antibiotics and antimotility agents, reserve testing for dysentery, severe disease, persistence, or special exposures, and escalate care for red flags. If the child is dehydrated or malnourished in a high-burden setting, I can consider azithromycin only when bacterial etiology is likely or strongly suspected, acknowledging evolving but not yet practice-changing evidence for targeted benefit [^116t5QFh] [^111LYwyM] [^111muNpK] [^116tubYj].

Diarrhea in a 2-year-old is most often due to **viral infections** (rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, astrovirus) [^1118dWLP] [^112Kv8Jv] and is typically self-limited [^116nboPy]. The priority is to **assess dehydration** and treat with oral rehydration solution (ORS) [^116t5QFh]; continue age-appropriate feeding [^111Lqkk8], and give zinc if the child is ≥ 6 months and from a setting with zinc deficiency or malnutrition [^117EwKV1] [^111KYhPn]. Antibiotics are not routine [^111LYwyM]; reserve for dysentery [^115g8TM3], suspected cholera, or high-risk hosts [^113JD2Em]. Probiotics may shorten illness by ~24 hours [^111Uwqao] [^114dmvXk]. Seek urgent care for severe dehydration, persistent vomiting, blood in stool, high fever, lethargy, or illness lasting > 14 days [^111pT2PA].

## Common causes of diarrhea in 2-year-olds

- **Viral infections**: Most common; rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus predominate [^112Kv8Jv] [^116b35Ty].

- **Bacterial infections**: Less common but important; Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and E. coli are typical pathogens [^11494BgB] [^114Vv3mT].

- **Parasitic infections**: Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium are notable, especially in immunocompromised or daycare-exposed children [^114Vv3mT] [^116tubYj].

- **Non-infectious causes**: Dietary changes, food intolerances, antibiotics, and functional toddler's diarrhea [^111N5c4k] [^117HYu8c].

---

## Clinical assessment and dehydration evaluation

Assessment should include **frequency, duration, and stool characteristics** (watery, bloody, mucous); associated symptoms (vomiting, fever, abdominal pain); and signs of dehydration (dry mucosa, decreased tears, sunken eyes, delayed capillary refill, lethargy) [^117JU66P]. Dehydration severity guides therapy:

| **Severity** | **Clinical signs** |
|-|-|
| Mild | - Minimal dehydration <br/> - Normal vital signs <br/> - Slightly dry mucosa <br/> - Normal skin turgor |
| Moderate | - Tachycardia <br/> - Decreased urine output <br/> - Sunken eyes <br/> - Delayed capillary refill <br/> - Irritable but consolable |
| Severe | - Hypotension <br/> - Lethargy <br/> - Very delayed capillary refill <br/> - Marked sunken eyes <br/> - Minimal urine output |

---

## Recommended management strategies

### Fluid management

- **Oral rehydration solution (ORS)**: First-line for mild-to-moderate dehydration; reduced-osmolarity ORS is preferred [^116t5QFh] [^116JZifh].

- **Nasogastric ORS**: Use if oral intake is inadequate or refused [^1117Tzi7].

- **Intravenous fluids**: For severe dehydration or ORS failure [^116T8iZ1].

---

### Nutritional management

Continue **age-appropriate feeding** during and after rehydration [^111Lqkk8] [^112a9xde]. Lactose restriction is generally unnecessary; consider lactose-free options only if persistent diarrhea or lactose intolerance is suspected [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Zinc supplementation**: Give 10–20 mg daily for 10–14 days to children ≥ 6 months in zinc-deficient settings or with malnutrition [^117EwKV1] [^111KYhPn].

- **Probiotics**: Consider Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii; may shorten diarrhea by ~24 hours [^111Uwqao] [^114dmvXk].

- **Antibiotics**: Not routine; reserve for dysentery, suspected cholera, or high-risk hosts (e.g. immunocompromised) [^111LYwyM] [^115g8TM3].

---

## Indications for medical consultation or hospitalization

Seek **urgent care** for:

- **Severe dehydration**: Hypotension, lethargy, very delayed capillary refill, minimal urine output.

- **Persistent vomiting**: Unable to retain fluids.

- **Blood in stool**: Suggests bacterial dysentery or other serious pathology [^116CuDrD].

- **High fever**: ≥ 39°C or fever lasting > 3 days.

- **Lethargy or altered consciousness**: Indicates severe illness.

- **Persistent diarrhea**: > 14 days or failure to improve after 3–5 days of therapy [^111pT2PA].

---

## Preventive measures

- **Hand hygiene**: Frequent handwashing reduces transmission [^116b3fHg].

- **Safe water and food**: Ensure clean drinking water and safe food handling [^112oCrK1].

- **Vaccination**: Rotavirus vaccine significantly reduces severe diarrhea [^111ndPHx].

- **Breastfeeding**: Continued breastfeeding provides protection and nutrition [^112a9xde].

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications include **dehydration**, the most common and serious risk, as well as electrolyte disturbances such as hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Malnutrition can result from prolonged or recurrent diarrhea, and secondary infections — including bacterial or parasitic — may occur. Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome or other gastrointestinal sequelae can follow severe episodes.

---

## Prognosis

Most cases resolve within **3–7 days** with appropriate rehydration and supportive care [^notfound]. Persistent diarrhea (> 14 days) warrants further evaluation for underlying causes, including malabsorption, parasitic infection, or inflammatory bowel disease [^111pT2PA].

---

Diarrhea in 2-year-olds is **usually viral and self-limited**; prioritize dehydration assessment, ORS, continued feeding, and zinc where indicated, and reserve antibiotics for select cases. Prompt recognition of warning signs and preventive measures are essential to reduce morbidity and complications.

### Inability to reduce morbidity of diarrhea by ORS: can we design a better therapy? [^1145ixH7]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Diarrheal disease is a worldwide problem that still causes significant morbidity and mortality among children. Currently, oral rehydration solution (ORS) is the standard of care for acute diarrhea in pediatric patients. Although effective in reducing mortality, ORS does not alleviate diarrheal symptoms, thus reducing caregiver compliance and therapeutic efficacy. This article will briefly review the current problem of pediatric diarrhea and the shortcomings of current therapies; however, the focus of this review is to examine the intestinal calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). The author summarizes the evidence suggesting that targeting the CaSR will enable clinicians to address all four major pathophysiological mechanisms of diarrheal disease, and substantiates the need for future research regarding this therapy.

Pediatric diagnosis — toddlers and older children: Clostridium difficile testing should not be routinely performed in children with diarrhea who are 1–2 years of age unless other infectious or noninfectious causes have been excluded (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). In children ≥ 2 years of age, C. difficile testing is recommended for patients with prolonged or worsening diarrhea and risk factors (eg, underlying inflammatory bowel disease or immunocompromising conditions) or relevant exposures (eg, contact with the healthcare system or recent antibiotics) (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

### Diarrhea and your child… [^115UZRSB]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

When a child's bowel pattern changes suddenly to a loose and watery bowel movement and occurs more often than usual, he or she has diarrhea. Diarrhea is a common symptom of illness in young children. In the United States, children younger than 4 years may have diarrhea 1 or 2 times each year. Diarrhea can be acute or chronic. Here is information from the American Academy of Pediatrics about acute diarrhea, as well as how to manage the symptoms, and how to help reduce your child's chances of getting diarrhea. Most diarrhea in children is caused by viruses. Diarrhea can also be caused by bacteria, parasites, changes in diet, problems with the intestines, and the use of some medicines. Most of the time mild.

### Double trouble: ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^113Xdkk7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is important to distinguish that there are 2 related but distinct pathological conditions in our patient described above. Failure to realize this could yield an inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis and a poor patient outcome. Therefore, it was important to generate 2 separate differential diagnoses in this case, 1 for acute abdominal pain and 1 for chronic secretory diarrhea.

Regarding her abdominal pain the diagnoses in were considered (Table 1). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was less likely with a stable weight, normal ESR (of 3), normal albumin, normal hemoglobin, and no inflammatory cells in the stool. Transglutaminase IgA and IgG were both negative, reducing the likelihood for celiac disease. Appendicitis, pyelonephritis, and cholecystitis were ruled out with MRI on admission. Ovarian torsion was also unlikely as her ovaries were visualized and normal on the MRI. Urinalysis on admission was negative for hemoglobin and microscopy showed only 5 to 10 RBCs making nephrolithiasis possible, but less likely than other entities. Urine culture grew 10,000 colonies of E coli but patient denied dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, or flank pain, so unlikely to be urinary tract infection (UTI)/pyelonephritis. An abdominal X-ray was negative for small bowel obstruction. Peptic ulcer disease was less likely due to the location and episodic nature of her abdominal pain unrelated to timing of meals. Malignancy was less likely due to the acute nature of the pain and lack of weight changes, fevers, or mass/lymphadenopathy on MRI. Lipase and MRI were negative for acute pancreatitis. Intussusception was diagnosed via the abdominal ultrasound that captured the bowel telescoping.

Table 1.
Differential Diagnosis for Abdominal Pain for Preadolescent Female Patient.

Intussusception is defined as the slipping of a portion of bowel into the neighboring portion. This condition generally occurs in young children, and only 30% occur in individuals greater than 2 years of age. Risk factors for intussusception include young age, intestinal malformations, and any condition that leads to inflammation of the GI tract as identified in (Table 2). The rotavirus vaccine has also been associated with intussusception. In some cases, a pathologic lead point, which is an anatomic anomaly that predisposes the bowel to intussusception, is identified. Examples of pathologic lead points include Meckel's diverticulum, polyp, or tumor. In most cases of intussusception, no cause is discovered (idiopathic) and no lead point is identified.

Supportive treatment — rehydration therapy indicates oral rehydration solution (ORS) as first-line and allows nasogastric administration in select cases: reduced ORS is recommended as the first-line therapy of mild to moderate dehydration in infants, children, and adults with acute diarrhea from any cause (strong, moderate), and in people with mild to moderate dehydration associated with vomiting or severe diarrhea. Nasogastric administration of ORS may be considered in infants, children and adults with moderate dehydration who cannot tolerate oral intake, or in children with normal mental status who are too weak or refuse to drink adequately (weak, low).

### Parasitic infections in Swiss children: are we overtesting? [^111N5c4k]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Twelve percent of all tested patients in our cohort were under the age of 2 years and we only found negative stool results for them. The main diagnosis after those tests was functional toddler's diarrhea. The prevalence of this functional phenomenon was found to be 6% in the US. When a child daily passes painlessly 4 or more large, unformed stools for at least 4 weeks, it has an adequate caloric intake without failure to thrive and is at onset of symptoms between 6 and 60 months of age, the diagnosis of functional toddler's diarrhea can be made without further investigations according to the Rome IV Criteria for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in Infants and Toddlers. Whilst there are lot of data proofing, that in developing countries parasites, such as Cryptosporidium are commonly causing episodes of diarrhea, especially in young children under the age of 5 years, the situation of enteric pathogens is different in Europe: Our findings are in line with a prospective study from Paris, where no parasites were detected in children under the age of 2 years.

In our cohort, the second most common indication in negative tested children for parasite infection was diarrhea. A disadvantage of this retrospective study is, that often the consistency and frequency of the stool is not specified, which is important to decide whether further diagnostic is indicated, as usually diarrhoeal illness has to be subdivided into three main categories, based on its clinical presentation: Acute watery, bloody or persistent diarrhea. According to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases, the incidence of acute diarrhea (defined as a decrease in the consistency of stools and/or an increase in the frequency of evacuations, more than 3 in 24 h) ranges from 0.5 to 2 episodes per child per year in children under 3 years in Europe with Rotavirus being the most frequent agent. The guidelines state that children presenting with acute gastroenteritis don't require routine etiological investigation, but microbiological tests may be considered in children with immune deficiencies.

Pediatric diagnosis — neonates and infants ≤ 12 months: Because of high asymptomatic carriage, testing for CDI should never be routinely recommended for neonates or infants ≤ 12 months of age with diarrhea (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Children < 12 months of age should only be tested if they have evidence of pseudomembranous colitis or toxic megacolon, or if they have clinically significant diarrhea and other causes have been excluded; the rate of C. difficile colonization among asymptomatic infants can exceed 40%, and C. difficile toxin can still be detected in approximately 15% of 2-year-old infants.

### Effect of 3 days of oral azithromycin on young children with acute diarrhea in low-resource settings: a randomized clinical trial [^11494BgB]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately half a million children die annually as a result of acute diarrhea, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. The current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the case management of acute diarrhea (rehydration, supplemental zinc, continued feeding, and follow-up)have contributed to significant reductions in diarrhea-associated mortality. These guidelines do not include the use of antibiotics except in the case of bloody diarrhea or suspected cholera.

Studies have shown that 1 or more pathogens can be identified in more than two-thirds of children with acute diarrhea in low- and middle-income settings. After rotavirus, bacterial pathogens such as Shigella, heat-stable enterotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (ST-ETEC), Campylobacter, and typical enteropathogenic E coli are the leading causes of diarrhea. These bacterial pathogens are associated with subsequent deathand linear growth faltering. With the implementation of rotavirus vaccine programs, the relative contributions of bacterial causes will likely increase but will remain undiagnosed in the absence of point-of-care diagnostics. Current treatment guidelines may therefore be missing the opportunity to appropriately treat bacterial diarrhea in a select group of young children with dehydrating diarrhea or undernutrition who are at particularly high risk of diarrhea-associated mortality.

Azithromycin, a macrolide with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, is effective against common diarrheal pathogens, including enterotoxigenic E coli, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. In addition, there are yet-uncharacterized survival benefits, as indicated by improved survival among young children who benefitted from the biannual mass administration of drugs in high-mortality settings in Africa. At the same time, there are concerns regarding the potential wide use of azithromycin as prophylaxis on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in children and their communities.

We conducted a multicountry, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ie, the Antibiotics for Children With Diarrhea [ABCD] trial) to determine whether the addition of azithromycin to the standard case management of acute nonbloody, watery diarrhea among children 2 to 23 months of age who are dehydrated or undernourished could reduce mortality and improve linear growth.

### Infectious diarrhea in developed and developing countries [^116nboPy]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhea from gastrointestinal infection remains a common problem. In industrialized countries, management is aimed at reducing morbidity and defining groups that may benefit from further investigation. Most infectious diarrhea is self-limiting and only requires supportive management. Viral agents are increasingly recognized as causative agents of epidemic and sporadic diarrhea. In developing countries, diarrhea is a major cause of mortality in children. Oral rehydration therapy, guided by a clinical assessment of the degree of dehydration, is cheap, simple, and effective and remains the mainstay of management of infant diarrhea. Controversies focus on the optimal formulation of oral rehydration solution. A vaccine against rotavirus has the potential to save millions of lives worldwide.

Infectious diarrhea — reevaluation for nonresponse or persistent symptoms: A clinical and laboratory reevaluation may be indicated in people who do not respond to an initial course of therapy and should include consideration of noninfectious conditions, particularly when symptoms last 14 or more days; reassessment of fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional status, and optimal dose and duration of antimicrobial therapy is recommended in people with persistent symptoms, and the usual duration of symptoms may be up to 10–14 days or longer.

### Racecadotril in the management of diarrhea: an underestimated therapeutic option? [^114vdxbX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute infectious diarrhea (AID) represents an important clinical entity both regarding morbidity and mortality rates, even in industrialized countries, and it leads to one of the major public health burdens, among gastroenterological diseases, with significant healthcare costs. Oral rehydration solution is the cornerstone of the therapy, but despite its proven efficacy in avoiding dehydration, it is still underused as it does not reduce the duration of diarrhea; hence, it is perceived as ineffective by caregivers. In this narrative review, we collected literature regarding the use of racecadotril, deeply discussing its role in the treatment of AID in both adults and children. Racecadotril has been studied in wide populations of patients, in many countries, and in different clinical settings. Its effectiveness in reducing the stool output and the duration of diarrhea has been proven, not only in the early phase of the disease. Racecadotril has been shown to increase the likelihood of home management of AID, to reduce hospitalizations and parenteral rehydration needs resulting in healthcare costs reduction. The current new formulations require only two-daily doses for adults and the pediatric syrup should simplify its use.

Regarding medical management for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to intravenous fluids, IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend to continue IV rehydration in severe dehydration until pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize, and the patient awakens, has no risk factors for aspiration, and has no evidence of ileus.
Consider replacing the remaining deficit with oral rehydration.

### Limitations of probiotic therapy in acute, severe dehydrating diarrhea [^1151LbxC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have shown that probiotics, most commonly, may be useful in treating acute gastroenteritis. However, beneficial effects appear to be limited to a modest decrease in the duration of diarrhea. No studies have evaluated this therapy in moderate to severe dehydrating diarrhea in a metabolic facility.

Methods

Male children less than 2 years of age were admitted to a metabolic unit of the Department of Pediatrics at the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil, with moderate dehydration and were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) was administered per protocol and either placebo or was given in combination with the ORS. Output of urine, stool, and vomitus was recorded along with stool weight, nude body weight, and standard laboratory assessments for hydration.

Results

There was no significant reduction in diarrhea duration and stool output in the group. However, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that, even in moderate to severe diarrhea, resolution of the illness occurred so rapidly, that statistically significant benefits of probiotic therapy could not be demonstrated.

Conclusion

Our data implies that colonization must occur before benefits of probiotics can be realized. Probiotics are, therefore, likely to be of limited benefit in treating diarrheal illnesses of short duration such as viral enteritis. The beneficial effects of probiotics may be limited to prophylactic usage in high-risk populations.

### Zinc and copper supplementation in acute diarrhea in children: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111jeGJW]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhea causes an estimated 2.5 million child deaths in developing countries each year, 35% of which are due to acute diarrhea. The importance of zinc and copper in the pathophysiology of acute diarrhea is highlighted by the significantly higher daily fecal losses of these elements during acute diarrheal episodes than the fecal losses in unaffected children. Conversely, zinc supplementation exhibits therapeutic action by facilitating the transport of water and electrolytes across the intestinal mucosa, preventing villous atrophy and improving overall immunity. A pooled analysis of the impact of zinc supplements added to the treatment regimens for acute diarrhea has reported a beneficial effect of reduction in the duration of diarrhea. A recently published Cochrane review has reported a reduction of the duration of acute diarrhea in the zinc group by 12 hours, but there was significant heterogeneity between the trials examined. Consequently, the current paradigm favors the use of Zn supplementation for treatment of acute diarrhea in children.

The reported efficacy of zinc therapy for acute diarrhea, although encouraging, needs to be considered in the light of several caveats. First, the initial pooled analysis reported a beneficial effect of zinc on duration of diarrhea but a similar effect on the volume of stools was not included in this analysis or the subsequent Cochrane review. Second, additional supplementations in the form of multivitamins or vitamin A were also administered with zinc and placebo in most of the studies included in these reviews, and it is difficult to ignore the possibility of synergistic effects of the co-interventions. Third, the potential beneficial effects of zinc supplementation across different sub-groups of children with acute diarrhea based on age, nutritional status or diarrheal etiology are still not established. Lastly, community-based trials are more prone to difficulties with monitoring, compliance and measurement of the trial outcomes such as stool frequency, volume and duration. Large community-based, cluster-randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trials of daily prophylactic supplements of 10 mg of zinc found no significant difference in frequency of diarrhea, duration, all-cause hospitalization rates or overall mortality, in Nepal, India and Zanzibar.

### Racecadotril for acute diarrhoea in children [^1169SWm8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute diarrhoea is a leading cause of death for children under five years of age. Most deaths are caused by excessive fluid and electrolyte losses. Racecadotril is an anti-secretory drug that has been used for acute diarrhoea in children as an adjunct to oral rehydration therapy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of racecadotril for treating acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, published in the Cochrane Library Issue 3, March 2019); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), up to 4 March 2019, for clinical trials regardless of publication language or status.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared racecadotril to placebo or no intervention in addition to standard care (oral rehydration therapy) in children under five with acute diarrhoea. The primary outcomes were failure of oral rehydration, duration of diarrhoea, and number of stools. The secondary outcomes were stool output, length of the hospital stay, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. We presented dichotomous data with risk ratios (RR) and continuous data with mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD). Where appropriate, we combined trials with meta-analysis and used a random-effects model if there was significant heterogeneity (I² ≥ 50%). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Seven RCTs with a total of 1140 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials were carried out on children aged three months to five years, in outpatient and inpatient facilities from France, Spain, Peru, India, Kenya, and Ecuador. The efficacy and safety of racecadotril were compared to placebo or no treatment. Racecadotril may reduce the risk of rehydration failure (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.23; 2 RCTs, 192 participants; low-certainty evidence). Data on duration of diarrhoea, number of stools in the first 48 hours are insufficient to reach a conclusion; stool output in the first 48 hours appears to be lower in the two trials measuring this, although the data is not combinable. Length of hospital stay was similar in two studies measuring this, and overall there was no evidence that racecadotril increased overall rate of adverse events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22; 5 RCTs, 688 participants; low-certainty evidence). Most adverse events in the racecadotril group were mild or moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Racecadotril seems to be a safe drug but has little benefit in improving acute diarrhoea in children under five years of age. Current evidence does not support routine use of racecadotril in management of acute diarrhoea in children under five outside of the context of placebo controlled RCTs. 18 December 2019 Up to date All studies incorporated from most recent search All studies identified during the most recent search (4 Mar, 2019) have been incorporated in the review, and no ongoing studies identified.

### Validity analysis on the findings of dehydration in 2 to 24-month-old children with acute diarrhea [^117JU66P]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The most common cause of diarrheal mortality in children is dehydration. In this study, we aimed to assess the validity (sensitivity and specificity) of history and the clinical and laboratory findings in in the diagnosis of dehydration in children younger than 2 years with acute diarrhea.

Methods

One hundred twenty-six 2 to 24-month-old children with acute diarrhea, who were admitted to Hacettepe University Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital's Diarrheal Diseases Treatment and Training Unit, were included. The patients were examined on admission for clinical findings of dehydration. Percent weight loss on admission was calculated by using the weight on admission and the weight after the diarrhea resolution and was used as the golden standard for analyzing the validity of clinical and laboratory findings.

Results

Compared with the golden standard, dehydration was overestimated in 13% of the cases and underestimated in 7% when using only the World Health Organization criteria. Dehydrated children had higher diarrheal frequency and longer anuria time. Thirst, weakness, sunken fontanelle, sunken eyes, decreased tears, dry mucous membranes, and dry lip were detected in children with 2% or greater of weight loss. The most valid laboratory findings were low serum pH (< 7.30), low bicarbonate (< 15 mmol/L), and hyperurisemia (> 5.8 mg/dL). In multivariate analysis, physical findings, such as thirst, dry mucous membranes, weakness, sunken eyes, hoarse crying, and low pH, were found to be significant for the diagnosis of dehydration.

Conclusions

In children with acute diarrhea, diarrheal frequency and last urination time should be asked, thirst, dry mucous membranes, weakness, sunken eyes, and hoarse crying should be examined.

### Zinc deficiency in children with environmental enteropathy-development of new strategies: report from an expert workshop [^115xSAcA]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Zinc deficiency is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. The WHO/UNICEF strategy for zinc supplementation as adjunctive therapy for diarrhea is poorly implemented. A conference of experts in zinc nutrition and gastrointestinal disorders was convened to consider approaches that might complement the current recommendation and what research was needed to develop these approaches. Several key points were identified. The design of novel zinc interventions would be facilitated by a better understanding of how disturbed gut function, such as environmental (or tropical) enteropathy, affects zinc absorption, losses, and homeostasis. Because only 10% of zinc stores are able to be rapidly turned over, and appear to be rapidly depleted by acute intestinal illness, they are probably best maintained by complementary regular supplementation in a primary prevention strategy rather than secondary prevention triggered by acute diarrhea. The assessment of zinc status is challenging and complex without simple, validated measures to facilitate field testing of novel interventions. Zinc bioavailability may be a crucial factor in the success of primary prevention strategies, and a range of options, all still inadequately explored, might be valuable in improving zinc nutrition. Some therapeutic actions of zinc on diarrhea seem attributable to pharmacologic effects, whereas others are related to the reversal of deficiency (ie, nutritional). The distinction between these 2 mechanisms cannot be clarified given the insensitivity of serum zinc to identify subclinical deficiency states. Why zinc seems to be less effective than expected at all ages, and ineffective for secondary prevention of diarrhea in children < 12 mo of age, remains unclear. It was concluded that a reframing of the current recommendation is warranted with consideration of how to better optimize and deliver zinc and whether to provide a complementary public health primary prevention zinc strategy. This requires careful consideration of the zinc product to be used as well as strategies for its delivery.

### Age-specific spectrum of etiological pathogens for viral diarrhea among children in twelve consecutive winter-spring seasons (2009–2021) in China [^114A8q78]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Globally, acute diarrhea infection remains the most frequent childhood illness and cause of attendance at health facilities, particularly in low‐income and middle‐income countries. An estimated 1 in 10 childhood deaths results from diarrhea disease during the first five years of life. Despite significant progress in reducing diarrhea mortality through vaccination intervention, improving sanitation water supply, and public health awareness, it remains 1 of the top 5 causes of death among children younger than five years.

Although intensive data about the etiology and epidemiology of infectious diarrhea in children are available, the etiology differs among age groups depending on geography, climate, and economic development. However, most previous studies lacked continuous active surveillance and without comprehensive laboratory detection of enteric viruses. Particularly, limited data are available regarding the etiology of infectious diarrhea disentangled by age and other demography. An enhanced acquirement of these refined data in children would be valuable for planning and adopting targeted preventive measures. Here we conducted a long persistent active surveillance study in Chongqing, a mountainous region with dense populations and high humidity in southwestern China, to identify the age‐specific etiological, epidemiological, and clinical features of children with acute diarrhea.

### Azithromycin for bacterial watery diarrhea: a reanalysis of the antiBiotics for children with severe diarrhea (ABCD) trial incorporating molecular diagnostics [^116tubYj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Bacterial pathogens cause substantial diarrhea morbidity and mortality among children living in endemic settings, yet antimicrobial treatment is only recommended for dysentery or suspected cholera.

Methods

AntiBiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea was a 7-country, placebo-controlled, double-blind efficacy trial of azithromycin in children 2–23 months of age with watery diarrhea accompanied by dehydration or malnutrition. We tested fecal samples for enteric pathogens utilizing quantitative polymerase chain reaction to identify likely and possible bacterial etiologies and employed pathogen-specific cutoffs based on genomic target quantity in previous case-control diarrhea etiology studies to identify likely and possible bacterial etiologies.

Results

Among 6692 children, the leading likely etiologies were rotavirus (21.1%), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli encoding heat-stable toxin (13.3%), Shigella (12.6%), and Cryptosporidium (9.6%). More than one-quarter (1894 [28.3%]) had a likely and 1153 (17.3%) a possible bacterial etiology. Day 3 diarrhea was less common in those randomized to azithromycin versus placebo among children with a likely bacterial etiology (risk difference [RD] likely, −11.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, −15.6 to −7.6]) and possible bacterial etiology (RD possible, −8.7 [95% CI, −13.0 to −4.4]) but not in other children (RD unlikely, −0.3% [95% CI, −2.9% to 2.3%]). A similar association was observed for 90-day hospitalization or death (RD likely, −3.1 [95% CI, −5.3 to −1.0]; RD possible, −2.3 [95% CI, −4.5 to −.01]; RD unlikely, −0.6 [95% CI, −1.9 to.6]). The magnitude of risk differences was similar among specific likely bacterial etiologies, including Shigella.

Conclusions

Acute watery diarrhea confirmed or presumed to be of bacterial etiology may benefit from azithromycin treatment.

### Toddler diarrhoea: is it a useful diagnostic label? [^117HYu8c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Toddler diarrhoea is a term coined many years ago to describe a young child who passes several loose stools a day but who is otherwise healthy with excellent growth and normal examination. It could be argued that it is not an appropriate diagnostic term as it potentially stops the clinician from thinking about the possible causes of loose stools in this clinical situation. This article, which follows a debate between the authors on the topic at the 2010 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Annual meeting, discusses the differential diagnoses of a young child presenting with the so-called toddler diarrhoea.

### Probiotics for treating acute infectious diarrhoea [^114vx3r8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Probiotics may be effective in reducing the duration of acute infectious diarrhoea.

Objectives

To assess the effects of probiotics in proven or presumed acute infectious diarrhoea.

Search Methods

We searched the trials register of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 17 December 2019, as well as the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 12, 2019), in the Cochrane Library, and reference lists from studies and reviews. We included additional studies identified during external review.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing a specified probiotic agent with a placebo or no probiotic in people with acute diarrhoea that is proven or presumed to be caused by an infectious agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Primary outcomes were measures of diarrhoea duration (diarrhoea lasting ≥ 48 hours; duration of diarrhoea). Secondary outcomes were number of people hospitalized in community studies, duration of hospitalization in inpatient studies, diarrhoea lasting ≥ 14 days, and adverse events.

Main Results

We included 82 studies with a total of 12,127 participants. These studies included 11,526 children (age < 18 years) and 412 adults (three studies recruited 189 adults and children but did not specify numbers in each age group). No cluster-randomized trials were included. Studies varied in the definitions used for "acute diarrhoea" and "end of the diarrhoeal illness" and in the probiotic(s) tested. A total of 53 trials were undertaken in countries where both child and adult mortality was low or very low, and 26 where either child or adult mortality was high. Risk of bias was high or unclear in many studies, and there was marked statistical heterogeneity when findings for the primary outcomes were pooled in meta-analysis. Effect size was similar in the sensitivity analysis and marked heterogeneity persisted. Publication bias was demonstrated from funnel plots for the main outcomes. In our main analysis of the primary outcomes in studies at low risk for all indices of risk of bias, no difference was detected between probiotic and control groups for the risk of diarrhoea lasting ≥ 48 hours (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.09; 2 trials, 1770 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); or for duration of diarrhoea (mean difference (MD) 8.64 hours shorter, 95% CI 29.4 hours shorter to 12.1 hours longer; 6 trials, 3058 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Effect size was similar and marked heterogeneity persisted in pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary outcomes that included all studies. These included analyses limited to the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii. In six trials (433 participants) of Lactobacillus reuteri, there was consistency amongst findings (I² = 0%), but risk of bias was present in all included studies. Heterogeneity also was not explained by types of participants (age, nutritional/socioeconomic status captured by mortality stratum, region of the world where studies were undertaken), diarrhoea in children caused by rotavirus, exposure to antibiotics, and the few studies of children who were also treated with zinc. In addition, there were no clear differences in effect size for the primary outcomes in post hoc analyses according to decade of publication of studies and whether or not trials had been registered. For other outcomes, the duration of hospitalization in inpatient studies on average was shorter in probiotic groups than in control groups but there was marked heterogeneity between studies (I² = 96%; MD -18.03 hours, 95% CI -27.28 to -8.78, random-effects model: 24 trials, 4056 participants). No differences were detected between probiotic and control groups in the number of people with diarrhoea lasting ≥ 14 days (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.53; 9 studies, 2928 participants) or in risk of hospitalization in community studies (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.89; 6 studies, 2283 participants). No serious adverse events were attributed to probiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

Probiotics probably make little or no difference to the number of people who have diarrhoea lasting 48 hours or longer, and we are uncertain whether probiotics reduce the duration of diarrhoea. This analysis is based on large trials with low risk of bias.

### Hospitalizations and deaths caused by diarrhea in children five years old and younger at four hospitals in Haiti, 2010–2012 [^111ZJEec]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Worldwide, diarrhea is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in children; however, there are few data on the burden of diarrheal disease in Haiti. We conducted a retrospective review of hospital discharge registries from 2010 to 2012 in the pediatric wards of four Haitian hospitals and recorded the number of all-cause hospitalizations and deaths as well as diarrheal hospitalizations and deaths by age (≤ 2 and 3–5 years) and epidemiological week. Diarrhea was associated with 3,582 (33.7%) of 10,621 hospitalizations and 62 (11.5%) of 540 in-hospital deaths in children ≤ 5 years old. Of these children, 88.5% and 96.8%, respectively, were among children ≤ 2 years old. The highest proportions of diarrhea-associated hospitalizations occurred from January to April. At four Haitian hospitals over a 3-year period, during which time a major epidemic of cholera occurred, diarrheal disease in children ≤ 5 years was a major contributor to pediatric hospitalizations and mortality.

### Azithromycin for bacterial watery diarrhea: a reanalysis of the antiBiotics for children with severe diarrhea (ABCD) trial incorporating molecular diagnostics [^113v2Ns9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

This reanalysis of the ABCD trial addresses evidence gaps in the use of antibiotic therapy, in conjunction with other WHO-indicated standards of care, for watery diarrhea of bacterial etiology among children in low- and middle-income settings. If confirmed, the use of azithromycin for acute watery diarrhea in young dehydrated or undernourished children living in settings of high bacterial diarrhea burden may be warranted if the subset of children with diarrhea who benefit from azithromycin can be identified.

### Defining pediatric diarrhea in low-resource settings [^112bh1kD]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Differences in definitions of acute pediatric diarrhea limit accurate quantification of disease burden, treatment coverage, associations with risk factors and health outcomes, and intervention effects. As noted previously, the use of a quantitative definition alone may not always reflect a clinically relevant disease state. Until further validation studies are performed, research settings could consider systematic use of a definition that requires "both" that a minimum frequency threshold is met (≥ 3 loose/watery stools in a 24-hour period) "and" the perception by a caregiver that such an event constitutes an aberration from normal for the individual. Such a definition emphasizes the systematic integration of both the frequency measure and the consideration of caregivers' perception of illness, a combination that, although recognized in early WHO guidelines, we found to be inconsistently applied in practice. Ultimately, a set of standardized definitions of diarrhea based on events of clinical relevance and that target potential pathways for intervention are needed for both research and programmatic evaluation. Biomarkers that represent underlying pathology, including markers of environmental enteric dysfunction, inflammation, microbial dysbiosis, as well as fluid loss, may aid in developing improved clinical definitions. In addition, studies to determine age and feeding status standardized stool frequencies among infants and young children in low-resource, high-burden settings may lead to more accurate definitions of diarrhea for specific subgroups. Universal adoption of a set of valid gold standard definitions specifically aligned with various programmatic and research goals will lead to more accurate estimates of coverage and better-informed resource prioritization.

### Defining pediatric diarrhea in low-resource settings [^1122cn6a]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

The context in which the diarrhea definition is applied will also influence its validity. The accuracy of a definition is inevitably higher when applied to a population already conditioned on caregiver perception of illness. Therefore, the accuracy of a diarrhea definition in correctly classifying true, clinically relevant disease is likely higher when applied at a healthcare facility than applied in a community active surveillance setting. Diarrhea can be caused by a range of enteric infections and local and systemic inflammatory processes that may or may not be captured by any single diarrhea definition. For diarrhea caused by pathogens that produce profuse secretory diarrhea, such as rotavirus and Vibrio cholerae, a definition based on number of loose stools may be optimal. For diarrhea etiologies that result in less acute fluid loss but may be associated with chronic linear growth failure or other more chronic pathologies, such as Cryptosporidium, a definition that includes mother's perception of child's overall health may be warranted. Noninfectious causes of diarrhea, such as inflammatory bowel disease, recent administration of antibiotics, or other non-gastrointestinal infections such as malaria and dengue, for which diarrhea is a common secondary consequence, also complicate the accuracy of diarrhea definitions.

The validity of a diarrhea definition will also depend on the underlying pathophysiology the definition is intended to measure and the goal of its diagnosis. If identifying children with dehydrating diarrhea is the goal, as in the case of cross-sectional surveys aimed at assessing the coverage success of oral rehydration solution, a definition that maximizes the sensitivity and specificity of identifying cases at risk of progressing to dehydration should be used. This definition may differ from one used in efforts to estimate attribution of diarrhea to other outcomes, such as environmental enteric dysfunction or malnutrition, where a definition should be optimized to disaggregate children with the highest and lowest likelihood of experiencing these sequelae.

Infectious diarrhea — probiotics and zinc recommendations — Probiotic preparations may be offered to reduce the symptom severity and duration in immunocompetent adults and children with infectious or antimicrobial-associated diarrhea (weak, moderate), and specific recommendations regarding selection of organism(s), route, and dosage may be found through literature and manufacturer guidance. Oral zinc supplementation reduces the duration of diarrhea in children 6 months to 5 years of age who reside in countries with a high prevalence of zinc deficiency or who have signs of malnutrition (strong, moderate). Meta-analyses report probiotics reduced mean duration of diarrhea by 25 hours (95% confidence interval, 16–34 hours), reduced the risk of diarrhea with a duration > 4 days, and reduced stool frequency on the second day of symptoms, with overall greater efficacy when a viral etiology is identified; most trials report decreased duration and stool frequency, and no adverse events have been directly attributable in healthy recipients, though bacteremia or fungemia has occurred in critically ill or immunocompromised people. For zinc, a meta-analysis of 24 RCTs found oral zinc shortened acute diarrhea in children 6 months to 5 years by 10 hours, with 27 hours reduction among children with signs of malnutrition; the effect on hospitalization and death could not be measured, treatment of persistent diarrhea was shortened by about 16 hours, vomiting was noted to be more common with zinc, and an RCT evaluating a 14-day course in US outpatients and inpatients aged 6 months to 6 years is ongoing.

### Effect of 3 days of oral azithromycin on young children with acute diarrhea in low-resource settings: a randomized clinical trial [^116AsYnA]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Accruing data were monitored, in confidence, by the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) with an interim analysis performed in June 2019, when 40% and 50% of the proposed 11 500 children had been followed up for the primary mortality outcome and the growth outcome, respectively. The DSMB recommended that the trial be stopped for futility on the mortality outcome because available data indicated that the predictive power for rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference in mortality by day 180 was 7% if the trial continued recruitment to target enrollment. For change in length-for-age z score, despite a reasonable predictive power (68%) to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in change in length-for-age z score, the DSMB considered the effect size to be of insufficient clinical or public health relevance significance. Recruitment was stopped at all sites thereafter, although all participants recruited up to that point were followed up for 180 days from recruitment. All ethics committees and regulatory authorities were informed.

### Visual diagnosis: chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive in a 5-year-old girl [^111BVEzu]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic GVHD usually develops 100 days after BMT and is a serious and potentially life-threatening long-term complication. Chronic GVHD can occur after previous or ongoing acute GVHD or in patients without a history of acute GVHD (eg, de novo disease) as illustrated by this case. In evaluating a patient presenting with chronic diarrhea more than 100 days after BMT, one must consider a serious underlying illness such as chronic GVHD because it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. As indicated by this case, chronic GVHD can cause diarrhea. Complete evaluation of the diarrhea state should be part of the initial investigation. In many cases, however, the diagnosis of GVHD is not straightforward, and gastrointestinal biopsy and histologic confirmation is often necessary to corroborate a clinical impression of chronic GVHD.

### Personalized azithromycin treatment rules for children with watery diarrhea using machine learning [^114gazjs]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhea is a leading cause of death globally, especially for children aged less than 5 years. Approximately 25% of diarrheal episodes are likely attributed to bacterial pathogens, which disproportionately contribute to severe outcomes including growth faltering and death –. Antibiotic therapy could prevent poor outcomes, but in the absence of point-of-care diagnostics in most clinical facilities in low-resource settings, it is difficult to identify which episodes are bacterial and therefore could benefit from treatment. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) takes a syndromic approach by recommending antibiotics only for bloody diarrhea. However, this approach misses watery bacterial diarrheal episodes that would likely be responsive to antibiotic therapy and inadvertently results in the widespread overuse of antibiotics because the guidance is perceived as insufficient in practice. Strategies to better target antibiotic treatment are needed to optimize clinical outcomes and limit antibiotic resistance.

The factors that determine antibiotic treatment response may be more complex than bacterial etiology and antibiotic susceptibility. The AntiBiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea (ABCD) randomized clinical trial investigated the effects of azithromycin treatment among dehydrated or undernourished children with acute watery diarrhea, and the primary outcomes for the ABCD trial are published in ref. The trial found no overall survival benefit, but a small improvement in linear growth among children who received azithromycin. Children with diarrhea attributed to bacterial etiologies were found to have reduced risk of diarrhea on day 3 and of hospitalization or death by day 90. Less expectedly, there was also reduced risk of these outcomes (albeit of smaller magnitude) among diarrheal episodes in which bacteria were detected but did not meet the quantity thresholds to be attributed to bacteria. Furthermore, bacterial etiology was not a strong determinant of the effect of azithromycin on linear growth outcomes; the effect of azithromycin was similar regardless of etiology. Together, these results suggest that the determinants of which children benefit from azithromycin treatment are complex and incompletely understood.

Supportive therapy — oral rehydration: Reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) is recommended as the first-line therapy of mild to moderate dehydration in infants, children, and adults with acute diarrhea from any cause (strong, moderate), and in people with mild to moderate dehydration associated with vomiting or severe diarrhea. Nasogastric administration of ORS may be considered in infants, children, and adults with moderate dehydration, who cannot tolerate oral intake, or in children with normal mental status who are too weak or refuse to drink adequately (weak, low).

### A comparison of diarrheal severity scores in the MAL-ED multisite community-based cohort study [^114AJ9ZU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

What Is Known
There is a lack of consensus on how to define severity in community-based studies of childhood diarrhea in the low- and middle-income countries.
This lack of consensus limits comparability between studies.
Existing severity scores were developed around rotavirus, and their reliability and validity in relation to non-rotavirus diarrhea is unknown.

What Is New
Severity scores built using maternally reported symptoms predicted hospitalization and other negative child health outcomes across geographically diverse communities.
Validated clinical severity criteria can be used to quantify estimates of severe diarrhea in the absence of outpatient confirmation.
The global health research community should adopt standardized methods of measuring diarrheal severity

The lack of validated and widely adopted definitions for severity is a methodological hindrance to community-based and outpatient studies of pediatric diarrhea in low- and middle-income countries. A recent review highlighted heterogeneity in measurement approaches; among 138 randomized clinical trials involving primary outcomes of acute diarrhea, 46 definitions were used, and in 32 trials using diarrheal severity instruments, 8 used the original or modified Vesikari score, whereas the remainder used other instruments. This review also noted that there are no published reports of reliability and validity for any diarrheal severity instrument.

The Vesikari score was designed for use in rotavirus vaccine trials, and although useful in that context, it may be less so in community-based studies due to multiple etiologies. This is because it includes clinical management in its scoring, making it impractical in contexts in which diarrhea referral and treatment varies, weighs vomiting relatively heavily compared with other symptoms, and does not include dysentery. The original Vesikari score assessed children at hospital presentation, but subsequent studies have calculated severity after episode resolution. Other scores have been proposed, but only 1 designed for nonetiologically specific diarrhea in HIV-negative children.

Conceptually, diarrheal severity relates to acute morbidity, represented by the presence of clinical signs and symptoms such as fever or vomiting; the risk of acute progression, including severe dehydration, and, in the worst case, mortality; and the risk of later morbidity (eg, nutritional status). Although these domains overlap, there may be differences in which should be targeted during the clinical assessment of severity in an outpatient context, versus during community surveillance where the majority of episodes may be mild-to-moderate. Although different scores may serve for different purposes, the agreement between them should nevertheless be characterized.

### A prospective case-control study of the role of astrovirus in acute diarrhea among hospitalized young children [^112Kv8Jv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

This study examines the importance of astroviruses as a cause of acute diarrhea in hospitalized children < 10 years old during a 5-year period. Stools were screened by electron microscopy and were tested for astrovirus, rotavirus, and enteric adenovirus by EIA. During the study, 14.6% of hospitalized children had diarrhea. Astroviruses were second only to rotaviruses as etiologic agents of both community-acquired and nosocomial diarrhea. Community-acquired astrovirus infection occurred in 6.8% of patients, and nosocomial disease occurred in 16.2%. Most cases occurred from March through June, and astrovirus type 1 was the most common. The symptoms of astrovirus-infected children were similar to those of children with rotavirus infection. However, astrovirus-infected children had a lower median age, less dehydration, and lower symptom severity scores and were less likely to have been admitted for gastroenteritis than were children with rotavirus. Astrovirus, for which only rehydration therapy is required, should be considered as another common diarrheal pathogen in children < 2 years old.

### Viral acute gastroenteritis in special populations [^117JxZMB]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is common and afflicts people of all ages. Nonviral causes of AGE are less common. Norovirus is a leading cause of sporadic cases and outbreaks of AGE across all ages. Universal rotavirus vaccination of infants has reduced frequency and severity of rotavirus AGE cases in children and indirectly reduced cases in older adults. Severe illness is more likely in persons at age extremes or with immunocompromising conditions. Viral causes of AGE can lead to protracted diarrheal illness in immunocompromised persons. Nucleic acid amplification tests are changing diagnostic testing algorithms.

### Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy [^117LJA7t]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis remains a common illness among infants and children throughout the world. Among children in the United States, acute diarrhea accounts for > 1.5 million outpatient visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and approximately 300 deaths/year. In developing countries, diarrhea is a common cause of mortality among children aged < 5 years, with an estimated 2 million deaths annually. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) includes rehydration and maintenance fluids with oral rehydration solutions (ORS), combined with continued age-appropriate nutrition. Although ORT has been instrumental in improving health outcomes among children in developing countries, its use has lagged behind in the United States. This report provides a review of the historical background and physiologic basis for using ORT and provides recommendations for assessing and managing children with acute diarrhea, including those who have become dehydrated. Recent developments in the science of gastroenteritis management have substantially altered case management. Physicians now recognize that zinc supplementation can reduce the incidence and severity of diarrheal disease, and an ORS of reduced osmolarity (i.e., proportionally reduced concentrations of sodium and glucose) has been developed for global use. The combination of oral rehydration and early nutritional support has proven effective throughout the world in treating acute diarrhea. In 1992, CDC prepared the first national guidelines for managing childhood diarrhea (CDC. The management of acute diarrhea in children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy. MMWR 1992;41[No. RR-16]), and this report updates those recommendations. This report reviews the historical background and scientific basis of ORT and provides a framework for assessing and treating infants and children who have acute diarrhea. The discussion focuses on common clinical scenarios and traditional practices, especially regarding continued feeding. Limitations of ORT, ongoing research in the areas of micronutrient supplements, and functional foods are reviewed as well. These updated recommendations were developed by specialists in managing gastroenteritis, in consultation with CDC and external consultants. Relevant literature was identified through an extensive MEDLINE search by using related terms. Articles were then reviewed for their relevance to pediatric practice, with emphasis on U.S. populations. Unpublished references were sought from the external consultants and other researchers. In the United States, adoption of these updated recommendations could substantially reduce medical costs and childhood hospitalizations and deaths caused by diarrhea.

### Traveler's diarrhea in the pediatric population: etiology and impact [^111ZLscJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Children who travel are at risk of developing the same, well-known illnesses that affect adult travelers. The etiology, treatment, and actual risk of these illnesses are not well defined in children. The limited amount of data available forces clinicians to extrapolate appropriate treatment for children. Recommendations for children have not been standardized. The role and judicious use of antimicrobials in the treatment of pediatric traveler's diarrhea have evolved during recent decades and will be reviewed here. The past 2 decades have seen an unprecedented, sustained growth in travel. The epidemiology related to travel medicine has evolved to describe travelers and their illnesses more specifically. The development of the field of travel medicine has led to greater understanding and improved, targeted treatment of travel-related illnesses. Most of the data available today describe traveler's diarrhea in adults. Children traveling to distant destinations from their home country have not been well studied, yet treatment parameters exist in practice and will be reviewed here.

### Acute diarrheal disease in children: epidemiology, prevention, and treatment [^112d1yoU]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The causes of acute diarrhea in children vary with the location, time of year, and population studied. There is increasing recognition of a widening array of enteric pathogens associated with diarrheal diseases. Adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement and maintenance are key to managing diarrheal illnesses. Thorough clinical and epidemiologic evaluation is needed to define the severity and type of illness, exposures, and whether the patient in is immunocompromised to direct the performance of selective diagnosis cultures, toxin testing, parasite studies, and the administration of antimicrobial therapy.

### The sanitation hygiene infant nutrition efficacy (SHINE) trial: rationale, design, and methods [^112cLNuE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Studies estimating the effect of diarrhea on linear growth have reached inconsistent conclusions. In a pooled analysis of 9 studies that together collected diarrhea and growth data on 1393 children, the odds of stunting at 24 months increased multiplicatively by 2.5% per episode of diarrhea, and 25% of all stunting among 24-month-old children was attributable to having 5 or more episodes of diarrhea in the first 2 years of life. In other studies, the observed effect of diarrhea on long-term linear growth was small or absent because children grew at higher-than-average "catch-up" growth rates between illness episodes. Most recently, an analysis of 7 longitudinal cohort studies of children aged < 2 years, conducted in 4 low-income countries, estimated that the average child's diarrhea burden (46 days with diarrhea between birth and 2 years) was associated with a 0.38-cm height deficit at 2 years of age. Because a change in LAZ of 1.0 at 2 years is equivalent to approximately 3 cm, their analysis suggests that the growth effect of reducing diarrhea during the first 2 years of life from the average burden currently experienced in low-income countries to zero is a statistically significant but clinically modest LAZ score of approximately 0.13, or about 7% (one-fifteenth) of the average height deficit of 2-year-old Asian and African children.

Like stunting, childhood anemia is a major public health problem in Africa and Asia and a primary cause of cognitive and behavioral developmental delay throughout childhood and adolescence. The 2010 Global Burden of Disease ranks iron deficiency anemia as the 15th leading cause of lost disability-adjusted life-years globally. Anemia becomes prevalent in the second half of infancy and peaks between 12 and 24 months of age, affecting well over half of all children in Africa and Asia. Iron deficiency causes about half of the anemia among children under 2. Accordingly, increasing iron intake by young children has been the focus of most research and public health programming, and, in randomized trials, iron supplements or iron-fortified foods reduce anemia in young children by about 37%–62%, leaving a substantial portion of child anemia unaddressed.

### Age-specific spectrum of etiological pathogens for viral diarrhea among children in twelve consecutive winter-spring seasons (2009–2021) in China [^116b35Ty]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, by performing a systematic, continuous, laboratory‐based surveillance of acute viral diarrhea on 5072 children in Chongqing, we disclosed an age‐specific infection pattern of five dominant enteric viruses among those aged 0–59 months, with the highest prevalence of viral infection occurring at 12–23 months. The finding is consistent with previous studies indicating high susceptibility to viral infection in early childhood, especially at the age younger than five years.

Consistent with previous findings in China, as well as other countries, e.g. in northeast Brazil before the introduction of rotavirus vaccination, rotavirus remained the top viral pathogen, and norovirus was next ranked. It's been well accepted that most children might develop three or more episodes of rotavirus infections by age of two years, and thereafter when host immunity has been established, a steadily decreasing infection occurs in the older childhood. By applying an age‐specific analysis, we determined norovirus had replaced rotavirus to become the top etiological cause of acute diarrhea in children aged 6–11 months, despite a slight excess over rotavirus. This might as well indicate an increased incidence of norovirus among this age group owing to the increased transmission in the household, such as immunocompromised elderly who are more likely to live in the same house as the children in a traditional Chinese family.

Clostridium difficile epidemiology and testing considerations — In children, asymptomatic colonization is common and complicates interpretation, with a "high frequency (up to 70%) of asymptomatic colonization among healthy newborns", and rates that "gradually fall to adult levels… by about 2 years of age", making results in "an individual child < 2 years of age" uncertain. In hospitals, "C. difficile is more prevalent in diarrheal stools obtained > 72 hours after admission", and, because asymptomatic carriage is recognized, "patients without diarrhea should not be tested or treated". C. difficile "should be considered in patients with diarrhea occurring in hospitals".

### Azithromycin for bacterial watery diarrhea: a reanalysis of the antiBiotics for children with severe diarrhea (ABCD) trial incorporating molecular diagnostics [^1114YHNr]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial pathogens cause substantial diarrhea morbidity and mortality among children living in endemic settings, yet antimicrobial treatment is only recommended for dysentery or suspected cholera.

Methods

AntiBiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea was a 7-country, placebo-controlled, double-blind efficacy trial of azithromycin in children 2–23 months of age with watery diarrhea accompanied by dehydration or malnutrition. We tested fecal samples for enteric pathogens utilizing quantitative polymerase chain reaction to identify likely and possible bacterial etiologies and employed pathogen-specific cutoffs based on genomic target quantity in previous case-control diarrhea etiology studies to identify likely and possible bacterial etiologies.

Results

Among 6692 children, the leading likely etiologies were rotavirus (21.1%), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli encoding heat-stable toxin (13.3%), Shigella (12.6%), and Cryptosporidium (9.6%). More than one-quarter (1894 [28.3%]) had a likely and 1153 (17.3%) a possible bacterial etiology. Day 3 diarrhea was less common in those randomized to azithromycin versus placebo among children with a likely bacterial etiology (risk difference [RD]likely, -11.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, -15.6 to -7.6]) and possible bacterial etiology (RDpossible, -8.7 [95% CI, -13.0 to -4.4]) but not in other children (RDunlikely, -0.3% [95% CI, -2.9% to 2.3%]). A similar association was observed for 90-day hospitalization or death (RDlikely, -3.1 [95% CI, -5.3 to -1.0]; RDpossible, -2.3 [95% CI, -4.5 to -.01]; RDunlikely, -0.6 [95% CI, -1.9 to .6]). The magnitude of risk differences was similar among specific likely bacterial etiologies, including Shigella.

Conclusions

Acute watery diarrhea confirmed or presumed to be of bacterial etiology may benefit from azithromycin treatment.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^111KYhPn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In developing countries, diarrhoea causes around 500,000 child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea is currently recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, mRCT, and reference lists up to 30 September 2016. We also contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral zinc supplementation with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. The primary outcomes were diarrhoea duration and severity. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses (using either a fixed-effect or random-effects model) and assessed heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Thirty-three trials that included 10,841 children met our inclusion criteria. Most included trials were conducted in Asian countries that were at high risk of zinc deficiency. Acute diarrhoeaThere is currently not enough evidence from well-conducted RCTs to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces death or number of children hospitalized (very low certainty evidence). In children older than six months of age, zinc supplementation may shorten the average duration of diarrhoea by around half a day (MD -11.46 hours, 95% CI -19.72 to -3.19; 2581 children, 9 trials, low certainty evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 3865 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence). In children with signs of malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around a day (MD -26.39 hours, 95% CI -36.54 to -16.23; 419 children, 5 trials, high certainty evidence). Conversely, in children younger than six months of age, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on the mean duration of diarrhoea (MD 5.23 hours, 95% CI -4.00 to 14.45; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence), or the number of children who still have diarrhoea on day seven (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54; 1074 children, 1 trial, moderate certainty evidence). None of the included trials reported serious adverse events. However, zinc supplementation increased the risk of vomiting in both age groups (children greater than six months of age: RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.86; 2605 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence; children less than six months of age: RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.24; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence). Persistent diarrhoeaIn children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the average duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (MD -15.84 hours, 95% CI -25.43 to -6.24; 529 children, 5 trials, moderate certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children less six months of age, in well-nourished children, and in settings where children are at low risk of zinc deficiency.

### Azithromycin for bacterial watery diarrhea: a reanalysis of the antiBiotics for children with severe diarrhea (ABCD) trial incorporating molecular diagnostics [^114rEsnM]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Likely etiologies (determined by pathogen-specific diarrhea-attribution cycle threshold cutoffs) among AntiBiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea (ABCD) study participants by site and age. Showing etiologies with 10% prevalence or more. Abbreviations: EPEC, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli; ST-ETEC, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli encoding heat-stable toxin.

More than one-quarter of children (1894 [28.3%]) had a likely bacterial cause of their diarrhea, and likely bacterial causes were balanced across the 2 arms (Supplementary Figure 5). The effect of azithromycin on the outcome of diarrhea on day 3 was modified by the presence of a bacterial etiology (interaction P < .001): Among children with a likely bacterial etiology, 11.8% in the azithromycin arm had diarrhea 3 days after randomization compared to 23.3% of children in the placebo group (risk difference [RD], −11.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, −15.6 to −7.6]; Table 2). Among children with a possible bacterial etiology, 7.1% in the azithromycin arm had 3-day diarrhea versus 15.8% of placebo-treated children (RD, 8.7% [95% CI, −13.0% to −4.4%]). There was no difference between randomization arms on day 3 diarrhea among the subset of children without a bacterial etiology (RD, −0.3% [95% CI, −2.9% to 2.3%]). During the 90 days of follow-up, azithromycin was associated with fewer deaths/hospitalizations among children with a likely (RD, −3.1% [95% CI, −5.3% to −1.0%]) and possible (RD, −2.3% [95% CI, −4.5% to −.01%]) bacterial cause of diarrhea, which was not observed in children with an unlikely bacterial etiology (RD, −0.6 [95% CI, −1.9 to.6]), but testing for effect modification was not statistically significant (interaction P = 0.10). Magnitudes of association were similar when considering rectal swab samples only (Supplementary Table 4) and considering death and hospitalization as separate outcomes (Supplementary Table 5). Azithromycin treatment was associated with a modest improvement in ΔLAZ among children with an unlikely bacterial etiology (difference in difference, 0.06 [95% CI,.02–.10]), but the effect was smaller and imprecise in the children with a likely or presumed bacterial etiology and the effect modification could have been due to chance (interaction P = 0.6).

### Probiotics for treating acute infectious diarrhoea [^111Uwqao]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Probiotics may offer a safe intervention in acute infectious diarrhoea to reduce the duration and severity of the illness.

Objectives

To assess the effects of probiotics in proven or presumed acute infectious diarrhoea.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's trials register (July 2010), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2010), EMBASE (1988 to July 2010), and reference lists from studies and reviews. We also contacted organizations and individuals working in the field, and pharmaceutical companies manufacturing probiotic agents.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing a specified probiotic agent with a placebo or no probiotic in people with acute diarrhoea that is proven or presumed to be caused by an infectious agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the trial and extracted data. Primary outcomes were the mean duration of diarrhoea, stool frequency on day 2 after intervention and ongoing diarrhoea on day 4. A random-effects model was used.

Main Results

Sixty-three studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 8014 participants. Of these, 56 trials recruited infants and young children. The trials varied in the definition used for acute diarrhoea and the end of the diarrhoeal illness, as well as in the risk of bias. The trials were undertaken in a wide range of different settings and also varied greatly in organisms tested, dosage, and participants' characteristics. No adverse events were attributed to the probiotic intervention. Probiotics reduced the duration of diarrhoea, although the size of the effect varied considerably between studies. The average of the effect was significant for mean duration of diarrhoea (mean difference 24.76 hours; 95% confidence interval 15.9 to 33.6 hours; n = 4555, trials = 35) diarrhoea lasting ≥ 4 days (risk ratio 0.41; 0.32 to 0.53; n = 2853, trials = 29) and stool frequency on day 2 (mean difference 0.80; 0.45 to 1.14; n = 2751, trials = 20). The differences in effect size between studies was not explained by study quality, probiotic strain, the number of different strains, the viability of the organisms, dosage of organisms, the causes of diarrhoea, or the severity of the diarrhoea, or whether the studies were done in developed or developing countries.

Authors' Conclusions

Used alongside rehydration therapy, probiotics appear to be safe and have clear beneficial effects in shortening the duration and reducing stool frequency in acute infectious diarrhoea. However, more research is needed to guide the use of particular probiotic regimens in specific patient groups.

Does the addition of azithromycin to the standard case management of acute watery diarrhea for children aged 2 to 23 months who are dehydrated or undernourished reduce mortality and improve linear growth?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial of 8266 children was unable to detect a survival benefit for children from the addition of azithromycin to the standard World Health Organization (WHO) case management of acute watery diarrhea in low-resource settings.

Meaning

In low-resource settings, adherence to current WHO case management protocols for watery diarrhea remains appropriate; antibiotic use is not warranted.

### Just another case of diarrhea and vomiting? [^112zMFj2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic intussusception is a treatable cause of failure to thrive. It is an uncommon condition often diagnosed late. The presenting features differ from acute intussusception. Chronic intussusception presents with a varying combination of abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss/failure to thrive, diarrhea, and blood per rectum. An abdominal mass may or may not be palpable. The classic triad of abdominal pain, vomiting, and blood per rectum is uncommon. The purpose of this report is to present a small series of 3 cases and review 19 previously reported cases of chronic intussusception. Considering the diagnosis of chronic intussusception in children who present with failure to thrive and recurrent nonspecific abdominal symptoms is emphasized.

### Improving antibiotic stewardship for diarrheal disease with probability-based electronic clinical decision support: a randomized crossover trial [^1113BzRW]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Inappropriate use of antibiotics for diarrheal illness can result in adverse effects and increase in antimicrobial resistance.

Objective

To determine whether the diarrheal etiology prediction (DEP) algorithm, which uses patient-specific and location-specific features to estimate the probability that diarrhea etiology is exclusively viral, impacts antibiotic prescriptions in patients with acute diarrhea.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized crossover study was conducted to evaluate the DEP incorporated into a smartphone-based electronic clinical decision-support (eCDS) tool. The DEP calculated the probability of viral etiology of diarrhea, based on dynamic patient-specific and location-specific features. Physicians were randomized in the first 4-week study period to the intervention arm (eCDS with the DEP) or control arm (eCDS without the DEP), followed by a 1-week washout period before a subsequent 4-week crossover period. The study was conducted at 3 sites in Bangladesh from November 17, 2021, to January 21, 2021, and at 4 sites in Mali from January 6, 2021, to March 5, 2021. Eligible physicians were those who treated children with diarrhea. Eligible patients were children between ages 2 and 59 months with acute diarrhea and household access to a cell phone for follow-up.

Interventions

Use of the eCDS with the DEP (intervention arm) vs use of the eCDS without the DEP (control arm).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of children prescribed an antibiotic.

Results

A total of 30 physician participants and 941 patient participants (57.1% male; median [IQR] age, 12 [8–18] months) were enrolled. There was no evidence of a difference in the proportion of children prescribed antibiotics by physicians using the DEP (risk difference [RD], -4.2%; 95% CI, -10.7% to 1.0%). In a post hoc analysis that accounted for the predicted probability of a viral-only etiology, there was a statistically significant difference in risk of antibiotic prescription between the DEP and control arms (RD, -0.056; 95% CI, -0.128 to -0.01). No known adverse effects of the DEP were detected at 10-day postdischarge.

Conclusions and Relevance

Use of a tool that provides an estimate of etiological likelihood did not result in a significant change in overall antibiotic prescriptions. Post hoc analysis suggests that a higher predicted probability of viral etiology was linked to reductions in antibiotic use.

### Azithromycin for bacterial watery diarrhea: a reanalysis of the antiBiotics for children with severe diarrhea (ABCD) trial incorporating molecular diagnostics [^116UAsrk]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this subgroup analysis of a multicountry, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of azithromycin in conjunction with WHO standard of care to treat acute watery diarrhea, azithromycin was associated with shorter diarrhea duration and fewer deaths/hospitalizations in the subset of children with a likely bacterial etiology, with some residual benefit observed in children with bacteria detected at quantities below the pathogen-specific etiologic cutoffs. More than one-quarter of all enrolled children had a bacterial etiology identified, a proportion nearly identical (32%) to that observed among acute watery diarrhea cases in the GEMS study. Antibiotic treatment efficacy studies of presumed or confirmed bacterial diarrhea have frequently used diarrhea presence after 2–6 days as a primary endpoint and here we show a benefit to azithromycin treatment of bacterial diarrhea in terms of the clinical outcome of diarrhea on day 3. Fewer than 9 children would be needed to treat to avert 1 case of day 3 diarrhea, and this effect was consistent across Shigella, ST-ETEC, tEPEC, and V cholerae, the most commonly identified bacterial etiologies.

While an effect of azithromycin on the secondary combined outcome of death or rehospitalization 90 days after diarrhea presentation was observed in the primary trial analysis, the absolute risk reduction was small (86 children would need to be treated to avert 1 death or hospitalization by day 90), a benefit likely diluted by enrollment of children with nonbacterial diarrhea. The present analysis supports this hypothesis in that the number needed to treat to prevent death or hospitalization by day 90 in children with likely bacterial diarrhea was > 33. This effect size is comparable or greater than the effect size used to support the routine use of amoxicillin to treat nonsevere pneumonia, based on the outcome of treatment failure that also included death and/or hospitalization, albeit as the prespecified primary endpoint and not limited to bacterial pneumonia. Clinical management guidelines in high-resource settings also indicate antibiotic treatment for some enteric bacteria, such as Shigella, and children with underlying malnutrition or other host vulnerabilities common in resource-limited settings may experience the greatest benefit of such treatment.

Pediatric diarrhea

Diarrheal diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for approximately 760,000 deaths per year in children under the age of 5. The causes of diarrhea are varied, including antibiotic-associated and infectious diarrhea, amongst others. S. boulardii has been evaluated as a treatment and preventative strategy for many types of diarrhea, with mostly positive outcomes. For example, a meta-analysis of five clinical trials reported that S. boulardii is effective in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults and children, and a separate meta-analysis also reported S. boulardii to be effective at reducing the duration of diarrhea in children with acute infectious gastroenteritis. A third meta-analysis including 22 studies further concluded that S. boulardii can significantly reduce the duration of childhood diarrhea, whether caused by bacteria, viruses, or protozoa. The mechanism whereby S. boulardii alleviates diarrhea is not yet clear, but animal models and in vitro work have shown S. boulardii to possess antimicrobial activities, inhibit bacterial toxins, promote barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, and elicit specific immune responses by the host. Whether early exposure to S. boulardii is beneficial for the long-term health outcomes of infants remains to be tested, but the beneficial effect of S. boulardii on pediatric diarrhea is clear.

### Aetiology and incidence of diarrhoea requiring hospitalisation in children under 5 years of age in 28 low-income and middle-income countries: findings from the global pediatric diarrhea surveillance network [^1118dWLP]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Results

From January 2017 to December 2018, 29 502 children under 5 years of age hospitalised with diarrhoea were enrolled from 33 surveillance sites in 28 countries (online supplemental table 1 and figure 1). Using GBD incidence and population estimates, these 28 countries included 51.4% (299 119/582 295) of all estimated diarrhoeal deaths and 49.9% (337 863 737/677 362 399) of the estimated global under 5 population. Most enrolled children were less than 2 years of age (22716, 77.0%)(table 1). Most cases were accompanied by vomiting and dehydration, and almost all patients received some form of rehydration therapy in the hospital. Of 20 471 cases for which dehydration was present and the severity was estimated, 6681 (32.6%) had severe dehydration. Of 26 728 (90.6%) cases that could be classified by both duration and presence of blood, 24 616 (92.1%) presented with acute watery diarrhoea, 1728 (6.5%) with acute bloody diarrhoea and 384 (1.4%) with watery or bloody persistent diarrhoea.

- **Definition**: Acute diarrhea is a clinical syndrome that is defined as the passage of ≥ 3 unformed stools per day for < 2 weeks.
- **Pathophysiology**: Frequent causes include viruses (norovirus, rotavirus), bacteria (Campylobacter, C. difficile, Salmonella, E. coli, Shigella), parasites (Giardia, Cryptosporidium), side-effects of medications (antibiotics, colchicine), abdominal surgeries, gastroenterologic diseases (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, appendicitis), and endocrine diseases (hyperthyroidism, carcinoid tumors).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of acute diarrhea is approximately 60,000 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Untreated, severe diarrhea may lead to dehydration, renal failure, and shock.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In developing countries, it is a common cause of death, especially in children.

### Factors associated with diarrhea and acute respiratory infection in children under two years of age in rural Bangladesh [^116b3fHg]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally pneumonia and diarrhea are major causes of child mortality, accounting for 15.5 and 8.9%, respectively, of deaths among children under 5 years of age in 2015. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for reducing under-five mortality was not met at the global level, and the new goal, part of the Sustainable Development Goals, is to reduce under-five mortality to 25 per 1000 live births or less by 2030. In Bangladesh, the under-five mortality rate was 46 per 1000 live births in 2014 (Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2014), and symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhea were present among 6 and 5%, respectively, of the under five children in the 2 weeks prior to the survey interview.

Incidence rates of respiratory infections and diarrhea are highest in the first 2 years of life and are related not only to child mortality but also to impaired physical growth and development of children. Although many studies have been conducted to identify the factors associated with ARI and diarrhea in lower-income countries, most have included all children under 5 years of age, and have not focused on the first 2 years of life. Factors associated with both ARI and diarrhea among children under five include lower household Xsocio-economic status, poor sanitation, larger family size, living in a rural area, younger mother, low maternal education, male child, younger child, higher birth order of the child, suboptimal breastfeeding practices, inadequate complementary feeding practices and poor anthropometric status of the child. Other factors associated with ARI include use of biomass fuel for cooking, low paternal education, and prematurity, and other factors associated with diarrhea include improper waste disposal, improper drainage system, unsafe drinking water, maternal depression, improper hand washing and lower birth order of the child.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^115XUxNq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In developing countries, diarrhoea causes around two million child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea is currently recommended by the World Health Organization and UNICEF.

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search Methods

In February 2012, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 11), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, mRCT, and reference lists. We also contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing oral zinc supplementation with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. Diarrhoea duration and severity were the primary outcomes. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses (using the fixed- or random-effects model) and assessed heterogeneity. The quality of evidence has been assessed using the GRADE methods

Main Results

Twenty-four trials, enrolling 9128 children, met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the data is from Asia, from countries at high risk of zinc deficiency, and may not be applicable elsewhere. Acute diarrhoea. There is currently not enough evidence from well conducted randomized controlled trials to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces death or hospitalization (very low quality evidence). In children aged greater than six months with acute diarrhoea, zinc supplementation may shorten the duration of diarrhoea by around 10 hours (MD -10.44 hours, 95% CI -21.13 to 0.25; 2175 children, six trials, low quality evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 3865 children, six trials, moderate quality evidence). In children with signs of moderate malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around 27 hours (MD -26.98 hours, 95% CI -14.62 to -39.34; 336 children, three trials, high quality evidence). Conversely, In children aged less than six months, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on mean diarrhoea duration (MD 5.23 hours, 95% CI -4.00 to 14.45; 1334 children, two trials, low quality evidence), and may even increase the proportion of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54; 1074 children, one trial, moderate quality evidence). No trials reported serious adverse events, but zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea causes vomiting in both age groups (RR 1.59, 95% 1.27 to 1.99; 5189 children, 10 trials, high quality evidence). Persistent diarrhoea. In children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (MD -15.84 hours, 95% CI -25.43 to -6.24; 529 children, five trials, moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of moderate malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children below six months of age.

### Etiology of acute diarrheal disease and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in children younger than 5 years old in Nepal [^113ZEzYG]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study population.

A surveillance study was conducted in children 3 months to 5 years of age with and without diarrhea in two study sites in Nepal — Bharatpur Hospital, Bharatpur, and Kanti Children's Hospital, Kathmandu — from December 2006 through February 2009.

Bharatpur Hospital is a government district hospital located in the Bharatpur municipality of the Chitwan District. The Bharatpur municipality has a tropical climate and is located at an altitude of 208 m. It is situated 146 km southwest of Kathmandu, and has 36,939 households and a population of 143,836 (2011 national census). Patients presenting to Bharatpur Hospital are mainly from the Bharatpur municipality and surrounding rural agricultural area, where the major poultry industry of Nepal is also situated.

Kanti Children's Hospital is located in the Kathmandu District. Kathmandu is the capital of Nepal, has a high urban population density, has a temperate climate, and stands 1,400 m above sea level. The 2011 national censusreported the Kathmandu District has 436,344 households and a population of 1,744,240. Kanti Children's Hospital is also a national children's hospital that receives patients from different parts of the country for tertiary care.

Children 3 months to 5 years seen or admitted to Bharatpur Hospital and Kanti Children's Hospital with acute diarrhea of no more than 72 hours' duration were enrolled as cases. Children from the same hospital seen or admitted for other causes with no history of diarrhea in the past 2 weeks were included as control subjects. Study enrollment was designed to include approximately 50 cases and 50 control subjects every 2 months for 2 years to ensure complete surveillance throughout the yearly cycles. One stool sample and brief demographic and clinical data, including antibiotic use during the past 2 weeks, were collected from each subject.

The study was approved by the Nepal Health Research Council (Kathmandu, Nepal) and the Human Subject Protection Branch, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (Silver Springs, MD). Signed informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of all subjects.

### Prevalence of and factors associated with acute diarrhea among children under five in rural areas in Ethiopia with and without implementation of community-led total sanitation and hygiene [^112oCrK1]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhea is defined as three or more loose or watery stools in a 24-h period. It may be caused by a number of bacterial, viral, protozoan, or parasitic organisms. In developed and developing countries, rotavirus and Escherichia coli are the most common etiological agents of diarrheal disease. Diarrheal diseases are more common in communities with poor sanitation, poor hygiene practices, a lack of safe water for drinking, improper child feeding practices, and poor housing conditions.

Globally, diarrhea kills more children than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined. Annually, 1.9 million children die from diarrheal diseases. About 78% of children who die from diarrhea live in Africa and Southeast Asia. The major contributors to diarrheal disease are poor sanitation, lack of hygiene, and lack of safe drinking water.

In Africa's sub-Saharan countries including Ethiopia, where hygiene and sanitation are poor, the incidence of diarrheal diseases is highest. Diarrhea is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age in Africa. African children experience, on average, five episodes of diarrhea every year, and an estimated 800,000 die from diarrhea and dehydration. About 80% of the rural population and 20% of the urban population of sub-Saharan Africa lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation.

In Ethiopia, childhood diarrheal disease is most common among 6- to 11-month-old children; the percentage of children under five years old who had diarrhea in a two week period decreased from 24% in 2000 to 18% in 2005, 13% in 2011, and 12% in 2016. Acute diarrhea is a common problem in Menz Gera Midir District, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. In its 2018/19 annual performance report, the district health office listed diarrhea as the leading cause of under-five morbidity. Out of 12,631 children under five, 2,023 (16.02%) sought treatment for diarrhea at a health institution.

### A core outcome set for clinical trials in acute diarrhoea [^111UdA5c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Core outcome sets are the baseline for what should be measured in clinical research and, thus, should serve as a guide for what should be collected and reported. The Consensus Group on Outcome Measures Made in Pediatric Enteral Nutrition Clinical Trials, established in 2012, agreed that consensus on a core set of outcomes with agreed-upon definitions that should be measured and reported in clinical trials was needed. To achieve this goal, six working groups (WGs) were setup, including WG on acute diarrhoea, whose main goal was to develop a core outcome set for trials in acute diarrhoea.

Methods

The first step identified how published outcomes related to acute diarrhoea were reported. The second focused on the methodology for determining which outcomes to measure in clinical trials. The third employed a two-phase questionnaire study using the Delphi technique to define clinically important outcomes to clinicians and parents.

Results

For therapeutic studies, the five most important outcome measures were diarrhoea duration, degree of dehydration, need for hospitalisation (or duration of hospitalisation for inpatients), the proportion of patients recovered by 48h and adverse effects. The prophylactic core outcome set included prevention of diarrhoea, prevention of dehydration, prevention of hospitalisation and adverse effects.

Conclusions

The outcome sets for therapy and prevention can be recommended for use in future trials of patients with gastroenteritis. Their envisioned goal is to decrease study heterogeneity and to ease the comparability of studies. WG's next step is to determine how to measure the outcomes included in the core set.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^113ToMpN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile testing indications and repeat testing — testing should only be performed on patients with diarrhea, defined as ≥ 3 unformed stools within 24 hours, and diarrheal stool specimens are required for diagnosis. Formed stools should be rejected except that formed stool from patients with ileus or potential toxic megacolon, as noted by the physician, should be tested. Repeat testing as a test of cure is not appropriate, and repeat testing of NAAT-negative patients should not be performed for at least 6 days. Pediatric guidance states testing should only be performed in children older than 2 years of age; toxigenic C. difficile colonizes nearly 50% of infants in the first year of life with asymptomatic rates approaching those of healthy adults around 2 years of age. Children < 1 year of age should not be tested, and for children 1–2 years of age, other causes should be pursued first with C. difficile testing performed only if there is no alternative cause and symptoms are severe or the presentation is consistent with C. difficile infection.

### Epidemiologic features of acute pediatric diarrhea in managua, Nicaragua, from 2011 to 2019 [^115JutVG]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We analyzed the incidence, risk factors, temporal trends, and seasonal patterns of acute diarrhea among 6,548 children in a longitudinal cohort study in Nicaragua over 9 years. We found a high frequency of diarrhea among all age groups, averaging 133.4 episodes per 1,000 person-years in our crude model. The highest incidence rates were experienced by children 2 to 5 years of age, with decreasing incidence among older children.

Our results are consistent with those of multiple prior studies showing a reduction in the incidence of diarrhea with increasing age. In 2012, one research group estimated that, on average, Latin American children younger than 5 years old experienced four episodes of diarrhea per year from 1990 to 2010 (4,000 cases per 1,000 person-years), which is ∼14 times greater than the overall rate we observed among 2- to 5-year-old PDCS participants (247.4 cases per 1,000 person-years in crude model incidence). This difference could be explained by our urban study population, by the age distribution in our cohort, or because we included only episodes of medically attended acute diarrhea. However, the authors of that review mentioned that their 2010 estimates were predominantly based on older data because of a lack of more recent cohort studies. Studies such as ours provide current estimates of the incidence of diarrhea in Central America. Becker-Dreps et al.found similar estimates to ours for the incidence of diarrhea in Léon, Nicaragua's second largest city. During a 3-year period (2007–2009), they found an incidence rate of diarrhea between 74 and 164 per 1,000 children 1 to 5 years of age. Our study and that of Becker-Dreps et al.found high incidence rates of pediatric diarrhea, and both studies found a lower diarrhea incidence of diarrhea in Nicaragua than that experienced across Latin America in general.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^111ndPHx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — prevention and management notes that avoiding dehydration by ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake for replacement and maintenance is the mainstay of diarrheal illness management. People with diarrhea should refrain from recreational water activities, food preparation or service, and sexual activities while symptomatic. Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents and risk of worsening illness (such as diarrhea associated with C. difficile) can result from antimicrobial and antimotility drug use and highlight the need for appropriate use of these interventions. The burden of acute gastroenteritis has been reduced since implementation of 2 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–licensed rotavirus vaccines, recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2006 and 2008, and clinically significant disease and hospitalization and office visits have been decreased in infants who have received a rotavirus vaccine as well as in adults through community protection.

### Effect of 3 days of oral azithromycin on young children with acute diarrhea in low-resource settings: a randomized clinical trial [^112AGcdC]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Based on previous data from GEMS, we anticipated 2.7% mortality by day 180 in the control group. At 1:1 allocation, 5750 children per group would provide 90% power at 95% confidence of detecting a 35% or more reduction in mortality in the azithromycin group, allowing for 10% loss to follow-up before completion and 1 interim analysis. This size provided 80% power and 95% confidence to detect a 0.04 or more absolute difference in the mean change in the length-for-age z score between study groups at day 90, assuming an SD of 0.7. All P values were from 2-sided tests and results were deemed statistically significant at P < .05.

Analytical plans were defined a priori and have been published. Primary analysis included all randomized participants by intention to treat. To obtain a relative risk for death up to day 180, a log-binomial regression (including country as a covariate to account for randomization scheme) was performed. Censored individuals who withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up were considered to be living. For the coprimary outcome, we used a linear regression model adjusted for country and baseline length-for-age z score to compare participants surviving to day 90 in the 2 groups. We also conducted prespecified subgroup analyses for the primary outcomes by site, age, sex, anthropometry, and socioeconomic status. Outcomes were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. For comparisons of antimicrobial resistance between groups, a noninferiority margin of 10% (absolute difference) was defined and tested by the continuity-corrected χ² test.

### Lactose avoidance for young children with acute diarrhoea [^1153au9y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Young children with acute diarrhoea, typically due to infectious gastroenteritis, may temporarily stop producing lactase, the intestinal enzyme that digests lactose. This means they may not digest lactose, the main sugar in milk, and this may worsen or prolong the diarrhoeal illness. However, there is uncertainty whether avoiding lactose-containing milk or milk products helps young children recover from acute diarrhoea more quickly.

Objectives

To assess if avoiding or reducing intake of lactose-containing milk or milk products shortens the duration and severity of illness in young children with acute diarrhoea. We also sought other indicators of morbidity and overall mortality.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (14 May 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2013), MEDLINE (1996 to 14 May 2013), EMBASE (1974 to 14 May 2013), and LILACS (1982 to 14 May 2013), and the reference lists of potentially relevant trials, key conference proceedings, and wrote to individuals and organizations in the field.

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of avoiding or reducing exposure to lactose in young children under five years with acute diarrhoea.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, and two review authors independently evaluated trial quality and data extraction. Continuous outcomes were compared using mean difference (MD), and dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR). We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 33 trials enrolling 2973 children with acute diarrhoea. Twenty-nine trials were exclusively conducted on inpatients, all from high- or middle-income countries. Fifteen trials included children aged below 12 months, and 22 excluded children who were being breast-fed. Compared to lactose-containing milk, milk products, or foodstuffs, lactose-free products may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by an average of about 18 hours (MD -17.77, 95% CI -25.32 to -10.21, 16 trials, 1467 participants, low quality evidence). Lactose-free products probably also reduce treatment failure (defined variously as continued or worsening diarrhoea or vomiting, the need for additional rehydration therapy, or continuing weight loss) by around a half (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.68, 18 trials, 1470 participants, moderate quality evidence). Diluted lactose-containing milk has not been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhoea compared to undiluted milk or milk products (five trials, 417 participants, low quality evidence), but may reduce the risk of treatment failure (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94, nine trials, 687 participants, low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In young children with acute diarrhoea who are not predominantly breast-fed, change to a lactose-free diet may result in earlier resolution of acute diarrhoea and reduce treatment failure. Diluting lactose-containing formulas may also have some benefits but further trials are required to have confidence in this finding. There are no trials from low-income countries, where mortality for diarrhoea is high, and malnutrition is more common.

### Effect of 3 days of oral azithromycin on young children with acute diarrhea in low-resource settings: a randomized clinical trial [^111muNpK]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines do not recommend routine antibiotic use for children with acute watery diarrhea. However, recent studies suggest that a significant proportion of such episodes have a bacterial cause and are associated with mortality and growth impairment, especially among children at high risk of diarrhea-associated mortality. Expanding antibiotic use among dehydrated or undernourished children may reduce diarrhea-associated mortality and improve growth.

Objective

To determine whether the addition of azithromycin to standard case management of acute nonbloody watery diarrhea for children aged 2 to 23 months who are dehydrated or undernourished could reduce mortality and improve linear growth.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Antibiotics for Children with Diarrhea (ABCD) trial was a multicountry, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial among 8266 high-risk children aged 2 to 23 months presenting with acute nonbloody diarrhea. Participants were recruited between July 1, 2017, and July 10, 2019, from 36 outpatient hospital departments or community health centers in a mixture of urban and rural settings in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Pakistan, and Tanzania. Each participant was followed up for 180 days. Primary analysis included all randomized participants by intention to treat.

Interventions

Enrolled children were randomly assigned to receive either oral azithromycin, 10 mg/kg, or placebo once daily for 3 days in addition to standard WHO case management protocols for the management of acute watery diarrhea.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality up to 180 days after enrollment and linear growth faltering 90 days after enrollment.

Results

A total of 8266 children (4463 boys [54.0%]; mean [SD] age, 11.6 [5.3] months) were randomized. A total of 20 of 4133 children in the azithromycin group (0.5%) and 28 of 4135 children in the placebo group (0.7%) died (relative risk, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.40–1.27). The mean (SD) change in length-for-age z scores 90 days after enrollment was -0.16 (0.59) in the azithromycin group and -0.19 (0.60) in the placebo group (risk difference, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01–0.06). Overall mortality was much lower than anticipated, and the trial was stopped for futility at the prespecified interim analysis.

Conclusions and Relevance

The study did not detect a survival benefit for children from the addition of azithromycin to standard WHO case management of acute watery diarrhea in low-resource settings. There was a small reduction in linear growth faltering in the azithromycin group, although the magnitude of this effect was not likely to be clinically significant. In low-resource settings, expansion of antibiotic use is not warranted. Adherence to current WHO case management protocols for watery diarrhea remains appropriate and should be encouraged.

### Defining pediatric diarrhea in low-resource settings [^114QZK5T]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

Differences in definitions of acute pediatric diarrhea result in variable estimates of morbidity and mortality, treatment coverage, and associations with risk factors and outcomes. We reviewed published literature and guidelines focused on acute pediatric diarrhea in low- and middle-income countries. Clinical guidelines most commonly defined diarrhea in terms of quantity of loose or watery stool with consideration of normal stool patterns, whereas research studies often relied exclusively on a quantitative definition. The most commonly used quantitative definition, ≥ 3 loose or watery stools in a 24-hour period, has been compared to gold standards of caregiver perception and visual inspection of stool, with variable agreement. Age, breast-feeding status, and setting (facility vs household-based) influence the performance of quantitative diarrhea definitions in children. Universal adoption of a set of valid gold standard definitions specifically aligned with various programmatic and research goals will lead to more accurate coverage estimates and better-informed resource prioritization.

### What place for ▾ racecadotril? [^113dYtBc]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Worldwide, there are about two billion cases of diarrhoeal disease every year and it is the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age, killing 1.5 million children annually.(1) The most severe threat posed by diarrhoea is dehydration. In the UK, the incidence of diarrhoea is about one episode per person per year,(2) and approximately 10% of children younger than 5 years old present to healthcare services with gastroenteritis each year.(3) ▾Racecadotril (Hidrasec) is the first in a new class of antidiarrhoeal drug ('enkephalinase inhibitor') that has an antisecretory mechanism and is licensed in adults, children and infants (over 3 months of age) for symptomatic treatment of acute diarrhoea or as complementary treatment when causal treatment is possible.(4–6) Here we review the evidence for racecadotril and its place in the management of acute diarrhoea.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute or persistent watery diarrhea: In most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), though an exception may be made in people who are immunocompromised or young infants who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate).
