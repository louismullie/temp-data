## Question

Reasons Semaglutide doesn't work to help losing weight

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why semaglutide might not lead to weight loss in some patients and what factors could explain that. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "not working" means in trials versus real-world settings. Then, I should verify the expected efficacy benchmarks from randomized trials. Next, I will examine patient-level factors that blunt response, followed by treatment-related factors like dose, titration, and adherence. After that, I need to consider disease-specific modifiers such as type 2 diabetes and post-bariatric physiology. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical framework for evaluation and next steps, including when to escalate or switch therapy.

> Let me first confirm what "not working" should mean. In trials, semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly typically produces a 12–15% placebo-subtracted weight loss at 68 weeks, with about 86% achieving ≥ 5%, 69% achieving ≥ 10%, and 50% achieving ≥ 15% weight loss, so a suboptimal response is generally less than 5% loss at 3–6 months or failure to reach individualized goals thereafter [^114YQ4nW] [^112TmKyn] [^1154aeeq]. In real-world cohorts, average losses are smaller, often around 8–11% at 6–12 months, and only about 40–60% of patients maintain persistent coverage at 1 year, so "not working" must be interpreted in the context of lower exposure and adherence outside trials [^113Cg9g1] [^113GwpK6].

> Wait, let me verify the biological ceiling and variability. Even in rigorously controlled trials, roughly 14% of non-diabetic participants lose less than 5% of baseline weight, and in type 2 diabetes, up to 27% have a sub-5% response, underscoring interindividual variability and a hard biological tail of poor response despite optimal conditions [^116Qg8TH]. Hold on, I should also note that STEP 5 documented a small subset with weight gain during treatment, reinforcing that pharmacologic response is heterogeneous even on therapy [^111QAHRT].

> I will now examine patient-level factors that blunt response. Type 2 diabetes consistently attenuates weight loss by about 30–50% versus non-diabetic cohorts, likely due to concomitant medications that promote weight gain, insulin resistance, and possibly reduced caloric spillover into glycosuria as glycemic control improves, so expectations should be adjusted in diabetes [^114Yo7Sy] [^116a38in]. Let me consider baseline BMI as well; lower BMI categories tend to have smaller percentage weight loss, and sex differences show women often lose a greater percentage than men, which can influence apparent "nonresponse" in some subgroups [^115XBWup] [^111hTJmk]. But wait, what if hormonal therapy is involved? Observational data in postmenopausal women suggest hormone therapy users may lose more weight on semaglutide, hinting at endocrine modifiers of response, though confounding is possible [^115Bptrw].

> Next, I should review treatment-related factors that impair outcomes. Inadequate dose or incomplete titration is common in practice; many patients never reach 1.7–2.4 mg due to side effects, access issues, or clinician conservatism, and real-world cohorts show that only about 44% reach maximal doses by 6 months, which clearly caps efficacy [^111KHTya] [^113Cg9g1]. Hold on, I should verify the impact of adherence; modeling suggests semaglutide is relatively "forgiving" of missed doses, but persistent nonadherence and early discontinuation still blunt observed weight loss, and real-world discontinuation rates of 20–50% within a year are a major driver of poorer average outcomes [^113sS7pX] [^113GwpK6]. I need to ensure I consider duration too; weight loss generally plateaus by 12–18 months, so judging "failure" too early can be misleading [^117DDcMb].

> Let me consider disease-specific contexts. Post–bariatric surgery patients can respond, but many cannot tolerate standard titration and stall at lower doses, limiting mean weight loss to roughly 7–9% in some series, which may be misread as nonresponse if expectations are set by non-surgical cohorts [^115rRg4A] [^1152iAr4]. I should double-check the implication: dose intolerance and systems barriers, rather than pharmacologic ineffectiveness, often explain attenuated outcomes in this group [^115rRg4A].

> I need to check for confounders that masquerade as treatment failure. Concurrent weight-promoting medications such as insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and some antidepressants can offset semaglutide's effect, and inadequate lifestyle support or misaligned expectations can also blunt apparent efficacy, so a careful medication reconciliation and goal-setting conversation is essential before labeling the drug as ineffective [^116a38in]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that lifestyle intensity directly drives greater loss with semaglutide; STEP 3 showed larger mean loss with intensive behavioral therapy, but other STEP trials achieved similar magnitudes with standard counseling, so the incremental benefit of very intensive programs is inconsistent and should not be overinterpreted [^112BFVzL] [^113SCwQs].

> Next, I should review how to evaluate a patient who "isn't losing weight". I should confirm the indication and dose, verify that escalation to at least 1.7–2.4 mg was attempted unless limited by intolerance, and document adherence and gaps in coverage; if early weight loss is under 5% by 3 months, guidelines support reassessment of adherence, dose, and competing factors before declaring failure [^1154aeeq] [^116KxXFF]. Hold on, I should verify the role of anti-semaglutide antibodies; although uncommon, their presence has been described and could theoretically reduce efficacy, so persistent nonresponse despite adequate dose and adherence warrants considering this possibility in the right clinical context [^114XcEhd].

> I will now examine management options when response is suboptimal. If dose remains below 2.4 mg, a cautious attempt to escalate can be reasonable if tolerated, recognizing diminishing returns and higher gastrointestinal adverse events at higher doses; if already at 2.4 mg with good adherence and still under 5% loss at 3–6 months, switching to an alternative agent such as tirzepatide or considering combination strategies like cagrilintide–semaglutide may be appropriate, as these approaches have shown larger mean weight losses in trials [^114ErakA] [^1134QoPH]. Let me reconsider the temptation to stop outright; abrupt discontinuation typically leads to regain of one-half to two-thirds of lost weight within a year, so any change should be planned with a maintenance strategy and close follow-up [^112TCecx] [^1154aeeq].

> Finally, I should synthesize the core reasons semaglutide "doesn't work". Biological nonresponse occurs in a minority and is more common with type 2 diabetes; treatment-related failures dominate in practice and include underdosing, slow or incomplete titration, nonadherence, early discontinuation, and inadequate duration; contextual factors such as weight-promoting co-therapies, lower baseline BMI, sex, and post-bariatric physiology further modulate observed loss; and finally, misaligned expectations and lack of persistent coverage often convert a pharmacologically active therapy into an apparently ineffective one in the real world [^116Qg8TH] [^113Cg9g1] [^113GwpK6] [^115XBWup] [^115rRg4A] [^112TCecx]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; when response is disappointing, a structured reassessment of dose, adherence, duration, comorbidities, and coverage usually reveals a modifiable barrier, and only a small fraction represent true pharmacologic nonresponse requiring agent switch or escalation [^113Cg9g1] [^116Qg8TH].

---

Semaglutide may fail to produce clinically meaningful weight loss due to **inadequate adherence** (missed doses, early discontinuation) [^113GwpK6], **insufficient dose titration** (not reaching 2.4 mg) [^111KHTya], or **poor lifestyle adherence** (excess calories, inactivity) [^114YQ4nW]. Other causes include **compensatory behaviors** (eating through nausea, high-calorie foods) [^notfound], **genetic resistance** (GLP-1 pathway variants), **concomitant medications** (insulin, sulfonylureas, SSRIs) [^116a38in], and **undiagnosed medical conditions** (hypothyroidism, Cushing's, PCOS). Less commonly, **anti-semaglutide antibodies** [^notfound] or **gastrointestinal disorders** (gastroparesis, IBD) limit efficacy. Addressing these factors — adherence, dose optimization, lifestyle, and comedications — typically restores weight loss to expected ranges [^113GwpK6].

---

## Patient-related factors

### Adherence and persistence

- **Missed doses**: Inconsistent use or early discontinuation reduces efficacy [^113GwpK6].
- **Early discontinuation**: Stopping within 3–6 months limits weight loss [^115WLZCu].
- **Compensatory behaviors**: Eating through nausea or choosing high-calorie foods can offset appetite suppression [^notfound].

---

### Lifestyle factors

Poor dietary adherence and physical inactivity can blunt weight loss despite pharmacotherapy [^notfound].

---

### Genetic and physiological factors

Genetic variants in the GLP-1 pathway may reduce response, and **intrinsic insulin resistance** or metabolic adaptation can limit weight loss.

---

## Medication-related factors

### Dose and titration

- **Insufficient dose**: Not reaching 2.4 mg limits efficacy [^111KHTya].
- **Improper titration**: Rapid escalation increases GI side effects and discontinuation [^116bmyfd].
- **Low adherence**: Missing doses reduces steady-state exposure and efficacy [^113sS7pX].

---

### Formulation and administration

Injection technique errors and **oral absorption issues** (with oral semaglutide) can reduce bioavailability and efficacy.

---

## Concomitant medications and medical conditions

### Medications that interfere with weight loss

- **Insulin and sulfonylureas**: Promote weight gain and hypoglycemia [^116a38in].
- **SSRIs and antipsychotics**: Often cause weight gain.
- **Corticosteroids**: Increase appetite and weight.

---

### Medical conditions

Hypothyroidism slows metabolism and reduces weight loss, and **Cushing's syndrome** promotes weight gain. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance and weight gain.

---

## Gastrointestinal and metabolic factors

### Gastrointestinal disorders

Gastroparesis delays gastric emptying and impairs drug absorption, and **inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)** can reduce absorption and tolerability.

---

### Metabolic adaptation

Metabolic adaptation can reduce energy expenditure and limit weight loss.

---

## Rare or idiosyncratic factors

Rarely, **anti-semaglutide antibodies** may neutralize activity [^notfound], and **severe GI side effects** (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) can lead to discontinuation [^114YQ4nW].

---

## Clinical strategies to address inadequate weight loss

- **Adherence assessment**: Identify and address barriers to adherence [^113GwpK6].
- **Dose optimization**: Titrate to 2.4 mg if tolerated [^112Zwtm3].
- **Lifestyle intervention**: Reinforce diet and physical activity [^112BFVzL].
- **Medication review**: Adjust or switch interacting drugs [^113yiXDX].
- **Medical evaluation**: Screen for thyroid, adrenal, or reproductive disorders.
- **Alternative therapies**: Consider switching to tirzepatide or combination therapy [^1134QoPH].

---

Semaglutide may fail to produce weight loss due to **adherence, dose, lifestyle, comedications, or medical conditions**; identifying and correcting these factors usually restores efficacy [^113GwpK6].

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^113bU4Z9]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, or 0.4 mg; initiated at 0.05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3.0 mg; initiated at 0.6 mg per day and escalated by 0.6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111.5 kg, and BMI 39.3 kg/m 2. Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2.3% for the placebo group versus -6.0% (0.05 mg), -8.6% (0.1 mg), -11.6% (0.2 mg), -11.2% (0.3 mg), and -13.8% (0.4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0.0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0.0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0.2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13.8% to -11.2% vs -7.8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0.1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0.0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

### Weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment for patients with overweight or obesity [^113c456V]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study suggest that semaglutide is clinically effective for weight loss at 3 and 6 months for people with overweight or obesity. Although our study lacked the stringent and closely controlled nature of RCTs, we report similar weight loss results within the same time period as in RCTs. Studies with greater sample sizes and longer periods of follow-up are further needed to support the effectiveness of semaglutide.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide for weight loss in patients without diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111hWRbR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated clinically important weight loss effects in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, its effects on sustained weight loss in patients without diabetes remains unclear. Our objective was to examine the long-term efficacy and safety of semaglutide use for weight loss in patients with overweight/obesity and without diabetes. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials that randomized participants with overweight/obesity and without diabetes to once-weekly 2.4 mg subcutaneous semaglutide versus placebo, with a follow-up of at least 68 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in relative body weight from baseline to the longest follow-up. Random-effects models with inverse variance weighting were used to estimate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 4 randomized controlled trials (n = 3,087) were included. Of the 3 trials that provided body mass index by category (n = 2,783), 94.0% of the participants had a baseline body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2. Compared with placebo, the use of semaglutide was associated with substantial decreases in long-term relative (WMD -12.1%, 95% CI -13.5 to -10.7) and absolute body weight (WMD -12.3 kg, 95% CI -13.6 to -11.0). At the longest follow-up, 33.4% of participants randomized to semaglutide achieved ≥ 20% weight loss compared with 2.2% with placebo (RR 15.08, 95% CI 9.31 to 24.43). The risk of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher in participants who took semaglutide than placebo (RR 1:47, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.68); however, the majority of these events were transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and did not require treatment discontinuation. In conclusion, semaglutide is efficacious for sustained weight loss in patients with overweight/obesity and without diabetes.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of obesity [^1128h29W]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for chronic weight management. This paper reviews data on the mechanism of action, weight-loss and cardiometabolic efficacy, and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg/week for obesity. Semaglutide has demonstrated the largest weight loss of any obesity medication to date with reductions of approximately 15% of initial weight at 68 weeks, accompanied by improvements in cardiovascular risks factors and physical functioning. The approval of this medication provides patients with greater options for weight management.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^114YQ4nW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a global health challenge with few pharmacologic options. Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed.

Methods

In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (≥ 27 in persons with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions.

Results

The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -13.4 to -11.5; P < 0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P < 0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]).

Conclusions

In participants with overweight or obesity, 2.4 mg of semaglutide once weekly plus lifestyle intervention was associated with sustained, clinically relevant reduction in body weight. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; STEP 1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03548935).

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^116JEHaY]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outside randomized clinical trial settings, data on weight loss with semaglutide or liraglutide for obesity are generally limited to 6 months of follow-up, based on brand names approved by the FDA for T2D only, or cohorts that exclude patients who did not persist with the treatment. Furthermore, emerging data suggest that persistent coverage with GLP-1 RAs (ie, a cumulative gap of less than 90 days), is difficult to achieve, but little is known about how persistence affects weight loss. Such understanding could inform the need and scope of future research, as well as clinical and policy interventions aimed at addressing the barriers to the use of these medications. We examined weight outcomes at 1 year in patients with obesity who received injectable forms of liraglutide or semaglutide and compared outcomes by GLP-1 RA agent, indication, dosage, and persistent coverage with the medication.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneous (SQ) weekly — weight-loss efficacy from randomized trials: Across "8 RCTs (2658 participants treated with semaglutide group vs 1694 participants in the placebo group)" with "a follow-up period ranging from 52 to 72 weeks", semaglutide produced greater total body weight loss (%TBWL), with "MD %TBWL was 10.76% (95% CI, 8.73%–12.80%)". Absolute weight change was larger with semaglutide as "weight loss ranging from 9.7 to 16.8 kg in the semaglutide group vs 1.5 to 6.2 kg in the placebo group (MD, 10.81 kg; 95% CI, 8.19–13.43 kg)". Categorical thresholds favored semaglutide: "82.3% vs 30.6% for ≥ 5% TBWL (RR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.21–3.40), 64.9% vs 12.3% for ≥ 10% TBWL (RR, 5.25; 95% CI, 3.61–7.64), and 46.1% vs 5.4% for ≥ 15% TBWL (RR, 7.82; 95% CI, 5.19–11.76)".

### High-dose once-weekly semaglutide: a new option for obesity management [^116HD88u]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide for chronic weight management.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched (inception to September 8, 2021) using keywords "semaglutide" and "obesity", "weight", "high dose", "high-dose", or "2.4".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with published results were included. Publications studying the oral or < 2.4 mg formulation of semaglutide were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated efficacy of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide compared with placebo for weight loss. Study populations included patients with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4) or patients with diabetes and with overweight or obesity (STEP 2). Lifestyle interventions for diet and exercise were included for all participants. Weight loss from baseline was significant for all studies, and secondary outcomes demonstrated cardiometabolic improvements including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, but the medication was otherwise well tolerated.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

High-dose semaglutide offers significant weight-lowering potential and favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and glycemic indices. Clinicians and patients should consider the route and frequency of administration, adverse effect profile, and cost when choosing an antiobesity medication. The importance of concomitant lifestyle interventions should be emphasized.

Conclusions

High-dose once-weekly semaglutide can significantly reduce weight, and although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, it is generally well tolerated.

### Weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment for patients with overweight or obesity [^115fQHyA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

No retrospective cohort study has assessed the effectiveness of semaglutide at doses used in randomized clinical trials to treat obesity (ie, 1.7 and 2.4 mg).

Objective

To study weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment at doses used in randomized clinical trials for patients with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study, conducted at a referral center for weight management, retrospectively collected data on the use of semaglutide for adults with overweight or obesity between January 1, 2021, and March 15, 2022, with a follow-up of up to 6 months. A total of 408 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or more were prescribed weekly semaglutide subcutaneous injections for 3 months or more. Patients with a history of bariatric procedures, taking other antiobesity medications, and with an active malignant neoplasm were excluded.

Exposures

Weekly 1.7-mg or 2.4-mg semaglutide subcutaneous injections for 3 to 6 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the percentage of weight loss. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients achieving weight loss of 5% or more, 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more after 3 and 6 months and the percentage of weight loss for patients with or without type 2 diabetes after 3 and 6 months.

Results

The study included 175 patients (132 women [75.4%]; mean [SD] age, 49.3 [12.5] years; mean [SD] BMI, 41.3 [9.1]) in the analysis at 3 months and 102 patients at 6 months. The mean (SD) weight loss after 3 months was 6.7 (4.4) kg, equivalent to a mean (SD) weight loss of 5.9% (3.7%) (P < .001), and the mean (SD) weight loss after 6 months was 12.3 (6.6) kg, equivalent to a mean (SD) weight loss of 10.9% (5.8%) (P < .001 from baseline). Of the 102 patients who were followed up at 6 months, 89 (87.3%) achieved weight loss of 5% or more, 56 (54.9%) achieved weight loss of 10% or more, 24 (23.5%) achieved weight loss of 15% or more, and 8 (7.8%) achieved weight loss of 20% or more. Patients with type 2 diabetes had a lower mean (SD) percentage weight loss at 3 and 6 months compared with those without type 2 diabetes: 3.9% (3.1%) vs 6.3% (3.7%) at 3 months (P = 0.001) and 7.2% (6.3%) vs 11.8% (5.3%) at 6 months (P = 0.005).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study suggest that weekly 1.7-mg and 2.4-mg doses of semaglutide were associated with weight loss similar to that seen in randomized clinical trials. Studies with longer periods of follow-up are needed to evaluate prolonged weight loss outcomes.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^111QAHRT]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In STEP 5, once-weekly treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg as an adjunct to behavioral intervention in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity led to a substantial initial reduction in weight, which plateaued after approximately week 60 and was maintained for the remainder of the study. At week 104, participants in the semaglutide group had achieved a mean weight loss of 15.2% from baseline — a difference of 12.6 percentage points versus placebo plus behavioral intervention. This weight loss is comparable to the mean reduction of 14.9% (placebo-corrected weight loss of 12.4 percentage points) seen at week 68 in the STEP 1 trial of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention). Thus, our findings indicate that the substantial weight losses reported during 68 weeks' treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg in prior STEP trials, can be maintained with continued semaglutide treatment up to at least 104 weeks. The mean weight loss of ~15% achieved with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 104 in STEP 5 exceeds weight loss reported at similar time points in trials with other pharmacotherapies for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity –.

Weight loss of ≥ 5%, a threshold widely used to indicate a clinically meaningful response to therapy, was achieved by > 75% of participants in the semaglutide group at week 104. Moreover, 61.8% of participants on semaglutide lost ≥ 10% of baseline weight, and over a third of participants had achieved at least 20% weight loss at week 104 in the semaglutide group. As was seen in prior studies, while the vast majority of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg had lost weight at the end of the STEP 5 study, a small proportion of participants experienced weight gain. We do not know how weight would have changed in these participants had they not been receiving the drug; notably, the proportion of patients with weight gain during the study was substantially higher in the placebo group. There is marked variability in weight change in patients on weight management treatments; the reason for this is still unclear and likely involves complex biological and societal influences.

### Weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment for patients with overweight or obesity [^115WLZCu]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the first retrospective study to evaluate weight loss outcomes associated with treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, including the highest doses approved for weight loss (> 1.0 mg) for patients with overweight or obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes. In our cohort, patients lost approximately 6.7 kg at 3 months and 12.3 kg at 6 months, equivalent to 5.9% of weight lost at 3 months and 10.9% of weight lost at 6 months. Hence, this study may be a stepping stone to demonstrating the effectiveness of semaglutide for patients aiming to lose weight. These results may support the applicability of semaglutide in a less controlled environment, as previously proven in RCTs.

Comparison With RCTs

Several RCTs evaluated the weight loss outcomes of semaglutide. In one study including 1306 patients taking semaglutide, 2.4 mg, weight loss of approximately 6% was achieved by week 12 and 12% was achieved by week 28. Our results reflect similar weight loss outcomes within the same period, particularly for patients taking doses of 1.7 mg and 2.4 mg.

In the STEP 2 trial comparing 1 mg and 2.4 mg of semaglutide for patients with type 2 diabetes, similar weight loss trends compared with those in our study were seen. In 12 weeks, weight loss of approximately 4% was achieved among patients taking the 1-mg dose, and weight loss of approximately 5% was achieved among those taking the 2.4-mg dose. In addition, weight loss at 28 weeks approached approximately 7% for patients taking the 1-mg dose and 9.6% for those taking the 2.4-mg dose. Patients without type 2 diabetes achieved higher weight loss outcomes than those with type 2 diabetes, which is also shown in our study.

In addition, considering the 16-week semaglutide titration schedule and having only 44.0% of the patients in our cohort reach maximal semaglutide doses (ie, 1.7 or 2.4 mg) compared with more than 94% of patients in RCTs, weight loss is expected to increase as more patients achieve the maximal doses of this medication.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^115aaKv4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease associated with multiple complications and a substantial morbidity, mortality and health care burden. Pharmacological treatments for obesity provide a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention, which often achieves only limited weight loss that is difficult to maintain. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial programme is evaluating once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue) in people with overweight or obesity. Across STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8, semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%-17.4% in individuals with overweight or obesity without type 2 diabetes from baseline to week 68; 69%-79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%-27% with placebo) and 51%-64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%-13% with placebo). In STEP 5, mean weight loss was -15.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -2.6% with placebo from baseline to week 104. In STEP 2 (individuals with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes), mean weight loss was -9.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -3.4% with placebo from baseline to week 68. Improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, including high blood pressure, atherogenic lipids and benefits on physical function and quality of life were seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg. The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistent across trials, primarily gastrointestinal adverse events. The magnitude of weight loss reported in the STEP trials offers the potential for clinically relevant improvement for individuals with obesity-related diseases.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg / wk for weight loss in patients with severe obesity and with or without a history of bariatric surgery [^1152iAr4]. Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4mg in patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40kg/m 2) who had previously undergone bariatric surgery (BS) but failed to achieve satisfactory weight loss or experienced weight regain compared with patients without a history of BS with similar BMI.

Methods

The authors analyzed data from 129 patients with a BMI ≥ 40kg/m 2, including 39 with (BS+) and 90 without (BS-) a history of BS. The patients received semaglutide treatment for 24weeks starting at 0.25mg/wk and gradually increasing to reach a final dose of 2.4mg/wk. The treatment outcomes were assessed based on the percentage of weight loss, changes in BMI, and waist circumference.

Results

Semaglutide treatment resulted in significant 9.1% weight loss in the BS+ group, with no significant difference in weight loss between the BS+ and BS- groups.

Conclusions

This study is the first, to the authors' knowledge, to compare the effectiveness of semaglutide treatment in patients with versus those without a history of BS, providing valuable evidence of its efficacy. By focusing on individuals with severe obesity (BMI > 40kg/m 2 and associated comorbidities), it fills a gap in the current literature and highlights the potential of semaglutide 2.4mg as a treatment option for this specific population.

### Proteomic changes upon treatment with semaglutide in individuals with obesity [^116xoYJq]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the randomized Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) 1 trial (intent to treat: 1,961 adults with overweight or obesity without T2D), once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in greater weight loss compared with placebo over a 68-week period (estimated treatment difference −12.4 percentage points, 95% confidence interval (CI) −13.4, −11.5; P < 0.001); half of the participants treated with semaglutide (50.5%) had a weight reduction of ≥ 15% compared with 4.9% assigned to placebo. In the randomized STEP 2 trial (intent to treat: 1,210 adults with overweight or obesity and T2D), the estimated treatment difference from baseline to week 68 for semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo was −6.2 percentage points (95% CI −7.3, −5.2; P < 0.0001).

In our analysis, we used fasting serum samples collected at baseline and end of treatment in a large subset of participants from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials, STEP 1 and STEP 2, to investigate the effects of semaglutide treatment on the circulating proteome. By examining the effects following weight loss and also effects after accounting for weight loss on the proteome throughout the trial in those with and without T2D, and by comparing proteomic profiles with those of observational cohorts, we aimed to comprehensively study the proteomic effects of semaglutide treatment and elucidate the mechanism of action driving its benefits on weight- and obesity-related complications, and to determine its potential for use in new indications.

### Evidence-based weight loss interventions: individualized treatment options to maximize patient outcomes [^113hmEmc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Against the backdrop of obesity as a major public health problem, we examined three questions: How much weight loss is needed to benefit patients with obesity? How well do current therapies do in producing weight loss? What strategies can be used to improve patient outcomes using evidence-based studies. This paper reviews literature on the outcomes of lifestyle, diet, medications and surgical treatments for obesity using literature searches for obesity treatments. Current treatments, including lifestyle, diet and exercise, produce a weight loss of 5% to 7% on average. Despite continued attempts to identify superior dietary approaches, most careful comparisons find that low carbohydrate diets are not significantly better than low fat diets for weight loss. The four medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for long-term management of obesity are not as effective as surgery, adding about 5% on average to lifestyle approaches to weight loss. Two new medications that are under investigation, semaglutide and tirzepatide, significantly improve on this. For all treatments for weight loss, including lifestyle, medications and surgery, there is enormous variability in the amount of weight lost. Examination of this literature has yielded evidence supporting baseline and process predictors, but the effect sizes associated with these predictors are small and there are no prospective studies showing that a personalized approach based on genotype or phenotype will yield uniform success. Because obesity is a chronic disease it requires a 'continuous treatment model' across the lifespan.

### Effect of subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 3 randomized clinical trial [^112BFVzL]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Weight loss improves cardiometabolic risk factors in people with overweight or obesity. Intensive lifestyle intervention and pharmacotherapy are the most effective noninvasive weight loss approaches.

Objective

To compare the effects of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg vs placebo for weight management as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy with initial low-calorie diet in adults with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 68-week, phase 3a study (STEP 3) conducted at 41 sites in the US from August 2018 to April 2020 in adults without diabetes (N = 611) and with either overweight (body mass index ≥ 27) plus at least 1 comorbidity or obesity (body mass index ≥ 30).

Interventions

Participants were randomized (2:1) to semaglutide, 2.4 mg (n = 407) or placebo (n = 204), both combined with a low-calorie diet for the first 8 weeks and intensive behavioral therapy (ie, 30 counseling visits) during 68 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The co-primary end points were percentage change in body weight and the loss of 5% or more of baseline weight by week 68. Confirmatory secondary end points included losses of at least 10% or 15% of baseline weight.

Results

Of 611 randomized participants (495 women [81.0%], mean age 46 years [SD, 13], body weight 105.8 kg [SD, 22.9], and body mass index 38.0 [SD, 6.7]), 567 (92.8%) completed the trial, and 505 (82.7%) were receiving treatment at trial end. At week 68, the estimated mean body weight change from baseline was -16.0% for semaglutide vs -5.7% for placebo (difference, -10.3 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -8.6]; P < .001). More participants treated with semaglutide vs placebo lost at least 5% of baseline body weight (86.6% vs 47.6%, respectively; P < .001). A higher proportion of participants in the semaglutide vs placebo group achieved weight losses of at least 10% or 15% (75.3% vs 27.0% and 55.8% vs 13.2%, respectively; P < .001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent with semaglutide (82.8%) vs placebo (63.2%). Treatment was discontinued owing to these events in 3.4% of semaglutide participants vs 0% of placebo participants.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with placebo, used as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy and initial low-calorie diet, resulted in significantly greater weight loss during 68 weeks. Further research is needed to assess the durability of these findings.

### Effect of continued weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo on weight loss maintenance in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 4 randomized clinical trial [^112VfZbG]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The effect of continuing vs withdrawing treatment with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, on weight loss maintenance in people with overweight or obesity is unknown.

Objective

To compare continued once-weekly treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, with switch to placebo for weight maintenance (both with lifestyle intervention) in adults with overweight or obesity after a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2.4 mg weekly.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, 68-week phase 3a withdrawal study conducted at 73 sites in 10 countries from June 2018 to March 2020 in adults with body mass index of at least 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related comorbidity) and without diabetes.

Interventions

A total of 902 participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide during run-in. After 20 weeks (16 weeks of dose escalation; 4 weeks of maintenance dose), 803 participants (89.0%) who reached the 2.4-mg/wk semaglutide maintenance dose were randomized (2:1) to 48 weeks of continued subcutaneous semaglutide (n = 535) or switched to placebo (n = 268), plus lifestyle intervention in both groups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percent change in body weight from week 20 to week 68; confirmatory secondary end points were changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning (assessed using the Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version [SF-36]).

Results

Among 803 study participants who completed the 20-week run-in period (with a mean weight loss of 10.6%) and were randomized (mean age, 46 [SD, 12] years; 634 [79%] women; mean body weight, 107.2 kg [SD, 22.7 kg]), 787 participants (98.0%) completed the trial and 741 (92.3%) completed treatment. With continued semaglutide, mean body weight change from week 20 to week 68 was -7.9% vs +6.9% with the switch to placebo (difference, -14.8 [95% CI, -16.0 to -13.5] percentage points; P < .001). Waist circumference (-9.7 cm [95% CI, -10.9 to -8.5 cm]), systolic blood pressure (-3.9 mm Hg [95% CI, -5.8 to -2.0 mm Hg]), and SF-36 physical functioning score (2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.3]) also improved with continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo (all P < .001). Gastrointestinal events were reported in 49.1% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs 26.1% with placebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events with continued semaglutide (2.4%) and placebo (2.2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity who completed a 20-week run-in period with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg once weekly, maintaining treatment with semaglutide compared with switching to placebo resulted in continued weight loss over the following 48 weeks.

### Reductions in insulin resistance are mediated primarily via weight loss in subjects with type 2 diabetes on semaglutide [^115Nsr4d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Semaglutide, a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 analog approved for use in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), demonstrated superior body weight (BW) reductions and decreased insulin resistance (IR) vs comparators across the Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) 1–3 clinical trials.

Objective

To investigate the relationship between IR and BW across the SUSTAIN 1–3 trials.

Design

Post hoc analysis of the SUSTAIN 1–3 trials.

Setting

Three hundred and eleven sites in 30 countries.

Patients Or Other Participants

2432 subjects with T2D.

Interventions

Semaglutide 0.5 or 1.0 mg, placebo or active comparator (sitagliptin 100 mg, exenatide extended release 2.0 mg).

Main Outcome Measure

To assess the extent of the effect on IR that is mediated (indirect effect) and not mediated (direct effect) by the effect on BW.

Results

Across SUSTAIN 1–3, mean BW was significantly reduced with semaglutide 0.5 mg (3.7 kg to 4.3 kg; P < 0.0001) and semaglutide 1.0 mg (4.5 kg to 6.1 kg; P < 0.0001) vs comparators (1.0 kg to 1.9 kg). There were greater reductions in IR with semaglutide 0.5 mg (27% to 36%) and semaglutide 1.0 mg (32% to 46%) vs comparators (17% to 28%). Greater reductions in BW were generally associated with greater decreases in IR. The effect on IR was primarily mediated by weight loss (70% to 80% and 34% to 94%, for semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, respectively, vs comparator).

Conclusions

Semaglutide consistently reduced BW and IR in subjects with T2D in SUSTAIN 1–3. In this analysis, IR improvement was positively associated with, and primarily mediated by, the effect of semaglutide on BW.

5.2 Efficacy outcomes

Table 2 presents results of the primary and selected key secondary and exploratory endpoints across the trials. All trials met their primary endpoints. Across the 68‐week long trials in individuals with overweight or obesity with comorbidities without type 2 diabetes (STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8), semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with a mean weight loss of 14.9%‐17.4% from baseline to week 68 (Table 2). Furthermore, > 84% of participants were receiving the full dose of semaglutide at week 68.

TABLE 2
Efficacy results from the STEP 1‐5 and 8 trials a

In STEP 1, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus usual lifestyle intervention was 14.9% (vs. 2.4% with placebo), whereas in STEP 3, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus intensive behavioural therapy was 16.0% (vs. 5.7% with placebo). In STEP 4, the mean decrease in body weight during the 20‐week run‐in period with semaglutide treatment was 10.6%. Individuals randomized to continue semaglutide lost an additional 7.9% in body weight from weeks 20 to 68, whereas individuals who switched to placebo experienced a mean 6.9% increase. In STEP 8, mean weight loss was greater with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with liraglutide 3.0 mg from baseline to week 68 (15.8% vs. 6.4%).

In the STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8 trials (the 68‐week long trials in participants without diabetes), weight loss of ≥ 5% (a threshold widely accepted as indicating clinically meaningful response to therapy)was achieved by 86%‐89% of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg versus 29%‐48% receiving placebo (Table 2). In these trials, 69%‐79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%‐27% with placebo), 51%‐64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%‐13% with placebo), and 32%‐40% achieved ≥ 20% weight loss (vs. 2%‐5% with placebo) (Table 2).

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^1118yYW4]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The STEP 5 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention) for long-term treatment of adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and achievement of weight loss of ≥ 5% at week 104. Efficacy was assessed among all randomized participants regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention. From 5 October 2018 to 1 February 2019, 304 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 152) or placebo (n = 152), 92.8% of whom completed the trial (attended the end-of-trial safety visit). Most participants were female (236 (77.6%)) and white (283 (93.1%)), with a mean (s.d.) age of 47.3 (11.0) years, body mass index of 38.5 (6.9) kg m –2 and weight of 106.0 (22.0) kg. The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 104 was −15.2% in the semaglutide group (n = 152) versus −2.6% with placebo (n = 152), for an estimated treatment difference of −12.6%-points (95% confidence interval, −15.3 to −9.8; P < 0.0001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight loss ≥ 5% from baseline at week 104 (77.1% versus 34.4%; P < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events, mostly mild-to-moderate, were reported more often with semaglutide than with placebo (82.2% versus 53.9%). In summary, in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity, semaglutide treatment led to substantial, sustained weight loss over 104 weeks versus placebo.

### Incretin mimetics for weight loss forgive nonadherence [^112L3xe6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

These limitations notwithstanding, the preponderance of evidence suggests that semaglutide and tirzepatide maintain strong weight loss efficacy in spite of missed doses. In particular, it appears that occasional missed doses are very unlikely to nullify treatment with incretin mimetics. The assumption that p = 80% is necessary for significant weight loss, is likely too pessimistic and needs revision. This contrasts with "unforgiving" drugs, in which missing just 10% of doses can cause treatment failure. Our results suggest that dosing regimens can be liberalised to reduce drug costs, mitigate side effects and ultimately improve long‐term treatment persistence, without a significant compromise in weight loss efficacy.

This work is not intended to discourage patients and healthcare providers from striving for high adherence. Rather, the predicted forgiveness of incretin mimetics is heartening news that treatment should not be abandoned if patients cannot consistently take at least p = 80% of their prescribed doses. Indeed, our analysis predicts that this new generation of medications is a powerful tool for combating obesity, perhaps even if patients take only half of their prescribed doses.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^113Cg9g1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large cohort of patients with obesity who initiated treatment with injectable semaglutide or liraglutide, patients lost an average of 3.7% body weight at 1 year. Weight loss varied significantly by the medication, indication, dosage, and persistence of medication coverage. In the multivariable analysis, patients who received semaglutide (vs liraglutide), had a high dosage of the medication (vs low), had obesity (vs T2D) as treatment indication, had persistent medication coverage or 90 to 275 medication coverage days within the first year (vs < 90 medication coverage days), had higher baseline BMI, and were female (vs male) had significantly higher odds of achieving 10% or greater weight reduction at 1 year.

Recently, injectable forms of semaglutide have been more commonly prescribed, in part related to their ability to demonstrate clinically meaningful weight outcomes. As a result of its superiority, the demand for the medication has skyrocketed, leading to notable drug shortages. Patients have high expectations to achieve substantial weight reductions with GLP-1 RA medications. Our clinical findings suggest that this was not the case for most patients in our cohort; however, those who persisted with the medication coverage experienced weight losses comparable with those shown in corresponding clinical trials. Unfortunately, only 4 in 10 patients in this cohort had persistent medication coverage at 1 year, which underlines the current challenges with treating T2D and obesity with these highly effective medications. High out-of-pocket costs, insurance coverage–related issues, medication supply shortages, adverse effects, and weight reduction not meeting the patient's expectations could be the reasons for this, warranting future studies on determinants of nonpersistent coverage with these medications. However, 61.0% of the patients who received semaglutide for obesity and with persistent coverage at 1 year achieved 10% or greater weight loss, which is only slightly less than the proportion in the STEP 1 study, where 69.1% of participants achieved at least 10% weight reduction at 68 weeks.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^112zMLnF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg for 2 years resulted in substantial and sustained changes in body weight versus placebo in STEP 5 (−15.2% vs. −2.6%), demonstrating encouraging long‐term maintenance of weight loss.

The mean weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes in STEP 2 was less than that observed in STEP 1 (which employed a similar study design but with a population of adults with obesity, and without type 2 diabetes). It is well known that weight reductions in people with type 2 diabetes are often less than in people without diabetes, although the full reasons for this remain unknown. In STEP 2, semaglutide 2.4 mg provided only a small numerical improvement over 1.0 mg in glycaemic parameters (HbA 1c levels and targets, fasting plasma glucose, and reduction in use of concomitant oral glucose‐lowering mediations). However, the benefit of the higher dose is seen in the context of greater weight loss.

STEP 3 assessed the impact of semaglutide 2.4 mg in combination with intensive behavioural therapy and an initial low‐calorie meal‐replacement diet, reporting mean weight loss of 16.0% (vs. 5.7% in the placebo group). However, in the other STEP trials, a less intensive lifestyle intervention programme was used, and similar levels of weight loss were achieved, suggesting that an intensive approach may not contribute significant additional weight loss. Rather, the results show the effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in those with overweight or obesity, probably through its ability to control appetite, energy intake and food cravings.

The STEP 6 results indicate that semaglutide 2.4 mg is an effective weight management option also in people from east Asia with obesity, and further illustrates a semaglutide‐induced reduction in visceral fat, which are known to be a strong predictor of weight‐related comorbidities, particularly in people from east Asia.

### Impact of semaglutide administration on weight loss after bariatric surgery: a meta-analysis [^114ABWnA]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A significant number of patients encounter weight gain (WG) or inadequate weight loss (IWL) following bariatric surgery for obesity. Recent studies have explored the role of semaglutide in addressing weight management challenges in patients who have inadequate weight loss or weight gain after bariatric surgery. Despite such studies, a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of semaglutide in this specific clinical context remains absent. Therefore, this study was undertaken to address this knowledge gap.

Methods

Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-control, cohort and observational studies involving use of semaglutide in the intervention arm post-bariatric surgery. Outcome was weight loss post-bariatric surgery.

Results

A total of six studies (300 participants) demonstrated significant weight reduction following semaglutide administration after bariatric surgery (WMD: -15.730, 95% CI: -22.140, -9.320, p < 0.001). This effect remained robust in sensitivity analysis.

Conclusion

The current data encourages the use of semaglutide for managing WG or IWL post-bariatric surgery.

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7. 2 mg in adults with obesity (STEP UP): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^116m7t69]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is approved for weight management in people with obesity and related complications; however, some individuals do not reach their therapeutic goals with this dose. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of semaglutide (7.2 mg) in people with obesity.

Methods

STEP UP was a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial conducted across 95 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in 11 countries in adults with BMI 30 kg/m 2 or greater, without diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (5:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7.2 mg, 2.4 mg, or placebo, with a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants with a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater for semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo from baseline to week 72 (treatment policy estimand). Confirmatory secondary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight with 7.2 mg versus 2.4 mg, change in waist circumference (cm), and proportion of participants with bodyweight reductions of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, 20% or greater, and 25% or greater versus placebo, and 20% or greater and 25% or greater versus 2.4 mg. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05646706) and is now completed.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, 1407 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 7.2 mg (n = 1005), semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 201), or placebo (n = 201). 1037 (73.7%) of 1407 participants were female, the mean age was 47 (SD 12) years, mean bodyweight was 113.0 (24.1) kg, and mean BMI was 39.9 (7.1) kg/m 2. The mean change in bodyweight was greater with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus 2.4 mg (-18.7% [SE 0.4] vs -15.6% [0.7]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -3.1% [95% CI -4.7 to -1.6]; p < 0.0001) and with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo (-18.7% [0.4] vs -3.9% [0.6]; -14.8% [-16.2 to -13.4]; p < 0.0001). Participants in the semaglutide 7.2 mg group were more likely than those in the placebo group to reach bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 12.1 [95% CI 8.3 to 17.6]; p < 0.0001), 10% or greater (14.5 [9.6 to 21.9]; p < 0.0001), 15% or greater (20.3 [11.2 to 36.8]; p < 0.0001), 20% or greater (27.3 [10.9 to 68.0]; p < 0.0001), and 25% or greater (127.4 [36.8 to 441.4]; p < 0.0001); and more likely than those in the 2.4 mg group to reach bodyweight reductions of 20% or greater (1.8 [1.3 to 2.4]; p = 0.0006) and 25% or greater (2.4 [1.6 to 3.5]; p < 0.0001). Improvements in waist circumference were observed with semaglutide 7.2 mg versus placebo (ETD -11.7 cm [95% CI -13.0 to -10.4]; p < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with semaglutide 7.2 mg (711 [70.8%] of 1004) versus 2.4 mg (123 [61.2%] of 201) or placebo (86 [42.8%] of 201), as was dysaesthesia (230 [22.9%], 12 [6.0%], and one [0.5%], respectively). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (6.8%) of 1004 participants with semaglutide 7.2 mg, 22 (10.9%) of 201 with semaglutide 2.4 mg, and 11 (5.5%) of 201 with placebo.

Interpretation

Semaglutide 7.2 mg was superior to placebo and 2.4 mg for bodyweight reduction in adults with obesity, while retaining a favourable risk-benefit profile.

### Ethical considerations in the use of weight loss medications [^113rpyAt]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The emergence of GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, has transformed the landscape of weight management and diabetes treatment. Initially developed for type 2 diabetes mellitus, these medications have gained widespread popularity due to their weight-loss effects, spurred by media attention and celebrity endorsements. However, their increasing demand raises ethical concerns regarding accessibility, affordability, and medical necessity. Patients with genuine clinical indications often struggle to obtain these medications due to shortages and high costs, while wealthier individuals use them for cosmetic weight loss. Additionally, unregulated alternatives, such as compounded injections and celebrity-endorsed supplements, further complicate the landscape by introducing safety risks and misinformation. Physicians face the challenge of balancing evidence-based prescribing with resource allocation, ensuring medications reach those in need. Patients have a responsibility to critically evaluate information and engage in informed decision-making. Policymakers must address disparities by implementing equitable policies that prioritize medical necessity over commercial interests. As the use of GLP-1 agonists continues to rise, a collaborative approach, rooted in ethical responsibility, patient education, and regulatory oversight, is essential to prevent healthcare inequities and uphold the integrity of medical practice.

### Weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment for patients with overweight or obesity [^111KHTya]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Weight Loss With Different Semaglutide Doses

In our study, 77 patients (44.0%) received the highest current doses of subcutaneous semaglutide (1.7 and 2.4 mg), while 98 (56.0%) received lower doses (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg). Detailed information of the maximum dose reached by our cohort of patients is presented in eTable 2 in the Supplement.

At 3 months, patients who received the highest doses achieved a mean (SD) weight loss of 6.9% (3.9%) (95% CI, −7.8% to −6.0% [n = 77]) compared with a mean (SD) weight loss of 5.1% (3.4%) (95% CI −5.8% to −4.4% [n = 98]) for patients receiving lower doses (P = 0.002). At 6 months, patients receiving the highest doses achieved a mean (SD) weight loss of 12.1% (5.9%) (95% CI, −13.6% to −10.6% [n = 60]) compared with a mean (SD) weight loss of 9.2% (5.2%) (95% CI, −10.9% to −7.6% [n = 42]) for patients receiving lower doses (P = 0.01) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).

Our cohort experienced a wide range of weight loss responses to semaglutide at 3 and 6 months (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Weight changes ranged between 3.6% and −14.3% at 3 months and between −0.6% and −29.1% at 6 months.

### Differential efficacy of weight loss interventions in patients with versus without diabetes [^114ErakA]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral semaglutide at the antidiabetic dose of 14 mg/day induces an average − 2.96 kg weight loss among patients with diabetes. While no RCT has evaluated oral semaglutide at this dose for weight loss in patients without diabetes, subcutaneous semaglutide 0.1 mg/day (roughly pharmacokinetically equivalent to oral semaglutide 14 mg/day) induced a weight loss of 9.1% (or 10.1 kg) in overweight persons without diabetes. Once again, the weight loss impact was strikingly higher in persons without diabetes. Interestingly, even patients with T1DM, who are supposed to have an intrinsic tendency to lose weight, seem to derive less weight loss benefit from GLP-1 agonists. A recent observational study of the real-life efficacy of semaglutide in 50 patients with T1DM and a BMI > 27 kg/m 2 found a mean weight loss of − 7.2 kg over 1 year of use.

The therapeutic landscape for obesity and diabetes has been expanded recently with the addition of multi-peptide agonists, of which tirzepatide is the most extensively studied so far. Tirzepatide is a dual agonist of the GLP-1 and GIP receptors, approved at different doses for the treatment of diabetes and obesity in several countries. The pivotal study of tirzepatide in patients with overweight or obesity but not diabetes (SURMOUNT-1), found a 20.9% (22 kg) weight reduction at 72 weeks with the 15 mg/week dose. Similarly, a RCT of tirzepatide initiated after a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention in patients with overweight or obesity but no diabetes, found a pooled weight reduction with the maximum tolerated dose (either 10 or 15 mg) of 18.4% (18.9 kg) over 72 weeks. By comparison, the SURPASS-1 study of tirzepatide in patients with T2DM found weight losses at 40 weeks of − 7.8 kg in the 10 mg arm, and − 9∙5 kg (− 11.0%) in the 15 mg arm. With tirzepatide as well, the weight loss efficacy in patients with diabetes is roughly one-half relative to patients without diabetes.

### Obesity pharmacotherapy in older adults: a narrative review of evidence [^1129GeoM]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Weight loss trials

Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) studies had no upper limit in age. STEP-1 took 1961 adults with a BMI ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 in people with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) without T2D and demonstrated mean weight reduction of 14.8% in participants taking semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly (vs. 2.4% in the placebo group), as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. 86.4% (vs. 31.5%) of patients achieved weight loss ≥ 5%, 69.1% (vs. 12%) achieved weight loss ≥ 10% and 50.5% (vs. 4.9%) achieved weight loss ≥ 15%. Results were reduced in those with T2D, but still significant (STEP-2). Further STEP trials have demonstrated mean weight reduction of 16% (vs. 5.7%) when semaglutide was used as an adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy (STEP-3), and improved head-to-head weight reduction compared to liraglutide over 68 weeks, with possible benefits in older adults given the once weekly administration of semaglutide (STEP-8). STEP-4 gave every participant a 20-week course of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly, and produced a mean weight loss of 10.6%, before randomisation to either continued semaglutide treatment or exchange to placebo for an additional 48 weeks. Continuation of semaglutide resulted in a further 7.9% reduction in body weight from their week 20 weight, whereas the placebo group regained 6.9%. However, STEP 1 extension concluded that 1-year withdrawal of semaglutide results in regain of two-thirds of prior weight loss, highlighting that withdrawal of semaglutide results in weight regain which may be problematic in older adults who are already using polypharmacy approaches for comorbid disease. Consideration of a cyclical delivery of semaglutide, and other AOMs, could be considered, where semaglutide is administered until a pre-determined body weight is achieved, at which point an interval period is commenced until a pre-determined percentage of weight is regained, before restarting treatment. In addition to being polypharmacologically beneficial, this method would appeal to organisations funding healthcare in the licensing of AOMs. More evidence is needed to clarify the ideal duration that an AOM should be given initially before the first interval, but longer compliance with anti-obesity agents from the outset does result in reduced weight regain following cessation. If this method was to be implemented, it would be imperative to remember the evidence to date suggests benefit only with chronic prescription of respective AOM, both in relation to weight and cardiometabolic disease.

### De-intensification of basal-bolus therapy by replacing prandial insulin with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in individuals with well-controlled type 2 diabetes: a single-centre, open-label randomised trial (TRANSITION-T2D) [^112Z1tho]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many individuals with type 2 diabetes initiate multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI) with basal and bolus insulin to achieve adequate glycaemic control. Despite initial improvements in glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c), long‐term MDI is associated with poor glycaemic control, for reasons including undesired weight gain (in a population that already has a high prevalence of overweight/obesity), increased hypoglycaemia frequency/severity, missed injections, ineffective prandial insulin titration and increased management burden (frequent injections, heightened glycaemia vigilance). Ideally, this therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes would be restricted to those unable to achieve glycaemic control with other pharmacological interventions.

Once initiated, MDI typically becomes a permanent/life‐long therapy, and failure to de‐intensify treatment (a form of therapeutic inertia) in such individuals is well documented. The American Diabetes Association recognises that complex insulin regimens may require simplification for patients with type 2 diabetes and self‐management challenges, citing the elderly, in particular. Yet, practical guidance on de‐intensification or simplification of basal‐bolus management is lacking, as is an acknowledgement of the range of possible patient‐specific reasons to de‐intensify or simplify MDI; these might include hypoglycaemia concerns, a desire to reduce the overall burden of management for quality‐of‐life reasons or weight‐loss goals.

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112RcCFN]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

### The expanding role of semaglutide: beyond glycemic control [^115YUKJR]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), has transformed the treatment landscape for type 2 diabetes and obesity due to its robust efficacy and wide-ranging therapeutic benefits. This review outlines semaglutide's diverse mechanisms of action, including its roles in glucose homeostasis, weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection. Data from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER clinical trials demonstrate significant reductions in HbA1c, body weight, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), firmly establishing semaglutide as a key agent in diabetes management. The STEP trials further highlight its exceptional effectiveness in weight control, with participants achieving up to 20% weight loss alongside improvements in obesity-related comorbidities. Moreover, ongoing studies such as the FOCUS trial are investigating its impact on microvascular complications. Beyond glycemic control, semaglutide exhibits renoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and potential hepatoprotective effects. Emerging evidence also supports its expanding role in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), heart failure, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and Alzheimer's disease. While gastrointestinal side effects are the most commonly reported adverse events, long-term studies affirm its overall safety and tolerability. The availability of both subcutaneous and oral formulations further enhances treatment adherence and accessibility. As a result, semaglutide has emerged as a cornerstone therapy for a broad spectrum of metabolic, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine disorders. Future research should continue to explore its therapeutic potential in under-studied populations, including individuals with non-diabetic cardiovascular disease and hepatic fibrosis.

### Weight regain and cardiometabolic effects after withdrawal of semaglutide: the STEP 1 trial extension [^112C25J8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Mean body weight data suggested a slowing of weight regain towards the end of the extension phase in participants withdrawn from semaglutide. By contrast, the STEP 4 study did not show a clear slowing of weight regain towards the end of its 48‐week observation period following semaglutide withdrawal. However, interpretation of weight trajectory in STEP 4 is limited by the comparatively small magnitude of weight regain (owing to the shorter treatment duration and smaller initial weight loss in STEP 4 relative to STEP 1, and the continuation of lifestyle intervention). Whether the slowing in regain in the off‐treatment STEP 1 extension represents a plateauing of mean body weight below baseline levels, or simply a slowing of weight regain as body weight approached baseline, cannot be determined without longer follow‐up.

Subgroup analyses indicated no difference in weight loss based on age, but did suggest lesser mean weight loss in men relative to women in the semaglutide arm, both at the end of active treatment (at week 68) and at the end of the off‐treatment extension phase (at week 120). Despite the small difference between men and women, weight losses during treatment were still substantial and clinically meaningful in both sexes. Subgroup analyses based on baseline BMI categories showed inconsistent trends in the semaglutide arm: weight loss during treatment (week 0 to week 68) showed no clear trend across increasing BMI categories, but over week 0 to week 120 showed a trend for greater weight loss in the subgroups of patients with higher versus lower baseline BMI categories, in part owing to a lesser weight regain in the 40 kg/m 2 or higher subgroup than most others. However, the differences in weight loss between baseline BMI subgroups were comparatively small, and a meaningful effect of baseline BMI cannot be concluded based on the present data. Differences in weight loss in the semaglutide arm were also seen based on baseline glycaemic status, with lesser weight loss from baseline at week 68 and week 120 among those with prediabetes at baseline relative to those with normoglycaemia. This finding is consistent with the established difficulty of achieving weight loss among people with type 2 diabetes, and with the previous observation of smaller reductions in body weight with semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes in the STEP 2 trial, relative to those seen during the main treatment period of STEP 1, which excluded patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: moving towards efficacy improvement [^117AWssX]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic, recurring, progressive disease and a major public health problem associated with several other diseases that lead to disability, morbidity, and mortality. The prevalence of obesity has increased at pandemic levels, along with increasing weight-related comorbidities and deaths worldwide. Lifestyle interventions alone provide clinically significant long-term weight loss in only a small proportion of individuals, and bariatric surgery is not suitable or desirable for all patients. Historically, anti-obesity medications achieved a mean efficacy with weight loss between 5 and 10%, which significantly impacted several comorbidities and risk factors, but the average efficacy of these medications remained lower than that expected by both patients and health care professionals and eventually curbed long-term use. Moreover, there is no direct evidence on the impact of anti-obesity medications on cardiovascular outcomes. Semaglutide is a newer anti-obesity medication that changes the overall landscape, as phase 3 studies show a mean weight loss near the 15% threshold and significant proportions of patients with a weight loss of greater than 20%. In this review, we focus on the currently available anti-obesity medications, discuss the results of semaglutide, and present perspectives on the future of obesity treatment after semaglutide.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^112Zwtm3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

### Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: the STEP 8 randomized clinical trial [^114nTXgk]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Phase 3 trials have not compared semaglutide and liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues available for weight management.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and adverse event profiles of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, vs once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (both with diet and physical activity), in people with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, 68-week, phase 3b trial conducted at 19 US sites from September 2019 (enrollment: September 11-November 26) to May 2021 (end of follow-up: May 11) in adults with body mass index of 30 or greater or 27 or greater with 1 or more weight-related comorbidities, without diabetes (N = 338).

Interventions

Participants were randomized (3:1:3:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg (16-week escalation; n = 126), or matching placebo, or once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (4-week escalation; n = 127), or matching placebo, plus diet and physical activity. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg of semaglutide could receive 1.7 mg; participants unable to tolerate 3.0 mg of liraglutide discontinued treatment and could restart the 4-week titration. Placebo groups were pooled (n = 85).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percentage change in body weight, and confirmatory secondary end points were achievement of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss, assessed for semaglutide vs liraglutide at week 68. Semaglutide vs liraglutide comparisons were open-label, with active treatment groups double-blinded against matched placebo groups. Comparisons of active treatments vs pooled placebo were supportive secondary end points.

Results

Of 338 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 49 [13] years; 265 women [78.4%]; mean [SD] body weight, 104.5 [23.8] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 37.5 [6.8]), 319 (94.4%) completed the trial, and 271 (80.2%) completed treatment. The mean weight change from baseline was -15.8% with semaglutide vs -6.4% with liraglutide (difference, -9.4 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -6.8]; P < .001); weight change with pooled placebo was -1.9%. Participants had significantly greater odds of achieving 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss with semaglutide vs liraglutide (70.9% of participants vs 25.6% [odds ratio, 6.3 {95% CI, 3.5 to 11.2}], 55.6% vs 12.0% [odds ratio, 7.9 {95% CI, 4.1 to 15.4}], and 38.5% vs 6.0% [odds ratio, 8.2 {95% CI, 3.5 to 19.1}], respectively; all P < .001). Proportions of participants discontinuing treatment for any reason were 13.5% with semaglutide and 27.6% with liraglutide. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by 84.1% with semaglutide and 82.7% with liraglutide.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to counseling for diet and physical activity, resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^116bRTXu]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The STEP 5 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention) for long-term treatment of adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and achievement of weight loss of ≥ 5% at week104. Efficacy was assessed among all randomized participants regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention. From 5 October 2018 to 1 February 2019, 304 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2.4mg (n = 152) or placebo (n = 152), 92.8% of whom completed the trial (attended the end-of-trial safety visit). Most participants were female (236 (77.6%)) and white (283 (93.1%)), with a mean (s.d.) age of 47.3 (11.0)years, body mass index of 38.5 (6.9)kgm -2 and weight of 106.0 (22.0)kg. The mean change in body weight from baseline to week104 was -15.2% in the semaglutide group (n = 152) versus -2.6% with placebo (n = 152), for an estimated treatment difference of -12.6%-points (95% confidence interval, -15.3 to -9.8; P < 0.0001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight loss ≥ 5% from baseline at week104 (77.1% versus 34.4%; P < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events, mostly mild-to-moderate, were reported more often with semaglutide than with placebo (82.2% versus 53.9%). In summary, in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity, semaglutide treatment led to substantial, sustained weight loss over 104weeks versus placebo.

### Coadministered cagrilintide and semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^1134QoPH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg has established weight-loss and cardiovascular benefits, and cagrilintide at a dose of 2.4 mg has shown promising results in early-phase trials; the efficacy of the combination (known as CagriSema) on weight loss in persons with either overweight and coexisting conditions or obesity is unknown.

Methods

In a phase 3a, 68-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial, we enrolled adults without diabetes who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or higher or a BMI of 27 or higher with at least one obesity-related complication. Participants were randomly assigned in a ratio of 21:3:3:7 to receive the combination of semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg and cagrilintide at a dose of 2.4 mg, semaglutide alone at a dose of 2.4 mg, cagrilintide alone at a dose of 2.4 mg, or placebo, plus lifestyle interventions for all groups. The coprimary end points were the relative change in body weight and a reduction of 5% or more in body weight from baseline to week 68 with cagrilintide-semaglutide as compared with placebo. Body-weight reductions of 20% or more, 25% or more, and 30% or more were assessed as confirmatory secondary end points. Effect estimates were assessed with the treatment-policy estimand (consistent with the intention-to-treat principle). Safety was assessed.

Results

A total of 3417 participants underwent randomization, with 2108 assigned to receive cagrilintide-semaglutide, 302 to receive semaglutide, 302 to receive cagrilintide, and 705 to receive placebo. The estimated mean percent change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -20.4% with cagrilintide-semaglutide as compared with -3.0% with placebo (estimated difference, -17.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -18.1 to -16.6; P < 0.001). Participants receiving cagrilintide-semaglutide were more likely than those receiving placebo to reach weight-loss targets of 5% or more, 20% or more, 25% or more, and 30% or more (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Gastrointestinal adverse events (affecting 79.6% in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and 39.9% in the placebo group), including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain, were mainly transient and mild-to-moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Cagrilintide-semaglutide provided significant and clinically relevant body-weight reductions in adults with overweight or obesity, as compared with placebo. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; REDEFINE 1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05567796.).

### GLP-1-based therapies for diabetes, obesity and beyond [^111FEVGZ]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, represent highly effective treatment options for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, enabling effective control of glucose and weight loss, while reducing cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The success of these medicines has spurred development of next-generation GLP-1-based drugs, promising greater weight loss, improved tolerability and additional options for the route and frequency of dosing. This Review profiles established and emerging GLP-1-based medicines, discussing optimization of pharmacokinetics and tolerability, engagement of new therapeutically useful pathways and safety aspects. Structurally unique GLP-1-based medicines that achieve substantially greater and rapid weight loss may impact musculoskeletal health, providing a rationale for therapeutics that more selectively target adipose tissue loss while preserving muscle mass and strength. Ongoing clinical trials in peripheral vascular disease, neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders, metabolic liver disease, arthritis, hypertension and neurodegenerative disorders may broaden indications for GLP-1-based therapeutics.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^113GwpK6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Real‐world evidence supports the effectiveness of GLP‐1RA for weight loss, but the observed weight reduction in therapy initiators overall tends to be lower than in randomised controlled trials, likely due to lower adherence, persistence and the use of reduced doses in clinical practice. Semaglutide and tirzepatide starters appear to achieve the greatest weight loss, with emerging data suggesting that real‐world outcomes may approach those seen in trials among highly adherent patients. Adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal disturbances, frequently lead to discontinuation, but otherwise, real‐world data provide little evidence for severe adverse effects. Adverse events in the obesity population and, in particular, long‐term safety outcomes remain insufficiently studied. Future research should focus on comparative effectiveness, long‐term clinical impacts, treatment discontinuation effects and cost‐effectiveness to optimise the real‐world application of these therapies. Addressing these gaps will be crucial for refining clinical guidelines, ensuring equitable access and guiding future pharmacological strategies for obesity management.

### Weight loss response to semaglutide in postmenopausal women with and without hormone therapy use [^115Bptrw]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, the weight loss response to semaglutide differed between postmenopausal women with and without HT use. Three, 6, 9, and 12 months after semaglutide initiation, HT use was associated with approximately 30% more weight loss. After adjusting for potential confounding variables this association remained significant across time. Similarly, at 12 months, HT use was associated with a greater probability of achieving ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% TBWL. The weight loss observed in our study was associated with an improvement in cardiometabolic risk markers, regardless of HT use.

These results replicate the effectiveness of semaglutide in phase 3 clinical trials and real-world studies. The 16% total body weight loss observed in the HT group, is similar to the weight loss response to semaglutide in pivotal studies. We observed an inferior weight loss response in the no-HT group that cannot be explained by the presence of factors that can affect weight loss, such as age, baseline weight, the presence of type 2 diabetes at baseline, and semaglutide dosage. Given the retrospective nature of the study, we were unable to identify factors other than HT use that could explain this differential response.

While the difference in weight loss response among the two groups may be explained by the positive effects of HT on body composition changes, other factors need to be considered. The primary indication for HT is for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms which impact 80% of women during the menopause transition and can last a mean of 7 to 10 years. Improving vasomotor symptoms can consequently lead to improved sleep, physical activity, and overall quality of life, all factors that can affect response to weight loss interventions. An additional consideration that can occur in observational studies is healthy-user bias. Healthy-user bias arises when users of preventive medications are healthier due to factors other than medication effect. This has been well established in research involving HT use, particularly as it relates to better CVD outcomes. - Compared to no-HT users, HT users generally pursue healthier lifestyle, are more physically active, leaner, and less likely to smoke, and have better access to medical care. In this study, it is therefore possible that women on HT were more amenable to make healthier dietary changes and exercise more regularly.

### Long-term comparative effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide versus alternative treatments in a real-world US adult population with type 2 diabetes: a randomized pragmatic clinical trial [^116AeEnT]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Average weight loss with semaglutide in SEPRA (year 1: −3.57% and −4.0 kg; year 2: −3.84% and −4.44 kg) was consistent with SUSTAIN 1–7 (semaglutide 1.0 mg: −4.9 kg to −6.5 kg; semaglutide 0.5 mg: −3.5 kg to −4.6 kg) based on the doses used in SEPRA. Average weight loss of −4.9 kg was reported in other real-world studies (over 26 to ~30 weeks). The ETD for average weight loss for semaglutide versus alternative treatment was only significantly different for years 1 and 2 in the second estimand that assumed all participants were adherent, whereas the ETD for the primary estimand was only significant at year 1. These results indicate that adherence to the study drug may influence the degree of weight loss at year 2, although differences in dose escalation patterns, tolerability issues, or treatment discontinuation may have also contributed to the lack of difference in weight loss between treatment groups for the primary estimand. Additionally, in this pragmatic study, practice patterns varied, and patients and practitioners prioritized achieving HbA 1c levels near 7% as opposed to maximizing the semaglutide dose to achieve greater weight loss.

### Effectiveness of adjuvant semaglutide following bariatric metabolic surgery [^115rRg4A]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a relapsing condition and response to anti-obesity therapies appears to be normally distributed. Therefore, some patients undergoing metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) will demonstrate a partial response to therapy. When prescribing therapies to patients living with obesity (PwO) the median total weight loss (TWL) gives a good indication of the likely utility of prescription for that individual. GLP-1 agonists (GLP1a) offer patients a reasonable prospect of clinically significant weight loss even if they have been previously treated with MBS.

Methods

A retrospective review of prospectively collected data in a single bariatric clinic was performed. Patients with insufficient weight loss at any time point were offered semaglutide therapy with doses titrated depending on response to treatment, tolerability, availability and affordability. Duration of therapy, highest dose tolerated, anthropometric measures and reported side effects were recorded. Reasons for discontinuation were noted where possible; however, discontinuation due to medication unavailability was not reliably captured in the dataset.

Results

The median dose tolerated was 1 mg s/c per week, and 78% tolerated ≤ 1 mg as the maximum achieved dose. The median TWL was 7.5% and side effects were uncommon. Most patients took therapy for > 6 months, but continued therapy > 1 year was uncommon.

Conclusion

Overall 'real-world' utility of semaglutide after MBS may potentially be hampered by supply and cost issues more than issues associated with effectiveness or side effect profile.

### Incretin mimetics for weight loss forgive nonadherence [^113sS7pX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

GLP-1 and GIP-GLP-1 agonists have emerged as potent weight-loss medications. These incretin mimetics often have low patient adherence, and as with any medication, clinically meaningful efficacy requires adequate adherence. But what constitutes "adequate" adherence for incretin mimetics? The purpose of this paper is to address this question.

Materials and Methods

We use mathematical modelling and stochastic simulation to investigate the weight loss efficacy of incretin mimetics under imperfect adherence. We use validated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models of semaglutide and tirzepatide and assume that simulated patients randomly miss doses.

Results

We find that semaglutide and tirzepatide forgive nonadherence, meaning that strong weight loss efficacy persists despite missed doses. For example, taking 80% of the prescribed doses yields around 90% of the weight loss achieved under perfect adherence. Taking only 50% of the prescribed doses yields nearly 70% of the weight loss of perfect adherence. Furthermore, such nonadherence causes only small fluctuations in body weight, assuming that patients do not typically miss more than several consecutive doses.

Conclusion

Incretin mimetics are powerful tools for combating obesity, perhaps even if patients can consistently take only half of their prescribed doses. The common assumption that significant weight loss requires at least 80% adherence needs revision.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^114UrjaB]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

AOMs are an important treatment option for people living with obesity who are unable to lose weight and maintain WL or for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery or who failed to maintain WL following bariatric surgery. The STEP clinical development program with the GLP‐1 analogue semaglutide provides rigorous assessment regarding the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly to treat people with obesity, with an effort to gain a greater understanding of WL, WL maintenance, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. We anticipate that these trials will demonstrate that semaglutide represents a new and effective medication that can be used to improve the health and quality of life for patients with obesity.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg QW

The STEP 1 clinical trial has investigated the benefits of once-weekly injections of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the management of people who are obese or overweight. In a double-blind trial of 1961 nondiabetic obese (≥ 30 kg/m 2) or overweight patients (≥ 27 kg/m 2) with coexisting weight-related complications, semaglutide 2.4 mg along with lifestyle modifications led to a 14.9% reduction in body weight as compared with a 2.4% reduction with placebo, with an estimated treatment difference of − 12.4 percentage points at 68 weeks. The mean reduction in body weight from baseline to week 68 was − 15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared to − 2.6 kg in the placebo group. 86.4, 69.1, and 50.5% of the patients on semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved weight losses of 5% or more, 10% or more, and 15% or more, respectively, at the end of 68 weeks. Not only that, patients receiving semaglutide also reported significant improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors and physical functioning as compared to the placebo arm. Transient nausea and diarrhoea were the most common adverse events; these were of mild-to-moderate severity that subsided over time. The STEP 2 trial compared semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo and semaglutide 1 mg for weight management in a double-blind, double-dummy design in overweight and obese T2DM patients. At the end of 68 weeks, semaglutide 2.4 mg once a week demonstrated a superior and clinically meaningful decrease in body weight compared with placebo, with an estimated treatment difference of 6.2 percentage points (95% CI − 7.3 to − 5.2; p < 0.0001). A higher number of patients with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo achieved a weight loss of 5% or more (OR − 4.88, 95% CI 3.58–6.64). Furthermore, semaglutide 2.4 mg has been investigated versus placebo as an adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy and a low-calorie diet for weight management in 611 overweight and obese patients in the STEP 3 trial. Higher proportions of the patients in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm achieved weight losses of 5% or more, 10% or more, and 15% or more at the end of 68 weeks: 86.6, 75.3, and 55.8%, respectively.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^1134d9Jy]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The obesity epidemic is a public health concern, warranting further research into pharmacological treatments for weight management (WM) as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program aims to investigate the effect of semaglutide versus placebo on weight loss, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity or overweight.

Methods

Across five phase 3 trials (NCT03548935, WM; NCT03552757, WM in type 2 diabetes; NCT03611582, WM with intensive behavioral therapy; NCT03548987, sustained WM; and NCT03693430, long‐term WM), ~5,000 participants are being randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly subcutaneously versus placebo. Results will be available in 2020/2021. For all trials, the primary end point is change from baseline to end of treatment in body weight.

Results

Participants have a mean age of 46.2 to 55.3 years, are mostly female (mean: 74.1%‐81.0%), and have a mean BMI of 35.7 to 38.5 kg/m 2 and a mean waist circumference of 113.0 to 115.7 cm.

Conclusions

The STEP program evaluates the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once weekly in a broad population. The trials will provide insights on WM in people with obesity with and without type 2 diabetes and on long‐term follow‐up.

### Efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of real-world evidence [^1154UmS8]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Oral semaglutide has undergone global Phase 3 development programs named PIONEER and approved for therapeutic use in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aim to systematically review the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in real-world settings.

Methods

We systematically searched the electronic databases of PubMed, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until March 15, 2024, using several keywords with Boolean "AND". We retrieved all the available granular details of real-world studies (RWS).

Results

To date, results from four prospective and ten retrospective real-world studies of oral semaglutide in T2D are available. In prospective studies, the primary outcome of HbA1c reduction varied from -0.9% to -1.6%, weight loss varied from -4.7 kg to -8.2 kg and HbA1c target of < 7% was achieved in 30%-64% with oral semaglutide. In retrospective studies, HbA1c reduction varied from -0.4% to -1.8%, weight reduction varied from -1.4 to -9.0 kg, HbA1c target of < 7% was achieved in 32–64%, and 30–41% of people with T2D had ≥ 5% weight loss with oral semaglutide. Gastrointestinal adverse events with oral semaglutide varied from 16% to 50% in prospective and 6%-47% in retrospective RWS. Overall, 0%-18% of patients had oral semaglutide discontinuation due to any cause.

Conclusion

Oral semaglutide exhibited a reasonable reduction in HbA1c and weight in people with T2D, consistent with the findings from PIONEER trials. While no new safety issues emerged, the inherent limitations of RWS underscore the necessity of long-term investigations to comprehensively assess safety.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1154aeeq]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Assessing efficacy and safety of weight management pharmacotherapy — upon initiating medications for obesity, assess their effectiveness and safety at least monthly for the first 3 months and at least quarterly thereafter; those who achieve sufficient early weight loss upon starting a chronic weight management medication (typically defined as > 5% weight loss after 3 months of use) should continue the medication long-term, whereas when early weight loss results are modest (typically < 5% weight loss after 3 months of use), the benefits of ongoing treatment need to be examined in the context of the glycemic response, alternative options, tolerance, and burden. Ongoing monitoring of the achievement and maintenance of weight management goals is recommended, and sudden discontinuation of semaglutide and tirzepatide results in regain of one-half to two-thirds of the weight loss within 1 year. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the best long-term approach (continuing on the lowest effective dose, using intermittent therapy, or stopping medication followed by close weight monitoring), and for those not reaching or maintaining goals, avoid treatment inertia by reevaluating therapies and intensifying with additional approaches (e.g., metabolic surgery, additional pharmacologic agents, structured lifestyle programs).

### Weight regain and cardiometabolic effects after withdrawal of semaglutide: the STEP 1 trial extension [^112TCecx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To explore changes in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors after treatment withdrawal in the STEP 1 trial extension.

Materials and Methods

STEP 1 (NCT03548935) randomized 1961 adults with a body mass index ≥ 30kg/m 2 (or ≥ 27kg/m 2 with ≥ 1 weight-related co-morbidity) without diabetes to 68weeks of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (including 16weeks of dose escalation) or placebo, as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. At week 68, treatments (including lifestyle intervention) were discontinued. An off-treatment extension assessed for a further year a representative subset of participants who had completed 68weeks of treatment. This subset comprised all eligible participants from any site in Canada, Germany and the UK, and sites in the United States and Japan with the highest main phase recruitment. All analyses in the extension were exploratory.

Results

Extension analyses included 327 participants. From week 0 to week 68, mean weight loss was 17.3% (SD: 9.3%) with semaglutide and 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) with placebo. Following treatment withdrawal, semaglutide and placebo participants regained 11.6 (SD: 7.7) and 1.9 (SD: 4.8) percentage points of lost weight, respectively, by week 120, resulting in net losses of 5.6% (SD: 8.9%) and 0.1% (SD: 5.8%), respectively, from week 0 to week 120. Cardiometabolic improvements seen from week 0 to week 68 with semaglutide reverted towards baseline at week 120 for most variables.

Conclusions

One year after withdrawal of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg and lifestyle intervention, participants regained two-thirds of their prior weight loss, with similar changes in cardiometabolic variables. Findings confirm the chronicity of obesity and suggest ongoing treatment is required to maintain improvements in weight and health.

### Long-term weight loss effects of semaglutide in obesity without diabetes in the SELECT trial [^115hXD2H]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The analyses of weight effects of the SELECT study presented here reveal that patients assigned to once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg lost significantly more weight than those receiving placebo. The weight-loss trajectory with semaglutide occurred over 65 weeks and was sustained up to 4 years. Likewise, there were similar improvements in the semaglutide group for anthropometrics (WC and WHtR). The weight loss was associated with a greater proportion of patients receiving semaglutide achieving improvement in BMI category, healthy BMI (< 25 kg m − 2) and falling below the WC cutoff point above which increased cardiometabolic risk for the sex and race is greater. Furthermore, both sexes, all races, all body sizes and those from all geographic regions were able to achieve clinically meaningful weight loss. There was no evidence of increased SAEs based on BMI categories, although lower BMI category was associated with increased rates of trial product discontinuation, probably reflecting exposure to a higher level of drug in lower BMI categories. These data, representing the longest clinical trial of the effects of semaglutide versus placebo on weight, establish the safety and durability of semaglutide effects on weight loss and maintenance in a geographically and racially diverse population of adult men and women with overweight and obesity but not diabetes. The implications of weight loss of this degree in such a diverse population suggests that it may be possible to impact the public health burden of the multiple morbidities associated with obesity. Although our trial focused on CV events, many chronic diseases would benefit from effective weight management.

### Long-term weight loss effects of semaglutide in obesity without diabetes in the SELECT trial [^111hTJmk]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The overall safety profile did not reveal any new signals from prior studies, and there were no BMI category-related associations with AE reporting. The analysis did reveal that tolerability may differ among specific BMI classes, since more discontinuations occurred with semaglutide among lower BMI classes. Potential contributors may include a possibility of higher drug exposure in lower BMI classes, although other explanations, including differences in motivation and cultural mores regarding body size, cannot be excluded.

Is the weight loss in SELECT less than expected based on prior studies with the drug? In STEP 1, a large phase 3 study of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in individuals without diabetes but with BMI > 30 kg m − 2 or 27 kg m − 2 with at least one obesity-related comorbidity, the mean weight loss was −14.9% at week 68, compared with −2.4% with placebo. Several reasons may explain the observation that the mean treatment difference was −12.5% in STEP 1 and −8.7% in SELECT. First, SELECT was designed as a CV outcomes trial and not a weight-loss trial, and weight loss was only a supportive secondary endpoint in the trial design. Patients in STEP 1 were desirous of weight loss as a reason for study participation and received structured lifestyle intervention (which included a −500 kcal per day diet with 150 min per week of physical activity). In the SELECT trial, patients did not enroll for the specific purpose of weight loss and received standard of care covering management of CV risk factors, including medical treatment and healthy lifestyle counseling, but without a specific focus on weight loss. Second, the respective study populations were quite different, with STEP 1 including a younger, healthier population with more women (73.1% of the semaglutide arm in STEP 1 versus 27.7% in SELECT) and higher mean BMI (37.8 kg m − 2 versus 33.3 kg m − 2, respectively). Third, major differences existed between the respective trial protocols. Patients in the semaglutide treatment arm of STEP 1 were more likely to be exposed to the medication at the full dose of 2.4 mg than those in SELECT. In SELECT, investigators were allowed to slow, decrease or pause treatment. By 104 weeks, approximately 77% of SELECT patients on dose were receiving the target semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly dose, which is lower than the corresponding proportion of patients in STEP 1 (89.6% were receiving the target dose at week 68). Indeed, in our first on-treatment analysis at week 208, weight loss was greater (−11.7% for semaglutide) compared with the in-trial analysis (−10.2% for semaglutide). Taken together, all these issues make less weight loss an expected finding in SELECT, compared with STEP 1.

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort study of 3389 patients with obesity treated with injectable forms of semaglutide or liraglutide in a regular clinical setting, achieving sustained weight reduction of 10% or more was associated with the GLP-1 RA agent, treatment indication, medication dosage, sex, and persistence with medication coverage. Future research should focus on identifying the reasons for discontinuation of medication use and interventions aimed at improving long-term persistent coverage.

Change in body weight with semaglutide 2.4 mg: STEP trials

In the follow-up of the STEP 1 trial, which included 327 participants with a mean weight loss of 17.3% in the semaglutide group and 2.0% in the placebo group, after the discontinuation of the treatment and lifestyle interventions, participants regained two-thirds (11.6 vs. 1.9 percentage points) of their previous lost weight, resulting in net losses of 5.6% vs. 0.1% by week 120. These data confirm that obesity is a chronic and recurrent disease, and medications will only be useful when used continuously; this concept is not different from that of hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia.

The double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled STEP 2 study evaluated patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 and T2DM (n = 1210). This was the only study included in the STEP program that involved patients with diabetes and, as such, the first trial to show clinically relevant weight loss related to a once-a-week subcutaneous injection of semaglutide 2.4 mg in people with overweight or obesity and T2DM. Patients treated with weekly subcutaneous injection of semaglutide 2.4 mg for 68 weeks showed a – 9.6% reduction in their initial body weight versus a – 7.0% reduction with 1.0 mg of semaglutide and a – 3.4% reduction with a placebo (p < 0.0001). A greater percentage of patients (13.3%) also achieved a ≥ 20% body-weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg, versus 4.7% in the semaglutide 1.0 mg group and 1.6% in the placebo group. The mean change in body weight (kg) is illustrated in Fig. 2.

### Incretin mimetics for weight loss forgive nonadherence [^113PQZTf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

GLP‐1 and GIP‐GLP‐1 agonists have emerged as potent weight‐loss medications. These incretin mimetics often have low patient adherence, and as with any medication, clinically meaningful efficacy requires adequate adherence. But what constitutes "adequate" adherence for incretin mimetics? The purpose of this paper is to address this question.

Materials and Methods

We use mathematical modelling and stochastic simulation to investigate the weight loss efficacy of incretin mimetics under imperfect adherence. We use validated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models of semaglutide and tirzepatide and assume that simulated patients randomly miss doses.

Results

We find that semaglutide and tirzepatide forgive nonadherence, meaning that strong weight loss efficacy persists despite missed doses. For example, taking 80% of the prescribed doses yields around 90% of the weight loss achieved under perfect adherence. Taking only 50% of the prescribed doses yields nearly 70% of the weight loss of perfect adherence. Furthermore, such nonadherence causes only small fluctuations in body weight, assuming that patients do not typically miss more than several consecutive doses.

Conclusion

Incretin mimetics are powerful tools for combating obesity, perhaps even if patients can consistently take only half of their prescribed doses. The common assumption that significant weight loss requires at least 80% adherence needs revision.

### Weight regain and cardiometabolic effects after withdrawal of semaglutide: the STEP 1 trial extension [^117EQ3ES]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

To explore changes in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors after treatment withdrawal in the STEP 1 trial extension.

Materials and Methods

STEP 1 (NCT03548935) randomized 1961 adults with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 (or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 with ≥ 1 weight‐related co‐morbidity) without diabetes to 68 weeks of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (including 16 weeks of dose escalation) or placebo, as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. At week 68, treatments (including lifestyle intervention) were discontinued. An off‐treatment extension assessed for a further year a representative subset of participants who had completed 68 weeks of treatment. This subset comprised all eligible participants from any site in Canada, Germany and the UK, and sites in the United States and Japan with the highest main phase recruitment. All analyses in the extension were exploratory.

Results

Extension analyses included 327 participants. From week 0 to week 68, mean weight loss was 17.3% (SD: 9.3%) with semaglutide and 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) with placebo. Following treatment withdrawal, semaglutide and placebo participants regained 11.6 (SD: 7.7) and 1.9 (SD: 4.8) percentage points of lost weight, respectively, by week 120, resulting in net losses of 5.6% (SD: 8.9%) and 0.1% (SD: 5.8%), respectively, from week 0 to week 120. Cardiometabolic improvements seen from week 0 to week 68 with semaglutide reverted towards baseline at week 120 for most variables.

Conclusions

One year after withdrawal of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg and lifestyle intervention, participants regained two‐thirds of their prior weight loss, with similar changes in cardiometabolic variables. Findings confirm the chronicity of obesity and suggest ongoing treatment is required to maintain improvements in weight and health.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight loss in overweight or obese adults without diabetes: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis including the 2-year STEP 5 trial [^114ih9Hr]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To explore the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4mg, administered once a week in non-diabetic overweight or obese individuals.

Methods

A thorough search was performed of various databases including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, CNKI and Wanfang from their inception up to April 11, 2023. Our aim was to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy of semaglutide administered once weekly with placebo in overweight or obese adults. Through a review of the literature, data were extracted from relevant studies and assessed for quality, and a meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4.1 software.

Results

Six RCTs comprising 3962 overweight or obese individuals were identified. The findings indicated that, in comparison to the placebo group, semaglutide caused a significant and sustainable reduction in the percentage of body weight (BW; mean difference [MD]: -11.80% [95% confidence interval {CI} -12.93, -10.68]; P < 0.00001) as well as a decrease in absolute BW (MD: -12.2kg [95% CI -13.3, -11.1]; P < 0.00001), body mass index (MD: -4.5kg/m 2 [95% CI -4.9, -4.1]; P < 0.00001) and waist circumference (MD:-9.4cm [95% CI -10.1, -8.8]; P < 0.00001). Moreover, it achieved a higher proportion of patients who experienced weight loss exceeding 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%. Furthermore, semaglutide showed significant efficacy in controlling blood pressure, blood sugar levels, C-reactive protein levels, and lipid profiles. In terms of safety, the most common adverse effects following semaglutide treatment were gastrointestinal adverse reactions (risk ratio: 1.49 [95% CI 1.38, 1.60]; P < 0.00001), which were generally mild to moderate in severity and temporary.

Conclusion

In overweight or obese non-diabetic individuals, semaglutide had a remarkable and sustained weight loss effect that was well tolerated and safe.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^114YSbP5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

8 CONCLUSIONS

A growing body of data from the STEP clinical trial programme has demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in individuals with overweight or obesity. Across the STEP trials, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistently associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%‐17.4% in participants without diabetes, and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, physical function and quality of life. Furthermore, the safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was as expected for the GLP‐1RA class. Results of other trials within the STEP programme are awaited, together with data from SELECT, which will provide valuable information on the impact of weight reduction with semaglutide 2.4 mg on decreasing CV risk.

### Semaglutide induces weight loss in subjects with type 2 diabetes regardless of baseline BMI or gastrointestinal adverse events in the SUSTAIN 1 to 5 trials [^115oeKEC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

SUSTAIN 3 was the only trial analyzed here that compared semaglutide with another GLP‐1RA. 17 In addition, the recently published SUSTAIN 7 trial compared semaglutide 0.5 mg versus dulaglutide 0.75 mg and semaglutide 1.0 mg versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg, all once‐weekly. 21 In both of these trials, semaglutide demonstrated significantly greater weight loss than the other two GLP‐1RAs, both in terms of absolute weight loss and the proportions of subjects achieving ≥ 5% weight loss. In SUSTAIN 3, the difference compared with exenatide ER was present across all BMI groups. This is despite the three agents ostensibly sharing the same mechanism of action. The reason behind these differences is unclear. In the case of exenatide ER, it may be related to its exendin‐4‐derived structure, which has a much lower amino acid sequence homology to native human GLP‐1 than semaglutide. This may confer different binding characteristics to the GLP‐1 receptor. 11, 17

### Long-term weight loss effects of semaglutide in obesity without diabetes in the SELECT trial [^113kagtW]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

In the SELECT cardiovascular outcomes trial, semaglutide showed a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in 17,604 adults with preexisting cardiovascular disease, overweight or obesity, without diabetes. Here in this prespecified analysis, we examined effects of semaglutide on weight and anthropometric outcomes, safety and tolerability by baseline body mass index (BMI). In patients treated with semaglutide, weight loss continued over 65weeks and was sustained for up to 4years. At 208weeks, semaglutide was associated with mean reduction in weight (-10.2%), waist circumference (-7.7cm) and waist-to-height ratio (-6.9%) versus placebo (-1.5%, -1.3cm and -1.0%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all comparisons versus placebo). Clinically meaningful weight loss occurred in both sexes and all races, body sizes and regions. Semaglutide was associated with fewer serious adverse events. For each BMI category (< 30, 30 to < 35, 35 to < 40 and ≥ 40kgm - 2) there were lower rates (events per 100years of observation) of serious adverse events with semaglutide (43.23, 43.54, 51.07 and 47.06 for semaglutide and 50.48, 49.66, 52.73 and 60.85 for placebo). Semaglutide was associated with increased rates of trial product discontinuation. Discontinuations increased as BMI class decreased. In SELECT, at 208weeks, semaglutide produced clinically significant weight loss and improvements in anthropometric measurements versus placebo. Weight loss was sustained over 4years. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03574597.

### Long-term weight loss effects of semaglutide in obesity without diabetes in the SELECT trial [^115XBWup]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

There were variations in the weight-loss response. Individual changes in body weight with semaglutide and placebo were striking; still, 67.8% achieved 5% or more weight loss and 44.2% achieved 10% weight loss with semaglutide at 2 years, compared with 21.3% and 6.9%, respectively, for those receiving placebo. Our first on-treatment analysis demonstrated that those on-drug lost more weight than those in-trial, confirming the effect of drug exposure. With semaglutide, lower BMI was associated with less percentage weight loss, and women lost more weight on average than men (−11.1% versus −7.5% treatment difference from placebo); however, in all cases, clinically meaningful mean weight loss was achieved. Although Asian patients lost less weight on average than patients of other races (−7.3% more than placebo), Asian patients were more likely to be in the lowest BMI category (< 30 kg m − 2), which is known to be associated with less weight loss, as discussed below. Clinically meaningful weight loss was evident in the semaglutide group within a broad range of baseline categories for glycemia and body anthropometrics. Interestingly, at 2 years, a significant proportion of the semaglutide-treated group fell below the sex- and race-specific WC cutoff points, especially in those with BMI < 35 kg m − 2, and a notable proportion (12.0%) fell below the BMI cutoff point of 25 kg m − 2, which is deemed a healthy BMI in those without unintentional weight loss. As more robust weight loss is possible with newer medications, achieving and maintaining these cutoff point targets may become important benchmarks for tracking responses.

### Weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment for patients with overweight or obesity [^112grkvF]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has some strengths, including an adequate sample size at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. In addition, the weight loss data of semaglutide use might be more representative of day-to-day clinical practice, including a more heterogenous patient population, compared with RCTs.

This study also has some limitations. Considering the observational nature of this study, we could not compare weight loss outcomes between patients receiving semaglutide and controls. The weight loss achieved may be associated with other interventions (eg, lifestyle interventions and diet) that are provided by the weight management clinic; however, we found that visits with a dietitian and a psychology group were not associated with greater weight loss. Another serious limitation is the exclusion of patients who did not reach 3 months of follow-up, which might have resulted in an overestimation of the association of semaglutide with body weight. In addition, we had mostly White female patients, which limits the generalizability of the study. Also, there is a possibility of recall bias because the dates of medication initiation and termination were reported by patients during patients' visits or communications with their physicians and therefore may not be exact. Moreover, some of the abstracted weights were self-reported, which might be not as accurate as clinic measurements (noncalibrated vs calibrated scales). Finally, using the EMR database might have increased susceptibility to coding errors and missing data during the data extraction phase. For example, any information (eg, on adverse effects) that was not reported by the patient or entered into the EMR portal by the health care professional could potentially be missed. In addition, some of the missing data may be associated with drug discontinuation for various reasons (eg, adverse effects, cost of the medication, lack of effectiveness, or patient's decision) that are hard to identify based on the retrospective nature of this study.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for obesity in adults [^111bdjc3]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Several patient-related factors can affect the amount of weight lost with each treatment. It is plausible that patients with a higher body weight at baseline experience a greater weight loss with treatment, as already reported in particular for MBS. Differences in mean baseline BMI of patients enrolled in trials with different OMMs should be considered in the interpretation of the results of the present NMA. To address this possibility, we performed a subgroup analysis of trials, which enrolled patients in different BMI classes. Notably, few data (only with semaglutide) were available for patients with BMI over 40 kg m − 2, and none could be retrieved for those with BMI 27–30 kg m − 2. The large majority of data were collected in patients with a BMI between 35.0 kg m − 2 and 39.9 kg m − 2; in this category, differences in TBWL were similar to those observed in the whole sample. However, due to the paucity of data, observed differences in efficacy cannot be generalized to patients affected by overweight (that is, with BMI 27–30 kg m − 2) or to those with a BMI ≥ 40 kg m − 2.

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: moving towards efficacy improvement [^115AY6sU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

In the STEP program, semaglutide was widely studied in various scenarios in the population with obesity. The program included several phase-3 trials evaluating the efficacy of subcutaneous weekly injections of semaglutide 2.4 mg for treating patients with obesity.

Common elements of the STEP 1–4 trials were the duration of 68 weeks and the 16-week-long regimen of dose escalation. The treatment was initiated with 0.25 mg semaglutide and was escalated every 4 weeks to the subsequent dosing levels of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 1.7 mg until reaching the target dose of 2.4 mg. Safety and tolerability were assessed up to week 75 (68 weeks on-treatment and 7 weeks off-treatment follow-up period).

STEP 1 was a phase-3a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial in 1,961 adults with obesity. The main objective of STEP 1 was to evaluate the weight-management effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus a placebo combined with lifestyle interventions such as counseling, 500 kcal reduced daily energy intake and increased energy expenditure (150 min/week physical activity). Factors such as a ≥ 10% or ≥ 15% reduction in body weight, changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning scores were also evaluated as secondary endpoints. In that study, patients (n = 1,306) with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) or who were overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2, with one or more weight-related comorbidities) received either semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, in addition to lifestyle changes, for 68 weeks. A total of 94.3% of the participants completed the trial. At the end of the trial, the mean percentage of body weight lost was 14.9% with semaglutide versus 2.4% with placebo (p < 0.001). The mean change in body weight (kg) is illustrated in Fig. 2. Investigators evaluated the body composition changes of a subgroup of the STEP 1 trial. The overall weight loss in the subgroup was 17.4 kg in the semaglutide group, with 10.4 kg of fat mass (60%) and 6.92 kg of fat-free mass (40%); there was an increase in the proportion of lean mass (+ 3.04% in absolute numbers). More studies are warranted to evaluate whether specific lifestyle changes could reduce the loss of lean mass with semaglutide. The secondary endpoints of the study, cardiometabolic risk factors such as waist circumference, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin levels, and lipid levels, baseline C-reactive protein, and the proportion of participants with normoglycemia, were significantly improved in the semaglutide group compared with the placebo group. The magnitude of these improvements is presumed to be proportional to weight loss. Regarding safety, both groups reported a similar number of adverse events (89.7% in the semaglutide group and 86.4% in the placebo group). Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common and were more frequent in the semaglutide group (74.2% vs. 47.9%). Serious events (also mainly gastrointestinal disorders) were reported in 9.8% and 6.4% of the cases and led to discontinuation of the trial in 7.0% of the cases in the semaglutide group vs. 3.1% in the placebo group.

### Proteomic changes upon treatment with semaglutide in individuals with obesity [^116h4JcB]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes are prevalent chronic diseases effectively managed by semaglutide. Here we studied the effects of semaglutide on the circulating proteome using baseline and end-of-treatment serum samples from two phase 3 trials in participants with overweight or obesity, with or without diabetes: STEP 1 (n = 1,311) and STEP 2 (n = 645). We identified evidence supporting broad effects of semaglutide, implicating processes related to body weight regulation, glycemic control, lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways. Several proteins were regulated with semaglutide, after accounting for changes in body weight and HbA 1c at end of trial, suggesting effects of semaglutide on the proteome beyond weight loss and glucose lowering. A comparison of semaglutide with real-world proteomic profiles revealed potential benefits on disease-specific proteomic signatures including the downregulation of specific proteins associated with cardiovascular disease risk, supporting its reported effects of lowering cardiovascular disease risk and potential drug repurposing opportunities. This study showcases the potential of proteomics data gathered from randomized trials for providing insights into disease mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities. These data also highlight the unmet need for, and importance of, examining proteomic changes in response to weight loss pharmacotherapy in future trials.

### The ethics of ozempic and wegovy [^113upS48]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, sold under the brand names of Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy, is one of the most popular drugs on the market. Manufactured by Novo Nordisk, semaglutide is the newest in a family of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists used most commonly to treat type II diabetes. To date, the results of semaglutide for the treatment of type II diabetes have been overwhelmingly positive. It is for the drug's effects on appetite suppression and weight loss, however, that have led its surge in popularity, with many hailing semaglutide as the new 'miracle drug for weight loss'. Despite its popularity, both the governmental and popular reception to the drug has largely been mixed. In this paper, we address a range of ethical concerns and argue that while many are legitimate, they do not provide conclusive reason not to prescribe semaglutide for weight loss.

5 WHAT IS A CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL WEIGHT LOSS TO IMPROVE OBESITY COMPLICATIONS?

Despite the recognition of obesity as a disease and existing clinical practice guidelines, there is a large unmet need for a patient‐centred, evidence‐based obesity treatment from both primary care providers, endocrinologists and other specialists. There are still several obstacles to translate current knowledge about the causes of obesity and modern treatment options for people living with obesity. Such barriers to initiating obesity treatment in primary care include a perceived lack of time during office visits, the fact that obesity treatment is not prioritised over other health concerns, and the stigma that patients with obesity are not sufficiently motivated to lose weight or uncomfortable discussing their weight. In addition, the lack of training provided by most medical schools, but also in postgraduate programmes and for other healthcare professionals frequently leads to insufficient skills to initiate and support obesity management.,

After overcoming these barriers in obesity treatment, the question remains, what are realistic and meaningful weight loss targets. In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defined a weight loss of ≥ 5% as a reasonable marker to evaluate the efficacy of anti‐obesity medications. This 'efficacy target' is mainly derived from clinical trial data providing evidence that 5% and more weight loss provides sufficient health benefits. Therefore, many practice guidelines for the management of obesity adopted the ≥ 5% weight loss target. However, the most recent recommendations for the standard of care by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) note that a sustained loss of > 10% of body weight usually confers greater benefits, including disease‐modifying effects and possible remission of type 2 diabetes, and may improve long‐term cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.

This statement is in line with the notion that there is a continuum of clinically meaningful weight loss, which varies among individuals and depends on specific obesity subtypes, severity of disease, complications and others. The recommendation from the ADA is based on semaglutide and tirzepatide trials in people with type 2 diabetes demonstrating that > 10% is realistic and may lead to greater health benefits compared to lower weight loss targets. Whereas a sustained weight loss of as little as 2–5% has shown significant benefits in cardiovascular risk factors, for many obesity‐related complications, clinically relevant improvements require greater weight loss (Figure 3).

Obesity management should reinforce the concept that clinically meaningful weight loss cannot be based on weight loss alone and requires a patient‐individualised approach focusing on additional improvements in quality of life, health outcomes, and reducing complications.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^117DDcMb]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

GLP-1 therapy efficacy magnitude and durability summarize trial and real-world effects and temporal patterns. In the original phase 3 randomized trials for obesity, average weight reduction compared to placebo has ranged from 5.3% to 17.8% after 56–72 weeks. In real-world practice, the efficacy for weight reduction is often lower: for example, about 8% for individuals with diabetes and 11% for individuals without diabetes at 60 weeks with semaglutide 2.4 mg/day. Generally, weight reduction is more rapid during the first 6 months and then slower thereafter, with relative plateauing at 18 months. When GLP-1 use is continued, weight reduction is sustained for at least 4 years, whereas when GLP-1s are stopped, weight regain is common — typically nearly to baseline within one year.

Semaglutide STEP 5 — two-year study in patients with obesity or overweight with at least one obesity-related complication without diabetes mellitus — assessed durability for 2 years and found that semaglutide 2.4 mg SQ per week significantly reduced body weight from baseline to week 104 compared to placebo (15.2% vs. 2.6%; estimated treatment difference: 12.6%).

### Real-world titration, persistence&weight loss of semaglutide and tirzepatide in an academic obesity clinic [^114fKRJw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding effectiveness, previous real‐world studies, often limited by size or follow‐up duration, reported 6‐month weight loss ranging from 11% to 13% for semaglutide or tirzepatide. Our cohort achieved a median weight loss of 9.4% at 6 months and, importantly, 14.4% at 12 months among persistent users, approaching the results observed in the STEP and SURMOUNT trials. Intriguingly, the impact of dose on degree of weight loss seems minimal. While greater weight loss was noted at 9 months, the difference was clinically insignificant. This finding should be interpreted cautiously, particularly given data missingness at later time points, and may reflect confounding factors (e.g. patients achieving sufficient response at lower doses) rather than a true lack of dose–response in practice. Data on weight after medication discontinuation suggested minimal regain at 3 and 6 months, but these findings are limited by very high rates of missing data (> 65%). The high rate of missingness may reflect patients discontinuing weight loss treatment and follow‐up visits due to perceived lack of effectiveness, achievement of personal weight loss goals, or external factors such as relocation or insurance changes related to employment transitions. Furthermore, emergency room visits and hospitalizations potentially related to these medications were infrequent, with gastrointestinal issues being the most common reason, consistent with the known side‐effect profile.

Despite this study taking place in a resource‐rich, specialized multidisciplinary obesity clinic, a significant proportion of patients did not follow the recommended titration defined in the package inserts for semaglutide and tirzepatide. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, reasons for patients not following the recommended titration could not be directly determined. Although patients were cared for by obesity medicine specialists with knowledge of the required titration and supported by pharmacists who assist with ensuring appropriate titration, this poor adherence could reflect systems‐level issues that fail to ensure titration adherence due to the frequency of required dose adjustments. Other factors could explain this finding, including medication supply issues, intolerance of higher doses, or patients desiring to continue at a dose perceived to be effective. Future studies should explore reasons for deviations from the recommended titrations.

### Once-weekly semaglutide versus placebo in adults with increased fracture risk: a randomised, double-blinded, two-centre, phase 2 trial [^115hooaw]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, the safety profile for semaglutide in this study was consistent with earlier findings in patients with T2D. As expected, transient gastrointestinal effects accounted for the most treatment-emergent adverse reactions. While all participants completed the trial, the dose of the investigational drug was reduced in 28% of the participants in the semaglutide group due to adverse reactions. Importantly, this study does not inform of the mechanism behind skeletal changes with semaglutide. Although the observed 17.3% increase in P-PINP from baseline to week 52 in the semaglutide group compared with the placebo group exceeded the anticipated 16% increase in this marker of bone formation, the confidence interval included zero making an effect of semaglutide on P-PINP unlikely. The effects on bone resorption and aBMD are likely explained by changes in body weight or in combination with direct skeletal effects of semaglutide. The absence of comparable weight loss in the placebo group limits interpretations of a potential direct effect of semaglutide on bone. Notably, exercise may mitigate weight loss-induced bone loss, and increased physical activity due to weight loss in this study could have protected against negative effects on the skeletal outcomes. Furthermore, changes in intake of macronutrients may also have contributed to the observed effects. Neither degree of physical activity nor dietary changes were accounted for in this study. Bone loss continued after stabilisation of body weight following calorie restricted-induced weight loss in non-obese men and women. With semaglutide, body weight is reported to stabilise after 52–104 weeks of treatment, limiting our opportunity to assess skeletal adaptions overshoots after stabilisation of body weight. Additionally, the design of this study deterred us from assessing if bone mass increased after cessation of semaglutide. Finally, the study was conducted at two sites and included a relatively small cohort with limited ethnic diversity which may limit the generalisability of our findings.

In conclusion, this study showed that semaglutide did not increase bone formation based on measures of PINP in adult men and women with increased fracture risk without T2D. Therefore, this study does not support further studies of osteoanabolic effects of semaglutide in individuals without T2D. Secondary outcomes showed increased bone resorption and bone loss, particularly in the cortical bone, which may represent skeletal adaptations to lower mechanical loading following weight reduction, direct effect of semaglutide on bone or a combination.

### Semaglutide-properties, action and chromatographic analysis [^116a38in]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide is associated with a risk of hypoglycaemia, however, due to the glucose-dependent mode-of-action of semaglutide, the risk is relatively small compared to other diabetes treatments. Hypoglycemia was seen most often in patients taking concomitant other drugs especially sulfonylureas. Chen et al. concluded on the basis of a meta-analysis that the combination treatment of semaglutide and basal insulin demonstrates significant improvements in glycemic control and reduction in body weight, without an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.

Rarely other unexpected effects of semaglutide are reported, including acute cholecystitis, paralysis of the abducens nerve, and positional vertigo.

Body weight is related to insulin resistance and glycaemic control in type 2 Diabetes mellitus. Patients with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese face increased risk of complications, including circulatory system diseases, liver diseases, and kidney diseases. Semaglutide a GLP-1 receptor agonist is effective in promoting both weight loss and lowering blood glucose in the treatment of people with type 2 Diabetes. However, individuals with type 2 diabetes tend to lose less weight than those without diabetes. The reasons for this difference are not fully understood, but it is generally believed that the blood glucose-lowering effect of semaglutide, leading to reduced urinary glucose loss, may result in relative energy retention, which may reduce weight loss. Additionally, the concomitant use of semaglutide with other type 2 diabetes medications, such as insulin or sulfonylureas, which promote weight gain may also reduce the weight loss effect. Reduced weight loss in people with diabetes may also be explained by pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, as well as alterations in metabolic rate and energy expenditure often seen in type 2 Diabetes. However, there is still a need to explain why weight loss achieved with semaglutide treatment in people with type 2 Diabetes and obesity or overweight is usually lower than in people without type 2 diabetes. The exact role of semaglutide in the treatment of obesity should be determined in future studies including those with a large number of participants and a long follow-up period.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^115aKutV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as key agents for weight management, based on their marked efficacy as observed in randomized controlled trials. While still limited, real-world studies on GLP-1RA use in populations with obesity are increasingly available. This narrative review discusses contemporary real-world evidence demonstrating the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of the currently approved GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies, that is, liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide. The observed weight reduction in clinical practice overall tends to be lower than in randomized controlled trials; however, outcomes approach those seen in trials when focusing on highly adherent patients. Real-world studies demonstrate high discontinuation rates of GLP-1RAs (20%-50%) within the first year, and the use of much lower doses than those evaluated in clinical trials. Evidence from observational studies within type 2 diabetes or obesity populations suggests frequent gastrointestinal disturbances in GLP-1RA users, as also observed in trials, but no clear increase in risks of severe events like pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, thyroid disorders, or depression and self-harm. Further evidence is needed to understand possible real-world associations of GLP-1RAs with eye disease and other rare outcomes. We provide 10 areas of particular importance for further research on GLP-1RA within the real-world space, including improved understanding of the exact drivers of early discontinuation and suboptimal dosing, studies of the effects of stopping GLP-1RA treatment, and investigations of clinical and cost-effectiveness for hard clinical outcomes in real-world settings, including not only cardio-reno-metabolic outcomes but also obesity-induced diseases like neuropsychiatric disease, cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and infections. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Recent advancements in weight-loss medications have sparked a lot of interest. The so-called GLP-1 receptor agonist medications (GLP-1RAs) have gained a lot of attention, because they have shown to be very effective, leading to significant weight loss in patients participating in clinical trials. GLP-1RAs, like liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, help manage weight by mimicking hormones that control blood sugar and appetite. However, how these medications perform in real life can be different from the controlled settings of clinical trials, in which patients are carefully selected and their treatment plans closely followed. This literature review looks at how these medications are used and their effectiveness and safety in real-world settings. In real-life practice, GLP-1RAs are often less effective than in clinical trial conditions. This is usually because patients don't follow their medication plans as strictly as in trials. Real-world data shows that many patients use lower doses and do not stick to their treatment as strictly as participants in a controlled trial might, leading to less weight loss. However, those who do follow their plans closely can achieve results similar to those in trials. A major issue with GLP-1RAs is that many patients stop using them within the first year due to side effects or high costs of the medications, especially if not covered by insurance. Common side effects include nausea and digestive problems, which are the main reasons patients stop taking these treatments. These side effects are often manageable and decrease over time, and this reviews found no strong real-world evidence that GLP-1RAs cause severe side effects in many users. Despite these challenges, when GLP-1RAs are used effectively and consistently, they show substantial benefits in weight loss, most so the newest medications semaglutide and tirzepatide. These medications are also likely to help manage and prevent weight-related health conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but evidence for these beneficial outcomes is still scarce in real-world settings. The review emphasizes the need for more research to understand why many patients stop using these medications and how to improve dosing. It also calls for studies on the long-term effects of these therapies on various health outcomes, including mental health, cardiometabolic health, cancer, and rare conditions like eye diseases. Overall, while GLP-1RAs are a valuable tool for weight management, their real-world use requires careful consideration of individual patient factors, such as the ability to stick to treatment plans, manage side effects, and afford the medications. Further research will help make these treatments more effective for a wider range of people that need them.

Anti-obesity medication use — Patients have an average of approximately 5–20% weight reduction with variable responses; for many agents, if no clinical improvement of at least 3–5% loss of baseline body weight occurs after 12–16 weeks, labeling may recommend increasing the dose or possibly discontinuing therapy, whereas some agents such as semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly injection do not have explicit stopping instructions; if weight regain indicates loss of effectiveness the medication should be discontinued, while a plateau after clinically meaningful loss should not necessarily be interpreted as tolerance and should not automatically warrant that the medication "be discontinued".

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^115CF5qv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, many real‐world studies suggested smaller weight loss (in kg or %) than what has been observed in the RCTs (i.e. up to 6% with liraglutide, 14% with semaglutide and 18% with tirzepatide vs. placebo). Estimated weight loss was highly variable between studies; however, even within the same GLP‐1RA, this was related to differences in user characteristics such as the proportion with T2D and previous use or not of GLP‐1RA at baseline, differences in dosages of the drug, comprehensiveness of the weight management programme, follow‐up time and weight measure used (e.g. self‐reported or other measurements of body weight). The percentage weight reduction over typically 6–12 months of follow‐up thus ranged from 2.2% to 18.5% for liraglutide,4.4% to 19.5% for semaglutide, and 4.8% to 21.2% for tirzepatide. Importantly, the weight‐loss effectiveness of GLP‐1RA was similar to what has been observed in trials when focusing on the subgroup of adherent patients who consistently took their prescribed GLP‐1RA, for example, at 12 months follow‐up, whereas studies reporting results in an 'as‐started' approach found considerably lower effectiveness. Semaglutide and tirzepatide initiators appeared to achieve the greatest weight loss in real life, and weight loss effects were weaker for patients with T2D than for obese people without diabetes, which was also observed in trials. Only two studies of tirzepatide for T2D were identified, and they reported lower weight loss results than in the trials. Both studies included many individuals switching to tirzepatide from other GLP‐1RAs, that is, individuals generally not included in the SURPASS and SURMOUNT‐1 trials, with those switching from semaglutide seemingly experiencing further weight loss on tirzepatide treatment.

### Glucagon-like peptide agonists: a prospective review [^114EHKNG]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Liraglutide

Liraglutide and semaglutide are both long‐acting GLP‐1RAs that have pharmacodynamic effects 24 h a day. They have around 93% sequence similarity with slight sequential and structural variances; therefore, they act similarly (Figure 4). Although their administration intervals and doses may vary, both are well‐tolerated and effective for weight loss. A systematic review of 18 studies reported that liraglutide and semaglutide therapies led to a weight loss of 48.2%–88.7% among obese and overweight adults without diabetes, where overall clinically acceptable change was set to be greater than 5%. Furthermore, a phase 2 trial found that once‐daily administration of subcutaneous semaglutide 0.4 mg dose (equivalent to 2.8 mg once weekly) significantly increased weight loss compared to the liraglutide 3.0 mg dose. Another randomized clinical trial compared the efficacy and adverse effects profiles of once‐weekly subcutaneously administered semaglutide, 2.4 mg, versus once‐daily liraglutide, more than 1.8 mg. The study backed the previous findings that both medications were significantly associated with weight loss. However, semaglutide induced greater weight loss and had fewer permanent treatment discontinuations due to adverse events.

In contrast, another study testing the weight‐loss effects of semaglutide presented those 85 patients (48.6%) reported experiencing adverse effects associated with gastrointestinal symptoms being the most commonly reported ones. Based on data from 10 studies involving liraglutide and semaglutide, both GLP‐1 receptor agonists demonstrated a generally favourable safety profile in real‐world practice. The discontinuation rates due to adverse events were relatively low, with liraglutide 3.0 mg once‐daily groups ranging from 5.4% to 11.4% and semaglutide 2.4 mg per week groups ranging from 2.4% to 7.0%. The overall incidence of adverse events was higher in the liraglutide and semaglutide groups (ranging from 66.5% to 96.7% and 81.3% to 95.8%, respectively) than in the control groups. However, it is important to note that serious adverse events were infrequently reported, ranging from 0% to 7.5% in liraglutide groups and 7.7% to 9.8% in semaglutide groups, with most being mild to moderate in severity.

Semaglutide — adult approval, pediatric trial outcomes, dosing, and contraindications: Semaglutide is FDA approved for obesity in patients ≥ 18 years of age with a BMI greater than 30 or a BMI greater than 27 with at least one obesity-driven disease and is not currently FDA approved for children. In adolescents, the reported mean change in BMI from baseline to week 68 with semaglutide alone was −16.0%, with 62% achieving at least 10% body weight loss and 37% achieving at least 20%; in adults, weight loss above placebo was 12.4% (confidence interval 11.5–13.4%). Semaglutide is given as a once weekly injection, and contraindications include a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2).

### Weight regain and cardiometabolic effects after withdrawal of semaglutide: the STEP 1 trial extension [^11195j2k]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In STEP 1, 68 weeks of treatment with once‐weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg plus lifestyle intervention provided significant, clinically relevant reductions in body weight versus placebo among adults with overweight/obesity. After withdrawal of semaglutide and structured lifestyle intervention, participants regained a mean of two‐thirds of their prior weight loss in the 1‐year off‐treatment extension phase; weight regain continued until the end of follow‐up (week 120). However, some treatment effects were sustained and weight remained 5.6% below baseline in the semaglutide arm. Almost half of the participants in the semaglutide arm (48.2%) still had clinically meaningful weight loss of 5% or more from baseline at week 120, although this proportion represented a substantial fall from that originally achieved at the end of 68 weeks of treatment (86.4%). Subgroup analyses suggested that participants in the semaglutide arm with greater weight loss during the 68‐week treatment period tended to have greater regain in body weight after semaglutide withdrawal, but ultimately retained greater weight loss at week 120 versus subgroups who lost less weight during the 68‐week treatment period.

Weight regain has previously been observed following withdrawal of obesity pharmacotherapies, including orlistat and lorcaserin — and also semaglutide, as shown in STEP 4 — despite continued lifestyle intervention. Taken together, these findings and those of the present study confirm the chronicity of obesity and highlight the importance of maintaining long‐term pharmacological treatment for weight management in people with obesity.

In the STEP 1 extension, weight regain was comparatively rapid following semaglutide withdrawal compared with that seen in other obesity pharmacotherapy withdrawal trials, including after semaglutide withdrawal in STEP 4. This may well relate to participants who received semaglutide in STEP 1 having achieved greater weight loss prior to withdrawal than in other trials, and thus having greater potential for regain, driven by physiological and behavioural factors. Accordingly, the steepest trajectory of weight regain after withdrawal was observed in participants who had lost 20% or more of baseline body weight during treatment. Furthermore, the absence of structured lifestyle intervention following semaglutide withdrawal contrasts with the continuation of lifestyle intervention in other withdrawal trials (including in STEP 4), and may also have contributed to the trajectory of weight regain.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Section 4.1 — rationale and eligibility for NuSH therapies — states that NuSH therapies are a crucial component of comprehensive obesity care for three reasons: they fill the treatment gap between lifestyle therapy and bariatric surgery, they help address disease mechanisms by targeting hormonal pathways that control appetite, and because they are titratable they allow dosing to minimize side effects and maximize weight loss. Eligibility for NuSH therapies may be determined by BMI thresholds, and the BMI used to establish eligibility may be the patient's nonpregnant lifetime high. The document further notes that whereas prior guidelines suggested a trial of lifestyle intervention prior to pharmacotherapy, data from phase 3 trials evaluating semaglutide and tirzepatide show minimal additional weight loss when combined with intensive behavioral therapy/lifestyle intervention, and it states that Patients should not be required to "try and fail" lifestyle.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg for the management of overweight or obesity in Asian populations: a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomised trials [^111c8nWC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The rising prevalence of overweight and obesity among Asian populations poses a critical public health concern. Semaglutide 2.4mg, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated promising weight-reduction effects in global populations, but its efficacy and safety profile in Asians remain less comprehensively examined. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of semaglutide 2.4mg compared to placebo in Asian individuals with overweight or obesity.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline, ScienceDirect, Europe pubMed central (PMC) and the Cochrane Library up to 15 June 2025. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing semaglutide 2.4mg with placebo in overweight or obese Asian individuals. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias v2 tool. Pooled outcomes were analysed using random-effects models to estimate mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I 2 statistic.

Results

Five RCTs involving 2614 participants met the inclusion criteria. All trials were deemed to have a low risk of bias. Our meta-analysis indicated that treatment with semaglutide 2.4mg resulted in significantly greater reductions in body weight (MD: -8.20%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -10.06 to -6.35; I² = 84%), waist circumference (MD: -6.47cm; 95% CI: -8.26 to -4.68; I² = 84%), body mass index (MD: -3.22kg/m 2; 95% CI: -4.01 to -2.44; I² = 66%) and systolic blood pressure (MD: -3.46mmHg; 95% CI: -5.29 to -1.62; I² = 28%) compared to placebo. A higher proportion of participants in semaglutide 2.4mg achieved weight loss exceeding 5%, 10% and 15%. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most commonly reported adverse effects, generally mild to moderate and self-limiting.

Conclusions

Semaglutide 2.4mg significantly improves weight-related and cardiometabolic outcomes in Asian adults with overweight or obesity. Further studies are warranted to assess long-term effects, real-world applicability and variability across subpopulations.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^115p9CyA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Alternative dosing of semaglutide

Though dose sizes vary between patients, both semaglutide and tirzepatide are typically administered once per week (q1wk). Indeed, once‐weekly is the dosing frequency studied in clinical trials, and phase 2 trials did not test dosing intervals longer than 1 week. We now use the mathematical models to investigate the weight loss efficacy of alternative dosing regimens.

Semaglutide is commercially available in maintenance doses of 2.4 mg (recommended) and 1.7 mg, with 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg available as escalation doses. Figure 2 predicts the efficacy of 1.7 or 2.4 mg of semaglutide administered less frequently than once‐weekly. In Figure 2A, we plot the steady‐state percent change in body weight as a function of the dosing interval (time between doses). The most salient feature of Figure 2A is that increasing the dosing interval (i.e. decreasing the dosing frequency) does not commensurately decrease the weight loss efficacy of semaglutide. For instance, for a once‐weekly (q1wk) dose of 2.4 mg, the model predicts a steady‐state body weight reduction of 17%, which is in good agreement with clinical data for q1wk dosing. If the dose is fixed at 2.4 mg but the dosing interval is increased to 14 days (q2wk), the model predicts a steady‐state body weight reduction of 12%. Therefore, despite the fact that decreasing the dosing frequency from q1wk to q2wk decreases the total amount of drug taken over time by one half, the model predicts that patients retain 72% of their weight loss compared with q1wk. Similarly, 1.7 mg q2wk retains 69% of the weight loss of 1.7 mg q1wk. Furthermore, the model predicts that nearly 50% of weight loss is retained when comparing once‐weekly to only once‐monthly dosing (i.e. comparing a 7 versus 28‐day dosing interval in Figure 2A), though clinical validation is especially warranted for this prediction.

### Semaglutide (Wegovy) [^111yGNWx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

✱ p < 0.0001 (unadjusted 2-sided) for superiority.

A reduction in body weight was observed with WEGOVY irrespective of age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI at baseline, body weight (kg) at baseline, and level of renal function impairment.

The cumulative frequency distributions of change in body weight are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 for Studies 2 and 3. One way to interpret this figure is to select a change in body weight of interest on the horizontal axis and note the corresponding proportions of patients (vertical axis) in each treatment group who achieved at least that degree of weight loss. For example, note that the vertical line arising from ‑10% in Study 2 intersects the WEGOVY and placebo curves at approximately 66%, and 12%, respectively, which correspond to the values shown in Table 6.

### Superior weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide versus other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is independent of gastrointestinal adverse events [^116NxwmE]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Given the clinical significance of weight loss in T2D management, it is important to understand the mechanism by which semaglutide provides greater weight loss versus class comparators and, in particular, whether it is mediated by GI AEs. A previous mediation analysis examining superior weight loss with semaglutide versus mixed class comparators by GI AEs in the SUSTAIN 1–5 trials showed that only 0.07 kg of 2.3 kg (semaglutide 0.5 mg) and 0.5 kg of 6.3 kg (semaglutide 1.0 mg) of the treatment difference in weight loss was mediated by nausea/vomiting.

To further determine if GI AEs of nausea/vomiting and others are associated with weight loss, we performed a post hoc mediation analysis to examine the extent to which the treatment difference with semaglutide versus the other GLP-1RAs in the SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 trials might be driven by a difference in GI AEs (indirect effects) or treatment (direct effect). Data on nausea and/or vomiting were pooled and data on nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation and dyspepsia were analyzed individually.

### Superior weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide versus other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is independent of gastrointestinal adverse events [^111JHjqb]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Furthermore, in this analysis, there was no evidence of a temporal association between the incidence of GI AEs and weight loss at EOT. The prevalence of GI AEs with GLP-1RA treatment was previously found to peak within the initial 12 weeks of treatment and decline thereafter. However, subjects in all treatment arms experienced weight loss between baseline and week 12, and from baseline to EOT (SUSTAIN 3, week 56; SUSTAIN 7, week 40; SUSTAIN 10, week 30).

Excess weight is an important contributing factor in the complex etiology of T2D, and BW control is an important factor in the individualized management of T2D.GLP-1RAs are established and effective therapies for T2D and can be prescribed at all stages of T2D. In addition to managing glucose levels, GLP-1RAs also reduce BW, and this potential for weight loss has been reflected by the GLP-1RA liraglutide (3.0 mg once daily) gaining approval as a treatment for obesity. Because GI AEs including nausea, vomiting or diarrhea are the most common type of AE with GLP-1RAs, it is important to establish whether the weight loss difference between treatment is mediated through the occurrence of GI AEs.

### Effects of once-weekly semaglutide on appetite, energy intake, control of eating, food preference and body weight in subjects with obesity [^117JEQ5y]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This trial investigated the mechanism of body weight loss with semaglutide in subjects with obesity. The results suggest that the significantly lower energy intake provides a plausible mechanism to explain the decrease in body weight associated with semaglutide treatment. Not only was energy intake during ad libitum lunch (primary endpoint) substantially lower with semaglutide vs placebo (approximately −35%), the same pattern also held true for subsequent ad libitum evening meal and evening snack box, demonstrating no compensatory effect due to a reduced lunch intake earlier in the day. Total ad libitum energy intake across all meals on the test day was reduced by 24%. A reduction in body weight of approximately 5.0 kg over 12 weeks was observed with semaglutide, consistent with previous findings. 19 Energy expenditure appeared to be lower with semaglutide vs placebo, though not statistically significant after correcting for lean body mass, suggesting that semaglutide‐associated weight loss was not attributable to increased energy expenditure.

Given recent findings regarding the association between energy intake and changes in weight, 34, 35 it is not possible to ascertain to what degree reductions in energy intake led to the 5.0 kg loss of body weight. Since RMR did not increase with semaglutide, it can be inferred that the whole of the body weight loss was most likely caused by a reduction in energy intake. However, RMR represents only one dimension of energy expenditure and the impact of semaglutide on the thermogenic effect or physical activity is unknown.

It should be noted that the reduction in energy intake was observed during/after body weight loss, despite known counter‐regulatory effects during a period with an energy deficit. 36 In terms of body composition, a three‐fold greater reduction in body fat vs lean body mass was observed with semaglutide, indicating no unintentional excess loss of lean body mass.

### Effectiveness of semaglutide versus liraglutide for treating post-metabolic and bariatric surgery weight recurrence [^116b8ZdE]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

A strength of this study is that these real-world data reflect weight-loss outcomes achieved under circumstances of everyday clinical care in a population seeking treatment for post-MBS weight recurrence. In addition, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to report on the effectiveness of semaglutide for treating post-MBS weight recurrence. It also compares weight loss between the obesity-treatment dose of liraglutide (3.0 mg daily) and the lower diabetes-treatment dose semaglutide (1 mg weekly) in this population. Our analysis of treatments reflects the real-world restrictions in availability and use of medications for weight management. Our data set includes representation across the three most performed MBS procedures with a meaningful duration of follow-up.

Limitations include the retrospective collection of data, which does not allow for assessment of medication adherence, titration schedule, side effects, and reasons for discontinuation. Many patients were treated with other AOMs, and we are unable to assess the efficacy of individual agent-specific doses. However, there were no significant differences in non-GLP-1RA AOMs between groups. Our definition of weight loss at 12 months includes the maximum weight loss at any time (3, 6, 9, or 12 mo) from baseline, which could lead to an overestimation of long-term weight loss by not accounting for weight recurrence on AOM therapy. Although our Supporting Information tables show that there were no differences between the semaglutide and liraglutide groups in the number of non-GLP-1RA AOMs used (Supporting Information Table S1) or specific non-GLP-1RA AOMs used (Supporting Information Table S2), we cannot report on whether these AOMs were used concomitantly or sequentially. Although the patient cohort was diverse in race/ethnicity, which is a strength of this study, these results may not be generalizable because patients received care in a specialized obesity medicine clinic and had insurance coverage or financial means sufficient to access GLP-1RA therapies. In spite of these limitations, this study provides promising evidence for the combination of MBS and AOM therapies for managing obesity as a chronic disease.

### FDA's concerns with unapproved GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss… [^116bmyfd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Compounding and the FDA: Questions and Answers Understanding unapproved versions of these drugs FDA is aware that some patients and health care professionals may look to unapproved versions of GLP-1 receptor agonists) drugs, including semaglutide and tirzepatide, as an option for weight loss. This can be risky for patients, as unapproved versions do not undergo FDA's review for safety, effectiveness and quality before they are marketed. Dosing concerns with compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide FDA received multiple reports of adverse events, some requiring hospitalization, that may be related to dosing errors associated with compounded injectable semaglutide products. These dosing errors resulted from patients measuring and self-administering incorrect doses of the drug, and in some cases, health care professionals miscalculating doses of the drug.

Additionally, the agency has received adverse event reports that may be related to patients prescribed compounded semaglutide or tirzepatide products in doses beyond what is in the FDA-approved drug label. This could mean using more product in a single dose, taking doses more frequently or increasing the amount more quickly. Some of the adverse events are serious and some patients reported seeking medical attention for their symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and constipation. Salt forms should not be used to compound semaglutide The agency is aware that some semaglutide products sold by compounders may be the salt forms. These salt forms, including semaglutide sodium and semaglutide acetate, are different active ingredients than are used in the approved drugs.

The agency does not have information on whether these salts have the same chemical and pharmacologic properties as the active ingredient in the approved drug, and we are not aware of any lawful basis for their use in compounding. As of July 31, 2025, the FDA has received:

- 605 reports of adverse events associated with compounded semaglutide.
- 545 reports of adverse events associated with compounded tirzepatide. It is not always possible to determine if the adverse event directly resulted from use of the drug or if other factors may have contributed to these adverse events.

### Effect of weekly semaglutide vs placebo on weight loss maintenance in adults with overweight or obesity… [^115oLYBo]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Gastrointestinal events were reported in 41. 9% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs
26. 1% with placebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events with continued semaglutide and placebo. Conclusions and Relevance Among adults with overweight or obesity who completed a 20-week run-in period with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2. 4 mg once weekly, maintaining treatment with semaglutide compared with switching to placebo resulted in continued weight loss over the following 48 weeks. Sustained weight loss of 5% to 15% is advised to improve many conditions associated with overweight/obesity, with adjunctive pharmacotherapy recommended to help achieve this goal. 5, 6 However, approved antiobesity medications have only moderate efficacy. 7–9 Short-term treatment fails to produce long-term health benefits, 5 while several agents also have safety concerns.

7–9 Well-tolerated new therapies that can produce substantial, sustained weight loss, when used long term, are therefore needed. 7, 10. Gastrointestinal tract disorders were reported most frequently and in greater proportions with continued semaglutide than placebo. Most gastrointestinal events were mild to moderate in severity, and the majority of participants recovered without treatment discontinuation. Serious adverse events were reported in 2. 3% of participants during the run-in period and in
7. 7% and 5. 6% receiving continued semaglutide and placebo, respectively. During the run-in, 5. 3% of participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events, most of which were gastrointestinal tract disorders. In the randomized period, 2. 4% and
2.

2% of participants receiving continued semaglutide and placebo, respectively, discontinued treatment because of adverse events. One death was reported in each treatment group during the randomized period, each considered unrelated to study treatment. The death in the continued semaglutide group was attributed to natural causes with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on the death certificate; the death in the placebo group was due to metastatic lung cancer with pericardial effusion.

### Simplicity… [^113yiXDX]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis has been observed in patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists. Semaglutide should not be used in patients with a history of pancreatitis because it has not been studied in this population. 1 Although significant weight loss can increase the risk of cholelithiasis, the incidence in clinical trials was higher in patients taking semaglutide than in those taking placebo. 1 Clinically significant hypoglycemia has not been observed in patients without a history of diabetes. Concomitant use of semaglutide with insulin or insulin secretagogues may result in hypoglycemia, and a dose reduction in the concomitant medication may be necessary. Because semaglutide-induced thyroid C-cell tumors have been reported in rodent studies, semaglutide should not be used in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2.

1 Semaglutide may cause fetal harm and should be discontinued at least two months before a planned pregnancy. Semaglutide is not approved for use in patients younger than 18 years. The effect of semaglutide on breastfed infants is unknown.

1. Tolerability Effectiveness The effectiveness of semaglutide to induce weight loss has been evaluated in three studies that included 3, 079 adults with obesity and 300 who were overweight. Participants had at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as dyslipidemia or hypertension, and this included 807 patients who had type 2 diabetes.
16. 4% with placebo) lost at least 10%; and
42. 1% lost at least 15%. Sustained weight loss has been demonstrated with up to 68 weeks of treatment with semaglutide. Based on a single study of treatment discontinuation after short-term therapy, patients are likely to regain some weight.

Bottom Line Semaglutide may result in more weight loss than other currently available treatments, but many patients will experience gastrointestinal effects and may regain a portion of the weight lost if the medication is discontinued. Some patients may not want to use an injectable medication. Semaglutide is significantly more expensive than other available weight-loss medications and may not be covered by health insurance.
