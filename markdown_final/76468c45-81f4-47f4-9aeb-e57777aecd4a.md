## Question

Minimum mean arterial pressure to preserve kidney

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the minimum mean arterial pressure (MAP) needed to preserve kidney function across settings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiologic principle of renal autoregulation and how it shifts in disease. Then, I should verify the universal baseline MAP target supported by high-quality guidelines. Next, I will examine special populations where higher MAP is warranted, followed by perioperative and CRRT-specific thresholds. After that, I need to consider the role of venous and compartment pressures in defining effective perfusion pressure. Finally, I will integrate duration of hypotension, vasopressor strategy, and a practical bedside approach, while double-checking areas of controversy and correcting any misstatements as needed.

> Let me first confirm the physiologic foundation: the kidney autoregulates renal blood flow and glomerular filtration across a range of perfusion pressures, but this autoregulatory plateau can be right-shifted in chronic hypertension and lost in shock states, making organ flow pressure-dependent at higher thresholds; I should verify that this rightward shift is consistently described in both experimental and clinical literature before proceeding [^114Hxg5Z] [^111Kk58g] [^112rPmJS].

> Next, I should review the universal baseline target; the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends an initial MAP target of 65 mmHg for adults with septic shock requiring vasopressors, and this 65 mmHg threshold is echoed broadly in critical care guidance and perioperative consensus, so I will anchor on 65 mmHg as the default minimum for most patients while acknowledging that this is a population-level target rather than a personalized guarantee [^115JuLE8] [^116g5VPs] [^112HwgsM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check who benefits from higher MAPs, and the clearest signal is in patients with chronic hypertension, where a higher MAP target of about 80–85 mmHg reduced AKI and renal replacement therapy in the SEPSISPAM RCT subgroup and in meta-analytic subgroup analyses, likely reflecting a right-shifted autoregulatory curve; I should confirm that this benefit did not translate into a mortality difference, which it did not in pooled RCTs, and note the trade-off of more atrial fibrillation with higher MAP targets [^116M1KhU] [^111Yskyf] [^115JuLE8].

> I will now examine perioperative settings; observational data consistently associate intraoperative MAP below about 60–70 mmHg with AKI, with particularly strong risk signals below 55 mmHg even for brief durations, and the POQI consensus recommends maintaining MAP at or above 60 mmHg in at-risk surgical patients, so I should keep a lower bound of 60 mmHg in mind intraoperatively while recognizing that duration and depth both matter and that randomized trials testing higher MAP targets have not uniformly improved composite outcomes despite reducing hypotension exposure [^112HwgsM] [^112HwgsM] [^1142E8i2] [^114jWWrq].

> Wait, let me verify the CRRT-specific threshold; in patients starting continuous renal replacement therapy for AKI, cohort analyses identified a nonlinear association with mortality such that MAP below approximately 82–83 mmHg at initiation carried higher risk, suggesting that in this hemodynamically fragile subgroup, targeting MAP above this range may be prudent when feasible, though I should emphasize this is observational and not a universal mandate [^114gLzpj] [^115Lu4XT] [^1176SPSy].

> Next, I should review the concept of effective perfusion pressure; mean perfusion pressure (MPP = MAP − CVP) better approximates renal inflow-to-outflow pressure and low MPP correlates with AKI progression, so when CVP is high or compartment pressures are elevated, I need to ensure MAP targets are adjusted upward to preserve organ perfusion pressure; practically, if CVP is around 15 mmHg, a MAP of 65 mmHg yields an MPP near 50 mmHg, which may be inadequate, prompting consideration of higher MAP targets or efforts to reduce venous and compartment pressures [^115r99md] [^117NiwC1].

> I should double-check the duration dimension; harm from hypotension accrues with both severity and time, with even short episodes of MAP below 55 mmHg increasing AKI risk intraoperatively, and cumulative time below 65 mmHg associating with worse outcomes in septic shock, so continuous, time-weighted avoidance of hypotension is as important as the absolute nadir achieved [^112HwgsM] [^115RuyoR] [^112HwgsM].

> Let me consider vasopressor strategy and the risk of excessive catecholamines; norepinephrine is first-line to achieve MAP targets, and while raising MAP can improve renal perfusion in some, higher MAP targets often require more vasopressor and fluid, which can cause harm, so I should titrate to a MAP challenge: transiently increase MAP and observe urine output, lactate, and mentation; if there is no response, return to the lower target to avoid iatrogenic injury from excessive vasoconstriction and fluid overload [^115JuLE8] [^115RuyoR] [^1155RuyA].

> But wait, what if I overstated a fixed minimum; I initially implied 65 mmHg suffices for all, yet in complex spine surgery and some neurosurgical contexts, recommendations often cite MAP thresholds of 80–85 mmHg to mitigate spinal cord ischemia risk, and permissive hypotension strategies in trauma can transiently accept MAPs near 50 mmHg as a bridge to definitive hemorrhage control, so I should correct that and frame 65 mmHg as the default critical care target with context-specific exceptions rather than a universal floor [^115gsbo7] [^114MZqGq] [^111Ds6tg].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach: start with a MAP target of 65 mmHg for most critically ill adults, individualize upward to 80–85 mmHg for those with chronic hypertension or clear right-shifted autoregulation, consider higher targets around 80–85 mmHg when initiating CRRT or when venous/compartment pressures are elevated, maintain at least 60 mmHg intraoperatively in at-risk patients while minimizing time below 65 mmHg, and use a MAP challenge to test responsiveness before escalating vasopressors further; throughout, prioritize continuous, time-weighted blood pressure stability and reassess frequently as the patient's condition evolves [^115JuLE8] [^112HwgsM] [^114gLzpj] [^117NiwC1] [^1155RuyA].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise: there is no single universal minimum MAP that preserves kidney function in all contexts, but 65 mmHg is the evidence-based default for most adults with shock, with credible signals that 60 mmHg is too low in perioperative cohorts and that 80–85 mmHg may be necessary in chronic hypertension, CRRT initiation, and settings of elevated venous or compartment pressures; duration of hypotension matters, and a dynamic, individualized MAP challenge is the safest way to resolve uncertainty at the bedside [^115JuLE8] [^112rtb1N] [^111Yskyf] [^114gLzpj] [^117NiwC1].

---

The minimum MAP to preserve kidney function is **≥ 65 mmHg** for most critically ill adults, as this aligns with renal autoregulation and is supported by major guidelines [^115JuLE8] [^116g5VPs]. For patients with chronic hypertension or CKD, **70–80 mmHg** may be needed due to a right-shifted autoregulatory curve [^116M1KhU] [^111Yskyf]. In perioperative settings, **≥ 60 mmHg** is advised to reduce AKI risk, with higher targets if baseline MAP is elevated [^112HwgsM]. Individualize targets based on baseline MAP, comorbidities, and response to therapy, and avoid prolonged MAP < 60 mmHg to prevent AKI [^112HwgsM] [^1142E8i2].

---

## Physiological basis of renal autoregulation

Renal autoregulation maintains stable renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) across a range of perfusion pressures, primarily via the myogenic response and tubuloglomerular feedback [^114Hxg5Z]. In healthy adults, this autoregulatory range is **approximately 60–100 mmHg**. Below this range, RBF and GFR decline linearly with pressure, risking ischemic AKI.

---

## Evidence for minimum MAP thresholds

Several studies and guidelines provide evidence for minimum MAP thresholds to preserve kidney function:

| **Clinical setting** | **Recommended minimum map** | **Evidence level** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| General critically ill patients | ≥ 65 mmHg | High | - Supported by Surviving Sepsis Campaign and ESICM guidelines <br/> - Balances perfusion and vasopressor-related risks [^115JuLE8] [^116g5VPs] |
| Patients with chronic hypertension or CKD | 70–80 mmHg | Moderate | - Higher targets due to right-shifted autoregulation <br/> - Reduced AKI and RRT in RCTs and meta-analyses [^116M1KhU] [^111Yskyf] |
| Perioperative patients | ≥ 60 mmHg | Moderate | - POQI consensus recommends ≥ 60 mmHg in at-risk patients <br/> - Higher targets if baseline MAP is elevated [^112HwgsM] |
| Septic shock patients with chronic hypertension | 80–85 mmHg | Moderate | - SEPSISPAM trial showed reduced AKI and RRT in chronic hypertensive patients with higher MAP targets [^116M1KhU] [^111Yskyf] |

---

## Risks of inadequate MAP

Prolonged MAP below these thresholds increases **AKI risk**, RRT, and mortality [^1142E8i2]. Observational data show that even brief intraoperative MAP < 55 mmHg increases AKI risk, with risk rising as duration and severity increase [^112rtb1N]. Similarly, in critically ill patients, sustained MAP < 65 mmHg correlates with higher AKI incidence and mortality [^115RuyoR].

---

## Individualization of MAP targets

While general thresholds guide care, **individualization is essential**. Baseline MAP, comorbidities (e.g. chronic hypertension, CKD), and clinical context should inform targets. The MAP challenge — transiently increasing MAP and observing urine output, lactate, and mentation — helps identify patient-specific optimal targets [^1155RuyA].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

To maintain adequate MAP and preserve kidney function, clinicians should:

- **Monitor hemodynamics**: Use invasive arterial lines or validated noninvasive devices for accurate MAP [^113RZtqR].
- **Use vasopressors**: Norepinephrine is first-line to achieve MAP targets; vasopressin or angiotensin II may be added if needed [^116M1KhU] [^113FXjer].
- **Balance risks**: Higher MAP targets may require more vasopressors, increasing arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia; individualize to net benefit [^111mbMhq] [^115RuyoR].
- **Address underlying causes**: Treat hypovolemia, sepsis, and cardiac dysfunction to improve perfusion [^117NiwC1].

---

## Special considerations

- **Chronic hypertension**: Higher MAP targets (70–80 mmHg) may be needed due to right-shifted autoregulation [^116M1KhU] [^111Yskyf].
- **Elderly patients**: Permissive hypotension (MAP 60–65 mmHg) may be acceptable if tolerated, but monitor closely for AKI [^115JuLE8].
- **Perioperative patients**: Maintain MAP ≥ 60 mmHg; higher targets if baseline MAP is elevated or AKI risk is high [^112HwgsM].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **General critically ill patients**: Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^116g5VPs].
- **Chronic hypertension or CKD**: Consider MAP 70–80 mmHg [^116kQGYg] [^111Yskyf].
- **Perioperative patients**: Maintain MAP ≥ 60 mmHg; higher if baseline MAP is elevated [^112HwgsM].
- **Individualization**: Use baseline MAP, comorbidities, and clinical response to guide targets [^1155RuyA].

---

The minimum MAP to preserve kidney function is **≥ 65 mmHg** for most critically ill adults, with higher targets (70–80 mmHg) for chronic hypertension or CKD. Individualize targets and avoid prolonged MAP < 60 mmHg to reduce AKI risk [^112HwgsM].

### Blood pressure deficits in acute kidney injury: not all about the mean arterial pressure? [^115U8p9t]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although there are many causes of AKI, it is known that patients undergoing high-risk surgery are known to be at significant risk. Although much effort has centred on the minimum arterial pressure needed to maintain renal perfusion, this tends to be based on relatively crude measures such as the mean arterial pressure (MAP), which is widely used as an index for the optimal blood pressure. The rationale behind maintaining MAP is to provide adequate organ perfusion, although this is difficult to assess other than by applying crude end-points. Recent studies have examined the progression of AKI as defined by the KDIGO criteria in terms of time-weighted average values for premorbid and within-ICU haemodynamic pressure-related parameters. Although principally performed on patients who had undergone cardiovascular surgery and who were on vasopressor support, some interesting results were obtained suggesting that crude MAP may not be an adequate target in AKI. In patients with AKI progression, greater observed deficits in mean perfusion pressure, diastolic arterial perfusion, and diastolic perfusion pressures were observed. This study may highlight potential modifiable risk factors for the prevention of progression of AKI, and hopefully translate into improved outcomes.

### Blood pressure deficits in acute kidney injury: not all about the mean arterial pressure? [^116EaezH]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The kidneys account for less than 5% of our total body weight and yet receive about 25% of our cardiac output. It is of no surprise, therefore, that targeting adequate renal perfusion is considered a potential factor for modifying the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). The risk of AKI varies depending on aetiology, but it is well established that high-risk surgery, in particular cardiovascular surgery, is associated with an increased threat of AKI. Therefore, protective strategies may be instigated prior to, or during, insult in order to minimize this potentially devastating outcome.

The preservation or improvement of renal perfusion may be achieved through increasing cardiac output by fluid resuscitation, inotropic drugs, renal vasodilators, or systemic vasopressors that all "redirect" blood flow to the kidney. The optimal target mean arterial pressure (MAP) remains an area of debate, although several studies have examined this including a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) which randomized patients with septic shock to resuscitation with a MAP target of either 80–85 mmHg or 65–70 mmHg. This study found no difference in mortality or renal end-points such as the incidence of AKI stage 2 or the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). However, in patients with known chronic hypertension, a higher MAP resulted in both a lower incidence of AKI stage 2 and less RRT but, importantly, there was no effect on mortality. Lowering systolic pressure has been studied in isolation in patients with acute cerebral haemorrhage randomized to a systolic blood pressure target of 110–139 mmHg or 140–179 mmHg. The primary end-point (death or disability) was not different between groups, although the rate of serious renal adverse events was higher in the lower blood pressure target group. In terms of potential treatment, norepinephrine is the most commonly used vasopressor in patients with vasodilatory shock although vasopressin or the analogue terlipressin may have a role in norepinephrine refractory shock. Exogenous vasopressin has vasoconstrictive and anti-diuretic properties and may increase glomerular filtration by preferential post-glomerular vasoconstriction and hence may play a role.

### Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI) international consensus statement on perioperative arterial pressure management [^112HwgsM]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Consensus statements and recommendations

Consensus statement 1: Intraoperative mean arterial pressures < 60–70 mm Hg or systolic arterial pressures < 90–100 mm Hg are associated with acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, and death. Injury is a function of hypotension severity and duration (high-quality evidence).

Consensus recommendation 1: We recommend keeping intraoperative mean arterial pressure ≥ 60 mm Hg in at-risk patients (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Intraoperative hypotension remains vaguely defined. Consequently, definitions for intraoperative hypotension vary widely. The most commonly used definitions are a systolic arterial pressure < 90 mm Hg or a mean arterial pressure < 60 mm Hg. A 20% reduction from baseline systolic or mean arterial pressure is also frequently used, although it remains unclear how to best define baseline arterial pressure. Arterial pressure measured just before induction of anaesthesia does not reflect normal baseline arterial pressures. Even clinic arterial pressures can be inaccurate. The best assessment of baseline arterial pressure is preoperative ambulatory arterial pressure monitoring, although it is rarely available.

Recent observational research confirms previous studies, in showing that, on a population basis, intraoperative mean arterial pressures < 60–70 mm Hg or systolic arterial pressures < 90–100 mm Hg are associated with acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, and death. Injury is a function of hypotension severity and duration. Harm from hypotension apparently largely accrues during brief periods of profoundly low arterial pressures rather than from prolonged exposure to moderately low arterial pressures. Absolute maximum decrease in arterial pressure and area under arterial pressure thresholds, which considers both severity and duration of hypotension, appear most strongly associated with organ injury. Associations with patient harm are similar for systolic and mean arterial pressures.

Baseline arterial pressure varies considerably among individual patients presenting for surgery. Intraoperative hypotension harm thresholds presumably also differ among individuals. Baseline patient risk factors are far more strongly associated with postoperative organ injury than intraoperative hypotension. But hypotension, in contrast to most baseline risk factors, is potentially modifiable and therefore of considerable interest.

### Re-thinking resuscitation: leaving blood pressure cosmetics behind and moving forward to permissive hypotension and a tissue perfusion-based approach [^114MZqGq]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Definitions of shock and resuscitation endpoints traditionally focus on blood pressures and cardiac output. This carries a high risk of overemphasizing systemic hemodynamics at the cost of tissue perfusion. In line with novel shock definitions and evidence of the lack of a correlation between macro- and microcirculation in shock, we recommend that macrocirculatory resuscitation endpoints, particularly arterial and central venous pressure as well as cardiac output, be reconsidered. In this viewpoint article, we propose a three-step approach of resuscitation endpoints in shock of all origins. This approach targets only a minimum individual and context-sensitive mean arterial blood pressure (for example, 45 to 50 mm Hg) to preserve heart and brain perfusion. Further resuscitation is exclusively guided by endpoints of tissue perfusion irrespectively of the presence of arterial hypotension ('permissive hypotension'). Finally, optimization of individual tissue (for example, renal) perfusion is targeted. Prospective clinical studies are necessary to confirm the postulated benefits of targeting these resuscitation endpoints.

### Target value of mean arterial pressure in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy due to acute kidney injury [^111zGcec]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Preventing hypotension is a crucial issue in critically ill patients because of its relationship with high mortality and other poor outcomes. Accordingly, the guidelines for septic patients requiring vasopressors suggest initially maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg, followed by monitoring via multiple hemodynamic parameters to an endpoint of tissue perfusion. Furthermore, this target value should be individualized to the pertinent circumstances or patient characteristics.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a rescue therapy for patients displaying both unstable vital signs and severe acute kidney injury (AKI). Hypotension after initiating CRRT is a frequent occurrence and can aggravate CRRT-related mortality, reaching 50%. Because patients requiring CRRT have AKI as well as other critical conditions, their target value of MAP may be different from that of other critically ill patient subsets or recommended MAP values. An elegant multicenter study including patients with septic shock suggests that a MAP of 65–70 mmHg is enough to guarantee survival compared with 80–85 mmHg; however, only 40% of those patients had AKI, and there was no information regarding CRRT. The target blood pressure values in hemodialysis patients are suggested as < 140 mmHg and < 90 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively (i.e. MAP is calculated as 106.7 mmHg), but this value could not be applied in cases of CRRT because the patient condition is much different from that of conventional hemodialysis patients. Collectively, there are no current guidelines or evidence for the target value of MAP in patients initiating CRRT due to AKI. Therefore, we addressed this issue using a multicenter cohort of patients with AKI requiring CRRT.

Vasopressors

Recommendations

We recommend titrating vasopressors to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65–70 mmHg (Grade 1B) rather than a higher MAP target (80–85 mmHg) in patients with septic shock. However, for patients with chronic hypertension we recommend aiming for a higher target (80–85 mmHg) for renal protection in septic shock (Grade 1C).
We recommend lowering systolic pressure to 140–190 mmHg rather than to 110–139 mmHg in patients with acute cerebral haemorrhage with severe admission hypertension (Grade 1C).
If vasopressors are needed for treatment of hypotension, we recommend norepinephrine (along with correction of hypovolaemia) as the first-choice vasopressor to protect kidney function (Grade 1B) and suggest vasopressin in patients with vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery (Grade 2C).
We suggest individualizing target pressure when premorbid blood pressure is available (BPS).

Rationale for MAP target

Preservation or improvement of renal perfusion can theoretically be achieved through increasing cardiac output by fluid resuscitation or inotropic drugs, through renal vasodilators or systemic vasopressors. Optimal target mean arterial pressure (MAP) was studied in a large open-label multicentre RCT randomising 777 patients with septic shock to resuscitation with a MAP target of either 80–85 mmHg or 65–70 mmHg. In most of the patients the achieved MAP was above the set target. The study found no difference in mortality, incidence of AKI stage 2 (38.7% vs. 41.5%, p = 0.42) or need for RRT (33.5% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.5), but more atrial fibrillation in the high target group. However, in patients with known chronic hypertension a higher MAP resulted in a lower incidence of AKI stage 2 (38.9% vs. 52%, p = 0.02) and less RRT (31.7% vs 42.2%, p = 0.046); mortality was unchanged.

The safety of lowering systolic pressure was studied in a larger RCT in patients with acute cerebral haemorrhage with severe hypertension on admission. Patients were randomised to a systolic blood pressure target of 110–139 or 140–179 mmHg. The primary endpoint (death or disability) was not different between groups. However, the rate of serious renal adverse events was higher in the lower target group (9% vs. 4%, p = 0.002) (ESM_2 Table S5).

### Blood pressure and acute kidney injury [^111ohtzo]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Maintaining the optimal blood pressure is an important aspect of preventing acute kidney injury (AKI), especially for vasopressor-dependent patients. Although mean arterial pressure (MAP) has played an important role in previous trials for prevention of AKI, there is little evidence that MAP actually reflects organ perfusion. In fact, several studies have suggested that perfusion pressure, including diastolic perfusion pressure and mean perfusion pressure (MPP) and calculated with central venous pressure (CVP), may be more useful than the widely used MAP to help prevent AKI. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining diastolic arterial pressure and avoiding elevation of CVP to prevent AKI in patients with sepsis or invasive surgery. To achieve this, further investigation regarding titrated fluid therapy and vasopressors is warranted.

### Optimizing mean arterial pressure in septic shock: a critical reappraisal of the literature [^112njLeK]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend that a mean arterial pressure (MAP) value greater than 65 mm Hg should be the initial blood pressure target in septic shock, but what evidence is there to support this statement? We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar by using the key words 'arterial pressure', 'septic shock', and 'norepinephrine' and retrieved human studies published between 1 January 2000 and 31 July 2014. We identified seven comparative studies: two randomized clinical trials and five observational studies. The results of the literature review suggest that a MAP target of 65 mm Hg is usually sufficient in patients with septic shock. However, a MAP of around 75 to 85 mm Hg may reduce the development of acute kidney injury in patients with chronic arterial hypertension. Because of the high prevalence of chronic arterial hypertension in patients who develop septic shock, this finding is of considerable importance. Future studies should assess interactions between time, fluid volumes administered, and doses of vasopressors.

### Blood pressure deficits in acute kidney injury: not all about the mean arterial pressure? [^114Hxg5Z]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

When considering alterations to the systemic blood pressure and effects on the renal circulation, however, several features must be borne in mind. Firstly, the renal circulation can be viewed as two circulations in series: that to the glomerular capillaries through the afferent arteriolar system, and that to the tubular network via the efferent arterioles. Secondly, in order to maintain adequate pressure within the glomerular and distal capillaries, these systems are under intimate local control. This balance between the afferent and efferent systems, termed auto-regulation, is a fundamental component of renal function.

Autoregulation stabilizes renal blood flow (RBF) and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during variations in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) over a defined range, implying that renal vascular resistance (RVR) changes in proportion to the RPP. The major pre-glomerular resistance vessels whose tone mediates most of this pressure-induced auto-regulation includes the afferent and cortical radial arteries. The efferent arterioles only play a minor role in RBF auto-regulation, principally under conditions of low RPP. Auto-regulation occurs through two major mechanisms: the myogenic response and the macula densa tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response, which are outlined in Fig. 1. The myogenic response reflects afferent arteriolar tone in response to changes in intraluminal pressure, whereas TGF is a more delayed response activated by tubular electrolyte delivery and re-absorption and, as such, associates the GFR with NaCl delivery. Consequently, TGF integrates both tubular and vascular function, and together these mechanisms adjust the tone of the pre-glomerular vessels in the face of a changing RPP. Local mediators also govern these responses; these include angiotensin II, arachidonate metabolites, and NO. Thus, auto-regulation is intrinsic to the kidney and largely independent of extrinsic nerves or circulating hormones. Such auto-regulation is not unique, and in many organs blood flow is regulated to satisfy the metabolic demands. However, what is different in the kidney is that the renal metabolic work is a function of RBF and is specifically dependent on the GFR and the amount of sodium that is to be actively re-absorbed. Therefore, the higher the blood flow the higher the metabolic demands. Given that under normal conditions renal sympathetic tone is low, a relatively high resting blood flow rate is observed within a relatively low resistance system. Interestingly, these flow waveforms observed are similar to that seen in the brain: both a relatively high diastolic pressure and mean flow velocity.

### Relation between mean arterial pressure and renal function in the early phase of shock: a prospective, explorative cohort study [^111q9RrE]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute circulatory failure is the main cause of renal failure in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, as low cardiac output and/or low mean arterial pressure (MAP) can cause low renal blood flow (RBF) and harm the kidney.

Very low levels of MAP are known to increase the risk of acute renal insufficiency (AKI) occurrence. In counterpart, although a MAP of at least 65 mmHg is thought to be protective against organ failures, including renal impairment, and is universally recommended, the true value of MAP that could really protect renal function against worsening is still unknown. In human septic shock, two interventional prospective studies of limited size have shown that increasing MAP from 65 to 75 or 85 mmHg with norepinephrine did not result in urinary output nor serum creatinine significant improvement. Conversely, in another recent study, increasing MAP from 65 to 75 mmHg resulted in an increase in urinary output in 11 septic shock patients. Further, a recent retrospective cohort study suggested that levels of MAP higher than 75 mmHg could be necessary to insure renal protection during sepsis and septic shock.

In healthy conditions RBF is stable within a wide range of MAP, due to regional autoregulation. However, in shock states, and particularly in septic shock, derangements in microcirculation and vasoreactivity, although not precisely examined for human renal perfusion, tend to increase the lowest MAP threshold that guarantees autoregulation. In addition, animal studies have shown that in ischemic AKI, a decrease in MAP even at high levels of MAP (above 90 mmHg) could be responsible of a decrease in RBF, suggesting an impairment of autoregulation in AKI. This suggests that independently of the shock state itself, shock-induced AKI could cause the partial or total loss of the renal autoregulation ability early in the course of the disease. This could explain the discrepancies between the above-cited human studies concerning the relation between MAP and renal function as they included patients regardless of the existence or not of AKI at the time of inclusion. However, at this time, human studies addressing the link between shock-induced AKI and the loss of autoregulation are lacking.

We hypothesized that, due to different MAP thresholds of renal autoregulation, patients with or without AKI at the time of initial therapy for acute circulatory failure could need different MAP levels to prevent the worsening of renal function or even to favour its improvement.

Accordingly, we conducted an explorative, prospective study aimed at comparing the relation between MAP and renal function in patients admitted for acute circulatory failure with different degrees of initial renal function impairment.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic renal disease [^116bJBsk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, development of end-stage renal disease, and all-cause mortality. It affects around 10% of the population worldwide. The prevalence of hypertension in people with CKD ranges from 22% in stage 1 to 80% in stage 4. Elevated arterial blood pressure is one of the major independent risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events. Thereby, reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial but could also increase the risk of adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and CKD remains unknown.

Objectives

Primary: to compare the effects of standard and lower-than-standard blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Secondary: to assess the magnitude of reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the proportion of participants reaching blood pressure targets, and the number of drugs necessary to achieve the assigned target.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database, and two trial registers up to 8 February 2023. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with hypertension and CKD that provided at least twelve months' follow-up. Eligible interventions compared lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (130/80 mmHg or lower) to standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or lower). Participants were adults with CKD and elevated blood pressure documented in a standard way on at least two occasions, or already receiving treatment for elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our critical outcomes were: total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and progression to end-stage renal disease. Important outcomes were: participant withdrawals due to adverse effects, and number of participants with a doubling of serum creatinine level or at least a 50% reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the end of the study. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for the critical outcomes. This review received no funding.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that contributed data for meta-analysis, involving 7348 participants overall (range 840 to 4733 people per study). The mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range 1.0 to 8.0 years). Three studies were publicly funded, two were privately funded, and one had both public and private funding. All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies blinded participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure target. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all studies. Critical outcomes. Compared with standard blood pressure targets, lower targets likely result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.06; 6 studies, 7348 participants), total serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 7348 participants), and total cardiovascular events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.15; 5 studies, 6508 participants), all with moderate-certainty evidence. Compared with standard blood pressure targets, lower targets may result in little to no difference in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 6 studies, 7348 participants) and progression to end-stage renal disease (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11; 4 studies, 4788 participants), both with low-certainty evidence. Important outcomes. We found little to no differences in: participant withdrawals due to adverse effects; and the number of participants with a doubling of serum creatinine level, or at least a 50% reduction in GFR at the end of the study. Exploratory outcomes. Compared to the standard blood pressure target groups, participants in the lower target groups achieved lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure values after one year, and required a higher number of antihypertensive drugs at the end of the studies. A higher proportion of participants in the standard blood pressure target groups achieved the targets they were assigned than did participants in the intensive target groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to a standard blood pressure target, lower blood pressure targets probably result in little to no difference in total mortality, total serious adverse events, and total cardiovascular events, and may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular mortality or in the progression to end-stage renal disease in people with hypertension and CKD. However, the evidence underpinning these conclusions has several limitations. All studies were open design, blood pressure measurement was performed at a medical office, and there was scant information about adverse events. Future research should include high-quality adverse event data, report results for people with different levels of proteinuria, and consider out-of-office blood pressure monitoring. Several studies are ongoing, and may provide new evidence for this topic in the near future.

### One-size MAP does not fit all [^116PpMwC]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

One-size mean arterial pressure does not fit all

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign advocates maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mm Hg in sepsis patients undergoing resuscitation. Leone and colleagues, in an article published in this journal, suggest considering higher MAP targets in the resuscitation of patients with a history of arterial hypertension so they do not progress to acute kidney injury. Asfar and colleagues, in a multicenter, open-label trial, showed no significant difference in mortality outcomes in septic shock patients undergoing resuscitation with an MAP target of either 80 to 85 mm Hg (high-target group) or 65 to 70 mm Hg (low-target group). However, the study did show that chronic hypertensive patients in the higher-target group had lower incidences of acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy. This likely stems from the need for higher MAPs in chronic hypertensive patients in order to maintain organ blood flow because of a shift of the organ's autoregulatory range to the right. Thus, targeting a higher MAP for chronic hypertensive patients may help avoid the development of acute kidney injury and the need for renal replacement therapy. Renal replacement therapy carries with it inherent morbidity as well as additional cost. These costs include the need for dialysate fluid and extra personnel and the use of anticoagulation and the extracorporeal circuit. However, chronic hypertensive patients in the high-target group had a greater incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation (5.2% in the low-target group versus 9% in the high-target group). Patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation during sepsis have been shown to have increased incidences of in-hospital stroke and in-hospital mortality as well as subsequent recurrence of atrial fibrillation and increased long-term risks for heart failure, ischemic stroke, and death. This may offset any benefit of a higher MAP. The ideal target MAP may have to be individualized for specific patient populations. More studies are needed to determine whether baseline blood pressure plays a role in the ultimate determination of the ideal MAP target for patients with sepsis.

### Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI) international consensus statement on perioperative arterial pressure management [^117NiwC1]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Consensus recommendation 2: We recommend increasing mean arterial pressure targets when venous or compartment pressures are elevated (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Mean arterial pressure, the mean pressure over the cardiac cycle, is the inflow pressure for most organs and therefore a main determinant of organ perfusion pressure. However, organ perfusion pressure is also influenced by venous outflow pressure and extravascular pressure in the relevant tissue. Organ perfusion pressure can be substantially reduced by increased extravascular compartment pressures in the abdomen, thorax, limbs, and cranium. Venous pressure can be elevated by right ventricular failure, systemic arteriovenous shunts, and venous obstruction.

The kidneys appear particularly sensitive to perioperative decreases in perfusion pressure. Elevated intraabdominal pressure promotes splanchnic venous congestion and impairs renal function. During surgery, venous pressure is often unknown, but operative factors including steep Trendelenburg (head-down) positioning and peritoneal or thoracic gas insufflation increase organ outflow pressure, possibly resulting in inadequate organ perfusion. We, therefore, recommend compensating for estimated venous outflow pressure and extravascular pressure on the relevant tissue when defining individual intraoperative mean arterial pressure targets.

However, there are no trials investigating how to best correct for increased venous outflow pressure or extravascular pressure. In clinical practice, venous and compartment pressures are often unknown. Central venous pressure can be measured in surgical patients with a central venous catheter, but compartment pressures (such as intraabdominal and intracranial pressures) are generally unknown. If compartment pressure is available or can be estimated, pathophysiological rationale suggests increasing the mean arterial pressure target by roughly the compartment pressure. For example, if clinicians aim for an organ perfusion pressure of 65 mm Hg and compartment pressure is 15 mm Hg, the inflow pressure (i.e. mean arterial pressure) might be maintained > 80 mm Hg.

Consensus recommendation 3: We recommend that treatment of hypotension be based on presumed underlying causes including vasodilation, hypovolaemia, bradycardia, and low cardiac output (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

### Optimizing mean arterial pressure in septic shock: a critical reappraisal of the literature [^111SLXwa]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

These concepts are based on the theoretically linear relationship between pressure and flow in septic states (Figure 1). To reach a high blood pressure target value, supplemental fluid volume and increasing dosages of inotropes or vasopressors or both are required. These drugs have adverse effects that are associated with organ failure, particularly true for catecholamines, the most common drugs used to maintain or increase blood pressure.

Experimentally, increasing arterial pressure excessively has harmful effects. In an ovine model of septic shock, Corrêa and colleagues showed that targeting a MAP of between 50 and 60 mm Hg was associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). In critically ill patients, unfavorable outcomes have been reported with persistent MAP values of less than 60 to 65 mm Hg. Also, although MAP levels of 54 mm Hg have been associated with worse microcirculatory variables, increasing MAP to more than 65 mm Hg was associated with improved microcirculatory parameters. Overall, data suggest that a level of MAP at 65 mm Hg is probably the minimal goal that should be targeted in septic shock. However, targeting a higher MAP (75 to 85 mm Hg) during resuscitation of otherwise healthy swine with fecal peritonitis-induced septic shock did not ameliorate the inflammatory response and resulted in increased net positive fluid balance and vasopressor load during resuscitation. Hence, a MAP target that is too low may be associated with organ hypoperfusion, whereas one that is too high may be associated with ischemic injury due to excessive vasoconstriction.

### Renal autoregulation and blood pressure management in circulatory shock [^114F4y7F]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A number of clinical studies have reported an association between low arterial blood pressure and increased mortality in patients with different types of shock. These patients typically receive vasopressor therapy to maintain adequate organ perfusion. Generally, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) target of around 65 mmHg is recommended in the initial management of shock, but the optimal level is hard to define. For example, a lower target may be advisable in patients with hemorrhagic shock without severe brain injury to minimize additional blood loss. Conversely, some patients may benefit from a higher blood pressure than others. Indeed, a small study in 25 patients with cardiogenic shock suggested a beneficial effect on microcirculation and tissue metabolism of increasing MAP from 65 to 85 mmHg. Whether a higher blood pressure beneficially affects renal blood flow (RBF) or kidney function is unknown. In septic shock, variable responses of RBF and kidney function to blood pressure levels greater than 65 mmHg have been reported in several small interventional studies. The randomized controlled SEPSISPAM trial evaluated the effect of increasing the target MAP to 80–85 mmHg, compared to a target of 70–75 mmHg, in 776 septic shock patients and found no difference in mortality between the two groups. However, patients in the pre-defined subgroup with arterial hypertension benefited from the higher MAP, as evidenced by lower plasma creatinine concentrations and reduced use of renal replacement therapy. These findings may be attributed to the existence of impaired renal autoregulation in these patients.

### SCAI appropriate use criteria for peripheral arterial interventions: an update [^1131pfc9]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Medium credibility.

SCAI appropriate use criteria (AUC) for peripheral arterial interventions define appropriate use by balancing risks and benefits, where an appropriate diagnostic or therapeutic procedure is one in which the expected clinical benefit exceeds the risks by a sufficiently wide margin such that the procedure is generally acceptable or reasonable. Using a modified Delphi method, an expert panel rated clinical scenarios on a nine-point scale (Appropriate 7–9, May Be Appropriate 4–6, and Rarely Appropriate 1–3), with a minimum of three rounds of ratings and agreement defined when none of the ratings fell outside the 2-point margin of the mean score. For renal arterial revascularization, benefits weighed against risks included blood pressure improvement, renal function improvement or stabilization, and improved cardiac destabilization syndromes, while for lower extremity arterial revascularization, benefits included survival or health outcomes such as symptom improvement, limb salvage, functional status and/or quality of life. "Appropriate Care" implies that the benefits generally outweigh the risks and is an effective option for individual care although not always required or necessary. "May Be Appropriate Care" describes an option that is generally accepted with variable levels of supporting evidence or expert consensus, and the appropriateness of a specific procedure in any individual must be determined by that patient's physician in consultation with the patient considering the risk to benefit ratio. "Rarely Appropriate" care describes an option for a patient with an adverse or uncertain risk to benefit ratio, is not commonly used as an effective therapy, and procedures in this category require justification through documentation of individual patient circumstances.

### Target value of mean arterial pressure in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy due to acute kidney injury [^1176SPSy]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Prevention of hypotension and maintaining proper tissue perfusion is the treatment goal for critically ill patients. Alarming a target value of MAP should facilitate the management of these patients, but this issue has not been evaluated in patients requiring CRRT despite their high mortality rates. The present study identified that baseline MAP at the time of starting CRRT was associated with the mortality risk. When a nonlinear relationship was applied, the potential target value of MAP was calculated as 82.7 mmHg. Accordingly, a warning for MAP values above this target may be needed at the time of initiating CRRT.

Among the patients requiring intensive care, a substantial proportion of patients suffered from AKI and may have needed the support of CRRT. AKI adds a significant burden to critically ill patients and ultimately leads to a poor outcome and high mortality. Among several risk factors in this patient subset, an abnormal blood pressure range has been included in the scoring system of outcome prediction. Although CRRT provides gentle modification of electrolyte, acid-base, and fluid imbalance with hemodynamic tolerance compared with intermittent hemodialysis, early exposure to hypotension during CRRT may be associated with high mortality. In addition to tissue hypoxia, low blood pressures affect the adequacy of CRRT by clotting in the circuit system. This event finally propagates hypotension as a vicious cycle. Accordingly, increasing the blood pressures over the target value may be needed before starting CRRT as a preventive management.

### Increasing mean arterial blood pressure in sepsis: effects on fluid balance, vasopressor load and renal function [^113je2DD]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Blood pressure targets did not modify mitochondrial respiration or markers of inflammation. However, animals in the low-MAP group had lower SvO 2 and hemoglobin levels, and a higher incidence of AKI, while animals in the high-MAP group had increased net positive fluid balance and vasopressor load during resuscitation. If the animals were not resuscitated after 12 h they died, with increased plasma levels of inflammatory markers, increased maximal skeletal muscle complex I mitochondrial respiration, and with preserved skeletal muscle ATP content.

Few clinical studies have prospectively addressed the effect on disease severity and the development of sepsis-associated organ dysfunction of different levels of MAP during the initial phase of severe sepsis and septic shock resuscitation. The lack of available data supporting a specific MAP target during the initial resuscitation of septic patients is emphasized by the wide range of MAP goals (60 to 100 mmHg) applied in randomized controlled clinical trials. Furthermore, experimental studies in sepsis either do not include MAP targets in resuscitation algorithms, or set the MAP target at 65 mmHg, consistent with the current recommendation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. Nevertheless, no clinical or experimental studies have prospectively addressed the effects of lower MAP targets (50 to 60 mmHg) on outcomes.

### Systolic blood pressure as the trigger for the renal myogenic response: protective or autoregulatory? [^114aViN6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The ability of the kidney to autoregulate renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate has long been viewed as existing to prevent fluctuations in blood pressure from causing parallel fluctuations in renal function and distal delivery of filtrate. This review, however, points out that the primary consequence of the loss of this autoregulatory capacity is not a disturbance in volume regulation, but rather an increased susceptibility to hypertensive injury. Moreover, the kinetic requirements for renal protection indicate that current views of dynamic autoregulation cannot explain how the kidney is normally protected against acute elevations in systolic blood pressure.

Recent Findings

Recent findings suggest that the kinetics of the myogenic mechanism of the afferent arteriole are uniquely suited to protect against acute elevations in the systolic blood pressure, in that this vessel not only senses this rapidly oscillating blood pressure component, but that its response is exclusively dependent on this signal.

Summary

These new findings are consistent with recent data indicating that it is the systolic blood pressure elevations that most closely correlate with target organ damage. The fact that the myogenic mechanism is also a necessary component of renal autoregulation may explain the strong linkage between autoregulatory impairment and increased susceptibility to hypertensive injury.

### Mean arterial pressure targets and patient-important outcomes in critically ill adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^111Yskyf]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether targeting a higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) compared with a lower MAP in adults with shock results in differences in patient important outcomes.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov through May 2021.

Study Selection

Titles and abstracts were screened independently and in duplicate to identify potentially eligible studies, then full text for final eligibility. We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials in adult patients with a diagnosis of shock requiring vasoactive medications. The higher MAP group was required to receive vasoactive medications to target a higher MAP as established by study authors, whereas the lower MAP group received vasoactive medications to target lower MAP.

Data Extraction

In triplicate, reviewers independently extracted data using a prepiloted abstraction form. Statistical analyses were conducted using the RevMan software Version 5.3.

Data Synthesis

Six randomized controlled trials (n = 3,690) met eligibility criteria. Targeting a higher MAP (75–85mm Hg) compared with lower MAP of 65mm Hg resulted in no difference in mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98–1.15; I2 = 0%; p = 0.12; moderate certainty. Targeting a higher MAP resulted in no difference in the risk of undergoing renal replacement therapy (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83–1.11; I2 = 24%; p = 0.57; moderate certainty); however, a subgroup analysis comparing patients with and without chronic hypertension demonstrated that a higher MAP may reduce the risk of undergoing renal replacement therapy (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.98; I2 = 0%; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated with moderate certainty that there is no difference in mortality when a higher MAP is targeted in critically ill adult patients with shock. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of mean arterial pressure on need for renal replacement therapy in this population.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^116vyvd4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Taking these largely indirect findings together and considering that, at least after development of proteinuria, progression of kidney injury tends to follow the same course in different situations, the 2023 ESH Guidelines suggest that: (i) the BP target for proteinuric nondiabetic CKD applies to patients with proteinuric diabetic kidney disease as well and (ii) for both patient categories, a target SBP of < 130 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg, if well tolerated, can be associated with protection against CKD progression in individuals with an albuminuria > 30 mg/g. A similar target may be associated with a reduction in mortality in most patients with CKD. Particularly in patients with advanced CKD (G4 and G5), careful monitoring of eGFR is recommended as a further functional, but reversible, decline of GFR may occur on a lower BP. Finally, most of the patients with CKD have CV comorbidities that require respective target BP values to be taken into account, and thus these CV comorbidities and not CKD protection may primarily guide the target BP in an individual patient.

However, the 2023 ESH Guidelines acknowledge that these recommendations have a number of limitations: (i) none of the trials comparing different BP targets included patients with diabetes and CKD, thus current evidence cannot be readily extrapolated to this subpopulation; (ii) MDRD and AASK trials randomized participants to different mean BP levels, which cannot be readily extrapolated to SBP and DBP values; (iii) MDRD and AASK trials recruited patient populations of a relatively young age (mean age 51.7 and 54.6 years, respectively), and thus, their findings cannot be readily extrapolated to older patients with CKD; and (iv) even for the long-term observational analyses, the benefits associated with lower BP targets were mainly apparent in individuals with proteinuria.

Overall, as shown in Fig. 2, the guidelines recommend that in all patients with CKD the primary goal is to lower office SBP to < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg (CoR I, LoE A) and that in most CKD patients (young patients, patients with a urine ACR ≥ 300 mg/g, high CV risk patients) office BP may be lowered to < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated (CoR II, LoE B). Actively targeting an office SBP target of < 120 mmHg and DBP < 70 mmHg cannot be recommended because of the absence of relevant evidence and the potential to induce harm (CoR III, LoE C).

### Protecting renal function in the hypertensive patient: clinical guidelines [^114RfV1r]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasing in the United States and worldwide. Patients with both diabetes and hypertension have a dramatically increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly if both conditions are not effectively controlled. Failure to achieve the goals for blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and lipids is associated with high morbidity from cardiovascular and renal events as well as the high costs of treating these morbid events. There is increasing evidence that cardiovascular events, renal failure, and premature death can be prevented or delayed by earlier identification and treatment of CKD, as well as by taking measures to prevent its onset. A large subgroup of hypertensive patients may be at increased risk for developing CKD and should be targeted for appropriate monitoring and treatment. Not all antihypertensive regimens are equally effective at preserving renal function. Clinical trials indicate that the primary clinical goal in the treatment of patients with CKD is to lower BP to the recommended goal as well as to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria to the lowest levels possible. This is achieved optimally by using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system in concert with other agents that reduce proteinuria and BP.

### The effect of a lower target blood pressure on the progression of kidney disease: long-term follow-up of the modification of diet in renal disease study [^115FvR8H]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease. The optimal blood pressure to slow progression is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of a low target blood pressure on kidney failure and all-cause mortality.

Design

Long-term follow-up of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study, a randomized, controlled trial conducted from 1989 to 1993.

Setting

15 outpatient nephrology practices.

Participants

840 persons with predominantly nondiabetic kidney disease and a glomerular filtration rate of 13 to 55 mL/min per 1.73 m2.

Intervention

A low target blood pressure (mean arterial pressure < 92 mm Hg) or a usual target blood pressure (mean arterial pressure < 107 mm Hg).

Measurements

After the randomized trial was completed, kidney failure (defined as initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation) and a composite outcome of kidney failure or all-cause mortality were ascertained through 31 December 2000.

Results

Kidney failure occurred in 554 participants (66%), and the composite outcome occurred in 624 participants (74%). After Cox proportional hazards modeling and intention-to-treat analysis, the adjusted hazard ratios were 0.68 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82; P < 0.001) for kidney failure and 0.77 (CI, 0.65 to 0.91; P = 0.0024) for the composite outcome in the low target blood pressure group compared with the usual target blood pressure group. Evidence was insufficient to conclude that the benefit of a low target blood pressure differed according to the cause of kidney disease, baseline glomerular filtration rate, or degree of proteinuria.

Limitations

The exact mechanism underlying the benefit of a low target blood pressure is unknown.

Conclusions

Assignment to a low target blood pressure slowed the progression of nondiabetic kidney disease in patients with a moderately to severely decreased glomerular filtration rate.

### Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI) international consensus statement on perioperative arterial pressure management [^114jWWrq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

The associations between intraoperative hypotension and acute kidney and myocardial injury are clear. However, it remains largely unknown whether the observed associations are causal, and thus amenable to intervention. Only a few randomised trials have reported the effect of targeted arterial pressure management on postoperative outcomes.

A single-centre trial of 458 major noncardiac surgery patients with high baseline cardiovascular risk tested the hypothesis that keeping intraoperative mean arterial pressure ≥ 75 mm Hg compared to ≥ 60 mm Hg reduces the incidence of a composite primary outcome of acute myocardial injury within the first 3 postoperative days and 30-day acute kidney injury or major adverse cardiovascular events. Patients assigned to the ≥ 75 mm Hg mean arterial pressure target spent substantially less time with hypotension than patients assigned to the ≥ 60 mm Hg mean arterial pressure target (e.g. median cumulative time with a mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg 9 vs 23 min). However, the incidence of the primary composite outcome was similar in each group: 48% in patients assigned to the ≥ 75 mm Hg mean arterial pressure target and 52% in patients assigned to the ≥ 60 mm Hg mean arterial pressure target (risk difference –4.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] –13% to 5%; P = 0.42).

The large international POISE-3 trial tested the effects of a hypotension-avoidance vs a hypertension-avoidance strategy on major postoperative vascular complications in 7490 patients with hypertension having noncardiac surgery. The intraoperative target mean arterial pressures were ≥ 80 mm Hg in the hypotension-avoidance group and ≥ 60 mm Hg in the hypertension-avoidance group. The median time with intraoperative mean arterial pressure of 60–79 mm Hg was 25 min in patients in the hypotension-avoidance group and 56 min in patients in the hypertension-avoidance group. However, profound hypotension was apparently rare in both groups. Absolute maximum arterial pressure declines and areas under arterial pressure thresholds were not reported. The composite primary outcome (vascular death and nonfatal myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, stroke, and cardiac arrest within the first 30 days after surgery) occurred in 14% of patients assigned to the hypotension-avoidance group and in 14% of patients assigned to the hypertension-avoidance group (hazard ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12; P = 0.92).

### Optimizing mean arterial pressure in septic shock: a critical reappraisal of the literature [^111Kk58g]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Overview of relationship between arterial pressure and organ perfusion

Septic shock is characterized by both vasodilation and cardiac dysfunction, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. Hypotension generates organ failure due to hypoperfusion, with the MAP reflecting the driving pressure at the organ level. The goal of resuscitation is to restore adequate organ perfusion (that is, to optimize the relationship between oxygen needs and oxygen supply). In healthy individuals, blood flow remains constant over a large range of blood pressures, at least in the brain and the kidney. For many years, researchers have hypothesized that this autoregulatory mechanism is impaired in septic shock, so that increasing blood pressure will increase organ blood flow (Figure 1). In addition, the autoregulation threshold is dependent on the basal level of blood pressure, tending to be higher in patients with than in those without a prior history of arterial hypertension (Figure 1). The 'optimal' MAP target, therefore, may differ according to the patient's medical history. Moreover, there are many autoregulatory thresholds depending on the specific tissue. In general, our goal is to provide an adequate perfusion to vital organs, which tend to have higher thresholds than less critical organs, such as skeletal muscle.

Figure 1
Organ blood flow and blood pressure relationships in healthy individuals, individuals with chronic hypertension, and patients with septic shock. The third linear relationship is theoretical.

The microcirculation is markedly altered in septic shock. Altered circulating cells, disseminated intravascular coagulation, peripheral edema, and impaired mitochondrial function have been implicated. Interestingly, the microcirculation can still be impaired when the blood pressure goals of resuscitation, as recommended by guidelines, have been reached, suggesting that these hemodynamic goals may be inadequate for some patients (that is, not high enough) and that increasing blood pressure to higher levels may be warranted in some patients. On the other hand, these observations may imply that the microcirculation is at least partially independent of systemic hemodynamics, so that a further increase in arterial pressure may not improve microcirculatory blood flow or may even threaten it.

### Low mean perfusion pressure is a risk factor for progression of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients – A retrospective analysis [^115r99md]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complications of critical illness affecting 50–60% of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). It is associated with serious short- and long term complications, including increased mortality and contributes to significant healthcare costs. Worldwide, opportunities are sought to prevent AKI and to reduce the risk of progression.

Haemodynamic regulation of renal blood flow and renal venous pressure are key determinants of renal function. In healthy individuals without systemic hypertension, intrarenal blood flow is auto-regulated at renal perfusion pressures between 60 and 100 mmHg. During critical illness, these processes may be compromised. A raised central venous pressure (CVP) and the resultant increased backward pressure also negatively impacts on renal function, mainly due to renal congestion and increased intra-renal pressure resulting in a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Most evidence stems from studies in patients with cardiovascular disease where an association between renal venous congestion and the development of AKI has been repeatedly shown.

To date, there are no established techniques to evaluate and monitor intrarenal blood flow and renal perfusion pressures directly. There are also no reliable means to predict intrarenal haemodynamics from systemic arterial pressures. It has been suggested that mean perfusion pressure (MPP) may serve as a surrogate. MPP is calculated as the difference between systemic mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CVP, ie MPP = MAP – CVP Previous studies have shown that a lower MPP was associated with an increased risk of developing AKI. It remains unknown whether MPP also affects the risk of progression in patients with established AKI.

### Effects of arterial pressure in an experimental isolated haemoperfused porcine kidney preservation system [^114SzCDC]. The British Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Normothermic preservation provides metabolic support to an ischaemically damaged organ before use as a kidney transplant. Optimal conditions for ex vivo preservation have not yet been established. This study examined the effects of arterial pressure on renal preservation using isolated haemoperfused kidneys.

Methods

An isolated organ preservation system, developed using cardiopulmonary bypass technology, was used to perfuse porcine kidneys with normothermic oxygenated blood. Groups of kidneys (n = 6) were perfused at a mean arterial pressure of 95, 75 or 55 mmHg.

Results

Kidneys perfused at the higher mean arterial pressures of 95 and 75 mmHg demonstrated improved renal function: mean(s.d.) area under the curve (AUC) for creatinine clearance 71(19) and 55(30) respectively versus 14(12) in the 55-mmHg group, P = 0.002; AUC for serum creatinine 938(140) and 1290(394) versus 2404(595), P = 0.003. The higher perfusion pressures were also associated with better acid-base homeostasis and improved renal haemodynamics.

Conclusion

Mean arterial pressures of either 95 or 75 mmHg were capable of sustaining physiological renal function, but kidneys in the 95-mmHg group demonstrated superior renal function overall.

### Higher blood pressure versus normotension targets to prevent acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^116kQGYg]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

MAP is the fundamental driver of organ perfusion. Autoregulation is the capacity of healthy essential organs such as the heart, brain, and kidney to maintain a consistent blood flow rate within a range of perfusion pressure. In disrupted hemodynamics, such as circulatory shock and perioperative patients, organ blood flow depends on perfusion pressure. Targeting a physiological MAP is necessary to safeguard key organs by ensuring peripheral perfusion BP and microcirculatory blood flow. As a target for hemodynamic optimization, MAP is commonly set at 65 mmHg in septic shock guidelines and perioperative settings. However, since the kidney has the highest autoregulation threshold compared to other organs, it remains unclear if a higher MAP is required for better AKI prevention. Animal research demonstrated a 50 to 90 mmHg renal autoregulation threshold, but no human data was available. The absence of renoprotective impact of greater MAP relative to normotension may be related to the kidney's ability to autoregulate above the autoregulation threshold. Our findings supported the currently suggested normotension level (MAP about 65 mmHg) over higher MAP targets for AKI prevention in frequent AKI-related scenarios.

After adjusting for patient group, we found no significant effect of hypertension, mean age, or RoB on the link between MAP and AKI in meta-regression models. Nevertheless, subgroup analysis of shock patients with hypertension revealed a renoprotective signal of higher MAP (> 70 mmHg) on reducing the RRT receipt rate. Chronic hypertension is known to shift the renal autoregulation zone to the right, higher MAP is therefore required to maintain adequate perfusion pressure. Dewitte et al. studied 26 hypertensive patients with sepsis-associated AKI and discovered that targeting 80–85 mmHg MAP was linked with significantly higher creatinine clearance than lower MAP (65–70 mmHg). Evidence of effect modification of hypertension is scarce in cardiac and non-cardiac surgery patients. Wu et al.'s RCT, which included exclusively hypertensive patients undergoing major surgery, demonstrated renoprotective effect of MAP at 80–95 mmHg versus MAP of 65–79 mmHg. Guidelines in resuscitating shock patients, consensus on post-operative non-cardiac AKI and perioperative patients also recommended higher MAP target in hypertension patients. Due to the observational nature of subgroup analysis and meta-regression, whether higher MAP targets could actually prevent AKI in hypertensive patients with hemodynamic instability may be an essential question for future trials.

### Perioperative fluid management in kidney transplantation: a black box [^113RZtqR]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Blood pressure is the most commonly used vital parameter for organ perfusion, and functions as an indirect measurement of renal perfusion in clinical practice. Although classic physiological studies suggest that autoregulation of renal blood flow is maintained at lower levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP 50–60 mmHg), retrospective data suggest that intraoperative MAP < 55 mmHg is associated with AKI and myocardial injury. In a prospective randomized controlled trial in which MAP targets of 65–70 mmHg were compared to MAP targets of 80–85 mmHg in septic patients, there were no significant differences in mortality. Renal replacement therapy was less commonly required in patients with chronic hypertension whose MAP was maintained at values of ≥ 80 mmHg. However, raising MAP by increasing the systemic vascular resistance does not necessarily improve flow and potentially also not renal perfusion.

Given the expected large oscillations in hemodynamic parameters during kidney transplantation, invasive arterial BP monitoring is commonly used. In a recent study of the biochemical outcomes of renal transplant recipients, no difference was observed in the creatinine levels of patients with a MAP between 95 and 131 mmHg, but MAP was continuously maintained at > 95 mmHg via the judicious use of fluids and dopamine. Consistent with other studies, Campos et al. observed that MAP < 93 mmHg is associated with poor graft function. In an earlier study, Tóth et al. observed stable creatinine levels in patients with a MAP of 80–100 mmHg, but an increase in creatinine in patients with MAP < 80 mmHg. However, these associations do not imply that raising pressure would restore function. The optimal measurement to evaluate renal microcirculation is unclear, as well as it being unknown which individual MAP could prevent AKI during different medical conditions.

### Relation between mean arterial pressure and renal function in the early phase of shock: a prospective, explorative cohort study [^117BVjML]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

In our study, in the patients with non septic shock and/or no AKI at H6, we did not determine any MAP threshold that could predict AKI at H72. Perhaps in these patients autoregulation was preserved. Furthermore, MAP is not the sole determinant of renal function in shock. Organ hypoperfusion and/or reperfusion lead to an important inflammatory reaction and inflammatory mediator systemic delivery known to be involved in renal injuries. The recent study conducted by Lerolle et al. confirms that renal lesions associated with AKI in septic shock are more complex than acute tubular injuries, involving intense capillary leukocytic infiltration and apoptosis. Moreover, aetiology of AKI in ICU patients is often multifactorial. The usual AKI risk factors identified are hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, sepsis and a high score of illness severity, all of which being not amenable to medical intervention in the acute situation of shock. Given these considerations, increasing MAP could be insufficient to avoid AKI. At this time, waiting for further studies, our results suggest that in patients with septic shock and initial renal insult (and perhaps also in patients with initial renal insult without septic shock), higher levels than the universally recommended level of 65 mmHg could be targeted. This could be achieved with an increase in norepinephrine dosage, as it has not been shown to adversely affect renal perfusion. Indeed the patients with low MAP are often those who also receive the highest doses of vasopressors, and consequently vasopressor dosages are statistically linked to AKI occurrence (as illustrated in Figure 6 for our patients). In consequence, for fear of precipitating AKI, one might be rather timid in increasing doses of vasopressors once the targeted MAP of 65 mmHg is attained. However, our analysis showed that a significant number of patients with rather low MAP (< 72 mmHg) averaged over H12 to H24 showed AKI at H72 while not receiving vasopressors at doses extraordinarily high (less than 0.5 μg/kg/min of epinephrine and/or norepinephrine). In our opinion, there was still room for an increase in vasopressor doses in these patients.

### Low achieved systolic blood pressure related to kidney protection in diabetic and non-diabetic high-risk hypertensive patients [^1129H9DC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants were followed for 4–6 years to a maximum of 72 months, with monthly visits during the initial six months after randomization and later at six-month intervals. BP was measured at each visit using a calibrated sphygmomanometer or validated digital device with an appropriate size cuff as required by the protocol though the choice of measurement device was not harmonized between study centers because VALUE was not primarily a BP study but a hypertension outcome trial.

Patients were seated quietly for 5 min before the measurement of such standard research BP. BP was measured in the morning, 24 hours after the last dosing. Measurements were performed 3 times during each visit. Mean BP at each visit was defined as the average of all 3 readings. Monitoring was performed by the Novartis Medical Department with headquarters in Basel, Switzerland and East Hanover, NJ, USA, known for their strict monitoring routines including high quality-work with source data verification.

Blood samples were collected and analyzed at central labs located in Europe, North and South America, Israel, Australia, and South-Africa. Serum creatinine was measured at baseline and thereafter yearly.

Kidney and cardiovascular outcomes

The primary goal of the studywas to determine the time to the occurrence of the first cardiac event, which included a combination of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, death from revascularization procedures or heart failure, hospitalization for heart failure, and emergency procedures to prevent myocardial infarction. The secondary endpoints were all cardiovascular events, fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalized heart failure, cardiovascular-, non-cardiovascular-, and all-cause mortality. Pre-specified secondary kidney endpointsincluded worsened kidney function by at least a 50% increase in serum creatinine from baseline, captured at a minimum of two occasions with at least 4 weeks apart, and ESKD as need for dialysis and/or kidney transplantation. To ensure impartiality, the endpoint committee was not informed of the treatment assignments when assessing events. Thus, the current paper reports the protocol-defined pre-specified kidney endpoints, as they were reported by study investigators during the trial and approved by the VALUE Trial expert Endpoint Committee. However, since VALUE is the only mega-trial ever performed comparing head-to-head blocker of the renin-angiotensin system with amlodipine, explorative analyses of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will likely be reported in the future. Regarding proteinuria, this was not quantified in VALUE and thus not reported.

### Relation between mean arterial pressure and renal function in the early phase of shock: a prospective, explorative cohort study [^113w1RRU]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Because of disturbed renal autoregulation, patients experiencing hypotension-induced renal insult might need higher levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP) than the 65 mmHg recommended level in order to avoid the progression of acute kidney insufficiency (AKI).

Methods

In 217 patients with sustained hypotension, enrolled and followed prospectively, we compared the evolution of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) during the first 24 hours between patients who will show AKI 72 hours after inclusion (AKIh72) and patients who will not. AKIh72 was defined as the need of renal replacement therapy or "Injury" or "Failure" classes of the 5-stage RIFLE classification (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, End-stage renal disease) for acute kidney insufficiency using the creatinine and urine output criteria. This comparison was performed in four different subgroups of patients according to the presence or not of AKI at the sixth hour after inclusion (AKIh6 as defined as a serum creatinine level above 1.5 times baseline value within the first six hours) and the presence or not of septic shock at inclusion. The ability of MAP averaged over H6 to H24 to predict AKIh72 was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared between groups.

Results

The MAP averaged over H6 to H24 or over H12 to H24 was significantly lower in patients who showed AKIh72 than in those who did not, only in septic shock patients with AKIh6, whereas no link was found between MAP and AKIh72 in the three others subgroups of patients. In patients with septic shock plus AKIh6, MAP averaged over H6 to H24 or over H12 to H24 had an AUC of 0.83 (0.72 to 0.92) or 0.84 (0.72 to 0.92), respectively, to predict AKIh72. In these patients, the best level of MAP to prevent AKIh72 was between 72 and 82 mmHg.

Conclusions

MAP about 72 to 82 mmHg could be necessary to avoid acute kidney insufficiency in patients with septic shock and initial renal function impairment.

### Association between mean arterial pressure and acute kidney injury and a composite of myocardial injury and mortality in postoperative critically ill patients: a retrospective cohort analysis [^115bx9fU]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Hypotension thresholds that provoke renal injury, myocardial injury, and mortality in critical care patients remain unknown. We primarily sought to determine the relationship between hypotension and a composite of myocardial injury (troponin T ≥ 0.03ng/mL without nonischemic cause) and death up to 7 postoperative days. Secondarily, we considered acute kidney injury (creatinine concentration ≥ 0.3mg/dL or 1.5 times baseline).

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting

Surgical ICU at an academic medical center.

Patients

Two-thousand eight-hundred thirty-three postoperative patients admitted to the surgical ICU.

Interventions

A Cox proportional hazard survival model was used to assess the association between lowest mean arterial pressure on each intensive care day, considered as a time-varying covariate, and outcomes. In sensitivity analyses hypotension defined as pressures less than 80mm Hg and 70mm Hg were also considered.

Measurements and Main Results

There was a strong nonlinear (quadratic) association between the lowest mean arterial pressure and the primary outcome of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery or mortality, with estimated risk increasing at lower pressures. The risk of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery or mortality was an estimated 23% higher at the 25th percentile (78mm Hg) of lowest mean arterial pressure compared with at the median of 87mm Hg, with adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) of 1.23 (1.12–1.355; p < 0.001). Overall results were generally similar in sensitivity analyses based on every hour of mean arterial pressure less than 80mm Hg and any mean arterial pressure less than 70mm Hg. Post hoc analyses showed that the relationship between ICU hypotension and outcomes depended on the amount of intraoperative hypotension. The risk of acute kidney injury increased over a range of minimum daily pressures from 110mm Hg to 50mm Hg, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.27 (95% CI, 1.18–1.37; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Increasing amounts of hypotension (defined by lowest mean arterial pressures per day) were strongly associated with myocardial injury, mortality, and renal injury in postoperative critical care patients.

### Blood pressure deficits in acute kidney injury: not all about the mean arterial pressure? [^112YtGka]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

To date, most studies have examined the MAP rather than specific components of the derived MAP. However, Saito and colleagues have examined patients on vasopressors who had undergone cardiovascular surgery with regard to the progression of AKI as defined by the KDIGO criteria. They measured time-weighted average values for premorbid and within-ICU haemodynamic pressure-related parameters including systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and MAP, and, in addition, central venous pressure (CVP; initially measured through inferior vena cava parameters (diameter and collapse) derived from outpatient echocardiography examinations and subsequently from direct measurements on the ICU). The mean perfusion pressure (MPP) and diastolic perfusion pressure (DPP) were calculated, with the differences between premorbid and ICU values determined and the calculated deficits in those values computed. This follows on from an observational cohort study that investigated mean deficits between premorbid and actual mean perfusion pressure in vasopressor-dependent ICU patients and identified "relative hypotension", reporting an association between the reduced MPP and the development of AKI. Both these studies focus once again on the pivotal role of renal blood flow in the development of AKI under certain conditions, particularly where renal hypoxia (at whatever level) is thought to be significant.

### Intraoperative hypotension and the risk of postoperative adverse outcomes: a systematic review [^1142E8i2]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intraoperative hypotension is a common side effect of general anaesthesia and might lead to inadequate organ perfusion. It is unclear to what extent hypotension during noncardiac surgery is associated with unfavourable outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL, and classified the quality of retrieved articles according to predefined adapted STROBE and CONSORT criteria. Reported strengths of associations from high-quality studies were classified into end-organ specific injury risks, such as acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, and stroke, and overall organ injury risks for various arterial blood pressure thresholds.

Results

We present an overview of 42 articles on reported associations between various absolute and relative intraoperative hypotension definitions and their associations with postoperative adverse outcomes after noncardiac surgery. Elevated risks of end-organ injury were reported for prolonged exposure (≥ 10 min) to mean arterial pressures < 80 mm Hg and for shorter durations < 70 mm Hg. Reported risks increase with increased durations for mean arterial pressures < 65–60 mm Hg or for any exposure < 55–50 mm Hg.

Conclusions

The reported associations suggest that organ injury might occur when mean arterial pressure decreases < 80 mm Hg for ≥ 10 min, and that this risk increases with blood pressures becoming progressively lower. Given the retrospective observational design of the studies reviewed, reflected by large variability in patient characteristics, hypotension definitions and outcomes, solid conclusions on which blood pressures under which circumstances are truly too low cannot be drawn. We provide recommendations for the design of future studies. CLINICAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: (PROSPERO ID). CRD42013005171.

The overriding message was the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations, and the expert panel thought the recommendations were generally reasonable but lacking in sufficient evidence support and felt that additional studies are greatly needed.

### Target blood pressure in sepsis: between a rock and a hard place [^1137jHMb]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The optimal target blood pressure in septic shock is still unknown. Therefore, in a long-term, resuscitated porcine model of fecal peritonitis-induced septic shock, Corrêa and colleagues tested whether different titrations of mean arterial pressure (50 to 60 and 75 to 85 mm Hg) would produce different effects on sepsis-related organ dysfunction. The higher blood pressure window was associated with increased needs for fluid resuscitation and norepinephrine support. However, titrating the lower blood pressure range coincided with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury. In contrast, neither the inflammatory response nor tissue mitochondrial activity showed any difference. This research paper in a clinically relevant model elegantly demonstrates that any standard resuscitation strategy may be a double-edged sword with respect to various therapeutic endpoints. Furthermore, it adds an important piece to the puzzle of the complex pathophysiology of sepsis-related acute kidney injury.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117Corcw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — therapeutic strategies for hypertension are as follows: In patients with diabetic or non-diabetic CKD, it is recommended that an office blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 140/90 mmHg be treated with lifestyle advice and BP-lowering medication, and it is recommended to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a range of 130–139 mmHg; individualized treatment should be considered according to its tolerability and impact on renal function and electrolytes. Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are more effective at reducing albuminuria than other antihypertensive agents and are recommended as part of the treatment strategy in hypertensive patients in the presence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria; a combination of a RAS blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic is recommended as initial therapy, whereas combinations of two RAS blockers are not recommended. In case of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), specifically eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², avoid thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and consider using a loop diuretic if required.

### Management of the potential organ donor in the ICU: Society of Critical Care Medicine / American College of Chest Physicians / association of organ procurement organizations consensus statement [^111i3Rk5]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamic management for organ preservation in the donor patient emphasizes volume optimization, monitoring, and defined targets. The primary goal of fluid management is to maximize perfusion for organ preservation, which can be achieved by ensuring adequate intravascular volume and appropriate cardiac output (CO), and a central venous catheter and/or pulmonary artery catheter provide continuous measurements of central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), CO, and cardiac index. Evidence cited includes that a negative or equalized fluid balance with CVP less than 6 mm Hg affected neither renal graft survival nor development of delayed graft function and that standardized hormone replacement therapy (HRT) plus a CVP less than 10 mm Hg significantly improved heart and lung procurement along with an increase in availability of kidneys for transplantation. Consensus guidance lists specific variables of adequate volume resuscitation including mean arterial pressure of 60–70 mm Hg, urinary output 1–3 mL/kg/hr, decrease in dose of vasoactive agents (dopamine ≤ 10 μg/kg/min), and left ventricle ejection fraction of at least 45%. Recommendations state that hypovolemia frequently is present at brain death and must be addressed promptly, that pulmonary artery or central venous catheter insertion or noninvasive monitoring techniques should be considered with serial or continuous measurements of CVP, PAOP, stroke volume, CO, cardiac index, and mixed venous oxygen saturation, and that fluid replacement using hemodynamic parameters, particularly CVP or PAOP, and targeted at maintaining euvolemia of the donor, is recommended during the entire donor management phase of care.

### A high mean arterial pressure target is associated with improved microcirculation in septic shock patients with previous hypertension: a prospective open label study [^114ka8A9]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock is a major cause of death in critically ill patients and is characterized by hypotension and hypoperfusion. Although mortality has been reported to be decreased due to the progress in therapy for septic shock, microcirculation abnormalities can still be present and contribute to hypoperfusion. Microvascular dysfunction is associated with organ dysfunction and mortality; moreover, early improvement in the microcirculation during resuscitation is associated with reduced organ failure. Therefore, therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the microcirculation are warranted to mitigate hypoperfusion and organ failure.

Maintaining sufficient perfusion pressure might be an important way to improve the microcirculatory perfusion. As one of the key determinants of perfusion pressure, adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) might reduce hypoperfusion and organ failure. Correa and colleagues have evaluated the effects of different MAP targets in septic pigs, and show that targeting a MAP between 50 and 60 mmHg in septic shock is associated with increased incidence of acute kidney injury when compared with a target MAP of between 75 and 85 mmHg. Moreover, Badin and colleagues have reported that acute kidney injury is decreased with a MAP of at least 72 mmHg. However, which MAP levels should be targeted to improve microcirculation remains controversial.

The optimal MAP target in septic shock patients, especially in patients with previous hypertension, is still unknown. The guidelines for treating septic shock have recommended that MAP should be maintained at a level of at least 65 mmHg, and emphasized a higher blood pressure for patients with previous hypertension. A recent published randomized controlled study has shown no difference in mortality in septic shock patients undergoing resuscitation with a high MAP target or a low MAP target. However, among chronic hypertensive patients, those in the high-target group require less renal replacement therapy, indicating that septic shock patients with chronic hypertension might need higher MAP to maintain microcirculation.

Our goal was to assess the effect on the microcirculation of MAP titration to normal levels in septic shock patients with previous hypertension. We hypothesized that the increase in MAP from 65 mmHg to the normal levels of patients is associated with improved sublingual microcirculation.

### Long-term renal consequences of hypertension for normal and diseased kidneys [^116JLT42]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence indicates that the adverse effects of hypertension on the kidney depend on the degree to which systemic blood pressure elevations are transmitted to the renal microvasculature. Such blood pressure transmission and consequent susceptibility to hypertensive renal damage is markedly exacerbated in states characterized by preglomerular vasodilation and an impairment of the normally protective renal autoregulatory mechanisms, e.g. diabetes or chronic renal disease. Moreover, this pathophysiology gives rise to the prediction that prevention of hypertension-induced barotrauma will require blood pressure to be reduced well into the normotensive range in such patients, as is being recognized in the currently recommended blood pressure goals. Agents that block the renin-angiotensin system should be preferred as initial therapy as they may provide additional risk reductions and minimize the potassium and magnesium depletion associated with the diuretic use usually necessary to achieve the lower blood pressure targets. The current failure to achieve optimal blood pressure reductions may be contributing not only to the still escalating incidence of end-stage renal disease in diabetic patients, but also to their greatly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

### Target value of mean arterial pressure in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy due to acute kidney injury [^115Lu4XT]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Target value of MAP related to high mortality

The nonlinear relationship between MAP and the risk of ICU mortality demonstrated that there seemed to be a target value of MAP related to increasing mortality (Fig. 2). To identify the target value, we used the penalized spline curve with a reference of which log hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% confidence interval were set to zero, and a referential MAP was defined when the minimal log HR was between 80 mmHg and 100 mmHg. When MAP was 82.7 mmHg, log HR started to increase, and its lower 95% confidence interval was > 0. Accordingly, 82.7 mmHg appeared to be the target value of MAP for ICU mortality.

Fig. 2
Nonlinear relationship between mean arterial pressure and mortality. The area indicates 95% confidence intervals. HR, hazard ratio

After dividing patients into high (≥ 82.7 mmHg) and low (< 82.7 mmHg) MAP groups, the low MAP group had different characteristics from the high MAP group based on age; sex; body weight; heart rate; serum values of hemoglobin, creatinine, and albumin; and APACHE II score (Table S1). Patients with low MAP had an additional 34.4% risk of ICU mortality compared with those with high MAP (Table 3). After several variables were adjusted in a stepwise fashion, the low MAP group was associated with high ICU mortality (Table 3). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves also supported these results (Fig. 3). Figure 4 demonstrates that the high risk of ICU mortality depending on the target value of MAP remained consistent irrespective of age, sex, diabetes mellitus, and other variables.

### Higher blood pressure versus normotension targets to prevent acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^111k9Eoq]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a global health burden, with an incidence of roughly 13.3 million cases per year, contributing to approximately 1.7 million deaths. AKI is linked to higher morbidity, death, and expenses.

AKI is a multicausal syndrome with complex pathophysiology, making the development of an effective treatment a challenging research area. To date, no effective pharmacologic therapy has been established to counteract the disorder. Consequently, according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) AKI guidelines, management of AKI should focus on implementing interventions to prevent its development, providing supportive care to prevent further injury, facilitate renal recovery and treat complications.

Renal hypoperfusion is one of the most common causes of AKI, especially in shock- and surgery-related AKI patients. Optimizing hemodynamics therefore is essential for the prevention and treatment of AKI in these settings. Among the strategies, maintaining a physiological MAP is necessary to ensure sufficient kidney perfusion pressure and microcirculatory blood flow. However, there were still conflicting results regarding the benefit of high MAP to renal outcomes.

Given the higher exposure to fluid and vasopressor use of higher MAP and the heterogeneous settings of AKI patients, it is essential to investigate: (1) whether higher MAP levels, compared to normotension, should be considered to prevent AKI, and (2) in which AKI settings higher MAP are more likely to be beneficial. We thus conducted a comprehensive review with meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials (RCT) that examined the effect of high versus normotensive MAP on AKI incidence or progression across common settings (shock, cardiac or non-cardiac surgery), and used meta-regression to examine several characteristics that may serve as effect-modifiers.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for management of blood pressure in CKD [^113n4Snd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO blood pressure management in chronic kidney disease emphasizes evidence gaps and debated targets. The evidence base is limited, with "no 1A recommendations" and a "serious paucity of evidence". For patients with CKD without diabetes, KDIGO "Recommendations 3.2, 3.3, and 4.2" state to treat to "a systolic blood pressure ≤ 130 mm Hg (2C and 2D)", which "may result in less albuminuria than a less stringent goal of < 140 mm Hg", but it is "hard to show the benefit at the 130-mm Hg systolic goal". The commentary notes "it makes intuitive sense to recommend measures to reduce body mass index in obese patients (Recommendation 2.3.1)", yet "the better survival of dialysis patients with higher body mass index gives one pause about a blanket implementation of this recommendation", and "while sodium restriction is beneficial for most, it may worsen renal function after renal transplantation or with salt-losing tubulopathies". Evidence from trials remains limited; "Lower systolic blood pressure goals did not protect kidney function in diabetic patients in the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) Study", and ongoing research is highlighted: "SPRINT is > 90% through recruitment and should address the 140- versus 120-mm Hg systolic pressure treatment goal in nondiabetic patients with CKD, including the elderly".

### Increasing mean arterial blood pressure in sepsis: effects on fluid balance, vasopressor load and renal function [^115gKE7e]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of two different mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) targets on needs for resuscitation, organ dysfunction, mitochondrial respiration and inflammatory response in a long-term model of fecal peritonitis.

Methods

Twenty-four anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs were randomly assigned (n = 8/group) to a septic control group (septic-CG) without resuscitation until death or one of two groups with resuscitation performed after 12 hours of untreated sepsis for 48 hours, targeting MAP 50–60 mmHg (low-MAP) or 75–85 mmHg (high-MAP).

Results

MAP at the end of resuscitation was 56 ± 13 mmHg (mean ± SD) and 76 ± 17 mmHg respectively, for low-MAP and high-MAP groups. One animal each in high- and low-MAP groups, and all animals in septic-CG died (median survival time: 21.8 hours, inter-quartile range: 16.3–27.5 hours). Norepinephrine was administered to all animals of the high-MAP group (0.38 (0.21–0.56) mcg/kg/min), and to three animals of the low-MAP group (0.00 (0.00–0.25) mcg/kg/min; P = 0.009). The high-MAP group had a more positive fluid balance (3.3 ± 1.0 mL/kg/h vs. 2.3 ± 0.7 mL/kg/h; P = 0.001). Inflammatory markers, skeletal muscle ATP content and hemodynamics other than MAP did not differ between low- and high-MAP groups. The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) after 12 hours of untreated sepsis was, respectively for low- and high-MAP groups, 50% (4/8) and 38% (3/8), and in the end of the study 57% (4/7) and 0% (P = 0.026). In septic-CG, maximal isolated skeletal muscle mitochondrial Complex I, State 3 respiration increased from 1357 ± 149 pmol/s/mg to 1822 ± 385 pmol/s/mg, (P = 0.020). In high- and low-MAP groups, permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers Complex IV-state 3 respiration increased during resuscitation (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

The MAP targets during resuscitation did not alter the inflammatory response, nor affected skeletal muscle ATP content and mitochondrial respiration. While targeting a lower MAP was associated with increased incidence of AKI, targeting a higher MAP resulted in increased net positive fluid balance and vasopressor load during resuscitation. The long-term effects of different MAP targets need to be evaluated in further studies.

### Perioperative individualized hemodynamic optimization according to baseline mean arterial pressure in cardiac surgery patients: rationale and design of the OPTIPAM randomized trial [^1136et4K]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) remain high despite recent advances in both anesthesia and perioperative management. Among modifiable risk factors for postoperative complications, optimal arterial pressure during and after surgery has been under debate for years. Recent data suggest that optimizing arterial pressure to the baseline of the patient may improve outcomes. We hypothesize that optimizing the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to the baseline MAP of the patient during cardiac surgery with CPB and during the first 24 hours postoperatively may improve outcomes.

Study Design

The OPTIPAM trial (NCT05403697) will be a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial testing the superiority of optimized MAP management as compared with a MAP of 65 mm Hg or more during both the intraoperative and postoperative periods in 1,100 patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with CPB. The primary composite end point is the occurrence of acute kidney injury, neurological complications including stroke or postoperative delirium, and death. The secondary end points are hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, Day 7 and Day 90 mortality, postoperative cognitive dysfunction on Day 7 and Day 90, and quality of life at Day 7 and Day 90. Two interim analyses will assess the safety of the intervention.

Conclusion

The OPTIPAM trial will assess the effectiveness of an individualized target of mean arterial pressure in cardiac surgery with CPB in reducing postoperative morbidity.

Clinical Trial Registration

### The effects of vasopressor choice on renal outcomes in septic shock: a systematic review of randomised trials as a guide for future research [^113FXjer]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Amongst patients with sepsis the most severely affected will be in septic shock, defined as a requirement for vasopressor therapy and a raised serum lactate. The mortality rate in this patient population is in the region of 35–40%. Although incompletely understood in terms of mechanism, patients with septic shock are at high risk for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). This syndrome accounts for almost half of all cases of AKI seen in the critically ill, and results in a further increase in mortality of up to 70%. Understanding specific risk factors for AKI, as well as possible preventative measures, is therefore of vital importance in the management of critically ill septic patients.

Vasopressors are the mainstay of vasodilatory shock management. In addition to classically used catecholamines, non-adrenergic vasopressors are commercially available that target either the vasopressin pathway or renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends intravenous crystalloid resuscitation as well as norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets. Where norepinephrine alone is insufficient, it is suggested that vasopressin be added as a second agent. However, the SSC describe the evidence underpinning these recommendations as high quality only when first line norepinephrine is compared to dopamine. When compared to other catecholamines and non-adrenergic vasopressors the evidence is of moderate, low or very low quality. In addition, the evidence underpinning the recommendation of vasopressin, where a second agent is required, is of moderate quality. This paucity of good quality evidence perhaps contributes to the apparent variation in standards of care relating to vasopressors. In addition, these guidelines do not fully consider cost, which can be important.

### Perioperative care of patients undergoing major complex spinal instrumentation surgery: clinical practice guidelines from the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care [^115gsbo7]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

Blood pressure targets — complex spine surgery evidence indicates that no evidence was found regarding blood pressure targets during complex spine procedures, though a meta-analysis of spinal cord injuries reported a low level of evidence for a recommended mean arterial pressure target ≥ 85 mm Hg. The incidence of acute kidney injury after noncardiac surgery is reported to be between 3.9% and 9.8%. Patients with medium risk demonstrated associations between severe range intraoperative hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 50 mm Hg) and acute kidney injury (adjusted odds ratio = 1.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.16–1.56), and in patients with the highest risk, mild hypotension ranges (mean arterial pressure 55 to 59 mm Hg) were associated with acute kidney injury (adjusted odds ratio = 2.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.65–4.16). According to the 2019 practice advisory update, deliberate hypotension should only be used on a case-by-case basis. Recommendation: Information related to baseline blood pressure, the presence of neurological deficits, and preexisting end-organ injury may influence intraoperative mean arterial blood pressure targets which must be individualized to the patient (Class I, Level of Evidence C-EO).

### Target value of mean arterial pressure in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy due to acute kidney injury [^114gLzpj]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently have instability in mean arterial pressure (MAP), no consensus exists on the target value of MAP related to high mortality after CRRT.

Methods

A total of 2,292 patients who underwent CRRT due to AKI in three referral hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. The MAPs were divided into tertiles, and the 3 rd tertile group served as a reference in the analyses. The major outcome was all-cause mortality during the intensive care unit period. The odds ratio (OR) of mortality was calculated using logistic regression after adjustment for multiple covariates. The nonlinear relationship regression model was applied to determine the threshold value of MAP related to increasing mortality.

Results

The mean value of MAP was 80.7 ± 17.3 mmHg at the time of CRRT initiation. The median intensive care unit stay was 5 days (interquartile range, 2–12 days), and during this time, 1,227 (55.5%) patients died. The 1 st tertile group of MAP showed an elevated risk of mortality compared with the 3 rd tertile group (adjusted OR, 1.28 [1.03–1.60]; P = 0.029). In the nonlinear regression analysis, the threshold value of MAP was calculated as 82.7 mmHg. Patients with MAP < 82.7 mmHg had a higher mortality rate than those with ≥ 82.7 mmHg (adjusted OR, 1.21 [1.01–1.45]; P = 0.037).

Conclusions

Low MAP at CRRT initiation is associated with a high risk of mortality, particularly when it is < 82.7 mmHg. This value may be used for risk classification and as a potential therapeutic target.

### Relationship between intraoperative mean arterial pressure and clinical outcomes after noncardiac surgery: toward an empirical definition of hypotension [^112rtb1N]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intraoperative hypotension may contribute to postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and myocardial injury, but what blood pressures are unsafe is unclear. The authors evaluated the association between the intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the risk of AKI and myocardial injury.

Methods

The authors obtained perioperative data for 33,330 noncardiac surgeries at the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio. The authors evaluated the association between intraoperative MAP from less than 55 to 75 mmHg and postoperative AKI and myocardial injury to determine the threshold of MAP where risk is increased. The authors then evaluated the association between the duration below this threshold and their outcomes adjusting for potential confounding variables.

Results

AKI and myocardial injury developed in 2,478 (7.4%) and 770 (2.3%) surgeries, respectively. The MAP threshold where the risk for both outcomes increased was less than 55 mmHg. Compared with never developing a MAP less than 55 mmHg, those with a MAP less than 55 mmHg for 1–5, 6–10, 11–20, and more than 20min had graded increases in their risk of the two outcomes (AKI: 1.18 [95% CI, 1.06–1.31], 1.19 [1.03–1.39], 1.32 [1.11–1.56], and 1.51 [1.24–1.84], respectively; myocardial injury 1.30 [1.06–1.5], 1.47 [1.13–1.93], 1.79 [1.33–2.39], and 1.82 [1.31–2.55], respectively].

Conclusions

Even short durations of an intraoperative MAP less than 55 mmHg are associated with AKI and myocardial injury. Randomized trials are required to determine whether outcomes improve with interventions that maintain an intraoperative MAP of at least 55 mmHg.

### The salutary blood pressure of a solitary kidney [^1111SLaf]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical utility of aortic stiffness measurements is impeded by the need for dedicated expensive instruments and the time required per analysis (about 20 min), which restricts this method to the research setting. Also, in lieu of therapeutic options, these measurements are largely prognostic factors which are not to be acted upon. This is unlike blood pressure measurements. Although improved after transplantation, hypertension is common in kidney recipients. Blood pressure increases in kidney donors long term, and becomes more common with time since donation. For patients with end-stage kidney failure and their clinicians, the attention should be on optimizing antihypertensive treatment, ensuring timely access to transplantation, and providing life-long follow-up of both donors and recipients.

### Efficacy of targeting high mean arterial pressure for older patients with septic shock (OPTPRESS): a multicentre, pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^113feQNa]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Consistent with previous trials, the actual MAP in the control group exceeded the target range. Since more than half of patients no longer did not receive vasopressors after 42 h of randomization in the control group, it was considered that the excess was largely led by improved patient condition, not by the issue of protocol compliance. Meanwhile, some patients could not reach the target MAP even with high-dose vasopressor because of their poor condition. This difference in target and observed MAP is the reason why this topic can be appropriately examined only in randomized trials rather than analysis of existing observed data. Although the difference in MAP between the groups was smaller than trial protocol, clear separation in MAP between the arms from 8 h of randomisation means that it is reasonable to compare the effect.

In this trial, while the administered fluid volume was similar between the arms, the cumulative amount of vasopressors was higher in the high-target group. As suggested in a previous prospective study, the vasopressor-related risks might have outweighed the hypotension-related risks in the high-target MAP strategy with increased exposure to vasopressors. Theoretically, there is a risk of organ ischemia due to excessive vasoconstriction. Increased risk of various comorbidities in older population may make them more vulnerable to vasopressors-induced adverse events. However, although adverse events were more frequent in the high-target group, there were no differences in causes of death other than sepsis, including the death due to ischemic events, between the arms (ESM 3, Table E6 and Figure E2). It was reported that vasopressors have immune effects potentially influencing the outcome of septic shock. Norepinephrine is suggested to have immunosuppressive and bacterial growth-promoting effects in preclinical models. Contrary to a previous trial that suggested the benefits of a high MAP target for renal function in patients with chronic hypertension, such a trend was not observed regarding MAKE development and RRT-free days. The difference in baseline conditions, including age and prevalence of chronic kidney disease, might have caused these differences. Another trial that included patients aged ≥ 65 years and compared the effect of target MAP reported no difference in renal replacement days.

### A plea for personalization of the hemodynamic management of septic shock [^1155RuyA]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

*Whatever pressure is higher

Most organs have the endogenous ability to preserve the microcirculation within a certain range of perfusion pressures. For instance, heart and brain can maintain a constant blood flow despite large changes in perfusion pressure. In case the pressure falls below the organ-specific autoregulation zone, organ blood flow becomes dependent on inflow pressure, hence the focus on reversing hypotension during the salvage state.

The heterogeneity of patients, distinct organ-specific microcirculatory regulation, variable receptor density, and the impact of pharmacological interactions make a uniform approach to septic shock challenging. The SSC Guidelines recommend an initial MAP target of 65 mmHg but include no recommendations for later stages. Observational data suggest that organ dysfunction may sometimes already begin when MAP falls below 75–80 mmHg, but reaching higher MAP targets often requires higher doses of vasopressors which may be associated with more adverse events. Trials randomizing septic patients to MAP targets ~ 65 mmHg or even less compared to ~ 75 and ~ 85 mmHg showed no difference in mortality. A beneficial impact of higher MAP on renal function in previously hypertensive patients can be observed but is not systematic. Differences in the effect of higher MAP targets on renal function may in part be explained by a high variability in the response in renal blood flow to an increase in MAP. The failure of the "one size fits all" approach was also demonstrated in patients with hypotension. An analysis of 3542 critically ill patients with shock showed that patients with naturally low BP (systolic BP < 100 mmHg) were treated for longer and with higher doses of norepinephrine and had a longer ICU stay and higher mortality. Accordingly, while an initial MAP target of 65 mmHg seems a reasonable approach for many patients, the ideal MAP should be individualized and ideally be based on a MAP challenge. The MAP challenge consists in the evaluation of changes in perfusion indices such as urine output, level of consciousness, and cutaneous perfusion during a transient increase in MAP. If beneficial effects are observed, this new MAP target can be used, if inefficient or not tolerated then the initial MAP value should be targeted.

### Individualized mean arterial pressure targets in critically ill patients guided by non-invasive cerebral-autoregulation: a scoping review [^114pZbuY]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend a uniform mean arterial pressure (MAP) target for resuscitating critically ill patients; for example, 65 mmHg for patients with sepsis and post-cardiac arrest. However, since cerebral autoregulation capacity likely varies widely in patients, uniform target may be insufficient in maintaining cerebral perfusion. Personalized MAP targets, based on a non-invasive determination of cerebral autoregulation, may optimize perfusion and reduce complications.

Objectives

This scoping review summarizes the numerical values, feasibility, and clinical data on personalized MAP targets in critically ill patients. The focus is on non-invasive monitoring, such as near-infrared spectroscopy and transcranial doppler ultrasound, due to their safety, practicality and applicability to patients with- and without brain injury.

Methods

Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a systematic search of Ovid MedLine, Embase (Ovid), and the Cochrane Library (Wiley) was conducted on September 28, 2023. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts for eligibility and manually reviewed references.

Results

Of 7,738 studies were identified, 49 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 45 (92%) were observational and 4 (8%) were interventional. Patient populations included cardiac surgery (26, 53%), non-cardiac major surgery (4, 8%), cardiac arrest (8, 16%), brain injury (7, 14%), respiratory failure and shock (3, 6%), and sepsis (3, 6%). Optimal MAP was reported in 24 (49%), lower limit of autoregulation in 23 (47%), and upper limit of autoregulation in 10 studies (20%). Thirty-four studies reported partial data loss due to software failures, anomalous data, insufficient natural MAP fluctuation, and workflow barriers. Available randomized controlled trials (RCT) identified challenges with maintaining patients within their target range. Studies explored the associations between personalized MAP targets and a wide range of neurological and non-neurological outcomes, with the most significant and consistent associations identified for acute kidney injury and major morbidity and mortality. Ten studies investigated demographic predictors identifying only few predictors of personalized targets.

Conclusion

Preliminary investigations suggest considerable variability in personalized MAP targets, which may explain differences in clinical outcomes among critically ill populations. Key gaps remain, including a lack of observational studies in critically ill subpopulations other than cardiac surgery and well-designed RCTs. Resolving identified feasibility barriers might be crucial to successfully carrying out future studies.

### Optimizing mean arterial pressure in septic shock: a critical reappraisal of the literature [^111mbMhq]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Effects on mortality

In two of the observational studies, MAP levels of less than 60 to 70 mm Hg were independent determinants of mortality. However, in a post hoc analysis, Dünser and colleagues found no association between MAP and mortality.

In a large randomized clinical trial of 776 patients, Asfar and colleagues compared the effects of low-target and high-target MAP on mortality. The study was designed to show an absolute 10% difference in mortality at day 28, assuming a mortality rate of 45%. The patients were allocated to protocols targeting MAPs of 65 to 70 mm Hg or 80 to 85 mm Hg for 5 days. As expected, the doses of norepinephrine were higher in the high-MAP target group than in the low-target group, but the cumulative fluid balance was similar. The 28-day mortality rate was 35% in both groups. The only difference was a higher rate of de novo atrial fibrillation in the high-target group (6.7% versus 2.8%, P = 0.02). Chronic arterial hypertension was reported in 44% of patients, and in a predefined stratum analysis of these patients, targeting a MAP of 80 to 85 mm Hg was associated with better renal function (lower rate of serum creatinine doubling and renal replacement therapy requirements). However, as also reported in one of the observational studies, there was no clear relationship between mortality and AKI. Consequently, this finding would suggest that targeting a MAP of 65 to 70 mm Hg or 80 to 85 mm Hg has similar effects on survival in a heterogeneous population of patients with septic shock. Of note, one limitation of this study was that the actual MAP achieved in the low-target group was 75 mm Hg instead of 65 to 70 mm Hg.

### Prior exposure to angiotensin II receptor blockers in patients with septic shock to individualize mean arterial pressure target? A post hoc analysis of the sepsis and mean arterial pressure (SEPSISPAM) trial [^114Mt7oV]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Individualizing a target mean arterial pressure is challenging during the initial resuscitation of patients with septic shock. The Sepsis and Mean Arterial Pressure (SEPSISPAM) trial suggested that targeting high mean arterial pressure might reduce the occurrence of acute kidney injury among those included patients with a past history of chronic hypertension. We investigated whether the class of antihypertensive medications used before the ICU stay in chronic hypertensive patients was associated with the severity of acute kidney injury occurring after inclusion, according to mean arterial pressure target.

Design

Post hoc analysis of the SEPSISPAM trial.

Setting

The primary outcome was the occurrence of severe acute kidney injury during the ICU stay defined as kidney disease improving global outcome stage 2 or higher. Secondary outcomes were mortality at day 28 and mortality at day 90.

Patients

All patients with chronic hypertension included in SEPSISPAM with available antihypertensive medications data in the hospitalization report were included.

Measurements and Main Results

We analyzed 297 patients. Severe acute kidney injury occurred in 184 patients, without difference according to pre-ICU exposure to antihypertensive medications. Patients with pre-ICU exposure to angiotensin II receptor blockers had significantly less severe acute kidney injury in the high mean arterial pressure target group (adjusted odd ratio 0.24 with 95% CI [0.09–0.66]; p = 0.006). No statistically significant association was found after adjustment for pre-ICU exposure to antihypertensive medications and survival.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that patients with septic shock and chronic hypertension treated with angiotensin II receptor blocker may benefit from a high mean arterial pressure target to reduce the risk of acute kidney injury occurrence.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, BP targets, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering less intensive BP-lowering therapy in patients with frailty, high risk of falls and fractures, very limited life expectancy, or symptomatic postural hypotension, compared to targeting a SBP < 120 mmHg in patients without those conditions.

### Evaluation and treatment of renal artery stenosis: impact on blood pressure and renal function [^112ai1vW]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The conventional non-invasive tests to diagnose renal artery stenosis in a general hypertensive population are not accurate enough for screening purposes. Magnetic resonance angiography might become the new gold standard, with the advantages of the absence of contrast toxicity, good accuracy, and information on flow characteristics. With regard to the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal artery stenosis, intervention is advised only when blood pressure cannot be controlled by at least three antihypertensive drugs. Patency after stenting is superior to angioplasty, although its clinical benefit has not been proved. As for renal function, evidence - although from uncontrolled studies - for the preservation of renal function by intervention is accumulating, especially in those patients with bilateral stenosis or stenosis in a single functioning kidney.

### Minimizing catecholamines and optimizing perfusion [^115RuyoR]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Which targets?

The targets of resuscitation include perfusion pressure and various indices of tissue hypoperfusion.

What is the optimal blood pressure target? Varpula et al. first demonstrated in 111 patients with septic shock that the time spent with MAP below 65 mmHg was associated with a worse outcome. Several trials not only confirmed this finding, but even further expanded this reporting that MAP threshold levels lower than 65 were associated with even more severe outcomes. Interestingly, mortality already increases with shorter periods of time when thresholds of MAP lower than 65 mmHg are considered compared to the 65 mmHg threshold. On the contrary, there was no association between mortality and time spent with below MAP thresholds 80–85 mmHg (but above 65 mmHg). Altogether, these observational studies support a MAP threshold around 65 mmHg for the majority of the patients.

However, the optimal MAP threshold may require some individualization. In a series of patients with sepsis but without clinical signs of hypoperfusion, a MAP between 55 and 65 mmHg was well tolerated. In an interventional trial evaluating a MAP threshold of 65–70 versus 80–85 mmHg, no differences in survival were observed. In the subgroup of patients previously hypertensive, the higher MAP target was associated with a reduction in acute kidney injury. However, there was also a significant increase in arrhythmic events and a trend toward an increase in acute myocardial infarction. This trial had two major limitations. First, MAP was much higher than the predefined target value in the lower threshold group so that the safety of MAP 65 was not really evaluated. Second, the trial attributed patients to one group or the other without considering the response to therapy. Interestingly, different MAP targets had variable effects on various indices of tissue hypoperfusion and organ function in several small size interventional studies. Hence, the recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines to initially target MAP of 65 mmHg remain valid. In selected patients, a higher MAP may be considered, but the effects of increasing MAP above 65 mmHg should be carefully evaluated and returning to lower MAP thresholds should be considered if the patient does not respond to this MAP challenge.

### Managing kidney disease with blood-pressure control [^112W1F7M]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

The progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is largely independent of the underlying kidney disorder once renal function has fallen below a critical level. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for disease progression in both adult and pediatric patients with kidney disorders. Increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that the rate of CKD progression can be lowered by pharmacological interventions. Nephroprotective strategies currently focus on the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers provide efficient control not only of blood pressure, but also of proteinuria, an effect associated with improved long-term nephroprotection compared with other antihypertensive drug classes. In addition, evidence for an additional nephroprotective advantage of tight blood-pressure control towards the low-normal range in young patients and patients with proteinuria is emerging. In this Review, we describe the role of hypertension in CKD and discuss the therapeutic principle of the prevention of CKD progression with antihypertensive agents.

### Fine-mapping the association of acute kidney injury with mean arterial and central venous pressures during coronary artery bypass surgery [^112wXR53]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior studies identified thresholds for mean arterial pressure (MAP < 65 mm Hg) and central venous pressure (CVP > 12 mm Hg) beyond which risk for cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) increases. Optimal hemodynamic targets-that is, where active protection from AKI is observed-are unclear; however, current guidelines suggest maintaining MAP > 65 and CVP 8 to 12. The aim of this study was to identify hemodynamic ranges associated with both increased and decreased risk of AKI by evaluating narrow ranges of MAP, CVP, and joint exposure to MAP and CVP concurrently.

Methods

In a retrospective cohort study of adults undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, we fine-mapped the association between AKI and the total number of minutes spent in each of the following narrow hemodynamic ranges: 14 MAP ranges in increments of 5 mm Hg (45–115), 10 CVP ranges in increments of 2 mm Hg (0–20), and 70 joint MAP/CVP ranges. Separate multivariable regression models estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for each range including adjustments for correlations and multiple comparisons across ranges. Joint MAP/CVP ranges were grouped into 5 hemodynamic zones based on contiguity of the ranges and similarity of ORs observed across ranges in a color-coded heatmap. The 5 MAP/CVP zones were included in a single regression model to assess risk for AKI associated with time spent in each hemodynamic zone, independent of time spent in other zones.

Results

In 1199 participants, incidence of AKI was 28%. For every 5-minute spent in each hemodynamic range, risk of AKI was significantly increased in MAP range 45 to 50 (aOR 1.18; p = 0.002), 50 to 55 (aOR 1.13; p = 0.001), and 55 to 60 mm Hg (aOR 1.06; p = 0.001); and significantly decreased in MAP range 90 to 95 mm Hg (aOR 0.85; P < .001). Risk of AKI was significantly increased in CVP range 16 to 18 mm Hg (aOR 1.07; p = 0.002) and significantly decreased in CVP range 4 to 6 mm Hg (aOR 0.97; p = 0.025). In joint analyses, both MAP and CVP contributed to AKI risk estimates; risk decreased as CVP decreased within every MAP range and was significantly lower for joint ranges of CVP < 8 and MAP > 75. In analyses containing all 5 MAP/CVP hemodynamic zones, risk estimates suggested protection from AKI in zone 1 (high MAP/low CVP) and increased risk of AKI in zones 3 to 5 (low MAP/high CVP).

Conclusions

Fine-mapping identified narrow ranges of MAP, CVP, and joint MAP/CVP associated with both AKI risk and protection. This report is among the first to characterize the association between joint MAP/CVP and AKI. Contrary to current guidelines, there was no evidence for protection associated with MAP 65 to 75 or CVP 8 to 12 mm Hg.

### Renal autoregulation and blood pressure management in circulatory shock [^112rPmJS]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Remaining questions and future research

Studies have revealed that low MAP may be associated with increased mortality in cardiogenic shock. Similarly, multiple observational studies in septic shock have reported that repetitive reductions in MAP or RPP are associated with adverse renal outcome. So far, this has mainly raised discussion about which MAP threshold should be targeted when titrating norepinephrine in these patients. Indeed, results from the SEPSISPAM study suggest that septic patients with previous arterial hypertension may benefit from higher MAP targets, which is in line with the rightward shift of the A LL observed in many experimental models of hypertension. However, some data suggest that not all patients with hypertension display a similar shift. For example, patients with severe hypertension and signs of renal injury are likely to have no renal autoregulation and whether aiming for a higher RPP would be beneficial in these cases, particularly in view of the protective properties of renal autoregulation, remains unknown. Furthermore, experimental data indicate that the choice of vasopressor could have a direct influence on renal autoregulation, which may help to reduce the risk of renal hypoperfusion in shock. Finally, whether fluid administration affects renal autoregulation is unknown.

### Prevention of acute kidney injury and protection of renal function in the intensive care unit: update 2017: expert opinion of the working group on prevention, AKI section, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^117ND2nJ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit is associated with significant mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine and update previous recommendations for the prevention of AKI, specifically the role of fluids, diuretics, inotropes, vasopressors/vasodilators, hormonal and nutritional interventions, sedatives, statins, remote ischaemic preconditioning and care bundles.

Method

A systematic search of the literature was performed for studies published between 1966 and March 2017 using these potential protective strategies in adult patients at risk of AKI. The following clinical conditions were considered: major surgery, critical illness, sepsis, shock, exposure to potentially nephrotoxic drugs and radiocontrast. Clinical endpoints included incidence or grade of AKI, the need for renal replacement therapy and mortality. Studies were graded according to the international GRADE system.

Results

We formulated 12 recommendations, 13 suggestions and seven best practice statements. The few strong recommendations with high-level evidence are mostly against the intervention in question (starches, low-dose dopamine, statins in cardiac surgery). Strong recommendations with lower-level evidence include controlled fluid resuscitation with crystalloids, avoiding fluid overload, titration of norepinephrine to a target MAP of 65–70 mmHg (unless chronic hypertension) and not using diuretics or levosimendan for kidney protection solely.

Conclusion

The results of recent randomised controlled trials have allowed the formulation of new recommendations and/or increase the strength of previous recommendations. On the other hand, in many domains the available evidence remains insufficient, resulting from the limited quality of the clinical trials and the poor reporting of kidney outcomes.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — blood pressure (BP) targets and renin–angiotensin system therapy: The prevalence of hypertension is 67% to 92% among people with CKD, and in SPRINT intensive BP treatment with mean achieved SBP 121 mm Hg versus standard treatment with mean achieved SBP 136 mm Hg reduced the risk of CVD, including among those with CKD. The recommendation in this guideline is for a treatment goal SBP < 130 mm Hg. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended for initial treatment of hypertension in CKD when albuminuria is moderate or severe (≥ 30 mg/g) and may be considered for lower level albuminuria (< 30 mg/g) based on expert opinion; these recommendations refer to people with nondialysis-requiring CKD, and ACEI or ARB is also appropriate for less-severe CKD (stage 1 or 2) when moderate or severe albuminuria is present. Supporting data include an analysis of CKD patients from 4 trials finding an SBP target of < 130 mm Hg (versus < 140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality and a meta-analysis of CKD subsets from 18 trials where more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) control resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality; while < 120 mm Hg is more effective at preventing CVD events, meta-analyses support SBP < 130 mm Hg to balance benefits and risks. With ACEI/ARB therapy, these agents reduce intraglomerular pressure and may cause a transient dip in eGFR up to 30%; this short-term decline is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEI or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEI or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation; ACEI or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/ min/1.73 m2, and the combined use of an ACEI and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for management of blood pressure in CKD [^114vv475]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 6.2 in children with CKD ND — evidence basis and feasibility are questioned: Recommendation 6.2 is problematic for several reasons. First, there is no scientific evidence to support a measurable benefit from reducing office blood pressure to less than the 50th percentile in children with CKD. In the ESCAPE trial, enhanced blood pressure control, defined as 24-hour mean ambulatory blood pressure lower than the 50th percentile, resulted in a slower rate of progression in children with stage 2–4 CKD. Second, the document suggests reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure to lower than the 50th percentile, while the evidence is based on mean ambulatory blood pressure lower than the 50th percentile. Ambulatory blood pressure values are generally higher than the office values in children, and there are no data indicating the level of office systolic or diastolic blood pressure equivalent to the 50th percentile ambulatory mean arterial pressure (MAP), leaving clinicians uncertain about the corresponding office level and making implementation challenging.

### Adenocaine and Mg (2 +) reduce fluid requirement to maintain hypotensive resuscitation and improve cardiac and renal function in a porcine model of severe hemorrhagic shock* [^111Ds6tg]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hypotensive resuscitation is gaining clinical acceptance in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock. Our aims were to investigate: 1) the effect of 7.5% NaCl with adenocaine (adenosine and lidocaine, AL) and AL with Mg (ALM) on fluid requirement to maintain a minimum mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg, and 2) the effect of a second bolus of 0.9% NaCl with AL during return of shed blood on cardiac and renal function in a porcine model of hemorrhagic shock.

Design

Pigs were randomized to: Sham (n = 5), Sham + ALM/AL (n = 5), hemorrhage control (n = 11), or hemorrhage + ALM/AL (n = 9). Hemorrhage animals were bled to a mean arterial pressure of 35 mm Hg. After 90 mins, pigs were fluid resuscitated with Ringers acetate and 20 mL 7.5% NaCl with ALM to maintain a target mean arterial pressure of minimum 50 mm Hg. Shed blood and 0.9% NaCl with AL were infused 30 mins later. Hemorrhage control group was subjected to the same protocol but without ALM/AL. Hemodynamics, cardiodynamics (pressure-volume analysis), oxygen consumption, and kidney function were measured for 6 hrs.

Setting

University hospital laboratory.

Subjects

Female farm-bred pigs.

Results

Fluid volume infused during hypotensive resuscitation was 40% less in the 7.5% NaCl-/ALM-treated pigs than controls (25 vs. 41 mL/kg, p < .05). ALM was associated with a significant increase in dp/dtmax, end-systolic blood pressure, and systemic vascular resistance. Return of shed blood and 0.9% NaCl/AL reduced whole body oxygen consumption by 27% (p < .05), and significantly improved the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship and preload recruitable stroke work compared to controls. Glomerular filtration rate in the ALM/AL group returned to 83% of baseline compared to 54% in controls (p = .01).

Conclusion

Resuscitation with 7.5% NaCl ALM increases cardiac function and reduces fluid requirements during hypotensive resuscitation, whereas a second AL infusion during blood resuscitation transiently reduces whole body oxygen consumption and improves cardiac and renal function.

Standardized measurement requirement and caution: The commentary notes that "standardized BP measurements should be obtained when managing high BP because the actual achieved SBP may be lower than 120 mm Hg if nonstandardized clinic BP measurements are utilized", and that it "would be potentially hazardous to apply the recommended SBP target of < 120 mm Hg to BP measurements obtained in a non-standardized manner".

### Hemodynamic monitoring in the critically ill: spanning the range of kidney function [^112TYgQW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients often have deranged hemodynamics. Physical examination, central venous pressure, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure ("wedge") have been shown to be unreliable at assessing volume status, volume responsiveness, and adequacy of cardiac output in critically ill patients. Thus, invasive and noninvasive cardiac output monitoring is a core feature of evaluating and managing a hemodynamically unstable patient. In this review, we discuss the various techniques and options of cardiac output assessment available to clinicians for hemodynamic monitoring in the intensive care unit. Issues related to patients with kidney disease, such as timing and location of arterial and central venous catheters and the approach to hemodynamics in patients treated by long-term dialysis also are discussed.

### The effects of arterial pressure during normothermic kidney perfusion [^114e4B8V]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ex vivo normothermic perfusion (EVNP) can reverse some of the detrimental effects of ischemic injury. However, in kidneys with warm and cold ischemic injury the optimal perfusion pressure remains undetermined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two different arterial pressures during EVNP.

Methods

Porcine kidneys underwent static cold storage for 23 h followed by 1 h of EVNP using leukocyte depleted blood at a mean arterial pressure of either 55 or 75 mm Hg. After this, kidneys were reperfused for 3 h to assess renal function and injury. This was compared with a control group that underwent 24 h cold storage.

Results

During EVNP, kidneys perfused at 75 mm Hg had a higher renal blood flow, increased oxygen consumption (median 59.9 mL/min/g (range 30.1–78.6] versus 31.8 [8.2–53.8] mL/min/g; P = 0.026), and produced more urine (P = 0.002) than kidneys perfused at 55 mm Hg. During ex vivo reperfusion, renal blood flow was significantly higher in the 75 mm Hg and 55 mm Hg groups compared with the control (area under the curve median 75 mm Hg 462 [228–745], 55 mm Hg 454 [254–923] versus control 262 [215–442] mL/min/100g.h; P = 0.040). There was a significant loss of renal function and increase in tubular injury in the 55 mm Hg group kidneys (P = 0.001, 0.007). Levels of endothelin 1 were significantly reduced in the 75 mm Hg group (P = 0.026).

Conclusions

A mean arterial pressure of 75 mm Hg during EVNP resulted in less tubular damage and less endothelial injury during ex vivo reperfusion compared with kidneys perfused at 55 mm Hg.

### Low blood pressure threshold for adverse outcomes during left ventricular assist device support [^112y1fjB]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that maintaining low mean arterial pressure (MAP) in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients is associated with a reduced risk of stroke/death. However, the lower limit of the optimal MAP range has not been established. We aimed to identify this lower limit in a contemporary cohort of LVAD recipients with frequent longitudinal MAP measurements. We analyzed 86,651 MAP measurements in 309 patients with an LVAD (32% LVADs with full magnetic levitation of the impeller) at a tertiary medical center during a mean follow-up of 1.7 ± 1.1 years. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to study the association of serial MAP measurements with stroke/death within 3 years after index discharge. Multivariate analysis identified MAP ≤ 75 mm Hg, compared with MAP > 75 mm Hg, as the low MAP threshold associated with increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 4.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.85 to 7.87, p < 0.001), stroke (HR 2.72;, 95% CI 1.39 to 5.33, p = 0.01), and stroke/death (HR 4.45, 95% CI 2.83 to 6.99, p < 0.001). The risk associated with MAP ≤ 75 mm Hg was consistent in subgroups categorized by age, gender, race, device type, renal function, right-sided heart failure, and blood pressure medications. In conclusion, our findings suggest that maintaining MAP ≤ 75 mm Hg during long-term follow-up in LVAD recipients is associated with increased risk of stroke/death regardless of risk factors or medical management.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic… [^111vH4Nj]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION Is there a benefit to using a lower blood pressure target of 130/80 mm Hg for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease compared with a higher BP target of 140 to 160/90 to 100 mm Hg. EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER Having a lower BP target of 130/80 mm Hg for hypertension in people with CKD compared with a higher BP target of 140 to 160/90 to 100 mm Hg does not reduce total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, total cardiovascular mortality, or progression to end-stage renal disease.

1. PRACTICE POINTERS The prevalence of CKD is estimated to be 14% in the United States. 2 Systemic hypertension is the second leading cause of CKD in the United States behind diabetes and is an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events.

1, 2 The authors of this Cochrane review aimed to identify the effects of lower vs higher BP targets on morbidity and mortality in people with CKD.

### Blood pressure, readmission, and mortality among patients hospitalized with acute kidney injury… [^116G68w4]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In this cohort study of 80 960 patients from the Veterans Healthcare Association who had AKI during a hospital admission, systolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg had the most favorable postdischarge risk level for mortality and readmission over time. There was a clear, time-dependent mediation of the associations of blood pressure with mortality and readmission, with patients with higher blood pressures generally being at lower risk for mortality and readmission initially, but at higher risk later in the postdischarge course. Overall, patients with SBP between 130 and 139 mm Hg had the most favorable risk level for mortality and readmission. There were clear, time-dependent mediations on associations in all groups. Compared with patients with SBP of 160 mm Hg or greater, the risk of mortality for patients with SBP between 130 and 139 mm Hg decreased between 60 days and 365 days.

Blood pressure reduction is critical for both primary and secondary prevention of major cardiovascular disease events, heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality, 6–8 and as a result, major guidelines recommend that all adults with high CVD risk should be treated to achieve a blood pressure target of less than 130 mm Hg systolic blood pressure and 80 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure. 9 However, despite the increased risk of CVD and death in individuals after AKI, optimal blood pressure targets and optimal timing of blood pressure control for this group remain undefined. Age and admission laboratory values were otherwise similar among groups. Adjusted HRs for each blood pressure category and time point relative to SBP of 160 mm Hg or greater are given in Table 2.

The overall risks for both mortality and readmission were similar in the analysis stratified by ACEI and ARB use at 60 days, with lower blood pressures associated with higher risk of mortality and readmission. Patients with SBP less than 120 mm Hg, between 120 and 129 mm Hg, between 130 and 139 mm Hg, and 160 mm Hg or greater had significantly lower relative risks of mortality with ACEI or ARB use compared with those without ACEI or ARB use at 60 days.
