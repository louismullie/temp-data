## Question

Treatment for toe dislocation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step approach to the evaluation and treatment of toe dislocations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and imaging strategy. Then, I should classify the dislocation by joint and direction and screen for associated injuries. Next, I will decide between closed versus open reduction, including indications for operative management. After that, I need to detail reduction techniques and immobilization protocols. Then, I should address special populations such as children, patients with diabetes, and athletes. Finally, I will outline rehabilitation, follow-up, and a concise decision algorithm, while continuously checking for pitfalls and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the essentials of the initial assessment: inspect for deformity, swelling, ecchymosis, and skin tenting, palpate for tenderness and crepitus, and assess neurovascular status including capillary refill and light touch, because neurovascular compromise mandates urgent reduction and escalation of care, and I should not delay reduction if perfusion is threatened [^1146ffCo]. I need to check the mechanism carefully, since axial loading with hyperextension commonly causes dorsal interphalangeal or metatarsophalangeal dislocations, and hyperabduction-flexion patterns in children can signal more complex injuries that may need surgical management rather than simple closed reduction [^114L5SgP] [^111ywKr4]. Hold on, I should verify that I also screen for associated injuries like nail bed lacerations, subungual hematoma, and adjacent fractures, because these can change management and timing of intervention [^114QoxLM].

> Next, I should review imaging, and I need to ensure I do not jump to conclusions before obtaining radiographs. Standard three-view radiographs — AP, lateral, and oblique — are mandatory to confirm the dislocation, define direction, and detect associated fractures or intra-articular fragments that could impede reduction or alter prognosis [^116B8wWH]. Wait, let me verify the role of advanced imaging: if radiographs are normal but clinical suspicion remains high for occult injury, or if there is concern for complex soft-tissue interposition, CT or MRI can be considered per ACR trauma guidance, but I should not delay urgent reduction for imaging if the foot is ischemic or clearly dislocated on exam [^116B8wWH] [^1146ffCo]. I should double-check that I also assess the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully for sesamoid position and plantar plate integrity, as sesamoid interposition can block closed reduction and change management [^notfound].

> I will now classify the dislocation by joint and direction, because this frames both reduction strategy and prognosis. Interphalangeal dislocations are common and often dorsal, metatarsophalangeal dislocations are less frequent and may be dorsal or lateral, and great toe interphalangeal dislocations are particularly prone to irreducibility due to sesamoid or plantar plate interposition, which I should keep in mind before attempting multiple failed reductions [^1121gYzY]. Hold on, I should verify that I also distinguish simple from complex dislocations: complex injuries include open wounds, associated fractures, or failed closed reduction, and they carry a higher likelihood of needing open reduction and internal fixation, so I need to flag these early in the plan [^113zdSxv].

> Now, I need to decide on closed versus open reduction, and I should confirm the indications for operative management. Closed reduction is first-line for most acute, closed dislocations without associated fractures or neurovascular compromise, but I should not persist beyond a few attempts if resistance is felt, as repeated force risks cartilage injury and soft-tissue interposition may be present [^114EdBbK]. Indications for open reduction include irreducible dislocation after appropriate closed attempts, open injury, associated unstable intra-articular fracture, neurovascular compromise, or chronic unreduced dislocation with contractures, and I should escalate promptly in these scenarios to avoid late complications such as stiffness, malunion, or osteonecrosis [^115zCJ2M] [^114L5SgP]. Wait, let me verify that I also consider percutaneous techniques for specific great toe interphalangeal dislocations with sesamoid interposition; case reports suggest percutaneous release can succeed when closed reduction fails, which may avoid formal open arthrotomy in select cases [^1121gYzY].

> For closed reduction technique, I should confirm the basics: provide analgesia with a digital block or intra-articular lidocaine, apply longitudinal traction along the axis of the toe, exaggerate the deformity slightly to disengage impinging structures, and then reverse the direction of injury to achieve reduction, which I will verify both clinically and radiographically before proceeding [^111q2TRs]. Hold on, I should verify immobilization specifics after reduction: buddy taping to an adjacent stable toe with a rigid-sole shoe or walking boot is appropriate for lesser toes, whereas the great toe may benefit from a short-leg walking boot with a toe plate or a cast for added protection, and I should tailor the device to stability and patient factors [^111q2TRs] [^114HY85u]. I need to ensure the joint is immobilized for about 2 to 3 weeks, then wean protection gradually as pain and stability improve, with early range-of-motion work to mitigate stiffness [^notfound].

> If closed reduction fails or open reduction is indicated, I should review the operative approach and fixation choices. A dorsal or midaxial approach allows removal of interposed soft tissue such as the volar plate, flexor tendons, or sesamoid fragments, and Kirschner wire fixation is commonly used to maintain reduction when instability is present, with wires typically removed at 3 to 4 weeks once early healing is established [^115zCJ2M]. Wait, let me verify that I also plan postoperative immobilization and weight-bearing: a short-leg cast or boot for 3 to 6 weeks with toe-specific protection is reasonable, advancing weight-bearing as pain and radiographic union allow, and I should obtain post-reduction radiographs to confirm concentric joint alignment and assess for associated fractures that may change rehabilitation [^notfound].

> Special populations require tailored decisions, so I will now examine pediatric considerations. In children, most acute toe dislocations can be managed conservatively with closed reduction and immobilization, but I should confirm that I do not miss subtle physeal or intra-articular fractures, which carry higher complication risks and may require operative fixation, and I should maintain a low threshold for orthopedic referral in complex injuries or when alignment is unstable after reduction [^1132EBJk] [^116MpFup]. But wait, what if the child has a hyperabduction-extension mechanism with a lateral condylar avulsion at the proximal phalanx base; that pattern has a worse prognosis and may justify more aggressive management to prevent nonunion or deformity, so I should double-check radiographs for this specific injury [^111ywKr4].

> For patients with diabetes, I need to ensure a comprehensive neurovascular and soft-tissue assessment because neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease increase risks of missed injury, infection, delayed healing, and construct failure, and palpable pulses do not exclude PAD in this population [^1146ffCo]. Hold on, I should verify that urgent reduction is not delayed for vascular studies when perfusion is compromised; reduction should proceed immediately with reassessment of pulses afterward, and vascular consultation can follow once the joint is reduced and stabilized [^1146ffCo]. I should also confirm that perioperative glycemic control and pressure-offloading strategies are emphasized to mitigate wound complications and promote healing [^115HPHno].

> Athletes and high-demand patients often require expedited, sport-specific rehabilitation, so I need to balance stability with timely return to activity. For great toe hyperextension injuries consistent with turf toe, I should confirm that both conservative and surgical pathways are individualized, recognizing that restricted dorsiflexion is a common sequela and that persistent instability may benefit from plantar plate repair or tenodesis in select cases, with decisions guided by severity grading and activity goals [^113ESVcT]. Let me reconsider the timing of immobilization and rehabilitation: early protected motion after initial stability is achieved can help preserve range of motion without compromising healing, but I should tailor this to the specific joint, fixation, and sport demands [^112EGFQF].

> Rehabilitation and follow-up are critical to outcomes, so I should confirm a structured plan. Early toe range-of-motion exercises can begin once pain and swelling permit, typically after 2 to 3 weeks of immobilization, with gradual strengthening and return to full weight-bearing over 4 to 6 weeks, and I should warn patients about stiffness and provide home exercise instruction to mitigate it [^112EGFQF]. I need to check for complications at follow-up visits, including recurrent instability, post-traumatic arthritis, and osteonecrosis, especially after metatarsophalangeal dislocations where avascular necrosis of the metatarsal head has been reported, and I should obtain radiographs at around 6 to 8 weeks to confirm maintenance of reduction and joint congruity before fully releasing activity restrictions [^114EdBbK].

> Let me synthesize a concise decision algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. If the dislocation is acute, closed, and reducible, proceed with closed reduction, confirm on radiographs, immobilize appropriately, and start early motion; if closed reduction fails after a few attempts or the injury is open, unstable, or associated with intra-articular fracture, proceed to open reduction with removal of interposed tissue and K-wire fixation as needed; if the dislocation is chronic or neglected, plan open reduction with contracture release and consider arthrodesis if cartilage is degraded, and in all cases, reassess neurovascular status before and after reduction and escalate care for any compromise [^114L5SgP]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost forgot to emphasize that persistent pain or stiffness after apparently successful closed treatment warrants repeat imaging to evaluate for occult fracture, malalignment, or evolving arthritis, which I should address proactively to prevent long-term disability [^116B8wWH].

> Finally, I should double-check key pearls and pitfalls to guide safe practice. Great toe interphalangeal dislocations are disproportionately likely to be irreducible due to sesamoid or plantar plate interposition, so I should avoid repeated forceful attempts and pivot early to percutaneous or open techniques when resistance is encountered [^1121gYzY]. Lesser toe metatarsophalangeal dislocations can be deceptively unstable and may require K-wire fixation even when initial reduction looks acceptable, so I should verify stability under fluoroscopy when available and maintain a low threshold for fixation in high-demand patients [^115zCJ2M]. I need to ensure that I do not overlook associated injuries such as nail bed lacerations, subungual hematomas, or adjacent phalangeal fractures, as these can alter pain control, infection risk, and immobilization strategy and should be treated concurrently [^114QoxLM] [^111q2TRs].

---

Toe dislocation treatment centers on **early closed reduction** with local anesthesia or a digital block, followed by **buddy taping and a rigid-soled shoe** for 2–4 weeks [^111q2TRs]. If closed reduction fails due to soft-tissue interposition or instability, **open reduction with K-wire fixation** is indicated [^113zdSxv] [^115zCJ2M]. Post-reduction care includes ice, elevation, and NSAIDs, with early range-of-motion exercises once pain subsides. Most patients regain full function, but delayed treatment or complex dislocations increase the risk of stiffness, arthritis, or osteonecrosis [^114EdBbK] [^112dcBJc].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnosis

- **Clinical examination**: Assess deformity, swelling, ecchymosis, and neurovascular status [^1146ffCo].

- **Imaging**: Obtain AP, lateral, and oblique radiographs to confirm dislocation, assess alignment, and identify fractures [^111cTRK3].

- **Classification**: Dislocations are described by joint (IP, MTP) and direction (dorsal, plantar, lateral, medial) [^117VnuBK].

---

## Conservative management

### Closed reduction

- **Indications**: Most acute, closed toe dislocations without associated fractures or neurovascular compromise [^notfound].

- **Technique**: Apply longitudinal traction, exaggerate the deformity, then reverse the injury mechanism to achieve reduction [^113ADFWq].

- **Anesthesia**: Local anesthesia or digital block may be used for patient comfort [^1121gYzY].

- **Post-reduction immobilization**: Buddy taping to an adjacent toe and a rigid-soled shoe or walking boot for 2–4 weeks [^113ADFWq].

- **Follow-up**: Clinical and radiographic confirmation of alignment and stability [^113ADFWq].

---

## Surgical management

### Indications for surgical intervention

- **Failed closed reduction**: Due to soft-tissue interposition (volar plate, sesamoid, tendon) [^1121gYzY] [^115RCEE5].

- **Instability**: Persistent instability after closed reduction [^113kUtej].

- **Open dislocation**: Requires irrigation, debridement, and stabilization [^113HXvJZ].

- **Associated fractures**: Intra-articular or unstable fractures [^111cTRK3].

---

### Surgical techniques

Open reduction exposes the joint, removes interposed tissue, and achieves **anatomic alignment** [^115RCEE5]. Internal fixation with **Kirschner wires (K-wires)** or screws maintains reduction and is typically maintained for 3–4 weeks [^113kUtej]. Postoperative care includes immobilization, protected weight-bearing, and structured rehabilitation [^113kUtej].

---

## Post-treatment rehabilitation

- **Early mobilization**: Gentle range-of-motion exercises once pain subsides.

- **Progressive rehabilitation**: Gradual strengthening and functional exercises.

- **Footwear modification**: Rigid-soled shoes or orthotics to protect the joint.

- **Patient education**: Activity modification and injury prevention strategies.

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **persistent stiffness** or limited range of motion, post-traumatic arthritis, and avascular necrosis of the metatarsal head, particularly with delayed treatment [^114EdBbK]. Recurrent instability or redislocation may occur, and chronic pain or functional impairment can persist [^115WPKDq].

---

## Prognosis

With appropriate treatment, most patients experience **excellent functional recovery**. Delayed treatment, complex dislocations, or associated injuries increase the risk of complications and poorer outcomes [^1177Zsxt].

---

Toe dislocation treatment prioritizes **early closed reduction** with immobilization; surgery is reserved for irreducible or unstable cases. Most patients recover fully, but timely intervention and adherence to rehabilitation are critical to minimize complications.

Although not uncommon, dislocation of the toes, including that of the great toe, is not commonly reported in published studies. In the present report, we describe a series of 18 patients with toe dislocations managed by our department from January 2001 to December 2007. We considered the radiographic pattern of injury in our series of patients. Of the 18 patients, 10 (55.56%) had their toe dislocations treated by closed reduction with or without internal fixation. Seven patients (38.89%) with complex dislocation, defined as open dislocation or dislocation not amenable to (failed attempt) closed reduction, that required open reduction and internal fixation. One patient (5.56%) with a dislocated toe declined to undergo any form of treatment.

Fracture dislocation injuries of the toes are rare among pediatric population. These injuries when acute are mostly treated conservatively and a good reduction must be ensured. We present the case of a 2-year-old girl who presented with missed chronic fracture dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth toe, which was managed by open reduction and internal fixation and had a good outcome at over 1 year of follow up. We believe that this is the first case of this injury to be published in the peer-reviewed literature.

### Hip dislocation and subluxation in athletes: a systematic review [^112KuyDE]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hip dislocation is a rare occurrence during sports but carries serious implications for athletes.

Purpose

To systematically review treatment strategies and outcomes for hip dislocation in athletes, with the ultimate goal of providing sports medicine physicians with the information necessary to appropriately treat and counsel patients sustaining this injury.

Study Design

Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched for studies relating to hip instability and athletics from January 1, 1989 to October 1, 2019. Abstracts and articles were evaluated on the basis of predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were the following: (1) data from ≥ 1 patients, (2) native hip dislocation or subluxation occurring during sports, (3) patients aged at least 10 years, and (4) written in English. Exclusion criteria were (1) patients younger than 10 years; (2) nonnative or postoperative hip dislocation or subluxation; (3) a native hip injury without dislocation or subluxation; (4) patients with dislocation or subluxation secondary to neuromuscular, developmental, or syndromic causes; (5) dislocation or subluxation not occurring during sports; (6) patients with physeal fractures; or (7) review articles or meta-analyses. Data were recorded on patient demographics, injury mechanism, treatment strategies, and clinical and radiographic outcomes. Where possible, pooled analysis was performed. Studies were grouped based on reported outcomes. Meta-analysis was then performed on these pooled subsets.

Results

A total of 602 articles were initially identified, and after screening by 2 reviewers, 27 articles reporting on 145 patients were included in the final review. There were 2 studies that identified morphological differences between patients with posterior dislocation and controls, including decreased acetabular anteversion (P = 0.015 and .068, respectively), increased prevalence of a cam deformity (P < .0035), higher alpha angles (P ≤ .0213), and decreased posterior acetabular coverage (P < .001). No differences were identified for the lateral center edge angle or Tonnis angle. Protected postreduction weightbearing was most commonly prescribed for 2 to 6 weeks, with 65% of reporting authors recommending touchdown, toe-touch, or crutch-assisted weightbearing. Recurrence was reported in 3% of cases. Overall, 4 studies reported on findings at hip arthroscopic surgery, including a 100% incidence of labral tears (n = 27; 4 studies), 92% incidence of chondral injuries, 20% incidence of capsular tears, and 84% incidence of ligamentum teres tears (n = 25; 2 studies). At final follow-up, 86% of patients reported no pain (n = 14; 12 studies), 87% reported a successful return to play (n = 39; 10 studies), and 11% had radiographic evidence of osteonecrosis (n = 38; 10 studies).

Conclusion

Various treatment strategies have been described in the literature, and multiple methods have yielded promising clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients with native hip dislocation sustained during sporting activity. Data support nonoperative treatment with protected weightbearing for hips with concentric reduction and without significant fractures and an operative intervention to obtain concentric reduction if unachievable by closed means alone. Imaging for osteonecrosis is recommended, with evidence suggesting 4- to 6-week magnetic resonance imaging and follow-up at 3 months for those with suspicious findings in the femoral head.

### Irreducible dorsal metatarsophalangeal joint dislocation of the fifth toe: a case report [^115zCJ2M]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The authors report a case of a dorsal dislocation of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint that could not be reduced by closed manipulation, and instead required open reduction with Kirschner-wire fixation to maintain alignment. Although metatarsophalangeal joint dislocation is not unheard of, it is not common for the deformity to resist efforts at closed reduction and immobilization or percutaneous pin fixation. One year after surgery, the patient described in this article had returned to his baseline activity level, and was ambulating without pain while demonstrating full range of motion in the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint.

### Evaluation and management of toe fractures [^111cTRK3]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Fractures of the toe are one of the most common lower extremity fractures diagnosed by family physicians. Toe fractures most frequently are caused by a crushing injury or axial force such as stubbing a toe. Joint hyperextension and stress fractures are less common. Most patients have point tenderness at the fracture site or pain with gentle axial loading of the digit. Anteroposterior and oblique radiographs generally are most useful for identifying fractures, determining displacement, and evaluating adjacent phalanges and digits. Referral is indicated in patients with circulatory compromise, open fractures, significant soft tissue injury, fracture-dislocations, displaced intra-articular fractures, or fractures of the first toe that are unstable or involve more than 25 percent of the joint surface. Most children with fractures of the physis should be referred, but children with selected nondisplaced Salter-Harris types I and II fractures may be treated by family physicians. Stable, nondisplaced toe fractures should be treated with buddy taping and a rigid-sole shoe to limit joint movement. Displaced fractures of the lesser toes should be treated with reduction and buddy taping. Patients with displaced fractures of the first toe often require referral for stabilization of the reduction.

### Percutaneous reduction of a dislocation of the interphalangeal joint of the great toe: a case report [^1121gYzY]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Dorsal dislocation of the interphalangeal joint of the great toe is quite rare. Closed reduction is often attempted in the emergency setting, but this measure is seldom successful because of invagination of the sesamoid-plantar plate complex into the interphalangeal space. Generally, open reduction is indicated when closed reduction fails. In this report, percutaneous reduction of the incarcerated sesamoid was performed under local and intraarticular anesthesia at our outpatient clinic, leading to successful reduction.

### Hemiphalangectomy and syndactylization for treatment of osteoarthritis and dislocation of the second metatarsal phalangeal joint: an outcome study [^115WPKDq]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

End-stage osteoarthritis or severe dislocation at the second metatarsophalangeal joint typically presents with chronic pain and is often unrelieved by conservative treatment. The aim of this article is to review the preliminary outcomes of surgery involving resection of the base of the second proximal phalanx with syndactylization to the third toe for stability. Thirteen patients (13 feet) with second metatarsophalangeal osteoarthritis and 15 patients (15 feet) with a dislocated second toe underwent the procedure and were reviewed after a mean 12.4 months (range, 5–25 months). Patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively with the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society's scoring system and clinical review. A patient questionnaire was devised to yield information regarding toe alignment, cosmesis, and reflection on the procedure. Pain and activities were significantly improved in both subgroups (P < .01). Eighty-two percent were very satisfied or satisfied with the reduction in symptoms, with 11% satisfied with reservations and 7% not satisfied. Seventy-nine percent were very satisfied or satisfied with the appearance. Thirty-nine percent stated the outcome was better than expected, 14% as expected, and 14% felt the result was worse than expected. Twenty-three patients (82%) had no postoperative cosmetic concerns, and 7 patients (25%) felt there was a moderate or severe difference in the alignment with respect to the other toes. In conclusion, syndactylization can significantly improve pain and activity levels and was found to be cosmetically acceptable.

### Irreducible fracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fifth toe [^115RCEE5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Interphalangeal joint dislocations of toes are relatively rare and can generally be treated by closed reduction.

Objectives

This case presentation intends to emphasize that irreducible lesser toe fractures may represent significant injuries. The minimal external injury and the infrequent presentation of these injuries entail the risk of remaining undiagnosed.

Case Report

We present a case of a persistent proximal interphalangeal joint fracture-dislocation of the fifth toe. Open reduction was performed because closed reduction remained unsuccessful as a result of interposition of both the flexor tendon and the volar plate into the fracture line.

Conclusions

Even such a minor trauma as a lesser toe injury deserves thorough physical examination, and when indicated on radiological imaging, as significant injuries can easily be overlooked.

### Neglected irreducible dislocation of the interphalangeal joint of the great toe: a case report [^114L5SgP]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Irreducible dorsal dislocation of the interphalangeal joint of the great toe is rare. We report a case of a 58-year-old man with an irreducible interphalangeal joint of the great toe that had been untreated for 4 years. The mechanism of this injury was thought to be a combination of axial loading with a hyperextension force when the patient hit his great toe against a pipe. Invagination of the sesamoid became a barrier for manual reduction attempted after the initial injury. The patient did not seek treatment because of the minor deformity of the affected great toe and lack of severe symptoms. One year later, symptoms eventually developed on the plantar aspect of the great toe, particularly when the patient was walking upstairs. He decided to seek treatment as pain worsened and he became more active when he changed occupations 4 years later. Manual reduction was impossible. The patient was treated with operative exploration of the joint and arthrodesis of the great toe. The operative course was uneventful. At 4 years after surgery, the patient could walk, run, and walk up and down stairs without discomfort.

### Dislocation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint: a case report and suggested classification system [^117VnuBK]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Dislocation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is a relatively rare and still poorly known injury. The current classification includes only the dorsal variety of this lesion; thus, as further cases of other varieties are reported, a larger understanding of this entity is required. We report the case of a young male with dorsal dislocation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint treated by closed reduction. The clinical outcome at the 2-year follow-up point is reported. A review of the published data of the variations of this injury reported to date is included, and a new summarizing classification is suggested.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^116U9Yje]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot disorders — initial patient evaluation emphasizes significant history items (Duration of Diabetes; Previous ulceration, infection, Charcot, amputation; Pain / sensation; PAD or prior revascularization), recommends laboratory tests (CBC with differential; ESR, CRP; Blood glucose; Hb A1c), diagnostic imaging (Plain radiographs; Imaging studies; CT; MRI; Bone scan), noninvasive vascular studies (Arterial Doppler; ABI, toe pressures, waveforms; Transcutaneous oxygen tensions), and review of radiographic findings (Bone density; Joints/bones involved; Osteolysis; Deformity; Fractures; Dislocation; Soft tissue edema; Vascular calcifications), with "Additional Diagnostic Procedures as Indicated". Triage then proceeds by problem: INFECTION — Proceed to Pathway #4 (CELLULITIS, ABSCESS, OSTEOMYELITIS); ISCHEMIA — Proceed to Pathway #2; and for ULCERATION ± Deformity, branch to CHARCOT — Proceed to Pathway #5 or ULCER Treatment — Proceed to Pathway #3.

### Metatarsophalangeal joint instability of the lesser toes [^116CxMop]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Metatarsophalangeal joint instability of the lesser toes is a common finding and a common cause of metatarsalgia. The clinical presentation can include swelling without digital deformity; however, often, this can progress to the development of coronal and transverse plane malalignment. In some cases, frank metatarsophalangeal joint dislocation can develop. The treatment regimen has historically focused on indirect surgical realignment using soft tissue release, soft tissue reefing, tendon transfers, and periarticular osteotomies. An improved understanding of the plantar plate has recently led to the development of a clinical staging system and surgical grading system of plantar plate attenuation. A dorsal surgical approach, using a Weil osteotomy, allows the surgeon to directly access and repair or advance the plantar plate to the base of the proximal phalanx. The addition of direct plantar plate repair could be a significant advancement in the reconstruction and realignment of metatarsophalangeal joint instability.

### Lesser metatarsophalangeal joint pathology addressed with arthrodesis: a case series [^1122i6BE]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Lesser metatarsophalangeal joint pathology is a common condition facing the foot and ankle surgeon, often beginning as a mild subluxation of the toe and progressing to a full dislocation of the metatarsophalangeal joint. In severe or recalcitrant deformities, traditional conservative and surgical methods can fail to resolve the issue. We report on 4 patients with 5 severely dislocated lesser metatarsophalangeal joints with varied etiologies and comorbidities who underwent arthrodesis of these joints using screw and plate fixation. All patients achieved radiographic and clinical signs of union at an average of 16.4 weeks.

### Surgical treatment and management for chronic dislocated subtalar joint [^114mZf33]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Lateral dislocation of the subtalar joint is a relatively uncommon pathology. It has previously been described in the literature secondary to acute trauma. This form of dislocation can also be acquired and seen in severe long-standing cases of flatfoot and Charcot neuroarthropathy. This study aims to describe this "sidecar" deformity, etiologies of the deformity, and the surgical options for correction. This study was performed by reviewing medical records of a single foot and ankle surgeon for patients who met inclusion criteria and underwent surgical correction. The study period was from October 2010 to July 2017. Statistical analysis was performed using chart-review information to examine variables affecting selected outcome measures. The outcome measures evaluated were minor and major complications, as well as functional limb status. A total of 16 patients were included in the study. Etiology included 10 severe flatfoot deformities and 6 Charcot deformities. Seven patients underwent staged reconstruction, and 9 underwent a single-stage reconstruction. Seven patients (44%) had complications; all were major and required unplanned reoperation. In all 16 patients (100%), limb salvage and a functional limb resulted. We conclude that patients with a limb-threatening sidecar deformity can be successfully treated with reconstruction. This is challenging and associated with a high complication rate. Patients with a history of infection should be counseled on the possibility of requiring a staged reconstruction with multiple surgeries as well as the possibility of amputation.

### Fractures and dislocations of the foot and ankle in people with diabetes: a literature review [^115HPHno]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Importance of distinguishing between complicated versus uncomplicated diabetes

One of the most important factors in treating fractures and dislocations of the foot and ankle is to recognize the difference between patients with uncomplicated and complicated diabetes. Complicated diabetes is defined as 'end organ damage', and for the purposes of this review, includes patients with neuropathy, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and/or chronic renal disease. The management of foot and ankle fractures in patients with complicated DM can be challenging, and surgical intervention is associated with an increased risk of impaired wound healing, delayed fracture healing, malunion, infection, and need for revision surgery.– Surgical repair of diabetes-related ankle fracture in patients with complicated DM is associated with higher rates of in-hospital postoperative complications, longer hospital stay, higher total costs, higher rates of non-routine discharges, higher in-hospital mortality rates, and prolonged opioid use. – Because peripheral neuropathy may be associated with absent or diminished pain, patients often ambulate on the surgically repaired foot or ankle unknowingly. Increased stress from premature weight-bearing can lead to early failure of the construct. Peripheral artery disease increases the risk of wound healing problems, and this can be problematic, especially in the peroneal artery angiosomal distribution. Routine palpation of pulses and measurement of ankle and toe pressures do not assess the peroneal artery. The peroneal artery supplies the tissue of the lateral ankle and hindfoot, a common anatomic area for incision placement (Figure 2). Finally, renal disease may be associated with metabolic bone disease because of vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Another important factor for reducing complications is glycemic control, as both long-term and perioperative control impacts outcomes after foot and ankle surgery.

### Irreducible dislocation of the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint – a case report [^114EdBbK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Traumatic dislocation of the metatarsophalangeal joint of an isolated lesser toe is an uncommon injury. We report a patient who presented 1 day after a dorsiflexion injury of the right foot. Physical examination showed a shortened and angulated right fourth toe resulting in scissoring of his digits. X-rays of the right foot confirmed complete dislocation of the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint. After failing 4 attempts at closed reduction, an orthopedic consult was made, and he underwent surgery. Six months after the operation, he developed avascular necrosis of the fourth metatarsal head. Reduction of the metatarsophalangeal of an isolated lesser toe is difficult due to the anatomical constraints imposed by the surrounding soft tissue. Failure at reduction after a single attempt by an experienced emergency physician should prompt the need for an orthopedic consult in view of likely surgery required. Avascular necrosis of the metatarsal head can also occur as a late complication after such injury.

### Fingertip injuries [^1173jf7j]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint dislocation — management requires closed reduction and specific immobilization positioning: "Dislocation of the DIP joint requires reduction and splinting in full extension (for volar [palmar] dislocations) or 15 to 30 degrees of flexion (for dorsal dislocations) for 2 to 3 weeks". The presence of an open wound "necessitates surgical management with appropriate washout to prevent infection". After reduction, "periodic reevaluation is essential to assess joint stability and manage potential complications such as recurrent dislocation or joint stiffness", and "physical therapy and hand rehabilitation exercises should be initiated early to restore range of motion and strength".

### Fingertip injuries [^112v8j7p]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint dislocation — diagnosis and initial management involve clinical evaluation and radiographic imaging, with three-view radiography in the anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique planes to define dislocation and associated fractures; initial treatment involves attempting closed reduction, with consideration of local anesthesia or a digital block, using gentle traction and manipulation to realign the joint followed by immobilization with splinting and buddy taping.

### Treatment options for turf toe: a systematic review [^113ESVcT]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Turf toe is hyperextension injury of the plantar plate at the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Etiologies have often included sports/activities with excessive forefoot axial loading and/or violent pivotal movements. The purpose of the systematic review was to systematically review and present an overview for the current evidence-based treatment options of turf toe. Both authors systematically reviewed the PubMed and EMBASE databases from inception to April 2016 based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The level of evidence and quality of evidence were assessed by using the Level of Evidence for Primary Research Question of the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, and the quality of evidence was assessed with use of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Data were collected and categorized into: case reports and case series. Eight studies (16 turf toes) met the aforementioned criteria and were included. Five case reports and 3 case series reported various treatment options for turf toe. Specifically, 3 studies reported solely conservative treatment (n = 5), 1 study reported solely surgical treatment (n = 1), and 4 studies involved patients in conservative and/or surgical treatments (n = 10). All studies were of level of clinical evidence 4 and quality of clinical evidence score 2 (poor quality). Conservative treatment included closed reduction and immobilization, and surgical treatment included plantar plate tenodesis. Restricted dorsiflexion was the most common complication reported. Turf toe is an underreported injury with no evidence-based treatment guideline to date. Future studies of higher level and quality of evidence with a specific classification system (Jahss or Anderson) consistently reported are warranted for the development of an optimal guideline to determine the most appropriate treatment for each specific severity in injury.

### Sesamoid and toe fractures [^111CN24R]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

Injuries of the toes and sesamoids of the first metatarsophalangeal joint comprise a wide spectrum of traumatic entities. Despite the fact that a majority of lesions may well respond to nonsurgical treatment and exhibit an excellent prognosis, appropriate clinical and imaging analysis is mandatory to select those injuries that require specific therapeutic and surgical measures to avoid long-term sequelae of functional disability.

### Fractures and dislocations of the foot and ankle in people with diabetes: a literature review [^1146ffCo]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Physical examination should include a detailed dermatological, vascular, neurological, and musculoskeletal assessment. The skin is evaluated for any wounds, swelling, fracture blisters or impending skin compromise (tenting of the skin or fracture blisters). The vascular exam includes palpation of the dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial and popliteal arteries, presence of edema, and the presence of hair growth. Pulses should be evaluated with a handheld Doppler ultrasound if pulses are not palpable. In patients with an abnormal vascular findings, further diagnostic testing should be performed, but should not delay the treatment of unstable fractures that require urgent reduction of fractures and dislocations. Further testing may include advanced diagnostic vascular studies and consultation with an experienced vascular consultant. Depending on geography, vascular consultants may include vascular surgeons, cardiologists, or interventional radiologists. Palpable pedal pulses do not exclude the presence of PAD in patients with DM and neuropathy, and these patients may not manifest the typical symptoms of PAD such as claudication. In addition, ankle brachial index (ABI) may be falsely elevated due to stiffening of the arterial wall from medial artery calcinosis which is common in patients with DM. In the presence of non-compressible arteries (ABI > 1.3), transcutaneous oximetry (TcPO₂) may also be performed to assess tissue perfusion. Measurement of the ABI, toe brachial index (TBI), absolute toe pressure, and the assessment of arterial wave forms may not be feasible or practical in patients with acute fractures. It is not uncommon for patients with displaced foot and ankle fractures with dislocation to have absent or diminished pulses. Immediate closed reduction should be performed, and reassessment of the pulses undertaken. This usually results in improvement of perfusion.

### Late onset osteonecrosis of the proximal phalanx of the great toe in a child [^116bBCL9]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Osteonecrosis, also known as avascular necrosis or osteochondrosis, refers to the death of bone tissue resulting from a to lack of blood supply. Osteonecrosis of the foot is most commonly seen in the talus and metatarsals and not as frequently in other bones. We report an extremely rare case of late-onset osteonecrosis of the proximal phalangeal head of the great toe in a 9-year-old male. Plain radiographs and computed tomography did not show any findings of osteonecrosis initially. However, because of persistent pain at the interphalangeal joint of the first toe and a decrease in the range of movement at the interphalangeal joint at 7 months after injury, the patient underwent additional examination with repeated radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging. We diagnosed late-onset osteonecrosis as a result of a subtle traumatic type I dislocation. Conservative treatment led to spontaneous recovery, leaving a bony fragment in the interphalangeal joint. To our knowledge, this is the first report of late-onset proximal phalangeal osteonecrosis after trauma in the great toe.

### The ESSKA-AFAS international consensus statement on peroneal tendon pathologies [^113sNYNo]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This consensus statement was initiated by the Ankle and Foot Associates (ESSKA-AFAS) of the European Society of Sports traumatology, Knee surgery and Arthroscopy (ESSKA). ESSKA is one of the leading organisations worldwide concerning sports-related pathology. Using the Nominal Group Technique or mini-Delphi method, an international consensus panel (ICP) was selected by the board of the ESSKA-AFAS on the basis of extensive knowledge and experience regarding the management of, and science pertaining to peroneal injury. The panel was specifically compiled to gain a global representation that would cover a spectrum of opinions relevant to peroneal pathology. In total, fourteen orthopaedic surgeons, one PhD-student, and one physiotherapist were invited to join the panel. All participants were required to have at least one published or submitted peer-reviewed paper on the topic. Represented countries included Australia, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

Preliminary work

After initial proposal of potential discussion topics by the board of ESSKA-AFAS, the ICP agreed upon ten final questions requiring accurate study and consensus assessment. The questions were unanimously considered to represent current controversial and relevant to daily practice topics. Each subject was designated to two independent panel members who individually performed a literature search using the PubMed and Cochrane databases to identify relevant literature published before the panel meeting date of 25th May 2017. In each case, a level of evidence was determined based on available literature, and a summary recommendation grade was then made using guidelines from the University of Oxford, Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

The following questions were considered:

Is there a relation between the anatomy and the development of peroneal tendon pathologies?
How should peroneal tendon pathologies be classified?
What are the key features to diagnose peroneal tendon pathology?
What conservative therapies may be considered and when?
What is the optimal treatment for peroneal tendon tears?
What is the optimal treatment for peroneal tendon ruptures?
What is the optimal treatment for acute peroneal tendon instability/dislocation?
What is the optimal treatment for a Painful Os Peroneum Syndrome?
When should hindfoot realignment procedures be considered?
What is the optimal post-operative protocol and rehabilitation following surgical treatment of a peroneal tendon pathology?

### Daptomycin and acute lung injury: recognising drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia [^112PpG5a]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Patient's perspective

Three and a half weeks before my admission, I fell and dislocated my hip. I went to the ER, where an orthopedist successfully reduced the dislocation. The only relevance of this is that I might have injured one of my toes as I fell — an injury I wouldn't have been aware of because diabetic neuropathy has left my feet largely without feeling. And indeed, a few days later I found that the middle toe of my left foot was red and very swollen. Concerned about the possibility of osteomyelitis (which had led to the amputation of another toe some years before), I went back to the ER, where — after a CT scan of my foot and having a high marker for infection — I was admitted to the hospital. The main issue under discussion at that point was whether to amputate the toe or to treat the infection with antibiotics. The decision was to go the antibiotic route, and to use daptomycin as the antibiotic. When I was discharged five days later (too soon, in my wife's view), daptomycin remained the antibiotic of choice, administered via a PICC line. I was very irritable, and in my wife's words "clearly not your usual self".

I should say at this point that many of the facts set out in this perspective do not come from my own memories, which became increasingly unreliable as time went on, but from my wife. She was there with me every step of the way, she was able to conduct informed and intelligent discussions with the many doctors and nurses who treated me, and she documented what was happening as events unfolded. It is no overstatement to say that I would have been much sicker for much longer (if I had survived at all) without her attention and help during the entire ordeal. And one of the many helpful things she did was to undertake online research about daptomycin, in the course of which she found that in a very small fraction of cases daptomycin can cause eosinophilic pneumonia.

### Treatment and rehabilitation of subtalar dislocations: a case series and a review of the literature [^115crgkN]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Subtalar dislocation is an uncommon orthopaedic pathology, representing 1% of all traumatic injuries of the foot and 1–2% of all dislocations, mostly affecting young male adults. While its urgent treatment consisting in reduction and immobilization of the dislocation has been well described, disagreement exists about post-operative management with specific regards to immobilization length and rehabilitation protocols.

Materials and Method

A case series of traumatic subtalar dislocations treated with urgent reduction, a mean of 4 weeks immobilization and subsequent rehabilitation is presented, with 1-year minimum clinical and subjective follow up. Also, a systematic review of the literature concerning the post-operative management following a subtalar dislocation, and subsequent results, has been performed.

Results

At 1-year minimum follow up, none of the patients presented with complications such as recurrence of dislocation or talus osteonecrosis. Tibio-talar and subtalar range of motion (ROM) were superimposable to the contralateral joints, with a maximum difference of 5°. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Score highlighted a good functionality and a full recovery in all patients but one. Pure subtalar dislocations led to better results than complicated ones. Review of current literature available on the topic demonstrated that an earlier mobilization resulted in better ROM, but the global outcome did not differ among 4 to 6 weeks of immobilization.

Discussion

Conflicting reports are present in the literature regarding the most appropriate post-reduction management of subtalar dislocations. In our case series, successful results have been obtained with a mean of 4 weeks of limb immobilization and an early rehabilitation protocol.

Conclusions

Although some limitations are present, 4 weeks immobilization appears to be the best balance between a good overall outcome and a better recovery of ROM. Further studies are needed to deepen the subject.

### Interventions for treating hallux valgus (abductovalgus) and bunions [^113hAM2L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hallux valgus is classified as an abnormal deviation of the great toe (hallux) towards the midline of the foot.

Objectives

To identify and evaluate the evidence from randomised trials of interventions used to correct hallux valgus.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group trials register (2003/1), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2003) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2003). No language restrictions were applied. Hand searching of specific foot journals was also undertaken. Date of the most recent search: 31st March 2003.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials of both conservative and surgical treatments of hallux valgus. Excluded were studies comparing areas of surgery not specific to the control of the deformity such as use of anaesthetics or tourniquet placement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Methodological quality of trials which met the inclusion criteria was independently assessed by two reviewers. Data extraction was undertaken by two reviewers. The trials were grouped according to the interventions being compared, but the dissimilarity in the comparisons prevented pooling of results.

Main Results

The methodological quality of the 21 included trials was generally poor and trial sizes were small. Three trials involving 332 participants evaluated conservative treatments versus no treatment. There was no evidence of a difference in outcomes between treatment and no treatment. One good quality trial involving 140 participants compared surgery to conservative treatment. Evidence was shown of an improvement in all outcomes in patients receiving chevron osteotomy compared with those receiving orthoses. The same trial also compared surgery to no treatment in 140 participants. Evidence was shown of an improvement in all outcomes in patients receiving chevron osteotomy compared with those receiving no treatment. Two trials involving 133 people with hallux valgus compared Keller's arthroplasty with other surgical techniques. In general, there was no advantage or disadvantage using Keller's over the other techniques. When the distal osteotomy was compared to Keller's arthroplasty, the osteotomy showed evidence of improving the intermetatarsal angle and preserving joint range of motion. The arthroplasty was found to have less of an impact on walking ability compared to the arthrodesis. Six trials involving 309 participants compared chevron (and chevron-type) osteotomy with other techniques. The chevron osteotomy offered no advantages in these trials. For some outcomes, other techniques gave better results. Two of these trials (94 participants) compared a type of proximal osteotomy to a proximal chevron osteotomy and found no evidence of a difference in outcomes between techniques. Three trials involving 157 participants compared outcomes between original operations and surgeon's adaptations. There was no advantage found for any of the adaptations. Three trials involving 71 people with hallux valgus compared new methods of fixation to traditional methods. There was no evidence that the new methods of fixation were detrimental to the outcome of the patients. Four trials involving 162 participants evaluated methods of post-operative rehabilitation. The use of continuous passive motion appeared to give an improved range of motion and earlier recovery following surgery. Early weightbearing or the use of a crepe bandage were not found to be detrimental to final outcome.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Only a few studies had considered conservative treatments. The evidence from these suggested that orthoses and night splints did not appear to be any more beneficial in improving outcomes than no treatment. Surgery (chevron osteotomy) was shown to be beneficial compared to orthoses or no treatment, but when compared to other osteotomies, no technique was shown to be superior to any other. Only one trial had compared an osteotomy to an arthroplasty. There was limited evidence to suggest that the osteotomy gat the osteotomy gave the better outcomes. It was notable that the numbers of participants in some trials remaining dissatisfied at follow-up were consistently high (25 to 33%), even when the hallux valgus angle and pain had improved. A few of the more recent trials used assessment scores that combine several aspects of the patients outcomes. These scoring systems are useful to the clinician when comparing techniques but are of dubious relevance to the patient if they do not address their main concern and such scoring systems are frequently unvalidated. Only one study simply asked the patient if they were better than before the treatment. Final outcomes were most frequently measured at one year, with a few trials maintaining follow-up for 3 years. Such time-scales are minimal given that the patients will be on their feet for at least another 20–30 years after treatment. Future research should include patient-focused outcomes, standardised assessment criteria and longer surveillance periods, more usefully in the region of 5–10 years.

### Complications after surgery of the hallux [^114erVsj]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

The great toe is affected by many congenital and acquired conditions including arthritis, hallux valgus, and hallux rigidus and disease of the hallucal sesamoids. Many surgical procedures have been described for the treatment of these conditions. With the increased popularity of forefoot surgery comes the potential for complications even when the surgery is done meticulously by an experienced surgeon under well-planned conditions. When a complication occurs, it can present difficult and challenging problems. It is, therefore, important to recognize a complication early so it may be analyzed and treated successfully. When recognized, a plan should be developed to identify, quantify, control, and resolve the problem. The current review defines some common complications and treatment options. Several problems may exist at the same time. A solution addressing all aspects of the problem must be designed so as not to augment the presenting complications. Salvage operations and long-term treatment are included to provide a perspective on treatment of residual deformity. It is important to realize that there often are several solutions to a difficult problem. Many factors influence the surgeon's choice and implementation of a solution, but the ultimate outcome always depends on a well thought out plan.

### Radiological approach to metatarsalgia in current practice: an educational review [^1149w7Gd]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The dorsoplantar view of the foot reveals an enlargement of the metatarsophalangeal angle (angle M1–P1 > 15°) and a varus of M1 (angle M1–M2 > 10°).

The subluxation of the sesamoids is assessed both on the frontal and the sesamoid views. This last incidence may also reveal a hypoplasia of the crest in favor of the congenital origin of the deformity and osteoarthritis between sesamoid and metatarsal head.

The lateral view can reveal a flatfoot and dorsal dislocation of P1.

Moreover, radiographs allow for the evaluation of lateral osteoarthritis of the first MTPJ, microtraumatic changes to the medial aspect of the head of M1, and medial capital exostosis.

MRI and CT scan are not necessary for a simple hallux valgus. However, they may be indicated in order to assess the bone or adjacent soft tissues.

Medical treatment is limited to physical therapy, footwear advice, and orthotic use. Surgical treatment aims to realign the big toe, correct deformities, and relieve related pain. Conservative surgery typically involves metatarsal and phalangeal osteotomies, while joint fusion is reserved for severe or recurrent cases, especially in cases of advanced arthritic hallux valgus.

### Open reduction of neglected dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint [^113kivRX]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic unreduced dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint are uncommon and management principles for these injuries have not been defined. The dislocation can be volar or dorsal and closed reduction is rarely successful owing to soft tissue contractures. We describe an extensile midaxial approach to the proximal interphalangeal joint for release of contractures, open reduction, and repair of critical structures. A smaller contralateral incision can be made if needed for additional soft tissue release. Using illustrative cases, we discuss technical points that are essential for a successful outcome and common pitfalls that could lead to complications. A functional range of motion with a stable joint can be achieved as long as articular cartilage is relatively preserved.

### Intramedullary fixation system for the treatment of Hammertoe Deformity [^113WEzGJ]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Hammertoe is one of the most common foot deformities. Arthrodesis or arthroplasty of the proximal interphalangeal joint using temporary Kirschner wire fixation is the most widespread method of surgical stabilization. However, this type of fixation is associated with some potential complications that can be obviated if percutaneous fixation is avoided. The purpose of the present study was to prospectively collect clinical and radiographic outcomes of operative correction of hammertoe deformity using a permanently implanted 1-piece intramedullary device. A total of 29 patients with 60 painful, rigid hammertoes were prospectively enrolled, clinically and radiographically examined, operatively treated, then followed and re-examined. The outcomes were measured in terms of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society lesser toe and visual analog pain scores. After ≥ 18 months of follow-up, the incidence of fusion with satisfactory radiographic alignment was 85% (51 of 60 toes). One toe (1.67%) developed early postoperative implant failure because of dislocation of the device, there were no cases of infection, and the mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society lesser toe score was 87.4 ± 1.3 and the mean visual analog scale pain score was 1.78 ± 0.94. Twenty-five patients (86.21%) stated that they had no symptoms in the involved toes after surgery, and 4 (13.8%) experienced occasional pain, 2 (6.9%) of whom reported limitations of recreational activities and 2 (6.9%) reported persistent swelling without activity limitations. All the patients stated that they would undergo the surgery again if they had the same preoperative condition.

### Fingertip injuries [^113q2LN9]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Fingertip injuries — key practice recommendations include that an acutely painful subungual hematoma should be decompressed by nail trephination or removal; splinting or buddy taping for stable distal interphalangeal joint dislocations after closed reduction promotes joint stability; fingertip fractures involving more than one-third of the articular surface should be referred to an orthopedic or hand surgeon; and for mallet finger, the distal interphalangeal joint should be splinted in an uninterrupted neutral position and immobilized for at least 6–8 weeks.

### Preserving the first ray or first two rays in forefoot amputation for diabetic foot ulcers [^115Cx2nz]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 6
A 62-year-old male patient with diabetic foot ulcers underwent the 2–5 rays amputation (RA) on the right foot with no reulceration observed during the 10 years post-surgery.

The left foot underwent the 1–3 RA, with two sites of reulceration identified at the 1-year postoperative follow-up.

The second case presented in Fig. 7 once again highlighted the importance of the load-bearing capacity of the first ray. This patient presented with an infected necrotic DFU of the big toe underwent the 1 RA. Despite the preservation of all the lesser toes, reulceration and biomechanical disturbances of the foot still occurred, necessitating further surgeries. This also corresponded to the results of the aforementioned FE analysis, which indicated that the load originally borne by the first ray was transferred to the 2–5 rays, resulting in an obvious increase of strain in the residual plantar forefoot area particularly at the 2nd metatarsal head which was consistent with findings in Figs. 2 and 3 as described earlier.

Fig. 7
A case of reulceration following first ray amputation (1 RA).

a A 56-year-old female patient had first ray necrosis due to a severe diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). b The patient underwent the 1 RA. c Two months postoperatively, a reulceration occurred at the forefoot. d The recalcitrant ulcer lasted for 1 year despite the use of orthotics and treatments such as wound care and dressing changes. e The transferring load also led to dislocation of the second metatarsophalangeal joint (red arrow), the development of a claw toe in the third ray, and biomechanical disturbances of the foot. f The patient subsequently underwent further surgery to excise the ulcer and correct the forefoot biomechanics (excisional arthroplasty for the second metatarsophalangeal joint; Weil's osteotomy for the third and fourth metatarsals).

### Fingertip injuries [^112EGFQF]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

DIP joint dislocation — reduction and immobilization include consideration of a digital block with lidocaine to assist reduction, performing DIP joint reduction with traction, hyperflexion or hyperextension with pressure to the base of the distal phalanx, and postreduction splinting in full extension for volar dislocations or 15–30 degrees of flexion for dorsal dislocations for 2–3 weeks; referral is indicated for the presence of large avulsion fractures, irreducible dislocation after attempted closed reduction, or open wounds.

### Long-term results of nail brace application in diabetic patients with ingrown nails [^111PLS1W]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown toe nail is a common foot problem; however, there are limited data concerning the treatment options for diabetic patients.

Objective

Because of the special attention given to avoidance of infection and ulceration of the foot in diabetics, we applied a new, simple nail device as a treatment option without any systemic treatment or surgical intervention.

Methods and Materials

We applied braces to 21 diabetic patients with ingrown toe nails. All had severe pain, erythema, and edema without suppuration or granulation tissue formation. Braces were applied until all the symptoms are cleared. We followed the patients for 2 years for the recurrence of symptoms and signs.

Results

All patients had immediate relief of symptoms once the brace was applied. After the dislocation of braces, 15 of 21 patients did not have any recurrences for 2 years. Six patients had recurrence of pain and ingrown nail and were willing to use the brace once more instead of having any operations.

Conclusion

Nail brace application is a safe, simple, and inexpensive treatment option for diabetic patients with ingrown toe nails. Although there may be recurrences, patients are willing to use it for a second time as it is simple and pain free.

### Interventions for ingrowing toenails [^112iFpfg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrowing toenails are a common problem in which part of the nail penetrates the skinfold alongside the nail, creating a painful area. Different non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails are available, but there is no consensus about a standard first-choice treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of non-surgical and surgical interventions in a medical setting for ingrowing toenails, with the aim of relieving symptoms and preventing regrowth of the nail edge or recurrence of the ingrowing toenail.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also updated our searches of CINAHL, WEB of SCIENCE, ongoing trials databases, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails, which are also known by the terms 'unguis incarnatus' and 'onychocryptosis', and those comparing postoperative treatment options. Studies must have had a follow-up period of at least one month.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data from selected studies. We analysed outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Surgical treatments for ingrowing toenails'. In this update we included 24 studies, with a total of 2826 participants (of which 7 were also included in the previous review). Five studies were on non-surgical interventions, and 19 were on surgical interventions. The risk of bias of each included study was assessed; this is a measure of the methodological quality of several characteristics in these studies. It was found to be unclear for several items, due to incomplete reporting. Participants were not blinded to the treatment they received because of the nature of the interventions, e.g. surgery or wearing a brace on the toe. Outcome assessors were reported to be blinded in only 9 of the 24 studies. None of the included studies addressed our primary outcomes of 'relief of symptoms' or 'regrowth', but 16 did address 'recurrence'. Not all of the included studies addressed all of our secondary outcomes (healing time, postoperative complications - infection and haemorrhage, pain of operation/postoperative pain, participant satisfaction), and two studies did not address any of the secondary outcomes. Surgical interventions were better at preventing recurrence than non-surgical interventions with gutter treatment (or gutter removal), and they were probably better than non-surgical treatments with orthonyxia (brace treatment). In 4 of the 12 studies in which a surgical intervention with chemical ablation (e.g. phenol) was compared with a surgical intervention without chemical ablation, a significant reduction of recurrence was found. The surgical interventions on both sides in these comparisons were not equal, so it is not clear if the reduction was caused by the addition of the chemical ablation. In only one study, a comparison was made of a surgical intervention known as partial nail avulsion with matrix excision compared to the same surgical intervention with phenol. In this study of 117 participants, the surgical intervention with phenol was significantly more effective in preventing recurrence than the surgical intervention alone (14% compared to 41% respectively, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.69). None of the postoperative interventions described, such as the use of antibiotics or manuka honey; povidone-iodine with paraffin; hydrogel with paraffin; or paraffin gauze, showed any significant difference when looking at infection rates, pain, or healing time.

Authors' Conclusions

Surgical interventions are more effective than non-surgical interventions in preventing the recurrence of an ingrowing toenail. In the studies comparing a surgical intervention to a surgical intervention with the application of phenol, the addition of phenol is probably more effective in preventing recurrence and regrowth of the ingrowing toenail. Because there is only one study in which the surgical interventions in both study arms were equal, more studies have to be done to confirm these outcomes. Postoperative interventions do not decrease the risk of postoperative infection, postoperative pain, or healing time.

### Fractures and dislocations of the foot and ankle in people with diabetes: a literature review [^113yJAfi]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Health care providers will see more foot and ankle fractures as the prevalence of DM rises globally. The presence of neuropathy, nephropathy, PAD, and retinopathy (complicated DM) increases the complication rate of fracture treatment compared with patients without these complications. Prompt treatment and referral to an experienced foot and ankle specialist can improve outcomes in this vulnerable cohort of patients.

### Empty toe: a unique type of closed degloving injury with dismal outcome [^111LVWn7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Closed degloving injury is characterized by the development of soft tissue separated from underlying structure without outer skin disruption. "Empty toe" is one of the most unique types of closed degloving injuries. Only 4 such injuries have been reported previously. We demonstrate a case of this entity in a 20-year-old scooter passenger. She presented to our emergency department with apparent deformity of the left fifth toe with intact skin. Radiographic examination showed no skeletal fracture or dislocation, but the skin of the injured toe was detached from the underlying bony structure. Despite repositioning the phalangeal bone into the empty toe, the skin was nonviable, and surgical site gangrene developed thereafter. The fifth toe was eventually amputated. An empty toe implies that the injured site has experienced severe compressive and shearing force with potential neurovascular damage. Health care providers should be fully aware of the high risk of the probability of vascular insufficiency, and the viability would be associated with vascular capability.

Traumatic injuries to the toes and metatarsals are common injuries affecting nearly every individual. Injuries may be precipitated by industrial accidents or simple bumps in the night. They can produce a wide spectrum of consequences ranging from permanent disability to asymptomatic deformities. With appropriate treatment, most individuals should have the capacity to return to their preinjury functional status.

### Interventions for idiopathic toe walking [^116jdn51]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic toe walking (ITW) is an exclusionary diagnosis given to healthy children who persist in walking on their toes after they should typically have achieved a heel-toe gait. The literature discusses conservative and surgical interventions using a variety of treatment modalities. Young children and children without a limitation in ankle dorsiflexion (the upwards movement of the foot towards the shin of the leg) are commonly treated with conservative interventions. Older children who continue toe walking and present with limitations in ankle dorsiflexion are sometimes treated with surgical procedures. This systematic review is needed to evaluate the evidence for any intervention for the treatment of ITW. The conclusions of this review may support decision making by clinicians caring for children with ITW. It may also assist families when deciding on treatment options for their children with ITW. Many of the treatments employed have financial implications for parents or healthcare services. This review also aims to highlight any deficits in the current research base.

Objectives

To assess the effects of conservative and surgical interventions in children with ITW, specifically effects on gait normalisation, ankle range of motion, pain, frequency of recurrence, and any adverse effects.

Search Methods

On 29 April 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PEDro. We searched the following registers of clinical trials for ongoing and recently completed trials: the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, apps.who.int/trialsearch), and ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov). We searched conference proceedings and other grey literature in the BIOSIS databases and System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey, opengrey.eu). We searched guidelines via the Turning Research Into Practice database (TRIP, tripdatabase.com) and National Guideline Clearinghouse (guideline.gov). We did not apply language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised or quasi-randomised trials for inclusion in the review if they involved participants diagnosed with ITW gait in the absence of a medical condition known to cause toe walking, or associated with toe walking. As there is no universally accepted age group for ITW, this review includes ITW at any age, who have been toe walking for more than six months, who can or cannot walk with a heel-toe gait, and who may or may not have limited dorsiflexion of the ankle joint.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was improvement in toe walking (defined as greater than 50% of time spent heel-toe walking). Secondary outcomes were active and passive range of motion of the ankle joint, pain, recurrence of ITW after treatment, and adverse events. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework.

Main Results

Four studies, comprising 104 participants, met the inclusion criteria. One study did not report data within the appropriate follow-up timeframe and data from two studies were insufficient for analysis. The single study from which we extracted data had 47 participants and was a randomised, controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in Sweden. It tested the hypothesis that combined treatment with serial casting and botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was more effective than serial casting alone in reducing ITW gait. This study found that more participants treated with BTX improved (defined as toe walking less than 50% of the time, as reported by parents) (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 2.55; 1 trial, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference between groups in passive ankle joint dorsiflexion range of movement on the right with the knee extended (mean difference (MD) -1.48º, 95% CI -4.13 to 1.16; 1 trial, 47 participants), on the right with the knee flexed (MD -0.04º, 95% CI -1.80 to 1.73; 1 trial, 46 participants), on the left with the knee flexed (MD 1.07, 95% CI -1.22 to 3.37), or on the left with the knee extended (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.91 to 1.91). Nor was there a clear difference between the groups in recurrence of toe-walking gait (assessed via severity of toe walking (graded 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe)) on gait analysis, analysed as continuous data: MD 0.34 points, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.78; 46 participants). In principle, MDs greater than zero (i.e.) positive values) would favour BTX and casting and negative values would favour casting alone. We have not reported effects as better or worse because all results were from evidence of very low certainty. We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations (outcome assessment was not blinded) and imprecision. Outcomes of pain and active range of motion were not reported in the included study. In terms of adverse events, calf pain was reported twice in the casting-only group and three times in the BTX group. There were three minor skin problems in each group and one reported case of pain directly after BTX injection. The report did not state if calf pain and skin irritation were from the same or different participants. The study authors reported that adverse events did not alter treatment adherence.

Authors' Conclusions

The certainty of evidence from one study, which compared serial casting with serial casting with BTX for ITW in children, was too low for conclusions to be drawn. A further three studies reported outcomes relating to BTX, footwear, exercises, and different types of orthoses as interventions, however the outcome data were too limited to assess their effects.

### What are the MSTS scores and complications associated with the use of three-dimensional printed, custom-made prostheses in patients who had resection of tumors of the hand and foot? [^1144cWvj]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Complications

Most mechanical failures occurred in the distal digit, with subluxation of the metal-natural joint interface that caused malfunction and resulted in revision. After we stopped using a simple spacer in the digit and started using a stem or joint prosthesis instead, dislocation did not occur. A broken stem, broken plate, and loosening stem did not affect weightbearing or prevent the motion of another finger or toe. 3D-printed prostheses made using a sintering technique, such as selective laser melting with titanium powder, will have less strength than a prosthesis made with computerized numerical control milling from the factory. This may cause fracture of the delicate part of the stem in hand and foot prostheses. We attempted to solve this problem by increasing the density of titanium during fabrication. The 3D-printed prosthesis spacer in carpal and tarsal bone had less motion and scar contracture, and resulted in a better outcome. A spacer works well in unique anatomic bone, such as the calcaneus and talus, which cannot be replaced by any type of bone graft. Our metacarpal reconstruction showed excellent functional results and longevity, comparable to the result of Xu et al. (Table 2). However, for a spacer without a stem or joint for phalangeal bone, Beltrami did not report subluxation, as we did. None of our patients experienced infections, but the study was small and the follow-up duration was short. Vascularization of the hand and foot might be markedly high or perhaps we do not have enough patients to have sufficient data on infections yet. Some of our patients could experience late infections. Additionally, we reduced the size of the implant to reduce the likelihood of prosthesis exposure. The prosthesis is made of titanium alloy, which facilitates good biocompatibility.

Table 2.
Comparison of clinical outcomes of 3D-printed prostheses with those reported in other studies

Serious complications were, unfortunately, common in this group, as might be expected given the clinical challenges associated with large lesions in these anatomic regions. However, most of the patients retained their implants, at least in the short term.

Survivorship

Implant breakage and revision, as well as reoperations, were common in this series, but despite this, the patients' functional results generally were good-to-excellent. We observed an expected cumulative incidence rate of implant or joint discontinuity of 35% (95% CI 6% to 69%) and reoperation of 29% (95% CI 3% to 66%) at 5 years (Fig. 4).

### Closed pantalar dislocation with checkrein deformity: a unique case report and literature review [^114gnLjg]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

When closed reduction is unsuccessful, soft-tissue and/or bone impingement is likely preventing the reduction. In the case of closed, pantalar dislocations, joint capsule, long flexor tendons, and bone fragmentshave been described as preventing closed reduction. In such cases, open reduction becomes necessary. Incision placement should be planned to maximize exposure and avoid neurovascular structures. Approaches via an anteromedial, anterolateral, combined anteromedial and lateral, and dorsalincision have been reported.

This report is the first to document a simultaneous checkrein deformity of the great and lesser toes after a pantalar dislocation. Checkrein deformity of the great toe secondary to entrapment of the flexor hallucis longus tendon has been described after fractures of the talus and ankle and after fibular graft removal. Similar to our case, Tucker et alnoticed slight plantar flexion of the toes at the metatarsal-phalangeal and interphalangeal joints after a closed, lateral subtalar joint dislocation. However, a checkrein deformity was not diagnosed in this case. Tanwar et aldiagnosed a checkrein deformity of the great toe after a closed lateral subtalar joint dislocation. They concluded that the great toe was hyperflexed because the flexor hallucis longus tendon was tethered against the inferomedially dislocated talar head. It can be assumed that with a checkrein deformity of all the toes, both the flexor hallucis longus and flexor digitorum longus tendons become trapped under the dislocated talar head.

### The ESSKA-AFAS international consensus statement on peroneal tendon pathologies [^115QoHFm]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

What is the optimal treatment for peroneal tendon ruptures?

6.1 Complete rupture of one tendon can be treated conservatively in the inactive and asymptomatic patient.
6.2 In active patients, symptomatic complete rupture of one of the two peroneal tendons should usually be treated with repair. If repair is not possible, a single-stage hamstring autograft or tenodesis may be performed. In tenodesis, there is no preference of PB to PL or PL to PB. When these options are not feasible, FHL or FDL tendon transfer is a final option. In Fig. 3, a schematic algorithm for the treatment of peroneal tendon ruptures is presented.

Rationale

Complete rupture of one of the tendons can be treated conservatively in the event that the patient remains low demand and asymptomatic. In the symptomatic or highly active patient, however, surgical management is often required to support return to sports. Patients with rupture of both tendons benefit from surgical management to treat their symptoms. The panel agrees that, if possible, the tendon tissue should be preserved and, therefore, recommends end-to-end repair of the rupture(s).

In cases when this is not possible, the panel recommended the same treatment algorithm agreed for peroneal tendon tears. If grafting or tenodesis remains insufficient, a tendon transfer may be considered. It should be recognised that elite athletes may not return to their pre-operative level of sports after surgical treatment for peroneal tendon rupture.

What is the optimal treatment for acute peroneal tendon dislocation?

7.1 Treatment of peroneal tendon dislocation should be based on whether it is an acute or chronic injury and whether or not the patient is an athlete.
7.2 The non-athlete with an acute dislocation may be offered conservative management but should be warned that there is a 50% chance of recurrent dislocation. In case of unsuccessful conservative management or chronic instability, surgical intervention is advised.
7.3 Surgery is recommended for elite athletes having sustained either acute or chronic dislocation.
7.4 Surgery in non-athletes with acute peroneal instability consists of reduction of the tendons into the retrofibular groove and repair of the SPR. There was no agreement as to whether to perform an additional groove deepening in non-athletes.
7.5 There was agreement that surgical treatment in athletes should routinely include groove deepening, regardless of other possible treatment gestures. Figure 4 shows a schematic algorithm on treatment of peroneal tendon dislocation.

### Barefoot stubbing injuries to the great toe in children: a new classification by injury mechanism [^111ywKr4]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was conducted to categorize barefoot stubbing injuries to the great toe in children by injury mechanism to differentiate benign stubbing injuries from more complex injuries necessitating surgery.

Design

Prospective clinical series of consecutively treated patients.

Setting

Tertiary university hospital setting.

Patients

Forty-one children who had sustained an indirect injury to the great toe during barefoot sports activities between January 2001 and December 2009 were included.

Intervention

Conservative or surgical treatment was done according to clinical and radiological findings.

Main Outcome Measurement

Information regarding injury mechanism was collected from patients, parents, and coaches using skeletal models and assessed by a pediatric orthopedic surgeon. Mechanisms of injury were identified and grouped as follows: hyperabduction-flexion, hyperflexion, hyperabduction-extension, hyperextension, and hyperextension-adduction.

Results

Hyperabduction-flexion was the most common mechanism (n = 16), in which interphalangeal joint dislocation and skin disruption was noted in most cases. The second most common mechanism was hyperabduction-extension (n = 14) in which avulsion fracture of the lateral volar condyle of the proximal phalanx was noted in most cases. This avulsion fracture had the worst prognosis after conservative care.

Conclusions

Based on these results, we have created a grading system and treatment protocol for indirect hallux sports injuries in children. Avulsion fracture of the lateral condyle of the proximal phalanx, a result of hyperabduction-extension, is a high-risk sign of nonunion and should be aggressively treated, contrary to previous guidelines.

Total dislocation of the talonavicular joint is rare. Detection of a major tarsal bone extrusion is simple. However, its management and treatment are not. We present a case of a total extrusion of the talus and navicular of an open dislocation and the reconstruction options that subsequently followed. In spite of a well-perfused foot, our patient decided to undergo a below the knee amputation after an infection.

### Treatment of irreducible second metatarsophalangeal joint dislocation by double percutaneous osteotomy: haspell and distal metatarsal mini-invasive osteotomy [^114BrNpv]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Subluxation or dislocation of the second metatarsophalangeal joint may be commonly associated with crossover toe, metatarsalgia, and painful calluses. This retrospective study aims to evaluate the clinical and functional results in patients with irreducible second metatarsophalangeal joint dislocation treated by double percutaneous osteotomy in one step: Haspell's osteotomy and Distal Metatarsal Mini-Invasive Osteotomy. A total of 39 patients were included in this study. 31 patients had a simultaneous procedure on the first ray for hallux valgus correction. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score (AOFAS), the degree of joint range of motion (ROM) and hyperkeratosis of the second ray were assessed as outcomes at the baseline (T0), at 6 months (T1), and at 1 year (T2) from surgery. The mean pre-operative AOFAS score was 62.76 ± 5.5, at 6 months after surgery it increased to a value of 78.81 ± 8.15 and at one year to a value of 88.78 ± 6.51. No differences in term of ROM were found between pre and postoperative values at 6 months. A significant improvement in ROM at 12 months was found. Hyperkeratosis, assessed with a nominal scale classification, decreased statistically significantly and, one year after surgery, in 88.88% of cases they completely resolved. The double percutaneous osteotomy brings advantages in terms of pain reduction. In conclusion, DMMO associated with Haspell's osteotomy is a safe and effective and reproducible technique in the resolution of metatarsalgia in patient with irreducible instability of the second metatarsophalangeal joint.

### Fingertip injuries [^111zJPDa]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Fingertip injuries — key management points note that subungual hematoma is diagnosed clinically and treated with observation or nail trephination, and nail bed lacerations are treated by removal of the nail and repair of the nail bed. Distal interphalangeal joint dislocations typically occur dorsally from hyperextension or hyperflexion during sports or accidental trauma, and management primarily involves closed reduction and splinting, though surgical intervention might be necessary for complex cases. Distal phalanx fractures are most often minimally displaced and amenable to closed reduction and splinting, but open and intra-articular fractures involving more than one-third of the articular surface require referral to a hand surgeon. Mallet finger comprises rupture of the extensor digitorum tendon or avulsion from the distal phalanx that inhibits distal interphalangeal joint extension and typically heals after 6 to 8 weeks of constant immobilization. Jersey finger involves injury to the flexor digitorum profundus tendon and necessitates referral for surgical repair to restore function.

### The differential diagnosis of children with joint hypermobility: a review of the literature [^1155SZNd]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Appendix 1

Case study – AM

AM is an 11 yr old girl who presented with joint hypermobility (Beighton score 7/9) and instability episodes. She was initially diagnosed as having Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hypermobile type). She has dark blue sclera and a family but not a personal history of low trauma fractures. Osteopenia compared to age matched controls was present on DEXA so her diagnosis was revised to Osteogenesis Imperfecta type 1.

AM's current clinical problems include:

- recurrent dislocation of the right 4 th metacarpophalyngeal joint

- painful toe subluxations

- longstanding anterior knee pain worse after activity

- handwriting difficulties

Although OI is her genetic diagnosis, her symptoms and functional problems relate to her Joint hypermobility and management needs to be focused on these areas. She would meet the Brighton criteria for a diagnosis of benign joint hypermobility syndrome but is excluded from this group as she has mild OI. Her management ideally should include multidisciplinary musculoskeletal rehabilitation.

### Fingertip injuries [^115XQPw5]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Fingertip injuries — distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint dislocation follows hyperextension or hyperflexion force to the fingertip, with dorsal dislocation more common than volar and a painful, swollen fingertip with visible deformity; visible deformity is evident on clinical evaluation, and radiography (anteroposterior [AP], lateral, oblique) is used to diagnose and characterize the direction of dislocation.

### Closed pantalar dislocation with checkrein deformity: a unique case report and literature review [^111RMA43]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Closed pantalar dislocations are a rare variant of an uncommon injury. Pantalar dislocations are typically caused by high-energy trauma resulting in an open injury with associated fracture of the articulating bones. Given its obscurity, the literature on closed pantalar dislocations is scarce, and no standard treatment protocol has been accepted. This case report chronicles the treatment and outcome of a 29-year-old man who presented with a checkrein deformity of all digits after a closed pantalar dislocation with 6-month follow-up. A comprehensive literature review found 28 articles representing 39 patients with closed pantalar dislocations without talar neck or body fractures. Roughly equal numbers of closed and open reduction techniques were performed with avascular necrosis occurring in 7 of 36 patients. Although outcome measures and follow-up were variable, what can be considered a suitable outcome was seen in approximately 83% of patients, with only 3 of 35 requiring a secondary operation. Long-term studies with well-defined outcome measures are needed to adequately predict the prognosis of this rare injury and efficacy of treatment protocols.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures [^117ArG89]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Foot fractures are among the most common foot injuries evaluated by primary care physicians. They most often involve the metatarsals and toes. Patients typically present with varying signs and symptoms, the most common being pain and trouble with ambulation. Diagnosis requires radiographic evaluation, although emerging evidence demonstrates that ultrasonography may be just as accurate. Management is determined by the location of the fracture and its effect on balance and weight bearing. Metatarsal shaft fractures are initially treated with a posterior splint and avoidance of weight-bearing activities; subsequent treatment consists of a short leg walking cast or boot for four to six weeks. Proximal fifth metatarsal fractures have different treatments depending on the location of the fracture. A fifth metatarsal tuberosity avulsion fracture can be treated acutely with a compressive dressing, then the patient can be transitioned to a short leg walking boot for two weeks, with progressive mobility as tolerated after initial immobilization. A Jones fracture has a higher risk of nonunion and requires at least six to eight weeks in a short leg non-weight-bearing cast; healing time can be as long as 10 to 12 weeks. Great toe fractures are treated with a short leg walking boot or cast with toe plate for two to three weeks, then a rigid-sole shoe for an additional three to four weeks. Lesser toe fractures can be treated with buddy taping and a rigid-sole shoe for four to six weeks.

### Diagnosis and management of Cornelia de Lange syndrome: first international consensus statement [^115Vj7hb]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

In individuals with major anomalies, physical therapy or surgical procedures are usually not indicated as function is often remarkably good (R43). The use of full prosthetic devices has been attempted, but our joint experience indicates it is only rarely successful as the prostheses are not often accepted. The use of specific devices, for example, to allow independent eating, should be considered, as acceptance of such devices can be good (R44, R45). Minor limb anomalies do not require therapeutic interventions.

Major malformations of the lower extremities (absent tibia or fibula and split foot) are extremely uncommon. Minor leg length differences occur in 46% of individuals, and Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease, a hip disorder that presents alongside disrupted blood flow to the femur, is seen in 4%. Congenital hip dislocations are uncommon, and hip dislocations occur in 10% of individuals with CdLS later in life, especially in wheelchair-bound or bed-ridden individuals, as do tight hamstrings and Achilles tendons and contractures. Management is as in the general population, taking the prognosis with respect to development and mobility into account. Preventive measures (physical therapy or orthoses) are paramount, and Botox injections and surgery may be indicated as well. Minor lower limb anomalies (small feet, cutaneous syndactyly between the second and third toes, short fourth metatarsals or inward deviation of the big toes (hallux valgus)) are frequently present. Specifically, deviation of the halluces may increase with age and cause walking difficulties. In adults, 75% of individuals with CdLS report bunions, albeit without major complications; thus, surgical repair is not indicated.

Scoliosis, especially thoracic scoliosis, develops in one-third of patients, often by 10 years of age, and is more common in adults with decreased mobility(R46). Experience of scoliosis surgery is limited, but our mutual experience indicates that standard management is effective, taking prognosis with respect to development and mobility into account. Spine malformations are extremely rare and typically asymptomatic, with kyphosis present in one-quarter of these individuals. Flexion contractures have been reported in 18–25% of individuals with CdLS, particularly in the knees, which can interfere with ambulation, but also in the elbow and/or hip, as have tight Achilles tendons.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of pediatric foot and ankle pain [^112Kyp1c]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Medial and syndesmosis sprains

An injury to the medial deltoid ligament is not as common as lateral ligament injuries and usually results from eversion stress to the ankle. The deltoid ligament is stronger than the lateral ligaments and injury to the deltoid ligament may be accompanied by lateral complex injuries or fracture. A "high" ankle sprain refers to injury of the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament and syndesmosis and can occur if the ankle is forced into dorsiflexion and external rotation. The external rotation test causes pain. Radiographs should be obtained for suspected medial or high ankle sprain and referral to sports medicine specialist considered. Treatment follows the same general principles for lateral ankle sprains but it may take 6 weeks or longer to rehabilitate. Disruption of the ankle mortise and some fractures require orthopedic open reduction and internal fixation.

Turf toe

Turf toe refers to sprain of the plantar capsule ligament. It is common in soccer and football players and usually occurs secondary to hyperextension injury of the 1 st MTP, with hyperflexion injuries less common. Painful restricted range of motion and localized swelling are common. Treatment includes RICE, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS), early joint mobilization, toe taping, and increased rigidity of the shoe with a stiff insole. Long-term disability is not uncommon with decreased MTP range of motion, and degenerative arthritis (hallux rigidus) reported.

Tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) injury

Tarsometatarsal fractures or fracture/dislocations are rare but may have serious complications if missed. Injury usually follows inversion stress to the ankle with force transmitted to the midfoot. Children with midtarsal joint sprains present with midfoot pain. Children with fractures or fracture/dislocations present with tenderness and swelling over the dorsum of the foot at the base of the second metatarsal and inability to weight bear. Suspicion of Lisfranc injury should prompt orthopedic referral. Treatment includes a period of non-weight bearing immobilization and possible surgical intervention.

### Open reduction and internal fixation of tarsometatarsal (lisfranc) fracture dislocations-is arthrodesis necessary? [^113JaPs1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Controversy remains regarding the optimal management of tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) fracture dislocations. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and ORIF with primary arthrodesis (PA) have been described in the treatment of these injuries, although adverse sequelae remain problematic. Previous work has yielded small cohorts with heterogenous results. We aimed to describe the outcomes of Lisfranc fracture dislocations managed with ORIF and/or PA to identify risk factors for complications, such as nonunion and revision surgery.

Methods

A retrospective review of 206 consecutive tarsometatarsal fracture dislocations that underwent surgical repair between 2015 and 2021 was performed. Time to radiographic union was noted. Complications were recorded, including revision surgery, infection, symptomatic implant removal, posttraumatic arthritis, secondary arthrodesis, and nonunion. A comparative subgroup analysis of outcomes by treatment modality (ie, PA versus ORIF) and by injury severity (isolated injury versus concomitant lower extremity fracture) were performed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess factors associated with revision surgery.

Results

104 patients met the inclusion criteria with a mean 13-month follow-up. Ninety-three (n = 93) patients underwent ORIF, and 11 patients underwent PA. Radiographic union was achieved in 94.2% of cases (98/104) at an average 106 days. Complications included superficial infection (3.8%), deep infection (7.7%), symptomatic implant removal (19.2%), posttraumatic arthritis (12.5%), secondary arthrodesis (4.8%), and nonunion (2.9%). No difference existed in the complication rates between those who underwent ORIF and those who underwent PA (P = 0.50). Revision surgery rates were similar between patients who sustained isolated injuries and those with concomitant lower extremity fractures (P = 0.31). Risk factors for revision surgery included open fractures (OR 4.01, P = 0.042) and previous psychiatric illness (OR 5.77, P = 0.016).

Discussion

The vast spectrum of injury in Lisfranc fracture dislocations makes uniform treatment challenging. In this large consecutive series, few failed to achieve union or required secondary arthrodesis. Open fractures and previous psychiatric illness portended worse clinical outcomes. ORIF without PA remains a viable treatment in these injuries.

### Subtalar dislocations [^114JNw4b]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Subtalar dislocations can occur due to low- or high-energy injury mechanisms. Up to 60% of these injuries have associated fractures. Hence, a CT scan is indicated to avoid the sequelae of missed injuries. Low-energy, isolated medial subtalar dislocations that can be reduced by closed means have the best prognosis. On the other hand, high-energy and open dislocations that have associated foot injuries fare worse. Subtalar arthrosis is the commonest complication; however, all patients with subtalar arthrosis do not require surgical intervention.

### Pinckney fracture: do not underestimate trauma of the distal phalanx of the hallux [^114QoxLM]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

This case report highlights that not every stubbed toe in the paediatric population is straightforward. Therefore, clinicians should be aware not only of the possibility of a physeal injury but also of the high probability of a nail bed soft tissue injury, resulting in an open fracture that requires early treatment to prevent morbidity and increased treatment costs.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: a child with toe walking [^114sMvLQ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Toe walking is a common developmental phenomenon in young children. It is usually benign and self-limiting. Toe walking can be a presenting sign of some serious underlying disorders and idiopathic toe walking is a diagnosis of exclusion. Persistent toe walking can lead to limited ankle dorsiflexion which may cause functional problems. Specific interventions depend on underlying cause and may range from verbal reinforcement to serial casting and surgery.

### A case of simultaneous traumatic dorsal dislocation of all five metatarsophalangeal joints treated successfully with closed reduction [^113ADFWq]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Simultaneous dislocation of multiple metatarsophalangeal joints is a rare injury, because of the impediment presented by the anatomy of the lesser metatarsophalangeal joints. To the best of our knowledge, only 1 case of simultaneous dislocation of all 5 metatarsophalangeal joints has been previously reported in peer-reviewed studies. Owing to the same anatomic structures that obstruct relocation, closed reduction has been known to fail in a large proportion of cases. We report a case of simultaneous dorsal dislocation of all 5 metatarsophalangeal joints of the right foot after a motor vehicle accident. The highlight of our case was successful closed reduction after application of the reduction maneuver to all lesser metatarsophalangeal joints simultaneously in the second attempt with the patient under anesthesia. On confirming the stability of the reduction, the foot was immobilized in a short-leg, posterior slab cast for 3 weeks without placing Kirschner wires across the joints. At the 3-month follow-up evaluation, the patient had reacquired their preinjury level of activity with a good range of motion. At the 2-year follow-up evaluation, this range of motion was maintained with no radiologic evidence of arthrosis. We have inferred that the reduction was successful the second time because the maneuver freed the soft tissue structures from the contiguous impingement in the metatarsophalangeal joints by the exact reversal of the mode of injury using simultaneous application of the maneuver to all the lesser metatarsophalangeal joints. We encourage a trial of this modification of the closed reduction method in the emergency setting before proceeding to open reduction, because the results of closed reduction can be biologically rewarding without the risks associated with open surgical dissection.

### Displaced intra-articular fractures of the great toe in children: intervene with caution! [^116MpFup]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Intra-articular fractures of the proximal phalanx of the great toe in children are extremely rare and sparsely reported in the literature. We have noted a series of these fractures at our institution. The purpose of this report is to present a retrospective case series of children with intra-articular fractures managed operatively in order to highlight the inherent difficulties in managing these fractures.

Methods

Operative notes and billing records were searched from 2001 to 2011 to identify all children aged 18 years or younger who underwent surgical intervention for an intra-articular fracture of the proximal phalanx of the great toe. Charts and imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed to identify the mechanism of injury, fracture classification, operative details, clinical results, and complications.

Results

Seven boys and 3 girls with a mean age of 12.6 years (range, 8.7 to 15.7 y) were identified. The mechanism of injury was a direct blow from a stubbed toe (8 cases) or a dropped object onto the foot (2 cases). There were 7 intra-articular fractures of the proximal phalanx base, 4 of which occurred in the setting of an open physis. Mean fracture displacement was 4.4 mm. Open reduction was necessary in 9 cases, with K-wire fixation used in 9 cases. Median follow-up was 50.5 months (range, 11 to 123 mo). Seven fractures healed at a mean of 7.9 weeks. Nine patients returned to full activity without limitation at latest follow-up. Six patients had significant complications: 2 underwent revision open reduction internal fixation (one for postoperative redisplacement and the other for painful nonunion), 1 suffered a refracture, 1 developed posttraumatic arthritis requiring interphalangeal joint fusion, 1 developed an asymptomatic fibrous nonunion with avascular necrosis of the fragment, and 1 had K-wire migration necessitating early surgical removal.

Conclusions

Intra-articular fractures of the great toe primarily occur in adolescents after direct impact injuries. The most common location was the proximal phalangeal base. There is a high complication rate after surgical intervention, although most patients were asymptomatic at latest follow-up.

### Subtalar dislocations [^113HXvJZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Open Subtalar Dislocations

Approximately 20% to 25% of all subtalar dislocations are open; these are managed on the lines of other open injuries. Early institution of broad-spectrum antibiotics and meticulous wound débridement and lavage are the cornerstones of management. Temporary ankle spanning external fixation may be needed in the presence of large wounds to facilitate wound inspection and change of dressings.

### Hallux valgus with second brachymetatarsia discovered accidentally: a case report [^115UwqVP]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Hallux valgus deformity is one of the most common foot and ankle diseases, while brachymetatarsia is a rare foot anomaly with pathological shortening of a metatarsal bone. We present a case of hallux valgus deformity possibly due to second brachymetatarsia. As the hallux valgus was associated with dorsal dislocation of the second toe that made it difficult to evaluate the length of the second toe, the patient was unaware of the second metatarsal shortening until the lengths of the toes compared by manual reposition of the second MTP joint. In this case, proximal osteotomy of the first metatarsal on the hallux valgus and single-stage bone lengthening of the second metatarsal with iliac bone grafting on the second brachymetatarsia were performed. One year after the operation, the callosity of the third toe resolved and the clinical scores were improved. In the case of a hallux valgus deformity with second dorsal dislocation of the toes, surgeons should consider that there are rare cases with second metatarsal shortening. When hallux valgus associated with second brachymetatarsia is diagnosed, second metatarsal lengthening should be considered in addition to hallux valgus surgery.

### Percutaneous distal osteotomy of the fifth metatarsal for correction of bunionette [^117KDeje]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Distal osteotomy of the fifth metatarsal is indicated in the surgical treatment of bunionette and varus deformities of the fifth toe in patients with a valgus deviation of the fifth metatarsal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of a subcapital percutaneous osteotomy of the fifth metatarsal in the treatment of this disorder.

Methods

From 1996 to 2006, thirty consecutive percutaneous distal osteotomies of the fifth metatarsal were performed in twenty-one patients for the treatment of a painful prominence of the head of the fifth metatarsal. Combined procedures were performed, including a first metatarsal osteotomy in sixteen feet for hallux valgus treatment and a distal open osteotomy of the second metatarsal for painful dorsal dislocation of the second metatarsophalangeal joint in eight feet. The patients were assessed at a mean of ninety-six months with a radiographic and clinical protocol that made use of the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) Lesser Toe Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal Scale.

Results

The AOFAS score improved from a mean and standard deviation of 51.9 ± 10.2 points preoperatively to 98.4 ± 2.6 points at the time of final follow-up. In 73% of feet there was complete resolution of pain at the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint without any functional limitation (AOFAS score of 100). In 20% of the cases the AOFAS score was 95 points with some decrease in function and a need to use comfortable shoes. In the remaining 7% of patients the AOFAS score was 93 points with mildly asymptomatic malalignment. No nonunions or recurrences were observed.

Conclusions

The percutaneous procedure described here is a reliable technique to perform a distal transverse osteotomy of the fifth metatarsal to correct a painful varus fifth-toe deformity with prominence of the fifth metatarsal head. The clinical results are comparable with those reported with traditional open techniques, with the advantages of a minimally invasive surgical procedure, substantially shorter operating time, and a reduced risk of complications.

### Closed pantalar dislocation with checkrein deformity: a unique case report and literature review [^112SGBEX]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Report

In January 2020, a healthy 29-year-old man presented to the emergency department with severe pain of the left lower extremity after falling approximately 20 feet from a ladder. The patient had no significant medical, family, social, or surgical history. He was on no medications and had no known drug allergies. Radiographs revealed anteromedial dislocation of the talus with minor fragmentation of the lateral malleolus and fracture of the posterolateral talar process (Figures 1 and 2). Closed reduction under conscious sedation was attempted without success by the emergency physician, and the foot and ankle team was consulted. On evaluation in the emergency department, the left foot and ankle appeared grossly swollen and deformed. No wounds, lacerations, or evidence of skin necrosis were seen. However, the skin was tented on the dorsal medial foot overlying the talar head. Pedal pulses were not palpable, but capillary refill was brisk in the digits and the foot was warm to touch. Sensation in the foot was intact to light touch. All five digits were plantarflexed at the interphalangeal joints, representing a checkrein deformity of the toes (Figure 3). The patient was able to actively flex and extend the digits. Compartments were soft and compressible. No other musculoskeletal injuries were identified. The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for closed, possible open, reduction under anesthesia.

Injuries to the foot in athletes are often subtle and can lead to a substantial loss of function if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. For these injuries in general, even after a diagnosis is made, treatment options are controversial and become even more so in high level athletes where limiting the time away from training and competition is a significant consideration. In this review, we cover some of the common and important sporting injuries affecting the foot including updates on their management and outcomes.

### Subtalar dislocations [^113kUtej]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

For the rare anterior and posterior subtalar dislocations, the gastrosoleus is relaxed by flexing the knee. Axial traction is applied to the heel. Anterior and posterior translation of the foot is then performed to reduce posterior and anterior dislocations, respectively.

Immobilization after closed reduction can be achieved in a below-knee splint or brace. If marked instability is noted, Kirschner wire stabilization of the STJ may be necessary. Postoperative radiographs are performed to assess the congruency of reduction. As discussed earlier, a CT scan is done in all cases after closed reduction to verify the accuracy of reduction and detect any associated fractures that might warrant surgical intervention.

For dislocations that are stable after reduction, full weight is permitted in a cast or a walker boot, which is maintained for 6 weeks. Range of motion exercises may be initiated after 3 to 4 weeks for isolated, low-energy dislocations that are deemed stable after closed reduction. Any Kirschner wires that have been used for stabilization are also removed after 3 to 4 weeks. Longer period of immobilization (6 weeks or more) and partial weight bearing may be needed for unstable high-energy dislocations that have associated foot injuries. Physical therapy focuses on regaining the complete range of motion at the ankle and STJs.

### In-toeing is often a primary care orthopedic condition [^114RTc6B]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate in-toeing consults to a pediatric orthopedic clinic to determine the proportion that could be managed by a primary care physician.

Study Design

A prospective registry was created for 143 consecutive children referred to a pediatric orthopedic clinic for "in-toeing". Each patient underwent a careful history and physical examination, which included a rotational profile. We recorded the final diagnosis, treatment offered, follow-up visit results, and the source of the referral.

Results

After pediatric orthopedic evaluation, 85% of patients had a confirmed diagnosis of in-toeing, and 15% had a different final diagnosis. Seventy-four percent of patients had 1 consultation visit, 18% had 2, and 8% had > 2 visits. None of the referred patients was a candidate for treatment by casting or surgery.

Conclusion

In most cases, in-toeing is a normal variation of development that can be managed by counseling and observation by the primary care physician alone. Rare cases of severe in-toeing > 2 standard deviations from the mean should likely still prompt referral to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon for potential intervention.

### Lisfranc fracture dislocation: a review of a commonly missed injury of the midfoot [^113f59eC]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal trauma to the foot is a common presentation to EDs. A Lisfranc fracture dislocation involves injury to the bony and soft tissue structures of the tarsometatarsal joint. While it is most commonly seen post high velocity trauma, it can also present post minor trauma. It is also misdiagnosed in approximately 20% of cases. These Lisfranc injuries typically present to EDs with pain particularly with weight bearing, swelling and post a characteristic mechanism of injury. Diagnosis is via clinical examination and radiological investigation-typically plain radiographs and CTs. Once diagnosed, Lisfranc injuries can be classified as stable or unstable. Stable injuries can be immobilised in EDs and discharged home. Unstable injuries require an orthopaedic referral for consideration of surgical fixation.

### Low back pain [^113h3ASB]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain — prevalence, risk factors, and physical therapy treatments are described, noting that 8 of 10 people experience it at some time in their lives and that pain is usually felt in the lower back and buttocks with possible leg pain and numbness and tingling in the toes; lifestyle risks include sitting too much, being in poor physical condition, and bending and lifting improperly, and stress and lack of sleep can make the pain worse. Evidence suggests that early treatment for low back pain is helpful in decreasing the chance that your pain will become chronic. Not all low back pain should be treated the same, and a physical therapist can help determine if you will respond better to manipulation or to exercises to improve mobility and/or strengthen your back muscles. New clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of low back pain were published in the April 2012 issue of JOSPT, describing ways to treat back pain based on best research evidence.

### Toe transfers outperform replantation after digit amputations: outcomes of 126 toe transfers [^111Jeo7z]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) is commonly used in North America to treat upper-airway obstruction (UAO) in infants with Robin sequence (RS). MDO ameliorates UAO in more than 94% of infants with nonsyndromic RS. – MDO is also associated with improved oral feeding, – reduced need for surgical feeding tubes, better weight gain, improved laryngoscopy view, ease of intubation, and improved health-related quality of life. Despite these benefits, MDO imparts considerable treatment burden. Two operations are required (distractor placement and removal), prolonged hospitalization and intensive care needs are common, minor complications are frequent, and implications to dental development and growth remain unclear. –

An expanded repertoire of nonoperative treatments is used in select European centers, where MDO is less commonly performed. An oral appliance with a preepiglottic baton to mitigate tongue-base prolapse into the oropharynx (termed the preepiglottic baton plate [PEBP], Tübingen palatal plate, or orthodontic airway plate) is the first-line treatment in Tübingen, Germany. Similar appliances are used in other German institutions, and, recently, in the United States.

### Subtalar dislocations [^112x3qRD]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Subtalar dislocation, also termed variably as peritalar, subastralgar, or talocalcaneonavicular dislocation, is characterized by concurrent dislocations of the subtalar (talocalcaneal) and the talonavicular joints. These injuries can be broadly grouped into two distinct patterns, although other, lesser common variants have also been reported. Medial subtalar dislocations are more common, occur due to low-energy trauma, and generally have good functional outcomes. In stark contrast, lateral subtalar dislocations are less common, occur due to high-energy trauma, and have guarded outcomes. Anatomic reduction and stabilization of the subtalar joint (STJ) and optimal management of any associated foot injuries are the key to good outcomes but do not necessarily prevent arthrosis.

### Subtalar dislocations [^1177Zsxt]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Complications and Outcomes

It was traditionally thought that lateral subtalar dislocations have poor outcomes and medial dislocations have excellent outcomes; however, this view has been challenged. The final outcome depends on several factors, including the severity of the trauma, articular cartilage damage, need for open reduction, prolonged immobilization, and associated foot injuries. Isolated, low-energy dislocations that are stable after closed reduction and are mobilized early can be expected to have an excellent prognosis, (Figure 13). However, results can be expected to worsen as the severity of trauma increases. Osteonecrosis of the talus is seen in zero to 10% of closed dislocations and in up to 50% of open dislocations. Posttraumatic arthritis is perhaps the most common complication of subtalar dislocations and invariably involves the STJ, the reported rates varying from 40% to 89%. Midfoot arthritis is much less common. Patients with radiographic evidence of subtalar arthritis may not necessarily be symptomatic. In those who have troublesome subtalar arthritis, subtalar fusion may be needed. Chronic instability of the STJ is rare and attributable to inadequate immobilization. Mild to moderate instability may be managed with orthoses and muscle strengthening or ligamentoplasty. Gross instability with painful arthrosis of the STJ would necessitate subtalar arthrodesis.

Figure 13
One-year follow-up of a patient with open irreducible medial subtalar dislocation (presented in Figures 4 and 12). The posterior process fracture has healed. There is no subtalar or talonavicular arthrosis. There is excellent range of motion at the ankle. Subtalar movements (inversion and eversion) are restricted.

### Treatment after traumatic shoulder dislocation: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis [^116Dmvni]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The shoulder is the most commonly dislocated large joint. A traumatic shoulder dislocation is often accompanied by a labral lesion, which predisposes the patient to developing chronic shoulder instability. The incidence of primary shoulder dislocation varies between 15.3and 56.3per 100 000 person-years. Most patients are men aged under 40 years and most dislocations are sports injuries. Both these facts make shoulder dislocation and possible subsequent chronic instability an important health issue for young, active patients and their treating clinicians.

Acute treatment of a dislocated shoulder is closed reduction, which should be performed as soon as possible, either on the field or in an emergency department. Some patients develop recurrent dislocations or symptomatic subluxations even in daily activities. This has prompted suggestions that surgical stabilisation may be indicated after the first dislocation — a treatment strategy that has been investigated in several randomised controlled trials (RCT), with mixed results.

There is considerable variation in the management of patients after a primary traumatic shoulder dislocation (both between surgeons and disciplines). Most patients with chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability are offered stabilisation surgery, while the surgical methods vary widely. Some evidence suggests that in the management of musculoskeletal conditions patients are more likely to undergo surgical treatment if the treating physician is a surgeon versus a non-surgical specialty (eg, physiotherapy), and that surgeons more easily recommend surgical treatment if the evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgery is inconclusive. Thus, to provide the best care, physiotherapists, physical medicine specialists, sports medicine specialists and orthopaedic surgeons should know what is the best quality evidence for treatment of shoulder instability.

Therefore, we aimed to assess the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions after primary traumatic shoulder dislocation and in chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability. Our systematic review focused on two clinical effectiveness questions regarding post-traumatic shoulder instability: (1) What are the best treatments to reduce the incidence of chronic shoulder instability after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation? and (2) How can the clinician best treat a patient with chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability?

### Return to sports and clinical outcomes in patients treated for peroneal tendon dislocation: a systematic review [^113xk8xa]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

A third limitation is the prevalence of lateral ankle comorbidities among patients in some of the included studies, creating risk of selection bias. However, due to the relatively low prevalence of peroneal tendon subluxation, this bias is hard to avoid. In addition, as it is not uncommon that peroneal tendon dislocation occurs with concomitant lateral ankle comorbidities, including these patients creates a more accurate reflection of this patient population.

Another limitation of the study is combining different surgical techniques in the treatment groups. Although the surgical attempts within each group were relatively similar, the specific techniques used varied within each group. Due to small numbers of patients included per study, it was not possible to analyse different surgical techniques. Therefore, combining different techniques in treatment groups was the best option for comparison.

Future prospects

Future high-level prospective studies are necessary to establish a management algorithm for patients presenting with dislocation of peroneal tendons. Based on the quality of evidence assessment, it is evident that future studies should include control groups, randomization and masked assessment. Peroneal tendon dislocation is most prevalent in the athletic population; therefore, attention should be directed towards return to sports rates and time to return to sports.

A 39-year-old man fell at work sustaining dislocation of both the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of his left little finger. The injuries were assessed and treated with closed reduction and stabilised by buddy taping. Early active range of movement was encouraged and a referral to physiotherapy was made. At the final follow-up, 4 months after the injury, he lacked subtle end of range movement actively, but functionally he was coping well and had made a full return to work.

### Modified scarf osteotomy with medial capsular interposition combined with metatarsal shortening offset osteotomy: a comparison of patients with noninflammatory arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis of the foot [^114SnY3q]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients who have noninflammatory arthritis of the feet may develop destructive changes on the first metatarsal head and painful dislocation of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint of 1 or more lesser toes. This aim of this study was to compare feet with noninflammatory arthritis and those with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with respect to the clinical and radiographic outcomes after treatment of these destructive deformities with a modified Scarf osteotomy with medial capsular interposition into the newly formed first MTP joint, combined with metatarsal shortening offset osteotomy.

Methods

A retrospective observational study of 93 feet (31 with noninflammatory arthritis and 62 with RA) was performed. Hallux and lesser-toe scores on the Japanese Society for Surgery of the Foot (JSSF) scoring system, a self-administered foot evaluation questionnaire (SAFE-Q), and preoperative and postoperative radiographic parameters were evaluated.

Results

There were significant improvements at the time of the final follow-up in the mean scores on the hallux and lesser-toe scales of the JSSF system and in the SAFE-Q score. The postoperative JSSF lesser-toes function score was better for the feet with noninflammatory arthritis feet than the feet with RA. There was no significant difference in the hallux valgus angle (HVA) between 1 month postoperatively and the final follow-up for both groups. Furthermore, the HVA showed a strong correlation between the 1-month and final follow-up values.

Conclusions

The combination of the modified Scarf osteotomy with medial capsular interposition and shortening metatarsal offset osteotomy was useful and safe in feet with noninflammatory arthritis. The HVA at 1 month after surgery is useful to predict the HVA within 5 years after surgery. The postoperative clinical score for the lesser toes was better in the feet with noninflammatory arthritis.

Charcot arthropathy — classification centers on the Eichenholtz system based on radiographic appearance and physiologic stages, dividing the condition into three stages (developmental, coalescent, reconstructive); the developmental stage features significant soft tissue swelling, osteochondral fragmentation, or joint dislocation, the coalescent stage shows reduction in soft tissue swelling, bone callus proliferation, and consolidation of fractures, and the reconstructive stage is denoted by bony ankylosis and hypertrophic proliferation; in clinical practice, the initial stage is considered active, while the coalescent and reconstructive stages are considered quiescent or reparative; several authors have proposed an earlier stage 0 corresponding to the initial inflammatory period prior to characteristic bony radiographic changes and considered a "Charcot in situ" stage; another popular system is based on five anatomic sites of involvement but does not describe disease activity, and none has been found to be superior or predictive of outcome.

### Going toe-to-toe with a rare case of a complex regional pain syndrome limited to the hallux [^115g37ck]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

Treatments were administered in accordance with actual knowledge on CRPS and neuropathic pain. Local treatments were chosen preferably because of the small area of clinical manifestations (first topical lidocaine, topical ketamine and finally botulinum toxin injections). In a second step, bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid) and then steroids were also administered. However, none of these attempts resulted in significant therapeutic benefits. Because the patient presented many side effects after oral and systemic treatment, it was decided to avoid other drugs except non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It was also considered that there was no indication for invasive pain management. In parallel, the patient benefited from physiotherapy (graded exercises, walking school and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), occupational therapy (desensitisation and motor imagery) and footwear adaptation (adapted orthopaedic shoes and plantar insole). Explanations on the mechanisms of persistent pain and CRPS were given with an interpreter. However, due to the language barrier, low educational attainment and poor health literacy, this approach was limited, as were the opportunities for other therapies, such as cognitive–behavioural therapy. Interdisciplinary care lasted 6 weeks. At this time, the patient was able to walk without a crutch, for a limited travel duration (15–20 minutes), but still avoided the toe-off walking phase. He reported a moderate reduction in pain (20%–30%). It was then decided to continue the follow-up, while spacing out therapy sessions at two times a week intervals.

### Complete medial dislocation of the first cuneiform: a case report [^115rMAA6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Isolated dislocation of the first cuneiform bone is an extremely rare lesion that can usually be diagnosed on plain radiography. Few cases of this injury have been previously described in the literature. The case presented here resulted from a torsion injury and was treated by means of closed reduction with the aid of pointed reduction forceps. After fixation with Kirschner wires, the foot was immobilized for 6 weeks. The patient recovered uneventfully and remains asymptomatic 3 years later.

Foot fractures and treatment

In contrast to ankle fractures, little has been published on foot fractures in patients with uncomplicated and complicated DM. As previously discussed, foot fractures of the hindfoot and midfoot fractures are relatively uncommon compared with ankle fractures. Through our literature search, we found five case reports of foot fractures in which the primary subjects were patients with DM: fifth metatarsal base (Jones), calcaneal body, calcaneal tuberosity avulsion, and two case reports of Lisfranc fracture-dislocation. The Jones and calcaneus fractures were treated with surgery in the acute setting without complications, whereas the Lisfranc cases were reported to develop Charcot neuroarthropathy after nonoperative immobilization and casting treatment. –

The overwhelming majority of case series reporting on outcomes in foot fractures do not include diabetes as a comorbidity. A study of the American College of Surgeons National Trauma Data Bank reported on calcaneus fractures from 700 trauma centers over a 2-year period. A total of 14,516 calcaneus fractures were treated, and 96% of them were in patients aged 18 years or older. Diabetes was present in 7% of patients, although outcomes were not reported. Wallace et al. reported on the sinus tarsi approach for treating fractures of the calcaneus in 100 patients, and only four patients (4%) had diabetes. Kline et al. reported on the outcomes of 112 calcaneus fractures treated surgically. Only three of these 112 patients (2.7%) had diabetes, and the numbers were too few to identify any association with outcomes. A large single center study by Folk et al. reported on 190 fractures in 179 patients who underwent operative treatment of calcaneal fractures, nine of whom had DM (5.0%). Wound complications occurred in seven of nine fractures (78%) associated with DM compared with 41 of 181 fractures (22.7%) (p = 0.02) in patients without DM. A recent long-term series on the outcomes of surgically treated talus fractures included only two patients with DM in their series of 84 patients (2.4%). Case series of other tarsal and metatarsal injuries rarely report on diabetes as a comorbidity. The prevalence of DM as a comorbidity in these series is lower than the prevalence in the general population, suggesting a selection bias against operative treatment of hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot fractures in patients with DM. Consequently, treatments for the foot are generally extrapolated from the principles of managing ankle fractures in patients with DM.

### Proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation: a rare entity [^111y8yH9]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 37-year-old woman was diagnosed with an isolated proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation (PTJD) after an accident during gymnastic exercise. The dislocation has a low incidence rate and is often missed in the emergency department as physical and radiology signs are subtle. Treatment consists of closed or open reduction and immobilisation. When it is not recognised it is associated with significant peroneal nerve injury.

Cellulitis — local care and disposition state that elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower-extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate), and hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

Volar metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint dislocations are uncommon yet clinically significant injuries that pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This review synthesizes current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of injury, classification, treatment modalities, outcomes, and complications associated with volar MCP joint dislocations. Insights from 2 case studies, along with previously published case reports, literature reviews, and clinical experiences, are incorporated to provide a holistic understanding of these complex injuries. The review also highlights areas for future research to enhance clinical outcomes and optimize patient care.

### Peritalar dislocations: a retrospective study of 18 cases [^112YkW1j]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to retrospectively evaluate 18 consecutive cases of peritalar dislocations referred to our department during a period of 25 years and to delineate the factors influencing long-term prognosis. There were 13 (73%) medial and 5 (27%) lateral dislocations. Six patients (33%) suffered an open injury, including 2 of 13 (15%) medial and 4 of 5 (80%) lateral dislocations. Associated fractures involving the hindfoot or forefoot were noted in 7 feet, including 3 of 5 lateral dislocation cases. Reduction was accomplished under general anesthesia; in no case was open reduction necessary. In 4 of 6 open injuries with associated fractures, temporary fixation with Kirschner wires was performed. Patients were immobilized in a plaster cast for 4 weeks, or for 6 weeks in the presence of fracture, followed by weightbearing as tolerated. At a mean follow-up of 10.2 years (range, 4 to 26 years), 10 patients (56%) showed excellent results; all had sustained a closed medial low-energy dislocation. There were 3 cases (17%) with fair results and 5 cases (28%) with poor results. Forty-five percent of patients showed a restriction of activity, a reduction of subtalar range of motion, and moderate or severe radiographic signs of hindfoot degenerative arthritis. There were no cases of talar avascular necrosis, and in no case was secondary surgery necessary. Lateral dislocation and open medial dislocations with concomitant fractures showed a greater potential for poor prognosis. The results were independent from period of cast immobilization, suggesting that 4 to 6 weeks of immobilization provides acceptable long-term results.

### Evaluation and management of toe fractures… [^111q2TRs]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Treatment STABLE, NONDISPLACED FRACTURES Patients with closed, stable, nondisplaced fractures can be treated with splinting and a rigid-sole shoe to prevent joint movement. To enhance comfort, some patients prefer to cut out the part of the shoe that overlies the fractured toe. A walking cast with a toe platform may be necessary in active children and in patients with potentially unstable fractures of the first toe. The preferred splinting technique is to buddy tape the affected toe to an adjacent toe. 4 Treatment should continue until point tenderness is resolved, usually at least three weeks. Taping may be necessary for up to six weeks if healing is slow or pain persists. To control pain and swelling, patients should apply ice and elevate the affected foot for the first few days after the injury. Patients should limit icing to 20 minutes per hour so that soft tissues will not be injured.

Non-narcotic analgesics usually provide adequate pain relief. Narcotic analgesics may be necessary in patients with first-toe fractures, multiple fractures, or fractures requiring reduction. If an acute subungual hematoma is present, decompression may relieve pain substantially. Despite theoretic risks of converting the injury to an open fracture, decompression is recommended by most experts. 5 Toenails should not be removed because they act as an external splint in patients with fractures of the distal phalanx. DISPLACED FRACTURES OF LESSER TOES After anesthetizing the toe with ice or a digital block, the physician holds the tip of the toe, applies longitudinal traction, and manipulates the bone fragments into proper position. In most cases, this is done by simply adjusting the direction of traction to correct any shortening, rotation, or malalignment.

To unlock fragments, it may be necessary to exaggerate the deformity slightly as traction is applied or to manipulate the fragments with one hand while the other maintains traction. DISPLACED FRACTURES OF THE FIRST TOE Displaced fractures of the first toe generally are managed similarly to displaced fractures of the lesser toes. To minimize the possibility of future disability, the position of the bone fragments after reduction should be as close to anatomic as possible. If the reduction is unstable, splinting should not be used to hold the reduction, and referral is indicated.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures… [^114HY85u]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

and fractures with less than 10° of dorsoplantar angulation in the absence of other injuries can generally be managed in the same manner as nondisplaced fractures. 2–4, 6 Initial management includes immobilization in a posterior splint, use of crutches, and avoidance of weight-bearing activities. Patients should be instructed to apply ice, elevate the foot above heart level, and use analgesics as needed. MANAGEMENT: TUBEROSITY AVULSION FRACTURES Minimally displaced avulsion fractures typically require immobilization and support with a short leg walking boot. Evidence has shown that, depending on symptoms, short leg walking boots are superior to short leg walking casts. MANAGEMENT: JONES FRACTURES Initial management of a Jones fracture includes a posterior splint and avoidance of weight-bearing activity, with follow-up in three to five days.

After that, nonsurgical treatment options include six to eight weeks of short leg non–weight-bearing cast with radiographic follow-up to document healing at six to eight weeks. For athletes and other highly active persons, evidence shows earlier return to activity with surgical management; therefore, surgery is recommended. 13, 21, 22 In contrast, patients treated with nonsurgical techniques should be counseled about longer healing time and the possibility that surgery may be needed despite conservative management. 2, 13, 20–22. The primary goals of treating toe fractures include reestablishing and maintaining alignment, regaining range of motion, and preventing complications. In an analysis of 339 toe fractures, 95% involved less than 2 mm of displacement and all fractures were managed conservatively with good outcomes.
25. **MANAGEMENT**: GREAT TOE FRACTURES Great toe fractures are generally treated with a short leg walking cast with a toe plate.

MANAGEMENT: LESSER TOE FRACTURES Initial management of lesser toe fractures includes buddy taping to an adjacent toe, use of a rigid-sole shoe, and ambulation as tolerated. Initial follow-up should occur within one to two weeks, then every two to four weeks for a total healing time of four to six weeks. 6, 23, 24 Radiographic follow-up in seven to 10 days is necessary for fractures that required reduction or that involve more than 25% of the joint. 6.
