## Question

How to treat ankylosing spondylitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat ankylosing spondylitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing baseline disease activity. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic therapy and non-pharmacologic foundations. Next, I will assess escalation criteria and choose among biologic classes based on response patterns and comorbidities. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and extra-articular disease. Finally, I should review monitoring, imaging, and de-escalation strategies, and close with a concise algorithm summary that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline assessment, because treatment hinges on accurate classification and activity scoring. I should verify modified New York criteria or ASAS axial SpA features, document inflammatory back pain, quantify disease activity with BASDAI and ASDAS, and check CRP/ESR and MRI when activity is uncertain or to detect active sacroiliitis, while avoiding unnecessary baseline radiographs since they rarely change management early on [^115t8qJb] [^116Ku6hf] [^114hPdnH].

> Wait, let me verify the non-pharmacologic foundation before jumping to drugs. I need to ensure a strong recommendation for structured physical therapy emphasizing active, land-based exercise over passive modalities, and I should reinforce patient education on posture, ergonomics, smoking cessation, and weight management, as these measurably improve function and quality of life and are consistently endorsed by guidelines [^114TC5zq] [^115mBwZu] [^112Tp2XV].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic therapy. NSAIDs are strongly recommended over no NSAIDs, and I initially thought continuous dosing was universally preferred, but hold on, I should verify that nuance — continuous NSAIDs are conditionally favored in active disease, whereas in stable disease, on-demand use is reasonable to mitigate toxicity, so I need to tailor continuity to activity and patient risk profile rather than apply a blanket rule [^111tcWQg] [^114kWCkc] [^116YkpBA].

> I need to check escalation triggers. Inadequate response to at least two different NSAIDs at maximal doses for about 1–2 months, or intolerance, justifies moving to biologic therapy, and I should confirm that systemic glucocorticoids are not recommended for axial disease due to lack of efficacy and harm, reserving steroids for local injections in select peripheral sites only [^112N2ogt] [^11674i1K].

> Now, for active disease despite NSAIDs, I should confirm that TNF inhibitors are strongly recommended over no biologic therapy. I will now examine which TNFi to choose — no specific TNFi is preferred for pure axial disease, but if there is IBD or recurrent uveitis, monoclonal antibodies such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, or golimumab are favored over etanercept because of better control of extra-articular disease, so I need to align the agent with comorbidities and patient preference [^1167Q1q8] [^1143fKsX] [^116iSev3].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do after TNFi failure. For primary nonresponse, switching to an IL-17 inhibitor (secukinumab or ixekizumab) is conditionally recommended over switching to a second TNFi, whereas for secondary loss of response, switching to a different TNFi is favored, and I must avoid switching to a biosimilar of a failing TNFi or adding methotrexate or sulfasalazine for axial disease, as these strategies lack benefit and may destabilize control [^114zjRCs] [^114ea7Go] [^111bKT7b].

> Let me consider contraindications to TNFi. In patients with heart failure or demyelinating disease, IL-17 inhibitors are reasonable alternatives, but I should double-check that IL-17 agents are not ideal in IBD because they may exacerbate Crohn's disease, reinforcing the preference for TNFi monoclonals in IBD and recurrent uveitis, and I should also remember that tofacitinib is a potential option when TNFi are contraindicated, though recommendations remain cautious pending more data [^113ponmE] [^116iSev3] [^113JoyAQ].

> I will now examine peripheral manifestations. For persistent peripheral arthritis despite NSAIDs, sulfasalazine is conditionally recommended and methotrexate can be considered, but I need to ensure we do not extrapolate these to axial symptoms where evidence is weak, and for isolated sacroiliitis or enthesitis, local glucocorticoid injections can be used judiciously while avoiding peri-tendon injections at Achilles, patellar, or quadriceps insertions due to rupture risk [^115yreRm] [^1167Q1q8].

> Next, I should review monitoring and imaging. I should confirm that treat-to-target strategies using rigid ASDAS cutoffs are not favored over clinician-guided assessment, that validated indices (BASDAI, ASDAS) and periodic CRP/ESR are reasonable to track response, and that routine serial spine radiographs are discouraged. MRI can aid assessment when disease activity is unclear or would change management, but it should not be used to hunt for subclinical inflammation in stable patients [^117J2Erm] [^116Ku6hf] [^114hPdnH].

> But wait, what about de-escalation once control is achieved? I should confirm that discontinuation or tapering of biologics is not recommended as standard because relapse is common, though in prolonged stable disease, cautious dose reduction may be considered with shared decision-making and close monitoring, and if patients are on combination therapy, continuing the biologic alone is generally preferred over maintaining both agents [^114uL7C7] [^114A4Qra] [^111wJwLp].

> I need to ensure I address biosimilars correctly. If a patient is stable on an originator TNFi, I should strongly recommend continuing the originator rather than mandating a switch to a biosimilar in the absence of interchangeability evidence, given potential destabilization and limited cost-offset justification in many settings [^115aAHdW] [^111FQGAj].

> Let me reconsider the concise algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm diagnosis and baseline activity. Initiate NSAIDs with tailored continuity and concurrent structured exercise. Escalate to TNFi after inadequate NSAID trials, choosing the TNFi based on comorbidities. After TNFi failure, switch to IL-17 for primary nonresponse or to a different TNFi for secondary nonresponse. Manage peripheral disease with sulfasalazine or local steroids as indicated. Monitor with validated indices and CRP/ESR, avoid routine radiographs, and use MRI selectively. Avoid routine biologic tapering or discontinuation unless carefully planned with the patient [^1163yS3S] [^111tcWQg] [^114zjRCs] [^116Ku6hf].

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) management centers on **NSAIDs as first-line therapy** [^111tcWQg] for axial symptoms, with escalation to **TNF inhibitors** [^112UsS8V] if NSAIDs are inadequate or not tolerated [^112N2ogt]. IL-17 inhibitors (secukinumab, ixekizumab) [^117CcLjx] are **preferred after primary TNF inhibitor nonresponse** [^114ea7Go], while switching to a different TNF inhibitor is favored for secondary nonresponse [^111bKT7b]. Physical therapy and exercise are **strongly recommended** [^114TC5zq] to maintain function and posture [^116Wo2PM]. Systemic glucocorticoids are not recommended [^11674i1K]; local injections may be used for persistent peripheral arthritis or enthesitis [^115yreRm]. Regular monitoring with validated disease activity measures [^116Ku6hf] and shared decision-making are essential [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Physical therapy and exercise are **strongly recommended** [^114TC5zq] to maintain spinal mobility, posture, and function; active, land-based programs are preferred over passive or aquatic interventions [^114TC5zq]. Patient education on posture, ergonomics, and smoking cessation supports self-management and long-term outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line pharmacological therapy

NSAIDs are the **first-line treatment** [^111tcWQg] for axial symptoms; continuous NSAID use is conditionally recommended over on-demand use in active disease, with no specific NSAID preferred [^111tcWQg]. Sulfasalazine or methotrexate may be considered for prominent peripheral arthritis or when TNF inhibitors are contraindicated [^notfound].

---

### Second-line pharmacological therapy

TNF inhibitors are **strongly recommended** [^112UsS8V] for active AS despite NSAIDs, with no preferred TNF inhibitor except in patients with IBD or recurrent uveitis, where monoclonal antibodies (e.g. infliximab, adalimumab) are favored [^1143fKsX]. IL-17 inhibitors (secukinumab, ixekizumab) are recommended for patients with contraindications to TNF inhibitors or as an alternative after TNF inhibitor failure [^113ponmE].

---

### Management of treatment nonresponse

Primary nonresponse to TNF inhibitors warrants switching to **IL-17 inhibitors** (secukinumab or ixekizumab) [^114ea7Go], whereas secondary nonresponse favors switching to a different TNF inhibitor [^111bKT7b]. Biosimilar switching is not recommended as a standard approach due to potential destabilization of disease control [^115aAHdW].

---

### Glucocorticoids

Systemic glucocorticoids are **strongly recommended against** for axial disease because of limited efficacy and significant adverse effects [^11674i1K]. Local glucocorticoid injections may be used for persistent peripheral arthritis or enthesitis [^115yreRm].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring with validated disease activity measures (e.g. BASDAI, ASDAS) [^116Ku6hf] and acute phase reactants (CRP, ESR) is recommended [^1122NuHM]. Imaging is not routinely recommended; **MRI** may be considered when disease activity is unclear or to assess inflammation [^114hPdnH]. Shared **decision-making** is essential to align treatment with patient preferences and goals [^116E14rG].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment category** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| NSAIDs | First-line therapy for axial symptoms [^111tcWQg] |
| TNF inhibitors | Strongly recommended for active disease despite NSAIDs [^1167Q1q8] |
| IL-17 inhibitors | Recommended for TNF inhibitor nonresponse or contraindications [^113ponmE] |
| Physical therapy | Strongly recommended for all patients [^114TC5zq] |
| Systemic glucocorticoids | Strongly recommended against [^11674i1K] |
| Local glucocorticoids | For persistent peripheral arthritis or enthesitis [^115yreRm] |
| Monitoring | Regular disease activity assessment and shared decision-making [^116Ku6hf] |

---

Ankylosing spondylitis management emphasizes NSAIDs as first-line therapy, with escalation to TNF inhibitors and then IL-17 inhibitors as needed, alongside physical therapy and regular monitoring. Systemic glucocorticoids are avoided, and **shared decision-making** ensures individualized care [^111tcWQg] [^1177wVD4] [^114TC5zq] [^116Ku6hf] [^11674i1K] [^116E14rG].

The challenge of managing knowledge is a difficult one, and it is no longer enough simply to conduct clinical trials. Quality of care requires the incorporation of research knowledge into clinical practice. As our knowledge of the chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has grown, evidence-based recommendations for the early diagnosis and management of AS and scientifically-derived outcome measures have been developed to aid the clinician at the point of care. Some of these, including the ASAS/EULAR recommendations for the management of AS, are now being validated in national and international studies. This article discusses existing recommendations and the need for specific quality indicators in the field of AS.

### Ankylosing spondylitis [^115PJrqP]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Ankylosing spondylitis is a common inflammatory rheumatic disease that affects the axial skeleton, causing characteristic inflammatory back pain, which can lead to structural and functional impairments and a decrease in quality of life. New imaging techniques and therapies have substantially changed the management of this disease in the past decade. Whether inhibition of radiographic progression and structural damage can be reached with available drugs is as yet unclear. Furthermore, treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and physiotherapy remains an important approach to long-term management of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. The new treatment options with tumour necrosis factor blockers seems a breakthrough for patients refractory to conventional treatment.

Therapy for AS

There is good evidence that treatment with many of the licensed biologic therapies is associated with significant improvements in all aspects of HRQoL, from disease activity, pain and physical functioning to work stability, patients' psychological health and global quality of life. These important changes in the clinical management of axSpA have resulted in the widespread use of biologic therapies.

People with aggressive disease are offered such treatments more commonly, and at an earlier stage in the disease course. The evidence is clear that short-term benefits can be considerable. However, there are also short-term risks (e.g. increased vulnerability to infection), and the long-term consequences of these treatments (e.g. theoretical risk of malignancy) remain uncertain. This is of particular concern in AS/axSpA: those who are offered biologics are often in relatively early adulthood, at a point when their disease is at its most severe and their wider lives are characterized by change and uncertainty, when they are confronted with a decision that may have profound long-term consequences.

Conclusions

Despite significant advances in the management of axSpA, and treatment guidelines that provide a framework, clinicians continue to face many uncertainties about the best treatment options for an individual patient. Clinicians need to consider multiple components in decision-making and need to have a working knowledge of immunopathology and therapy across the SpA spectrum. This situation will be amplified when new agents with other mechanisms of action become available for axSpA. In order to translate these advances into significant additional improvements in patient outcomes, further research is required, including carefully designed head-to-head studies and research in subgroups at high risk of radiographic progression and long-term disability.

### Differences in pathophysiology between rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis [^115PjKRU]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are common and severe chronic inflammatory skeletal diseases. Recognizing the differences rather than emphasizing similarities is important for a better understanding of the disease processes, the identification of specific therapeutic targets and in the long-term better treatment options for the individual patients. We discuss a number of pathophysiological differences between rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis by looking at the anatomical characteristics, differences and similarities in the autoimmune and autoinflammatory reactions, association with other immune mediated inflammatory diseases, structural outcome, and their potential significance for further therapeutic developments. Further research into the differences between these diseases should focus on the specific nature of the immune/inflammatory components, the role of resident cells in the joint and joint-associated tissues, the types and mechanisms of tissue remodeling and the characteristics of the articular cartilage. Better insights into their individual characteristics may lead to better therapeutic strategies, specific targets and useful biomarkers.

### Ankylosing spondylitis: an overview [^116Ugif6]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a complex, potentially debilitating disease that is insidious in onset, progressing to radiological sacroiliitis over several years. Patients with symptomatic AS lose productivity owing to work disability and unemployment, have a substantial use of healthcare resources, and reduced quality of life. The pathogenesis of AS is poorly understood. However, immune mediated mechanisms involving human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, inflammatory cellular infiltrates, cytokines (for example, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 10), and genetic and environmental factors are thought to have key roles. The detection of sacroiliitis by radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography in the presence of clinical manifestations is diagnostic for AS, although the presence of inflammatory back pain plus at least two other typical features of spondyloarthropathy (for example, enthesitis and uveitis) is highly predictive of early AS. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) effectively relieve inflammatory symptoms and are presently first line drug treatment. However, NSAID treatment has only a symptomatic effect and probably does not alter the disease course. For symptoms refractory to NSAIDs, second line treatments, including corticosteroids and various disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, are employed but are of limited benefit. Emerging biological therapies target the inflammatory processes underlying AS, and thus, may favourably alter the disease process, in addition to providing symptom relief.

Ankylosing spondylitis with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — biologic selection: "In adults with AS and IBD, we conditionally recommend treatment with TNFi monoclonal antibodies over treatment with other biologics (PICO 32)". This was "based on limited direct evidence" in AS plus the broader IBD literature; patients treated with infliximab or adalimumab have "lower risks of IBD exacerbations than those treated with etanercept". Infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab are approved for Crohn's disease and infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab for ulcerative colitis, while "etanercept is not approved for either condition". Choice of TNFi monoclonal antibody "should be made in consultation with the patient's gastroenterologist". Cautions include that "Secukinumab has been associated with the new onset, or exacerbation, of Crohn's disease", and "Increased risk of IBD exacerbation appear to also occur with ixekizumab".

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) — disease activity assessment and imaging: We conditionally recommend the regular-interval use and monitoring of a validated AS disease activity measure. We conditionally recommend regular-interval use and monitoring of the C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) over usual care without regular CRP or ESR monitoring. In adults with active nonradiographic axial SpA, we conditionally recommend against using a treat-to-target strategy using a target of Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) < 1.3 (or 2.1) over a treatment strategy based on physician assessment. In adults with nonradiographic axial SpA of unclear activity while on a biologic, we conditionally recommend obtaining a pelvis MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to assess activity. In adults with stable nonradiographic axial SpA, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity. In adults with active or stable nonradiographic axial SpA on any treatment, we conditionally recommend against obtaining repeat spine radiographs at a scheduled interval (e.g., every 2 years) as a standard approach.

Therapy strength differences between AS and nonradiographic axial SpA — The recommendations for nonradiographic axial SpA were largely extrapolated from evidence in AS, and treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab was strongly recommended over no treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab in patients with AS, while use of these medications was conditionally recommended in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA because trials in nonradiographic axial SpA have not been reported.

### Therapeutic controversies in spondyloarthritis: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^1143TSH1]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered a first-line therapy in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including ankylosing spondylitis. NSAIDs reduce pain and stiffness effectively in most patients, are able to reduce systemic and local inflammation, and can inhibit progression of structural damage in the spine. However, effective control of symptoms and retardation of radiographic progression often require continuous and long-term treatment, which raises safety concerns. This article discusses controversies related to the current role of NSAIDs in axSpA treatment, risks and benefits of this treatment, and current trends for individualized treatment.

### Treatment strategies in axial spondyloarthritis: what, when and how? [^113hcFXv]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

There have been major advances in the management of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) with the introduction of effective biologic agents targeting TNF and IL-17A. Clinicians now have more choice but, despite treatment recommendations, are still faced with significant uncertainty when deciding on the optimal treatment strategy for an individual patient in clinical practice. Management of axSpA typically requires both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. NSAIDs remain the first line drug therapies for axSpA with proven efficacy for symptomatic management but uncertainty remains regarding their optimal long-term use relating to radiographic progression and safety in axSpA. To-date there are no head-to-head trials of biologics in axSpA. Clinicians need to consider other factors, including extra-articular manifestations, comorbidities, safety and radiographic progression when deciding on which biologic to recommend for an individual patient. This article will explore the evidence relating to these factors and highlight areas of unmet need.

Disease activity assessment — In adults with active AS, we conditionally recommend against using the treat-to-target strategy, which aims at a target of an Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score < 1.3 (or 2.1), over a treatment strategy based on physician assessment (new, PICO 67).

### Managing morbidity and treatment-related toxicity in patients with ankylosing spondylitis [^115p1aps]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

There is limited evidence that DMARDs such as MTX and SSZ provide therapeutic benefit in patients with AS, and EULAR guidelines specifically state that these drugs are not to be used in axial disease. Cochrane literature reviews of these agents found that there was not enough evidence to support any benefit from either MTX or SSZ in patients with AS. The use of systemic glucocorticoids is also not recommended for the treatment of AS.

One of the major limitations in the treatment of SpAs is that treat-to-target, a therapeutic concept derived from RA and other diseases, has not gained traction in SpA. Treat-to-target implies that a clear target, such as remission or low disease activity, has been established that can be sustained over time, with an understanding of the need to treat flares and maintain tight control of disease activity. Although treat-to-target has been proposed for SpA, it has not yet been adopted. This strategy requires a universal definition of the target (e.g. remission). Remission and sustained low disease activity have been suggested as possible targets in SpA. Unfortunately, there is currently no consensus on the definition of remission or minimal disease activity in AS that can be used as a treatment target. A composite of outcome measure may be most useful given the multifaceted nature of AS and other forms of SpA. ASAS/EULAR recommendations for the management of AS are presented in Fig. 1 [91].

### Trends in treatment and outcomes of ankylosing spondylitis in outpatient rheumatological care in Germany between 2000 and 2012 [^113dNTrY]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe changes in drug treatment and clinical outcomes of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) during the past decade.

Methods

The national database of the German collaborative arthritis centres collects clinical and patient-derived data from unselected outpatients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Cross-sectional data from 2000 to 2012 of around 1000 patients with AS per year were compared with regard to clinical presentation and quality of life indicators.

Results

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been the predominant treatment choice in AS over the years with a prescription rate of 67% of patients in 2012. Currently, almost half of the patients with AS in German rheumatology centres are treated with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). Often, both treatments are used in combination (33%), followed by combinations of NSAIDs and synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARDs) with 23% or TNFi alone (21%). In 2012, 10% of patients each received NSAID or sDMARD monotherapy. Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, glucocorticoids and analgaesics alone or in combination with other treatments were given to 10% of patients, respectively. Over the years, we have seen remarkable improvements in disease control and patient reported outcomes. These developments are consistent with enhanced functional status, increasing employment rates and decreasing sick leave, hospitalisation and work disability.

Conclusions

In the German rheumatology secondary/tertiary care setting, routine care of patients with AS has changed tremendously during the past decade. Increasingly, more efficacious treatment options are reflected in improved clinical outcomes, quality of life and participation in the labour force.

### Current evidence for the management of ankylosing spondylitis: a systematic literature review for the ASAS / EULAR management recommendations in ankylosing spondylitis [^116ay8AZ]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess available management strategies in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) using a systematic approach, as a part of the development of evidence based recommendations for the management of AS.

Methods

A systematic search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro, and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify relevant interventions for the management of AS. Evidence for each intervention was categorised by study type, and outcome data for efficacy, adverse effects, and cost effectiveness were abstracted. The effect size, rate ratio, number needed to treat, and incremental cost effectiveness ratio were calculated for each intervention where possible. Results from randomised controlled trials were pooled where appropriate.

Results

Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions considered to be of interest to clinicians involved in the management of AS were identified. Good evidence (level Ib) exists supporting the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and coxibs for symptomatic treatment. Non-pharmacological treatments are also supported for maintaining function in AS. The use of conventional antirheumatoid arthritis drugs is not well supported by high level research evidence. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (infliximab and etanercept) have level Ib evidence supporting large treatment effects for spinal pain and function in AS over at least 6 months. Level IV evidence supports surgical interventions in specific patients.

Conclusion

This extensive literature review forms the evidence base considered in the development of the new ASAS/EULAR recommendations for the management of AS.

### Assessment of ankylosing spondylitis [^111CLhbM]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Outcome measures for the assessment of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have been the subject of considerable research in the last decade, largely through the contributions of the ASessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) International Working Group. This review focuses on the measurement of disease activity, physical function and structural damage in AS, both in daily patient care and to measure treatment response in clinical trials. The ASAS Core Sets for assessment in AS are an important tool to guide disease monitoring, and the domains they contain are discussed, along with other possible concepts important to patient care, including imaging and health-related quality of life. In clinical trials, the assessment of disease response to therapy using the ASAS Response Criteria is a valuable means of determining treatment efficacy and allows comparison of response across trials and interventions.

Ankylosing spondylitis after inadequate response to first TNFi — response-pattern–based next steps. In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with a different TNFi in patients with primary nonresponse to TNFi, while we conditionally recommend treatment with a different TNFi over treatment with a non-TNFi biologic in patients with secondary nonresponse to TNFi. We strongly recommend against switching to treatment with a biosimilar of the first TNFi, and we conditionally recommend against the addition of sulfasalazine or methotrexate in favor of switching to a new biologic. Observational data suggest that 25–40% of patients who switch from one TNFi to another will have a meaningful response.

### Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis [^115RmeQn]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are widely used and well accepted for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Many studies have been performed with monotherapy and combinations of DMARDs showing their efficacy and safety. In ankylosing spondylitis (AS) DMARDs, sulfasalazine especially, are recommended only for the peripheral involvement and not for the axial symptoms. For this disease there is a lack of clinical trials and most of the trials did not show efficacy on the axial symptoms of the disease. In this paper, the differences and similarities of DMARDs in the treatment of RA and AS patients will be discussed.

### Therapies in ankylosing spondylitis-from clinical trials to clinical practice [^1118fW8P]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Until recently, the therapeutic options for patients suffering from active AS comprised NSAIDs and TNF inhibitor therapy. Although these are effective in a significant proportion of patients, not all patients respond and some are intolerant to these therapies. Therefore, there is a clear unmet treatment need in AS patients. This article reviews the evidence for targets currently being studied in AS. This includes the IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab, the pan-Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib and the anti-IL-17A antibody secukinumab.

### First update of the international ASAS consensus statement for the use of anti-TNF agents in patients with ankylosing spondylitis [^113GFvGG]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the international recommendations for use of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis.

Methods

The published recommendations on anti-TNF treatment in ankylosing spondylitis formed the basis of the update. A questionnaire was sent to the ASAS (assessment in ankylosing spondylitis) members before the final decisions were agreed upon at an international meeting of the ASAS working group.

Results

Only minor changes to the original consensus statement were required. For the initiation of anti-TNF treatment, there should be: a diagnosis of definitive ankylosing spondylitis (normally based on modified New York criteria); active disease for at least four weeks, as defined by a sustained Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI) of ≥ 4 on a 0–10 scale and expert opinion based on clinical findings; refractory disease, defined by failure of at least two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during a three month period, failure of intra-articular steroids (if indicated), and failure of sulfasalazine in patients with predominantly peripheral arthritis; and application of the usual precautions and contraindications for biological treatment. For monitoring anti-TNF treatment: both the ASAS core set for clinical practice and the BASDAI should be followed after the initiation of treatment. Discontinuation of anti-TNF treatment in non-responders should be considered after 6–12 weeks. Response is defined by improvement of at least 50% or 2 units (on a 0–10 scale) of the BASDAI.

Conclusions

This updated consensus statement is recommended in guiding clinical practice and as a basis for developing national guidelines. Evaluation and regular update of this consensus statement is subject to further research by the ASAS group.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

ACR/SAA/SPARTAN evidence and recommendation categories define evidence levels and decision terms as follows: High-quality evidence are "Studies that provide high confidence in the effect estimate, and new data from future studies are thought unlikely to change the effect", moderate-quality evidence are "Studies that provide confidence that the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate but could be substantially different", low-quality evidence are "Studies that provide limited confidence about the effect, and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate", and very low-quality evidence are "Studies that provide very little certainty about the effect, and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate". A strong recommendation means "Action should be favored in most patients, usually requiring high-quality evidence, high confidence that future research will not alter the conclusion, AND an assessment that the desirable effects of the intervention outweigh the undesirable effects", while a conditional recommendation means "Action should be followed only in selected cases, often limited by low-quality evidence, OR when the desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention are more balanced, OR if patients' preferences for the intervention are thought to vary widely". Patient preferences are "Beliefs and expectations regarding potential benefits and harms of treatment and how these relate to an individual's goals for health and life", and shared decision-making is "The process by which a patient and clinician arrive at an individualized treatment decision based on an understanding of the potential benefits and risks of available treatment options and of a patient's values and preferences".

### Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs as potential disease-modifying medications in axial spondyloarthritis [^112sAx5X]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the first-line pharmacotherapy for patients with axial spondyloarthritis (SpA). In recent years, treatment options have expanded with the availability of biologic agents, including tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and interleukin-17 inhibitors. However, a treatment strategy that clearly prevents syndesmophyte formation has not been established. Observational studies of patients with ankylosing spondylitis indicated potential disease-modifying effects of NSAIDs, but two randomized trials came to different conclusions. More broadly, whether any of the currently available medications for axial SpA have an effect on spine radiographic progression, beyond symptom control, remains inconclusive. In this article, we will review clinical studies of the disease modification effects of NSAIDs and biologics in axial SpA; examine genetic, animal, and clinical evidence of the effects of NSAIDs on bone formation; and discuss how future studies may investigate the question of disease modification in axial SpA.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) — key disease activity and response definitions are specified as follows: Active disease is "Disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level to the patient and judged by the examining clinician to be due to inflammation", whereas stable disease is "Disease that was asymptomatic or causing symptoms but at an acceptable level as reported by the patient. A minimum of 6 months was required to qualify as clinically stable". Primary nonresponse is "Absence of a clinically meaningful improvement in disease activity over the 3 to 6 months after treatment initiation, not related to toxicity or poor adherence", and secondary nonresponse is "Recurrence of ankylosing spondylitis activity, not due to treatment interruption or poor adherence, after having a sustained clinically meaningful improvement on treatment (generally, beyond the initial 6 months of treatment)".

Imaging and monitoring in axial spondyloarthritis — MRI and radiography guidance specifies that spine and/or pelvis MRI could aid in the evaluation of patients in whom the degree of active inflammation is uncertain, especially when findings would change management. MRI is not recommended to seek subclinical inflammation in patients with stable disease, though MRI could be considered in circumstances in which the findings would inform shared decision‑making. We recommend against obtaining spine radiographs on scheduled intervals to monitor progression; the panel also recommended against repeating spine radiographs as a standard approach, although in the absence of clinical indications repeat spine radiographs could be considered on an ad hoc basis for counseling patients on disease progression.

### Infliximab in the treatment of active and severe ankylosing spondylitis [^112Kj5XF]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

For treatment of the spondylarthropathies (SpA), of which ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the prototype, there is no effective disease modifying treatment available. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), few studies have been performed on the treatment of patients with AS with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, none of which have proved clearly effective in axial disease. Many patients with AS carry a heavy burden of disease and AS itself is responsible for direct and indirect socioeconomic costs. To find an effective treatment for severe ankylosing spondylitis is therefore thought to be an unmet medical need. In the last four years several pilot studies and recently a few randomised controlled trials have raised good evidence that TNFalpha blockade is very effective in AS and other SpA. Disease activity, function and quality of life improved upon treatment with TNFalpha blockers. Thus, biologicals seem to represent a major breakthrough in the treatment of AS and other SpA. Side effects similar to those observed in RA treatment occur. But there is furthermore a need for safety data for long-term treatment with biologicals over several years. In the light of the high costs and the unknown long-term side effects, a definition for patients who might be candidates for such a treatment is needed. This article gives detailed information about current experience with the new treatment options in active and severe AS with anti-TNFalpha therapy.

### American College of Rheumatology / Spondylitis Association of America / Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network 2015 recommendations for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis [^11724UnB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA).

Methods

A core group led the development of the recommendations, starting with the treatment questions. A literature review group conducted systematic literature reviews of studies that addressed 57 specific treatment questions, based on searches conducted in OVID Medline (1946–2014), PubMed (1966–2014), and the Cochrane Library. We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method. A separate voting group reviewed the evidence and voted on recommendations for each question using the GRADE framework.

Results

In patients with active AS, the strong recommendations included use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) when activity persists despite NSAID treatment, not to use systemic glucocorticoids, use of physical therapy, and use of hip arthroplasty for patients with advanced hip arthritis. Among the conditional recommendations was that no particular TNFi was preferred except in patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease or recurrent iritis, in whom TNFi monoclonal antibodies should be used. In patients with active nonradiographic axial SpA despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend treatment with TNFi. Other recommendations for patients with nonradiographic axial SpA were based on indirect evidence and were the same as for patients with AS.

Conclusion

These recommendations provide guidance for the management of common clinical questions in AS and nonradiographic axial SpA. Additional research on optimal medication management over time, disease monitoring, and preventive care is needed to help establish best practices in these areas.

### Antiinflammatory treatment with bisphosphonates in ankylosing spondylitis [^114Wa2Lp]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bisphosphonates are antiosteoclastic agents widely used in the treatment of bone diseases. They also have antiinflammatory properties suggested by a clinical amelioration in animal models of arthritis. Bisphosphonates act on cells from the monocyte/macrophage lineage and may modulate the generation of proinflammatory cytokines. Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by bone marrow subchondral inflammation with the presence of T cells and macrophages, and osteoporosis is a well known complication of the disease. Thus, bisphosphonates may be reasonably used as a therapeutic agent in ankylosing spondylitis.

Recent Findings

Different open trials have shown that the amino bisphosphonate pamidronate ameliorated the clinical symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, mainly axial disease, and in one study, peripheral arthritis. Laboratory parameters of inflammation were, in general, not influenced while biochemical markers of bone turnover fell significantly under pamidronate. Imaging modifications of the inflammatory lesions using MRI were also improved with pamidronate. A dose-controlled study demonstrated a higher efficacy for 60 mg pamidronate compared with a 10 mg dose.

Summary

The amino bisphosphonate pamidronate has shown clinical and radiological amelioration in ankylosing spondylitis patients, although this improvement is mild and transient. Additional studies are required to better define the real impact of pamidronate on ankylosing spondylitis and its place among the different treatment options for the disease.

### Conventional treatments for ankylosing spondylitis [^1151Q9t9]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Management of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is challenged by the progressive nature of the disease. To date, no intervention is available that alters the underlying mechanism of inflammation in AS. Currently available conventional treatments are palliative at best, and often fail to control symptoms in the long term. Current drug treatment may perhaps induce a spurious state of "disease remission", which is merely a low level of disease activity. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are first line treatment, but over time, the disease often becomes refractory to these agents. Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs are second line treatment and may offer some clinical benefit. However, conclusive evidence of the efficacy of these drugs from large placebo controlled trials is lacking. Additionally, these drugs can cause treatment-limiting adverse effects. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection guided by arthrography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging is an effective means of reducing inflammatory back pain, but controlled studies are lacking. A controlled study has confirmed moderate but significant efficacy of intravenous bisphosphonate (pamidronate) treatment in patients with AS; further evaluation of bisphosphonate treatment is warranted. Physical therapy and exercise are necessary adjuncts to pharmacotherapy; however, the paucity of controlled data makes it difficult to identify the best way to administer these interventions. Surgical intervention may be required to support severe structural damage. Thus, for patients with AS, the future of successful treatment lies in the development of pharmacological agents capable of both altering the disease course through intervention at sites of disease pathogenesis, and controlling symptoms.

### Therapies in ankylosing spondylitis-from clinical trials to clinical practice [^116VJ5qC]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Over the past decade TNFis have revolutionized the management of AS. However, ∼20–40% of patients do not respond or are intolerant to TNFis, and not all of those that do respond reach remission. Hence, there remains a clear unmet need in AS. Large numbers of clinical trials have examined potential alternatives, with mixed results.

Secukinumab, at a dose of 150 mg every month with an initial loading phase in the first 4 weeks, is the first IL-17A inhibitor approved as a systemic treatment for active AS in adult patients with an inadequate response to conventional therapies such as NSAIDs. In the UK, it has received approval from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence within its marketing authorization in adults whose disease has responded inadequately to conventional therapy (NSAID or TNFis).

This licence is an important addition to the AS treatment armamentarium, being the first treatment approved in over a decade and offering the only alternative biologic therapy to TNFis in this indication.

It is hoped that the other agents discussed will also demonstrate efficacy and safety in phase 3 trials, resulting in additional approvals for this indication and further increasing the armamentarium of drugs for AS.

Active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) after nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy — pharmacologic treatment: In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend treatment with sulfasalazine, methotrexate, or tofacitinib over no treatment with these medications, and sulfasalazine or methotrexate should be considered only in patients with prominent peripheral arthritis or when tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are not available. In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we strongly recommend treatment with TNFi over no treatment with TNFi. In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we do not recommend any particular TNFi as the preferred choice.

### Medical management of ankylosing spondylitis [^1158NoNB]. Neurosurgical Focus (2008). Low credibility.

In the following literature review the authors consider the available evidence for the medical management of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and they critically assess current treatment guidelines. Medical therapy for axial disease in AS emphasizes improvement in patients' pain and overall function. First-line treatments include individualized physical therapy and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in conjunction with gastroprotective therapy. After an adequate trial of therapy with two NSAIDs exceeding 3 months or limited by medication toxicity, the patient may undergo tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockade therapy. Response should occur within 6–12 weeks, and patients must undergo tuberculosis screening. Evidence does not currently support the use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, corticosteroids, or radiotherapy in AS.

B. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with stable AS — TNFi plus NSAIDs: In adults with stable AS receiving treatment with TNFi and NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend continuing treatment with TNFi alone over continuing both medications (PICO 11); no new studies have directly compared outcomes after stopping NSAIDs or a conventional synthetic antirheumatic drug (csARD), so this decision largely depends on current symptoms, drug toxicity history, and patient preferences, and in stable patients a trial of withdrawing either the NSAIDs or the csARD should be considered, while on-demand NSAID treatment for intermittent symptoms is recommended for patients with good prior responses.

### Biologic therapies in the spondyloarthritis: new opportunities, new challenges [^114X1VP2]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Therapeutic options for patients suffering from the more severe forms of spondyloarthritis have been rather limited in the last decades. There is now accumulating evidence that antitumor necrosis factor therapy is highly effective in spondyloarthritis, especially in ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Based on the data recently published on more than 500 patients with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis, this treatment seems to be even more effective than in rheumatoid arthritis. The antitumor necrosis factor-alpha agents currently available, infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), and adalimumab (Humira), are approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the United States and partly in Europe. The situation in spondyloarthritis is different from that of rheumatoid arthritis because there is an unmet medical need, especially in ankylosing spondylitis: no therapies with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are available for severely affected patients, especially with spinal disease. Thus, tumor necrosis factor blockers may even be considered a first-line treatment in a patient with active ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis whose condition is not sufficiently controlled with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in the case of axial disease, and sulfasalazine or methotrexate in the case of peripheral arthritis. For infliximab, a dose of 5 mg/kg was required, and intervals between 6 and 12 weeks were necessary to suppress disease activity constantly-also a major aim for long-term treatment. The standard dosage of etanercept is 2 x 25 mg subcutaneously per week. There are no studies yet on adalimumab (standard rheumatoid arthritis dose, 20–40 mg subcutaneously every 1–2 weeks) in spondyloarthritis. Infliximab was very recently approved for AS in Europe. The efficacy of etanercept was first demonstrated in psoriatic arthritis, and it is now approved for this indication. A double-blind study has also been performed in ankylosing spondylitis, with similarly clear efficacy. There is preliminary evidence that both agents do also work in other spondyloarthritis, such as undifferentiated spondyloarthritis. Ideally, both agents will be approved soon for the short-term treatment of severe, uncontrolled spondyloarthritis. In parallel, studies should be performed to document the long-term efficacy of this treatment. There is hope that ankylosis may be preventable, but it remains to be shown whether patients benefit from long-term antitumor necrosis factor therapy and whether radiologic progression and ankylosis can be stopped. Severe adverse events have remained rare. Complicated infections including tuberculosis have been reported. These can be largely prevented by appropriate screening. At it stands now, the benefits of antitumor necrosis factor therapy in ankylosing spondylitis seem to outweigh these shortcomings.

### Editorial review: how early should ankylosing spondylitis be treated with a tumor necrosis factor-blocker? [^112svXUR]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Therapy of ankylosing spondylitis with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-blockers is very effective in about 50% of patients. The focus of this review is to discuss how early in the course of the disease patients with axial spondyloarthritis should be treated with TNF-blockers.

Recent Findings

During the last 10 years TNF-blockers were investigated in established ankylosing spondylitis. More recently clinical trials focused on early treatment including patients with axial nonradiographic spondyloarthritis. It could be shown that TNF-blockers are at least as effective in patients with axial nonradiographic spondyloarthritis when compared with established ankylosing spondylitis and that TNF-blockers are even more effective when used earlier in the course of the disease and in younger age. Some data even indicate that drug-free remission might be achieved if patients are treated earlier. Active inflammation as seen by MRI can effectively be suppressed during therapy with TNF-blockers. It has been hypothesized that early anti-inflammatory treatment is the best way to prevent ankylosis, which has to be proven in future studies.

Summary

TNF-blockers can achieve a higher clinical response if ankylosing spondylitis patients and patients with nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis are treated earlier. Whether very early treatment affects ankylosis has to be further investigated.

### New treatment options in spondyloarthropathies: increasing evidence for significant efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy [^113DoAwM]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is a major effector and regulatory cytokine, which seems to have an outstanding position in rheumatic and other inflammatory states. Because TNF-alpha has been detected in the inflamed gut and sacroiliac joints of patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and spondyloarthritides, like ankylosing spondylitis, there was need for studies of the efficacy of the modern biologic anti-TNF agents infliximab and etanercept in these diseases. Infliximab is approved for the treatment of Crohn disease. In addition, there are now also positive data for infliximab in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and for etanercept and infliximab in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.

### New treatment paradigms in spondyloarthritis [^113KNZ7W]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review presents the recent rapid expansion of therapeutical options in spondyloarthritis. Additionally, it focuses on the importance of additional questions raised by the growing therapeutic possibilities related to the optimal use of these drugs.

Recent Findings

The emergence of new treatment options opens new avenues and opportunities for treating patients with nonresponse, contraindications, or intolerance for classic drugs. However, it becomes more relevant than ever to define not only drugs and treatment options but also treatment strategies. We address current literature and remaining questions on strategies such as early intervention, combination treatment, personalized medicine, and treat-to-target.

Summary

Not only the treatment as such, but also the treatment strategy is crucial to reveal the full therapeutic potential and benefit for patients. Whereas cautious but crucial steps have been taken in the last years to explore these aspects, related to timing and sequence of treatment (including combination treatments), stratified medicine approaches, and treat-to-target strategies, it is now time for full-scale investment in prospective strategy trials.

### 2019 update of the American College of Rheumatology / Spondylitis Association of America / Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network recommendations for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis [^117CcLjx]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology 2019 update for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) — key recommendations are as follows: Recommendations for AS and nonradiographic axial SpA are similar. TNFi are recommended over secukinumab or ixekizumab as the first biologic to be used. Secukinumab or ixekizumab are recommended over the use of a second TNFi in patients with primary nonresponse to the first TNFi. TNFi, secukinumab, and ixekizumab are favored over tofacitinib. Co-administration of low-dose methotrexate with TNFi is not recommended, nor is a strict treat-to-target strategy or discontinuation or tapering of biologics in patients with stable disease. Sulfasalazine is recommended only for persistent peripheral arthritis when TNFi are contraindicated. For patients with unclear disease activity, spine or pelvis magnetic resonance imaging could aid assessment. Routine monitoring of radiographic changes with serial spine radiographs is not recommended.

Arthritis Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA).

Methods

We conducted updated systematic literature reviews for 20 clinical questions on pharmacologic treatment addressed in the 2015 guidelines, and for 26 new questions on pharmacologic treatment, treat-to-target strategy, and use of imaging. New questions addressed the use of secukinumab, ixekizumab, tofacitinib, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) biosimilars, and biologic tapering/discontinuation, among others. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to assess the quality of evidence and formulate recommendations and required at least 70% agreement among the voting panel.

Results

Recommendations for AS and nonradiographic axial SpA are similar. TNFi are recommended over secukinumab or ixekizumab as the first biologic to be used. Secukinumab or ixekizumab is recommended over the use of a second TNFi in patients with primary nonresponse to the first TNFi. TNFi, secukinumab, and ixekizumab are favored over tofacitinib. Co-administration of low-dose methotrexate with TNFi is not recommended, nor is a strict treat-to-target strategy or discontinuation or tapering of biologics in patients with stable disease. Sulfasalazine is recommended only for persistent peripheral arthritis when TNFi are contraindicated. For patients with unclear disease activity, spine or pelvis magnetic resonance imaging could aid assessment. Routine monitoring of radiographic changes with serial spine radiographs is not recommended.

Conclusion

These recommendations provide updated guidance regarding use of new medications and imaging of the axial skeleton in the management of AS and nonradiographic axial SpA.

Glucocorticoids and local injections in ankylosing spondylitis: We strongly recommend against treatment with systemic glucocorticoids. In adults with isolated active sacroiliitis despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend treatment with locally administered parenteral glucocorticoids over no treatment with local glucocorticoids. In adults with stable AS disease and active enthesitis despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend using treatment with locally administered parenteral glucocorticoids over no treatment with local glucocorticoids. Peri-tendon injections of Achilles, patellar, and quadriceps tendons should be avoided. In adults with stable axial disease and active peripheral arthritis despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend using treatment with locally administered parenteral glucocorticoids over no treatment with local glucocorticoids.

### International ASAS consensus statement for the use of anti-tumour necrosis factor agents in patients with ankylosing spondylitis [^115t8qJb]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To obtain an international consensus about the use of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF alpha) for treating patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

Methods

These recommendations were developed by a review of published reports in combination with expert opinion, including a Delphi exercise, and a consensus meeting of the ASsessments in AS (ASAS) Working Group.

Results

The final consensus comprises the following requirements: (1) For the initiation of anti-TNF alpha therapy: (a) a diagnosis of definitive AS; (b) presence of active disease for at least four weeks as defined by both a sustained Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) of at least 4 and an expert opinion based on clinical features, acute phase reactants, and imaging modalities; (c) presence of refractory disease defined by failure of at least two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during a single three month period, failure of intra-articular steroids if indicated, and failure of sulfasalazine in patients with peripheral arthritis; (d) application and implementation of the usual precautions and contraindications for biological therapy. (2) For the monitoring of anti-TNF alpha therapy: both the BASDAI and the ASAS core set for clinical practice should be followed regularly. (3) For the discontinuation of anti-TNF alpha therapy: in non-responders, consideration should be made after 6–12 weeks' treatment. Response is defined as improvement of (a) at least 50% or 2 units (on a 0–10 scale) of the BASDAI, (b) expert opinion that treatment should be continued.

Conclusion

This consensus statement on anti-TNF alpha treatment in AS may be used for guidance in clinical decision making and as the basis for the development of guidelines. Evaluation of the healthcare consequences of this consensus is subject to further research by the ASAS group.

### Treatment trials in ankylosing spondylitis: current and future considerations [^116x1mUG]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Emerging treatment options in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are giving new hope to patients with this chronic and potentially disabling disease. Clinical development of new treatments requires that rigorous and well controlled trials be conducted to demonstrate safety and efficacy. A number of classification systems have been developed in recent years as a result of enhanced understanding of the pathogenesis of AS. Although new outcome measures have been developed and a consensus has been reached on the use of assessment instruments in clinical trials, there is still need for improvement and implementation. The ASsessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) Working Group has addressed some of these dilemmas by establishing a core set of domains for the evaluation of AS and by selecting specific assessment methods for each domain. They have also published improvement criteria for assessing short term improvement with symptom modifying antirheumatic drugs and are presently in the process of developing response criteria for disease controlling antirheumatic treatment. Various experts are also currently examining discrepancies and inadequacies of classification systems for AS. Imaging studies, magnetic resonance imaging, in particular, may provide better classification criteria in the near future. In addition to consensus on outcome assessment and classification of AS, lessons learnt from clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may serve as a template for AS. Guidance provided by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical trials in RA may be of particular use. The FDA has defined the claims that sponsors can receive for RA products and the clinical trial data that would be expected to be submitted to support such claims.

### Treatment strategies in axial spondyloarthritis: what, when and how? [^111id42w]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There have been major advances in the diagnosis, classification and understanding of the pathophysiology of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). This has led to the successful introduction in the clinic of new agents for the treatment of axSpA. However, despite treatment recommendations, there remain many unanswered questions relating to how best to use existing, and upcoming, therapies to achieve optimal outcomes for patients with axSpA. Here we consider the available therapies in axSpA, highlight specific areas of uncertainty relating to these and present suggestions to support clinical decision making in this setting.

### Defining the target: clinical aims in axial spondyloarthritis [^115NhhEi]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The treatment armamentarium for AS continues to expand. Although clinical guidelines recommend the application of a T2T paradigm for the treatment of axSpA, much debate and uncertainty remain on what an adequate target should be, when intervention should occur and what role treatment strategy will play. Further research is needed to clarify these points and validated definitions of remission and flare are needed; however, the current evidence suggests that therapy should be aimed at an early stage of disease before the processes of fat transformation and new bone formation have started. It is important that the assessments used to monitor long-term response in routine clinical practice reflect the overarching goals of treatment.

Ankylosing spondylitis with contraindications to TNFi — biologic selection. In adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) despite treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and who have contraindications to TNFi, we conditionally recommend treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with sulfasalazine, methotrexate, or tofacitinib. Treatment with rituximab, abatacept, tocilizumab, or IL-6 inhibitors is not recommended due to lack of effectiveness, and interleukin-17 inhibitors have not been shown to be efficacious in IBD, although tofacitinib is an approved treatment for ulcerative colitis.

### Management and treatment of ankylosing spondylitis [^111CYrdk]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Our purpose is to review the developments in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in 2004.

Recent Findings

Tumor necrosis factor blockers have been shown to have rapid and persistent efficacy with limited additional toxicity up to 4 years with continuing therapy, but cessation of therapy results in relapse in most patients. Therapy is cost-effective. There are some differences between the different tumor necrosis factor blockers currently available. Other biologic therapies are not as promising. Algorithms have been developed to aid in early diagnosis. This may be relevant for future therapeutic strategies.

Summary

Tumor necrosis factor blockers are effective and safe in active spinal disease, but simple measures such as exercise and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy are still considered the basis of standard therapy. Early disease diagnosis is becoming easier, and is likely to be important for optimal therapeutic responses. Future research will include the effect of tumor necrosis factor blockade on structural disease progression.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

ACR/SAA/SPARTAN 2019 — TNFi nonresponse in ankylosing spondylitis (AS): Switching to secukinumab or ixekizumab was recommended in most patients with a primary nonresponse to the first tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), while continuing the first TNFi could be considered to allow additional time to assess response or to adjust dose/interval; for secondary nonresponse, treatment with a different TNFi should be used in most patients and treatment with a second TNFi was recommended rather than immediately switching to a different class of biologics. In cases of nonresponse, the panel recommended against switching to the biosimilar of the first TNFi and recommended against adding sulfasalazine or methotrexate; the addition of sulfasalazine could be considered in the rare patient with well-controlled axial symptoms on TNFi who also has active peripheral arthritis.

### Trends in treatment and outcomes of ankylosing spondylitis in outpatient rheumatological care in Germany between 2000 and 2012 [^115xC7ZB]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is among the most common inflammatory rheumatic diseases and the major subtype of the group referred to as spondyloarthritides (SpA). This group can be divided into predominantly peripheral and predominantly axial forms of SpA, with AS being assigned to predominantly axial SpA. AS is more often diagnosed in men and has its usual onset between 25 and 40 years of age. As a progressive disease, it leads to structural damage, functional disability and a decrease in quality of life.

Typically, AS leads to radiographic changes in the sacroiliac joints and spine, although the onset of low back pain often dates back several years, before radiographic signs can be found. Although MRI technology now allows for the detection of active inflammation of the sacroiliac joints, which is assumed to be one sign of a potentially evolving AS, the diagnosis and subsequent therapeutic interventions remain a challenge. While synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARDs) are known to be effective in peripheral forms of SpA, no substantial outcome improvement could be verified for axial manifestations. For a long time, the only effective pharmacological treatment options for AS have been non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), improving clinical symptoms in 70–80% of treated patients. Consequently, NSAIDs are still recommended as the first choice of treatment. With the introduction of tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), new treatment options have become available and, meanwhile, they are recommended to be applied after non-response or unsatisfactory response to NSAIDs. We have analysed how drug treatment has changed over the past decade and how recommendations for the management of AS are reflected in routine rheumatological care in Germany. This is complemented by the evaluation of outcome assessments, healthcare utilisation and employment situation.

### Comparison of recommendations for the use of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy in ankylosing spondylitis in 23 countries worldwide [^114ErDnK]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To give an overview of the recommendations for the use of anti-TNF-α therapy in AS in 23 countries worldwide.

Methods

The recommendations were collected, translated and a summary was checked by Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) members from the respective countries. The recommendations were compared with the ASAS recommendations (2006) on three aspects: patient selection for initiation of treatment (diagnosis, disease activity, previous treatment and contraindications), assessment of disease and assessment of response.

Results

The majority of the recommendations are similar to the ASAS recommendation with regard to patient selection, assessment of disease and treatment response. Additional objective assessments of disease activity are required in eight countries, leading to a more strict indication to start anti-TNF-α therapy. CONCLUSION; Most national recommendations follow the international ASAS recommendations, suggesting that the latter are widely implemented. This might contribute to comparable access with anti-TNF-α treatment across countries. This article shows that general consensus exists about the use of anti-TNF-α therapy in AS across the world, although some countries require additional objective signs of inflammation and/or more pre-treatment, which limits access.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network 2019 update — scope and methods are as follows: Axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) comprises ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial SpA, and AS affects 0.1–0.5% of the population. The update was warranted by new medications to treat axial SpA and did not reexamine all 2015 recommendations, instead focusing on questions with consequential new evidence and adding recommendations on how newly available medications should fit in treatment strategies and on the use of imaging. Target populations are adults with AS or nonradiographic axial SpA, and target users include rheumatologists, primary care clinicians, physiatrists, physical therapists, and others providing care to patients with axial SpA. Methods followed American College of Rheumatology and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology with systematic literature reviews for prespecified population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) questions, and an expert voting panel reviewed evidence and formulated and voted on recommendations.

### Treatment update on spondyloarthropathy [^112L1DQp]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The unexpected success of the tumor necrosis factor antagonists in ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis has generated considerable enthusiasm regarding the therapeutic potential of these drugs. By contrast, concerns regarding the high cost and long-term safety of the tumor necrosis factor blocking agents have prompted investigators to take a closer look at more traditional anti-inflammatory agents and to explore novel therapeutic targets. The purpose of this review is to summarize treatment advances in spondylarthropathy over the past year and to discuss potential future therapies.

Recent Findings

Recent studies indicate that the morbidity of ankylosing spondylitis and PsA are considerably higher than previously reported. Etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab safely and effectively relieved the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis patients in phase III trials. Etanercept and infliximab were also effective in phase III trials in ankylosing spondylitis. Etanercept slowed radiographic progression in psoriatic arthritis trials, but it is not known whether tumor necrosis factor antagonists can prevent structural damage in ankylosing spondylitis. One trial showed that methotrexate may be effective for relieving the pain of axial disease in ankylosing spondylitis but these findings contradict two previous studies. For reactive arthritis and undifferentiated spondylarthropathy, a combination of antibiotics may be more effective than a single antibiotic for the relief of musculoskeletal symptoms. Last, potential therapeutic targets include interleukin-1, interleukin-12, B lymphocytes, accessory molecules on T lymphocytes, and angiogenic factors.

Summary

Phase III trials have confirmed that tumor necrosis factor antagonists are effective and safe for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. For patients who do not respond to tumor necrosis factor blockade, several treatment options are under study. Information from these trials will more clearly define the role of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, novel therapeutic agents, and antibiotics in the treatment of spondylarthropathy.

### Recent advances in the treatment of the spondyloarthropathies [^116Wo2PM]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recently, there has been renewed interest in the spondyloarthropathy family of chronic inflammatory rheumatic conditions, which has been fueled to a large extent by the biologic era. Over the period of the past 2 years in particular, there have been several notable advances. First, there have been a number of large, high-quality randomized controlled trials evaluating the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers and conservative treatments such as physiotherapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for use in spondyloarthropathy. This has paved the way for the development of better tools to assess outcome in these patients both in daily practice and in the context of clinical trials. This review uses a systematic approach to outline the most recent (within the last 2 years) and the most pertinent advances in the treatments of the spondyloarthropathies, with particular emphasis on ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis.

Recent Findings

Supervised group exercise programs maintain flexibility and posture in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, and spa therapy is a cost-effective treatment option in ankylosing spondylitis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have a role in symptom modification and, more importantly, may prevent structural disease progression in patients with ankylosing spondylitis when administered continuously at a fixed dose. TNF blockers have been evaluated in a number of randomized controlled trials in ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis and have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the short-term management of these diseases. Longer-term trials are awaited with radiographic outcomes to comment on their disease-modifying properties and their long-term safety and efficacy profiles.

Summary

There has been renewed interest in the spondyloarthropathy family of disorders, with an explosion in the number of trials evaluating outcome with the TNF blockers. To date, no cure has been found for the disease, but these agents are emerging as the best therapeutic option available for patients with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis to date.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis — positioning of new and existing therapies is summarized as follows: Based on the panel's considerations, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) agents remain the primary classes of medications for AS and nonradiographic axial SpA. Secukinumab or ixekizumab is recommended for patients with active disease who have heart failure or demyelinating disease as a contraindication to TNFi, and in primary nonresponders to TNFi. Secukinumab and ixekizumab are not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or recurrent uveitis, as TNFi monoclonal antibodies are better options. Tofacitinib is a potential second-line option for patients with contraindications to TNFi other than infections, and recommendations regarding tofacitinib may change pending the results of larger clinical trials.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) — discontinuation and tapering of tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) therapy: Discontinuation might be considered in sustained remission with the expectation that "only one-third of patients would not experience relapse". Two unblinded trials tapering etanercept to 25 mg weekly versus maintaining 50 mg weekly found remission or partial remission was "somewhat less likely" with tapering; small observational studies reported "53–70%" maintained reduced dose at "2 years". Accordingly, "the panel recommended against tapering of biologics as a standard approach", though tapering "could be considered" for prolonged stable AS with shared decision-making.

Ankylosing spondylitis — biosimilar switching: In adults with stable AS receiving an originator TNFi, "we strongly recommend continuing treatment with the originator TNFi over switching to its biosimilar (new, PICO 63)". The panel "recommend[ed] against mandated switching to a biosimilar… in the absence of evidence of interchangeability", noting that medication changes "can increase the risk of destabilizing a patient's condition", and that a "compelling rationale for switching" is needed given only marginal cost savings.

### ASAS / EULAR recommendations for the management of ankylosing spondylitis [^116v8DX6]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) as a combined effort of the 'ASsessment in AS' international working group and the European League Against Rheumatism.

Methods

Each of the 22 participants was asked to contribute up to 15 propositions describing key clinical aspects of AS management. A Delphi process was used to select 10 final propositions. A systematic literature search was then performed to obtain scientific evidence for each proposition. Outcome data for efficacy, adverse effects, and cost effectiveness were abstracted. The effect size, relative risk, number needed to treat, and incremental cost effectiveness ratio were calculated. On the basis of the search results, 10 major recommendations for the management of AS were constructed. The strength of recommendation was assessed based on the strength of the literature evidence, risk-benefit trade-off, and clinical expertise.

Results

The final recommendations considered the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (conventional NSAIDs, coxibs, and co-prescription of gastroprotective agents), disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, treatments with biological agents, simple analgesics, local and systemic steroids, non-pharmacological treatment (including education, exercise, and physiotherapy), and surgical interventions. Three general recommendations were also included. Research evidence (categories I-IV) supported 11 interventions in the treatment of AS. Strength of recommendation varied, depending on the category of evidence and expert opinion.

Conclusion

Ten key recommendations for the treatment of AS were developed and assessed using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. Regular updating will be carried out to keep abreast of new developments in the management of AS.

### Optimizing outcomes for ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis patients: a holistic approach to care [^1132HxmT]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The wide-ranging impact of AS/axSpA on the individual means that a holistic approach should be taken. Treating the inflammation and presuming everything else will improve is overly simplistic and runs the real risk of missing disease impact on major areas of life, with the potential to prevent patients managing and living successfully with their disease. Adopting a patient-centred approach and ensuring that the impact of AS/axSpA is considered across the physical, psychological, vocational and social spectrum, rather than maintaining a narrow focus on disease activity, should enhance care and achieve real-life improvements for patients.

### Treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis with infliximab: a randomised controlled multicentre trial [^117Jr2tq]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Unlabelled

BACKGROUND Treatment options for patients with ankylosing spondylitis are few. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of infliximab, an antibody to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, in treatment of such patients.

Methods

In this 12-week placebo-controlled multicentre study, we randomly assigned 35 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis to intravenous infliximab (5 mg/kg) and 35 to placebo at weeks 0, 2, and 6. One patient in the infliximab group was withdrawn from the study. Our primary outcome was regression of disease activity of at least 50%. To assess response, we used validated clinical criteria from the ankylosing spondylitis assessment working group, including disease activity (BASDAI), functional indices (BASFI), metrology (BASMI), and quality of life (short form 36). Analyses were done by intention to treat.

Findings

18 (53%) of 34 patients on infliximab had a regression of disease activity at week 12 of at least 50% compared with three (9%) of 35 on placebo (difference 44% [95% CI 23–61], p < 0.0001). Function and quality of life also improved significantly on infliximab but not on placebo (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Treatment with infliximab was generally well tolerated, but three patients had to stop treatment because of systemic tuberculosis, allergic granulomatosis of the lung, or mild leucopenia.

Interpretation

Our results show that treatment with infliximab is effective in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. Since there are some potentially serious adverse effects, we recommend that this treatment mainly be used in co-operation with rheumatological centres.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Disease activity assessment, imaging, and screening in AS — We conditionally recommend the regular-interval use and monitoring of a validated AS disease activity measure and regular-interval use and monitoring of CRP concentrations or ESR over usual care without regular CRP or ESR monitoring; in adults with active AS, we conditionally recommend against using a treat-to-target strategy using a target of ASDAS < 1.3 over a treatment strategy based on physician assessment; we conditionally recommend screening for osteopenia/osteoporosis with DXA scan over no screening and, in adults with syndesmophytes or spinal fusion, screening with DXA scan of the spine as well as the hips compared to DXA scan solely of the hip or other non-spine sites; we strongly recommend against screening for cardiac conduction defects with electrocardiograms and against screening for valvular heart disease with echocardiograms; in adults with AS of unclear activity while on a biologic, we conditionally recommend obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to assess activity, while in adults with stable AS, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity; and in adults with active or stable AS on any treatment, we conditionally recommend against obtaining repeat spine radiographs at a scheduled interval (e.g., every 2 years) as a standard approach.

Nonradiographic axial SpA — management after inadequate response to first TNFi: In adults with primary nonresponse to the first TNFi, we conditionally recommend switching to secukinumab or ixekizumab over switching to a different TNFi. In adults with secondary nonresponse to the first TNFi, we conditionally recommend switching to a different TNFi over switching to a non-TNFi biologic. We strongly recommend against switching to the biosimilar of the first TNFi, and we conditionally recommend against the addition of sulfasalazine or methotrexate in favor of treatment with a different biologic.

### Treatment of axial spondyloarthritis: an update [^114Lipd3]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Diagnosis and management of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) has vastly improved over the past two decades. With advances in the discernment of immunopathogenesis of this disease, new therapies have become available, which are associated with substantial improvement in symptoms, signs and quality of life. The four broad categories of approved treatment options are physical therapy and exercise (which have been known to be beneficial for millennia), NSAIDs (since the 1950s), TNF inhibitors (first FDA approval in 2003) and IL-17 inhibitors (first FDA approval in 2016). In addition, there have been a host of new developments in the axSpA field, including new treatment guidelines, the FDA approval of three biologic DMARDs to treat non-radiographic axSpA, the FDA and EMA approval of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors for ankylosing spondylitis, new data on the effect of biologic DMARDs on structural progression in ankylosing spondylitis, strategy trials on tapering or stopping TNF inhibitors in patients in remission, trials of treat-to-target strategy in axSpA, and several new molecules in phase III studies. This Review explores the developments in the management of axSpA.

### Anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis [^113xZLBf]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ankylosing spondylitis is the prototype of spondyloarthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease involving mainly the axial skeleton. The treatment strategy was, until now, restricted to NSAIDs and anti-TNF agents. Targeting Interleukin 17 is an emerging option with a currently available biologic agent, secukinumab.

Areas Covered

This paper reviews the available data published on secukinumab (and other anti-IL-17 agents) in ankylosing spondylitis, evaluating the effect on clinical outcomes as well as radiological progression and extra articular manifestations and safety.

Expert Opinion

Secukinumab represents the first anti-IL-17A agent available for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, with evidence of efficacy upon signs and symptoms of the disease, even after anti-TNF failure, and acceptable safety profile.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Ankylosing spondylitis — NSAID trial adequacy and TNF inhibitor (TNFi) selection are guided by explicit thresholds and safety considerations. Adequate NSAID trials before escalating to TNFi are defined as a lack of response or intolerance to at least 2 different NSAIDs at maximal doses over 1 month, or incomplete responses to at least 2 different NSAIDs over 2 months, with noted exceptions for recurrent uveitis or coexistent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients treated with infliximab may have increased risk of tuberculosis and of infections generally, and TNFi other than infliximab should be considered for patients at higher risk of tuberculosis exposure or with a history of recurrent infections.

Adults with active ankylosing spondylitis with inadequate response to the first tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) — next steps: In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with a different TNFi in patients with primary nonresponse to TNFi. In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend treatment with a different TNFi over treatment with a non-TNFi biologic in patients with secondary nonresponse to TNFi. In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we strongly recommend against switching to treatment with a biosimilar of the first TNFi. In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend against the addition of sulfasalazine or methotrexate in favor of treatment with a new biologic.
