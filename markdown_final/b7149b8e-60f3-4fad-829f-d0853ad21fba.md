## Question

A 56-year-old man comes to the physician because of a painless blistering rash on his hands, forearms, and face for 2 weeks. The rash is not itchy and seems to get worse in the sunlight. He has also noticed that his urine is darker than usual. His aunt and sister have a history of similar skin lesions. Examination of the skin shows multiple fluid-filled blisters and oozing erosions on the forearms, dorsal side of both hands, and forehead. There are areas of hyperpigmented scarring and patches of bald skin along the sides of the blisters. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to treat this patient's condition?
A. Hemin
B. Prednisone
C. Fexofenadine
D. Hydroxychloroquine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacotherapy is most appropriate for a 56-year-old man presenting with a painless, photodistributed, blistering eruption on sun-exposed sites, dark urine, and a family history suggesting porphyria cutanea tarda, and to choose among hemin, prednisone, fexofenadine, and hydroxychloroquine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits porphyria cutanea tarda. Then, I should verify the key differentials that can mimic this presentation and how to exclude them. Next, I will review evidence-based treatments for PCT and align them with the provided options. Finally, I will confirm dosing and safety considerations and select the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern. Painless, tense bullae on the dorsal hands, forearms, and face, worsened by sunlight, with skin fragility, milia, hyperpigmented scarring, and dark urine are classic for porphyria cutanea tarda, and a positive family history supports the hereditary or familial form in about 20–25% of cases, which fits this vignette well [^1159e7dp] [^112aBvog] [^116EhCcJ].

> Wait, let me verify the key differentials before jumping to treatment. Pseudoporphyria can look identical clinically and histologically but lacks biochemical porphyrin elevation; drug triggers and dialysis are common, so I should confirm porphyrin studies if available, but the stem's emphasis on dark urine and family history strongly favors true PCT rather than pseudoporphyria here [^111oocpy] [^117XANNt]. Bullous pemphigoid is usually pruritic and not photodistributed, and variegate porphyria can blister but also causes acute neurovisceral attacks with elevated ALA/PBG, which are not described here, so these are less likely in this scenario [^115bqK1P] [^115Gr7EN].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to guide therapy. PCT results from reduced hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity in the setting of hepatic iron overload and oxidative stress, leading to accumulation of uroporphyrin and related porphyrins that render skin fragile and photosensitive; iron depletion and reduction of porphyrin burden are central to management [^1159e7dp] [^115Gr7EN].

> Now, I will examine the treatment options against guideline-based care. Standard first-line therapy is therapeutic phlebotomy to reduce iron load, but that is not listed among the choices, so I must select the best pharmacologic option provided. Low-dose antimalarials, particularly hydroxychloroquine, are established alternatives that increase urinary porphyrin excretion and reduce hepatic porphyrin content; case-based evidence and reviews support hydroxychloroquine 100–200 mg twice weekly achieving biochemical and clinical remission, often within months, which makes hydroxychloroquine the most appropriate choice among the listed drugs [^1159e7dp] [^111jEH7P] [^114BcJR2].

> Hold on, I should verify why the other options are incorrect. Hemin is used for acute hepatic porphyrias during neurovisceral attacks to repress hepatic ALA synthase; it is not indicated for the chronic cutaneous photosensitivity of PCT, so choosing hemin would be a mismatch for this phenotype [^115Gr7EN]. Prednisone and other systemic corticosteroids do not address the porphyrin-driven pathogenesis of PCT and are not recommended for its treatment, so prednisone would be inappropriate here [^1159e7dp]. Fexofenadine is an antihistamine useful for pruritic dermatoses but PCT lesions are typically nonpruritic and antihistamines do not modify porphyrin metabolism, so fexofenadine would not treat the disease mechanism.

> Let me consider dosing and safety to ensure the recommendation is practical. Hydroxychloroquine for PCT is generally used at low dose, such as 100 mg twice weekly, with monitoring for ocular toxicity and consideration of liver function given the frequent hepatic comorbidity in PCT; this approach balances efficacy with safety and aligns with contemporary case experience and reviews [^111jEH7P] [^1159e7dp].

> I should double-check supportive measures that optimize outcomes even when selecting pharmacotherapy. Counseling on alcohol abstinence, hepatitis C screening/treatment when present, estrogen review, and strict photoprotection are integral to management and reduce triggers while therapy takes effect, which complements hydroxychloroquine use in PCT [^1159e7dp] [^115Gr7EN].

> Conclusion: Given the classic PCT phenotype, the absence of features suggesting acute porphyria, and the available pharmacologic choices, hydroxychloroquine is the most appropriate treatment to initiate, with the understanding that iron reduction via phlebotomy remains the preferred first-line modality when feasible and that ongoing monitoring for liver disease and relapse is essential [^1159e7dp] [^115Gr7EN].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)** [^1159e7dp], given the painless, photodistributed bullae on sun-exposed areas, dark urine, and family history. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy is **hydroxychloroquine** [^111jEH7P] 100–200 mg twice weekly, which increases urinary porphyrin excretion and reduces hepatic porphyrin burden. Therapeutic phlebotomy is the **first-line therapy** [^116sjYEn] but is not listed among the options; if available, it should be prioritized. Prednisone is ineffective for PCT, fexofenadine is for pruritus (not present), and hemin is for acute porphyrias, not PCT [^115Gr7EN].

---

## Clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis

The clinical features — painless bullae on sun-exposed sites, dark urine, and a positive family history — are **highly suggestive of PCT** [^1159e7dp]. Key differentials include:

- **Pseudoporphyria**: clinically similar but normal porphyrins; often drug-induced (e.g. NSAIDs, diuretics) [^111oocpy] [^117XANNt].
- **Bullous pemphigoid**: pruritic, not photodistributed, with linear IgG/C3 on DIF [^114G4DAc].
- **Variegate porphyria**: photosensitivity plus neurovisceral attacks; elevated ALA/PBG during attacks [^115Gr7EN].
- **Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita**: trauma-induced scarring; linear IgG/C3 on DIF [^114G4DAc].

---

## Pathophysiology of porphyria cutanea tarda

PCT results from **reduced hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) activity** [^1159e7dp], causing uroporphyrin accumulation and photosensitivity. Triggers include alcohol, hepatitis C, estrogen, iron overload, and genetic UROD mutations [^1159e7dp].

---

## Pharmacological treatment options

### First-line therapy

Therapeutic **phlebotomy** is first-line to reduce hepatic iron and porphyrins, but it is not among the listed options [^116sjYEn].

---

### Second-line therapy

Low-dose **hydroxychloroquine** (100–200 mg twice weekly) increases urinary porphyrin excretion and reduces hepatic porphyrin burden; it is the best listed option [^1159e7dp] [^111jEH7P].

---

### Other options

Chloroquine is an alternative antimalarial, though **hydroxychloroquine** is preferred for its safety profile. Low-dose **chloroquine** (125 mg twice weekly) is also effective but less commonly used.

---

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Option** | **Mechanism of action** | **Relevance to pct** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hemin | Heme administration suppresses ALA synthase | Used for acute porphyrias, not PCT | Incorrect |
| Prednisone | Anti-inflammatory corticosteroid | No effect on porphyrin metabolism | Incorrect |
| Fexofenadine | Antihistamine | For pruritus; PCT is non-pruritic | Incorrect |
| Hydroxychloroquine | Antimalarial increasing porphyrin excretion | Effective second-line therapy for PCT | Correct |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting hydroxychloroquine

Clinical evidence includes a case report in which a transgender woman with PCT achieved remission on **hydroxychloroquine 100 mg twice weekly** [^111jEH7P], and a review that lists low-dose antimalarials as effective second-line therapy for PCT [^notfound].

---

## Potential side effects and monitoring

Potential side effects include **ocular toxicity** (retinopathy), gastrointestinal upset, and myopathy. Monitoring should include baseline and periodic ophthalmologic exams, liver function tests, and CBC.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy is **hydroxychloroquine** 100–200 mg twice weekly, as it directly reduces porphyrin burden and is supported by clinical evidence. Prednisone, fexofenadine, and hemin are not indicated for PCT [^notfound].

Frequently the internist is confronted with the nonspecific exanthematous eruption. While often a sign of a benign and self-limiting process, an exanthem also might herald the development of a more severe systemic syndrome. Infections, immune-mediated processes, drug reactions, a neoplasm, and familial syndromes with poor prognoses might all manifest initially with an exanthem. A thorough history and complete physical examination should be performed on all patients who present with an exanthem. Characterization of the exanthem morphology, other physical examination findings, and review of systems can help guide laboratory testing and ensure prompt diagnosis and early treatment of potentially life-threatening conditions. This article provides a brief overview of the conditions that must be considered in the evaluation of an ill patient with an exanthem.

### Widespread rash in a 45-year-old woman after moxifloxacin administration [^113Cvq12]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the first step in the management of this patient's condition?
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin
D. Application of topical antibiotics
E. Referral to a dermatologist

Answers:
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin – Correct. The first step in managing the patient's condition is to discontinue moxifloxacin. In cases of TEN, it is essential to discontinue the culprit drug immediately to prevent further progression of the condition. This step is crucial because continuation of the drug may exacerbate immune-mediated destruction of keratinocytes, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids – Incorrect. Systemic corticosteroids may be considered, but they are not the initial step. The primary goal is to remove the trigger, which in this case is moxifloxacin, to stop the adverse reaction.
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin – Incorrect. Also, intravenous immunoglobulins and other immunomodulatory treatments may be considered, but the primary goal is to stop moxifloxacin.
D. Application of topical antibiotics – Incorrect. The application of topical antibiotics is not relevant to the systemic nature of the TEN and does not address the underlying cause.
E. Referral to a dermatologist – Incorrect. Referral to a dermatologist is important for complete treatment but should follow immediate discontinuation of the drug.

### The management of porphyria cutanea tarda [^114BcJR2]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the commonest of all porphyrias, is usually characterized by blisters and fragility of skin in light-exposed areas. It can be clinically indistinguishable from other disorders including variegate porphyria and the diagnosis can only be made by rigorous biochemical analysis. PCT does not cause acute attacks of porphyria. It is usually an acquired condition caused by inhibition of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme in the liver. Hereditary haemochromatosis, hepatitis C virus infection, alcohol, oestrogens and a family history of PCT are the major risk factors for the condition and should be searched for specifically in all patients. Liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma, is common in patients with PCT, and should be investigated for at presentation by means of a liver biopsy where possible. Patients with severe hepatic pathology or longstanding untreated PCT need to be monitored for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in the long term. Low dose twice weekly chloroquine is the mainstay of treatment, but venesection should be used in patients with severe iron overload or hepatitis C-related liver disease. Subsequently, long-term follow-up is needed in all patients to monitor for relapse.

### Disseminated superficial porokeratosis involving the groin and genitalia in a 72-year-old immunocompetent man [^117HqTwg]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Case report

A 72-year-old white man with skin type II presented for evaluation of erythematous round to ovoid macules with collarettes of scale measuring approximately 0.5 to 2 cm in size, most prominently involving the lower extremities, buttocks, groin area, and penis that had been present for more than 13 years (Fig 1, Fig 2). He also had scattered lesions on his upper extremities and trunk. The lesions were associated with pruritus and paresthesias, especially in the groin. The patient was otherwise well, with hypertension, arthritis, and hypothyroidism being his only medical problems. His medications included acetaminophen, aspirin, levothyroxine, meloxicam, enalapril, and metoprolol. He denied any history of skin cancer, radiation, or heavy sun exposure or family history of a similar rash. He denied any changes in the lesions with sun exposure.

On initial examination via interactive telemedicine, porokeratosis was suspected, and the patient was empirically treated with triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream for the extremities and hydrocortisone valerate 0.2% cream for the groin region. His pruritic symptoms were moderately controlled with the topical steroids; however, there was no improvement in the number or appearance of lesions. Because of the atypical distribution, he was seen in the clinic for further evaluation and biopsy.

A shave biopsy of a lesion on the thigh was performed, and histology testing found well-formed cornoid lamellae with dyskeratotic cells at their base, confirming the diagnosis of porokeratosis (Fig 3). Based on the course and distribution of his disease, he was given a diagnosis of DSP.

Theme 3: managing porphyria cutanea tarda – strategies for prevention, treatment and controls

Preventive strategies: frequent controls, taking calculated risks or doing nothing?

PCT was perceived as a chronic condition that patients needed to manage for the remainder of their lives. For some, this meant frequent controls and a vigilant lifestyle, with a focus on eating habits, avoiding the sun and generally being careful. For others, prevention involved taking blood samples and having control intervals. Control intervals varied greatly, from having ferritin levels never checked to having them checked every 2 weeks, every month and twice a year. The merits of this were debated by participants, and the more 'experienced' patients with PCT were asked for advice as to how often they should be tested, which test should be done and who should perform them. A few participants said they did nothing to prevent PCT. As Lilly said, 'I have a disease, but I'm not ill'. Most took calculated risks and would enjoy alcohol, sun and good food, but in moderation. They said they knew they risked skin symptoms, but it was worth it. However, the suspicion that PCT caused other problems was more worrying. Lilly said:

I think about it. But I choose to do it. And I think, like, if I'm traveling to sunny places, if I happen to get a blister, well that's just… I have a blister, blood samples and bloodletting. But what I might think about sometimes is, what does it do to other things in the body? Right? I'm thinking cirrhosis. Kidney failure? I mean, what if I defy this and perhaps avoid getting a blister. But perhaps I got it because I didn't take the precautions I should. And I just used bloodletting as a way to exceed my limitations. Do you understand what I'm saying? Because I don't want that, but this is something you don't know a lot about yet. Right? What it does to other organs? Because if it's just a rash that can be treated with draining blood? Well, then we can just do whatever we want, can't we?

### A 9-year-old girl with blisters on the hands and face: an early presentation of variegate porphyria [^114i6jM1]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Variegate porphyria (VP) is a rare subtype of porphyrias characterized by dysfunction of enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway leading to an accumulation of porphyrins and their precursors. The resulting buildup can manifest as neuropsychiatric symptoms and photosensitive blistering eruptions on sun-exposed skin. We report a case of VP in a 9-year-old girl with many confounding medical factors that warranted alternative explanations for her cutaneous lesions. VP has been reported infrequently in the pediatric population and is associated with more severe neuropsychiatric outcomes compared to adult-onset disease.

### How I treat erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^117UUCur]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is an inherited cutaneous porphyria caused by reduced expression of ferrochelatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in heme biosynthesis. The resultant accumulation of protoporphyrin IX leads to severe, painful cutaneous photosensitivity, as well as potentially life-threatening liver disease in a small percentage of patients. X-linked protoporphyria (XLP) is clinically similar to EPP but results from increased activity of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase 2, the first step in heme biosynthesis in the bone marrow, and also causes protoporphyrin accumulation. Although historically the management of EPP and XLP (collectively termed protoporphyria) centered around avoidance of sunlight, novel therapies have recently been approved or are in development, which will alter the therapeutic landscape for these conditions. We present 3 patient cases, highlighting key treatment considerations in patients with protoporphyria, including (1) approach to photosensitivity, (2) managing iron deficiency in protoporphyria, and (3) understanding hepatic failure in protoporphyria.

and are scattered throughout the body, including the axillae, medial thighs, groin, abdomen, flexor forearms, and lower legs. The lesions may be localized or generalized. Most often, the bullae are filled with a clear fluid, but they also can be hemorrhagic. There is no scar formation noted following the lesions of bullous pemphigoid, but milia may appear at sites of previously involved skin. 8 can lead to the formation of strictures, and these patients may present with dysphagia, odynophagia, and weight loss. Eventually, complete occlusion of the esophagus may occur. The blisters are subepidermal and surrounded by a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. In mucosal lesions, this infiltrate is primarily made up of mononuclear cells, histiocytes and plasma cells, while the skin lesion infiltrate is composed predominantly of eosinophils and neutrophils. Older skin lesions have less inflammation, with prominent fibroblast proliferation.

The lesions are usually intensely pruritic, accompanied by burning and stinging. Many patients experience localized burning, stinging, and pruritus approximately eight to 12 hours before the onset of lesions, and many are able to predict an eruption. Rarely, the lesions may be asymptomatic. There is symmetric distribution along the extensor surfaces, including the elbows, knees, buttocks, shoulders, and sacral areas. Less frequently, the lesions are found on the scalp, face, hairline, and the posterior neck. Involvement of the palms and soles is rare, and mucous membrane lesions are uncommon. COURSE AND COMPLICATIONS Dermatitis herpetiformis follows a prolonged course, lasting up to years. Approximately one third of patients eventually have spontaneous remission. Chronic bullous disease of childhood presents with abrupt onset of tense bullae on an inflamed, erythematous base and is accompanied by pruritus and a burning sensation.

The lesions are most frequently found on or near the genitalia, but may also be found on other areas, including the face, especially the perioral region. Oral ulcers are noted in 50 percent of cases. 12 Characteristic "collarettes" of blisters often form as new lesions arise in the periphery of old lesions. In both forms of linear IgA dermatosis, mucous membrane involvement may occur and ranges in severity from mild oral ulcers to severe oral or conjunctival disease.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^114gT6rK]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

KDIGO recommendations in Chapter 18: cancer of the skin and lip — prevention, screening, and referral for kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are as follows: 18.1. We recommend that KTRs, especially those who have fair skin, live in high sun-exposure climates, have occupations requiring sun exposure, have had significant sun exposure as a child, or have a history of skin cancer, be told that their risk of skin and lip cancer is very high. (1C) 18.2. We recommend that KTRs minimize life-long sun exposure and use appropriate ultraviolet light blocking agents. (1D) 18.3. We suggest that adult KTRs perform skin and lip self-examinations and report new lesions to a health-care provider. (2D) 18.4. For adult KTRs, we suggest that a qualified health professional, with experience in diagnosing skin cancer, perform annual skin and lip examination on KTRs, except possibly for KTRs with dark skin pigmentation. (2D) 18.5. We suggest that patients with a history of skin or lip cancer, or premalignant lesions, be referred to and followed by a qualified health professional with experience in diagnosing and treating skin cancer. (2D) 18.6. We suggest that patients with a history of skin cancer be offered treatment with oral acitretin, if there are no contraindications. (2B).

### Etravirine [^113qWtF6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe Skin Reactions

Inform patients that severe and potentially life-threatening rash has been reported with etravirine. Rash has been reported most commonly in the first 6 weeks of therapy. Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop rash. Instruct patients to immediately stop taking etravirine and seek medical attention if they develop a rash associated with any of the following symptoms as it may be a sign of a more serious reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or severe hypersensitivity: fever, generally ill feeling, extreme tiredness, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, eye inflammation, facial swelling, swelling of the eyes, lips, mouth, breathing difficulty, and/or signs and symptoms of liver problems (e.g., yellowing of your skin or whites of your eyes, dark or tea colored urine, pale colored stools/bowel movements, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching or sensitivity on your right side below your ribs). Patients should understand that if severe rash occurs, they will be closely monitored, laboratory tests will be ordered and appropriate therapy will be initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Drug Interactions

Etravirine may interact with many drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medication or herbal products, including St. John's wort [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Toxic cutaneous responses from inhalant abuse [^11611E9z]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 24 year old man with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department and was hospitalized for a painful rash. One week before admission, a progressive, tender, blistering rash developed, involving the left side of his upper chest, left arm and left hand. His lips, oral mucosa, and tongue were also involved with associated erosions and pain in his gums. The patient denied known precipitating factors including associated medication use, preceding infections, new or different topical products, travel history, insect bites, new or multiple sexual partners, and close contacts with similar eruptions. He did, however, report a similar rash on his right leg and groin 1 month before admission that resolved spontaneously with dark spots. The patient had no known allergies, and no personal or family history of skin disease. The patient vehemently denied use of drugs and alcohol. He works in a car factory on an assembly line and denied exposure to chemicals. He reports that since admission, the rash is stable and denies new areas of involvement.

Skin examination found blanching, erythematous to violaceous patches and plaques with sharply defined borders on the left side of the upper chest, shoulder, and arm (Fig 1, A). Tender, tense bullae were found on the left shoulder and left lateral arm (Fig 1, B). Thick yellow-brown plaques with yellow crust were noted on his right thumb. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation was also noted on the proximal right leg and inguinal fold. Superficial erosions on his tongue and oral commissures with hemorrhagic crust were also noted, and the nasal tip contained a crusted plaque (Fig 1, C).

Photos taken 7 days after the toxic insult.

In the emergency department, he was given intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics for his nausea and vomiting and suspected cellulitis. Chest and abdominal radiographs and electrocardiogram results were normal. Laboratory tests found an elevated a leukocytosis (14.1) with neutrophilia (84%). Troponin levels were elevated to 1.180. Urine drug screen was negative.

### Clinical guide and update on porphyrias [^115Gr7EN]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Physicians should be aware of porphyrias, which could be responsible for unexplained gastrointestinal, neurologic, or skin disorders. Despite their relative rarity and complexity, most porphyrias can be easily defined and diagnosed. They are caused by well-characterized enzyme defects in the complex heme biosynthetic pathway and are divided into categories of acute vs non-acute or hepatic vs erythropoietic porphyrias. Acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) manifest in attacks and are characterized by overproduction of porphyrin precursors, producing often serious abdominal, psychiatric, neurologic, or cardiovascular symptoms. Patients with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria can present with skin photosensitivity. Diagnosis relies on measurement of increased urinary 5-aminolevulinic acid (in patients with aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) or increased 5-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen (in patients with other acute porphyrias). Management of attacks requires intensive care, strict avoidance of porphyrinogenic drugs and other precipitating factors, caloric support, and often heme therapy. The non-acute porphyrias are porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, X-linked protoporphyria, and the rare congenital erythropoietic porphyria. They lead to the accumulation of porphyrins that cause skin photosensitivity and occasionally severe liver damage. Secondary elevated urinary or blood porphyrins can occur in patients without porphyria, for example, in liver diseases, or iron deficiency. Increases in porphyrin precursors and porphyrins are also found in patients with lead intoxication. Patients with porphyria cutanea tarda benefit from iron depletion, hydroxychloroquine therapy, and, if applicable, elimination of the hepatitis C virus. An α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogue can reduce sunlight sensitivity in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria. Strategies to address dysregulated or dysfunctional steps within the heme biosynthetic pathway are in development.

Case Presentation

A 56-year-old man presented to the pulmonary clinic with dyspnea and hypoxemia on exertion. He was an avid biker and skier who had noticed a significant decrease in high-level physical activity over the past 3 years. He reported dyspnea, desaturations at altitudes higher than 9,000 feet, dry cough, tachycardia, and palpitations with exercise. Review of systems was also notable for gluten-intolerance, Raynaud's phenomenon, recurrent skin lesions and joint swelling, pain, and stiffness in the areas overlying the jaw, wrists, knees, and ankles (after capsaicin exposure). He denied fever, chills, anorexia, weight loss, hair loss, ocular symptoms, jaw claudication, chest pain, or lower extremity swelling. He had a five pack-year smoking history, no history of prematurity, childhood asthma, recurrent infections, or environmental and occupational exposure. Based on pulmonary function tests from an outside provider, he had received a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma and had been prescribed an albuterol inhaler to use on an as-needed basis, which failed to improve his symptoms. He was later prescribed a mometasone-formoterol inhaler, still with no symptomatic improvement.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria are rare genetic photodermatoses. Limited expertise with these disorders among physicians leads to diagnostic delays. Here, we present evidence-based consensus guidelines for the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria. A systematic literature review was conducted, and reviewed among subcommittees of experts, divided by topic. Consensus on guidelines was reached within each subcommittee and then among all members of the committee. The appropriate biochemical and genetic testing to establish the diagnosis is reviewed in addition to the interpretation of results. Prevention of symptoms, management of acute phototoxicity, and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options are discussed. The importance of ongoing monitoring for liver disease, iron deficiency, and vitamin D deficiency is discussed with management guidance. Finally, management of pregnancy and surgery and the safety of other therapies are summarized. We emphasize that these are multisystemic disorders that require longitudinal monitoring. These guidelines provide a structure for evidence-based diagnosis and management for practicing physicians. Early diagnosis and management of these disorders are essential, particularly given the availability of new and emerging therapies.

Question 2: Which of the following is a risk factor for development of this condition in this patient?
A. Age over 70
B. Prior history of radiation therapy
C. Prior history of melanoma
D. Prior history of nonmelanoma skin cancer
E. All of the above

Answer:
A. Age over 70 – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
B. Prior history of radiation therapy – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
C. Prior history of melanoma – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
D. Prior history of nonmelanoma skin cancer – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
E. All of the above – Correct. All of the above listed answer choices are risk factors for BP. Based on a recent propensity score-matched case-control study, age greater than 70 years at the time of receiving first immune checkpoint inhibitor cycle, history of melanoma, and history of nonmelanoma skin cancers are all associated with increased risk of developing BP among a cohort of patients treated with ICIs. Radiotherapy is also an independent risk factor for BP. While the underlying pathophysiology is unknown, it has been hypothesized that radiotherapy causes tissue damage, leading to increased antigen exposure and increased autoantibody production. In addition to the risk factor of ICI usage, BP onset in this patient is likely associated with radiotherapy exposure given localized distribution of disease in previously irradiated areas on bilateral cheeks.

### Vesiculobullous skin lesions on the hands and face [^116EhCcJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 58-year-old man presented at the dermatology clinic with bullous lesions on his hands that had appeared 3 months earlier, in early summer. Upon examination, bilateral tightly roofed vesicles on his hands, along with milium-grain scars (Fig 1), crusted erosions on the face and hands (Figs 1 and 2), bilateral malar hypertrichosis (Fig 3), diffuse skin pigmentation, and port-red urine were observed. The skin biopsy showed dermal-epidermal junctional cleavage without alteration in the epidermal roof or dermal inflammatory infiltrate.

Question 1: What is the likely diagnosis?
A. Bullous pemphigoid
B. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)
C. Scabies
D. Systemic lupus erythematosus
E. Contact dermatitis

Answers:
A. Bullous pemphigoid – Incorrect. Bullous pemphigoid typically presents with tense bullae on erythematous skin, without the characteristic features of PCT such as malar hypertrichosis or port-red urine.
B. PCT – Correct. The presented clinical features, including vesiculobullous lesions in photo-exposed areas, milium-grain scars, malar hypertrichosis, skin pigmentation, and port-red urine, are typical of PCT. It is a rare skin disorder resulting from acquired or inherited hepatic deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.
C. Scabies – Incorrect. Scabies usually causes intense itching and burrows in the skin, including in interdigital spaces.
D. Systemic lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Systemic lupus erythematosus may present with cutaneous manifestations on sun-exposed areas, but it is characterized by a prominent rash on the cheeks and nose, commonly known as a "butterfly rash".
E. Contact dermatitis – Incorrect. Contact dermatitis typically presents with erythema, edema, and vesicles in areas of contact with an offending agent, which does not match the presentation described in the case.

### Porphyrias [^113Go42h]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Seven different porphyrias form a group of inherited metabolic disorders, each resulting from a partial deficiency of a specific enzyme in the haem biosynthesis pathway. Clinically, the three most important entities are an acute porphyric attack and acute and chronic skin symptoms. Porphyrias are rare and sometimes misdiagnosed, because various symptoms and signs mimic other diseases. Once porphyria is suspected, biochemical analyses easily detect porphyrins and their precursors from blood, urine, or faeces. Mutation screening can be done at the quiescent phase of the disease. Pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical manifestations differ in individual porphyrias and most of them require a specific treatment. Early diagnosis and information about precipitating factors can diminish mortality and prevent subsequent attacks among patients with acute porphyrias, so mutation screening is recommended for family members.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^112Cg6RZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Photolocalized varicella
B. Phototoxic drug reaction
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda
D. Polymorphous light eruption (PMLE)
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus

Answers:
A. Photolocalized varicella – Correct. Varicella is a common viral infection with a characteristic exanthem. Although viral rashes aggravated by sun exposure, trauma, and inflammation have been described, photolocalized varicella is rare, and the typical distribution may not be seen. As with our patient, a mild viral prodrome or constitutional symptoms are often reported. This case highlights the importance of including varicella in the differential diagnosis of a photolocalized eruption, especially in a patient with a known history of exposure and immunosuppression.
B. Phototoxic drug reaction – Incorrect. Phototoxic drug reactions present as more similar to a sunburn than to a pruritic eruption. Commonly reported etiologic drugs include vemurafenib, voriconazole, doxycycline, hydrochlorothiazide, amiodarone, and chlorpromazine. This patient was taking only ustekinumab and prednisone.
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. Porphyria cutanea tarda is a disorder of porphyrin accumulation and is characterized by painful vesicles that develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin, most commonly the hands and face. Most cases are due to acquired or inherited uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency.
D. PMLE – Incorrect. PMLE is an idiopathic photodermatosis that can present with a wide range of morphologies.PMLE can affect any skin type but is more commonly reported in lighter skin types. Systemic symptoms are rare in PMLE.
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a subtype of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that usually presents symmetrically as an annular or papulosquamous eruption distributed on the sun-exposed sites of the skin.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^116sjYEn]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the best treatment for this patient?
A. Drug discontinuation
B. Hydroxychloroquine
C. Immediate initiation of valacyclovir
D. Phlebotomy
E. Supportive care

Answers:
A. Drug discontinuation – Incorrect. In phototoxic drug reactions, the mainstay of treatment is the identification and cessation of the causative agent. In cases where discontinuation is not possible, patients should be instructed to avoid the sun and practice strict sun protection.
B. Hydroxychloroquine – Incorrect. Antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and quinacrine are the first-line systemic therapy for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Systemic medications are recommended in cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that are severe, widespread, or refractory to topical therapies.
C. Immediate initiation of valacyclovir – Correct. The treatment of choice for VZV infection in individuals at a greater risk for complications, including adults and immunocompromised patients, is antiviral therapy. The most commonly used antiviral agents are acyclovir and valacyclovir, which function by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and subsequently VZV replication. Our patient was treated with 1 gram of valacyclovir 3 times daily for 14 days and reported significant improvement after completion of the treatment course.
D. Phlebotomy – Incorrect. The standard treatment for patients with porphyria cutanea tarda is regular phlebotomy to reduce iron and porphyrin levels in the liver.
E. Supportive care – Incorrect. Varicella has a low complication rate, especially in children, and can be treated symptomatically. However, in immunosuppressed patients, antivirals should be promptly initiated to minimize the risk of complications.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^116QeugG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Clopidogrel hypersensitivity — incidence, presentation, and diagnostic notes include that clopidogrel (Plavix) is a selective, irreversible inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation for oral use, and the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions has been reported to range from 1% to 6%, with most estimates ranging from 1% to 3%. The most common hypersensitivity reaction is rash — macular, morbilliform, or diffuse and erythematous — beginning about 5 days into treatment; IgE-mediated reactions comprise about 5% to 7%, and in one case series urticaria represented 17% of reactions to clopidogrel. There is no validated skin testing or patch testing to clopidogrel, though the largest case series (42 patients) evaluated both immediate hypersensitivity testing and patch testing after a history suggestive of hypersensitivity; of the 42 patients tested, most had a history consistent with a delayed rash.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^116qSzuq]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic approach for this disease?
A. Autoantibody profile
B. Biochemical porphyrin profile
C. History and physical
D. Skin biopsy
E. VZV polymerase chain reaction

Answers:
A. Autoantibody profile – Incorrect. An autoantibody profile would be more useful for the diagnosis of connective tissue disease when there is clinical suspicion. Specifically, autoantibodies are frequently associated with cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Depending on the review of systems findings and clinical systemic symptoms, further laboratory testing may be indicated.
B. Biochemical porphyrin profile – Incorrect. The diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda is often confirmed by obtaining a biochemical porphyrin profile. In porphyria cutanea tarda, urinary porphyrins and plasma porphyrins are elevated. Fecal porphyrins may be elevated as well. Urinary excretion of porphobilinogen is normal, differentiating porphyria cutanea tarda from other porphyrias.
C. History and physical – Incorrect. Although a thorough history and physical is an important method for any diagnosis, this patient's atypical presentation and the rarity of this diagnosis required further laboratory confirmation.
D. Skin biopsy – Incorrect. Although skin biopsy can be utilized to make the correct diagnosis, a noninvasive diagnostic technique would be preferred as the next diagnostic step. On histopathologic examination, varicella will show multinucleated giant cellswith nuclear molding, cytopathic effect, and mild leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
E. VZV polymerase chain reaction – Correct. This patient's diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction to detect VZV. Serologic techniques can also be used to diagnose VZV, with active infection revealing elevated IgM titers. Studies have demonstrated that immunologic techniques and molecular amplification are superior for VZV detection when compared with serologic techniques.

### Summertime and the patient is itchy [^114w5QYU]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 36h history of a painful, itchy maculopapular rash and associated vesicles to his arms and neck. He had no history of exposure to new chemicals or hygiene products and no significant medical history. His physiological observations were normal and systemic examination was unremarkable. On close inspection the rash was noted to be present only on areas of skin exposed while wearing a polo shirt. On further questioning it transpired that he had been gardening 12h prior to the development of the rash. A diagnosis of phytophotodermatitis was made. The patient was discharged with chlorphenamine, simple analgesia and the advice to wear a long-sleeved t-shirt and sunscreen when gardening in future. Phytophotodermatitis is a cutaneous reaction caused by contact with light-sensitising compounds found in plants and exposure to ultraviolet A radiation. It is self-limiting and can be managed symptomatically.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Erythrodermic psoriasis — case 6 presents a 29-year-old man with a family history of psoriasis who developed plaque type psoriasis at 12 years of age initially treated with low-potency topical corticosteroids, with progressive worsening over the subsequent 6 years. He was treated initially with 15 mg per week of oral methotrexate (MTX) that led to significant elevations in his liver function test (LFT) findings after 9 months of therapy requiring discontinuation, failed to respond to a 12-week course of intramuscular alefacept, and thereafter obtained significant improvement with etanercept; approximately 7 months after his last etanercept dose an upper respiratory infection led to rapid worsening with involvement of most of his body surface area (BSA) sparing only the palms and soles. On examination he was afebrile with other vital signs within normal limits and had generalized erythematous inflammatory patches and plaques covering 95% of his BSA with superficial exfoliation of the face, palms, and soles, pitting edema of the lower extremities, and swelling of the toes without any specific individual joint tenderness.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda: a unique iron-related disorder [^1159e7dp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

The porphyrias are a group of disorders of heme biosynthesis, each characterized by an enzymatic defect in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) arises due to the inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) in the presence of hepatic iron and oxidative stress. Most patients with PCT have evidence of siderosis on liver biopsy, and the disease resolves with iron depletion. PCT manifests as skin fragility, blistering cutaneous lesions on sun-exposed areas, dark urine, and elevated plasma and urine porphyrins. Factors contributing to the development of PCT include alcohol use, hepatitis C virus infection, human immunodeficiency virus, estrogen use, UROD pathogenic variants, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Treatment includes therapeutic phlebotomy to decrease total body iron levels and low-dose hydroxychloroquine, which reduces hepatic porphyrin content. The following review explores the biology of PCT, the critical role of iron in disease pathogenesis, and our approach to the management of these patients.

### The rash that presents as a vesiculobullous eruption [^114qTLAM]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Various infections and autoimmune and reactive skin conditions can present with blisters of varying sizes. Some of these disorders are seen in everyday practice, whereas others are rarely encountered. In many cases, the clinical picture is so typical that the diagnosis is easy and obvious; nevertheless, the significant clinical overlap between many of these diseases can cause frustration in both unexperienced and expert clinicians. We present the most typical clinical clues and offer simplified algorithms to the clinical diagnosis of skin conditions with vesicles and bullae. We focus on several aspects, when assessing a patient with blisters on the skin: age of onset, a history of comorbidities and medications intake, the general condition of the patient, and most importantly, the distribution, number, size, morphology, and evolution of the blisters, the characteristics of the peribullous skin, and the presence of mucosal involvement. Emphasis is put on differentiating between potentially life-threatening blistering eruptions and more benign self-limiting conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

### Very early diagnosis and management of congenital erythropoietic porphyria [^1115ZFSD]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is a rare form of porphyria. This autosomal recessive inherited heme metabolism disorder is caused by a defect of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS), an enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Uroporphyrinogen III synthase deficiency leads to an accumulation of porphyrins in the erythroid precursors of bone marrow, red blood cells, and tissues such as skin, bones, teeth, and spleen. - The exposure of nonphysiological accumulated porphyrins to sunlight causes oxidative stress leading to cell death.

More than 50 pathogenic mutations in UROS have been identified explaining the various clinical presentations of CEP ranging from severe antenatal manifestations causing hydrops fetalis to adult-onset mild cutaneous lesions. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is characterized by severe skin photosensitivity and skin fragility, causing blisters, erosions, secondary skin infections, and later changes such as atrophy and mutilating scars. Accumulated porphyrins in the erythroid precursor of bone marrow and red blood cells result in ineffective erythropoiesis and long-term intravascular hemolysis. Other manifestations of CEP such as brown-red urine, erythrodontia, corneal ulceration, osteoporosis, and pathological bone fractures are corollaries of excessive porphyrins deposition in tissues. The diagnostic of CEP is based on the markedly elevated levels of porphyrins in urine, clinically observed with a dark-brown staining of the diapers. High levels of porphyrins in red blood cells and feces are also noted. Genetic testing identifying UROS mutation confirms the diagnosis.

Patients suffering from CEP have a poor outcome and quality of life. Several supportive therapies such as strict sun avoidance, physical sunblocks, red blood cells transfusions, hydroxyureaand splenectomyare commonly used in the management of CEP. Currently, the only available curative treatment of CEP is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this article, we present, to our knowledge, the youngest case of successful HSCT for CEP.

### Pruritic eruption on the extremities: report of 2 generations treated with dupilumab [^114G4DAc]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is your diagnosis?
A. Bullous pemphigoid
B. Bullous lupus
C. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
D. Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP)
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda

Answers:
A. Bullous pemphigoid – Incorrect. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder caused by autoantibodies targeted against bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 and bullous pemphigoid antigen 2. Histopathology would show a subepidermal blister with eosinophils; DIF would be positive for IgG and C3 in a linear pattern at the basement membrane zone (BMZ) in an N-serrated pattern. Immunofluorescence on salt-split skin would localize to the roof.
B. Bullous lupus – Incorrect. Bullous lupus is caused by circulating antibodies targeted against collagen VII; however, histopathology would show a subepidermal blister with neutrophils. DIF would show a "full-house pattern" with granular deposition of IgG, IgA, immunoglobulin (Ig) M, and C3 at the BMZ in a U-serrated pattern. Collagen VII is the target epitope in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, a rare, acquired subepidermal bullous disease. Classically, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita shows a cell-poor subepidermal blister on histopathology. DIF would show a broad linear band of IgG > C3 in a U-serrated pattern along the BMZ. Immunofluorescence on salt-split skin in both disorders would localize to the floor.
C. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is an inherited blistering disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding keratin 5 and keratin 14, resulting in tissue fragility. Histopathology would show an intraepidermal split. DIF would be negative.
D. EBP – Correct. EBP is a rare subtype of inherited dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) characterized by extremely pruritic lichenified, prurigo-like plaques and nodules. Pretibial involvement is typical, but it can also involve the forearms and trunk; nail dystrophy is common. Histopathology shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and subepidermal cleavage. DIF is negative.
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. Porphyria cutanea tarda is a blistering disorder caused by a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase. Histopathology would show a subepidermal noninflammatory blister with festooning, caterpillar bodies, and periodic acid–Schiff + perivascular hyaline material. DIF would show IgM + C3 around vessels.

Case report

A 36-year-old Caucasian male presented for evaluation of a widespread pruritic pustular eruption. It began on the left forearm and spread over 3 weeks to involve both upper and lower extremities with sparing of the trunk, face, hands, and feet. There were no associated constitutional symptoms and no improvement had occurred with a 10-day course of cephalexin followed by a 5-day course of prednisone 50 mg trialed by another physician prior to presentation at our clinic. The patient reported similar but less severe episodes occurring on a monthly basis over the previous 10 years.

His past medical history was significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia managed respectively with bisoprolol and rosuvastatin. He also gave a history of widespread erythema at birth, episodic spontaneous blistering of the skin in childhood and severe generalized xerosis and thickened skin on the extensors beginning in adulthood. The patient had one unaffected sibling, but there was a family history of similar skin problems occurring in his mother and maternal grandfather. There was no family history of psoriasis.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^112aBvog]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a rare disease characterized by fragile skin and blistering on sun-exposed areas. Increased urinary porphyrin excretion causes red- or dark-coloured urine. Symptoms typically develop in late adulthood and can be triggered by hepatic iron overload, alcohol intake, oestrogens, hepatitis C and various liver stressors, in combination with exposure to light. The prevalence of symptomatic disease is estimated to be 1 in 10 000. The condition exists in both a familial and sporadic subtype. Compared with 25% of cases worldwide, about 50% of cases of PCT in Norway are hereditary because of two founder mutations. Penetrance is very low, and only an estimated 10% of mutation carriers develop symptoms throughout life. Treatment consists of avoidance of precipitating factors, phlebotomy to reduce iron or increasing urinary porphyrin excretion by administering chloroquine.

It might take 6–15 months before complete clinical and biochemical remission is reached, but the prognosis is good, and many patients experience lifelong remission. To detect relapse, urinary porphyrin concentration, iron and liver functions should be assessed annually.

The principal aim of the Norwegian Porphyria Centre is to optimize the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with porphyria. Although the clinical benefits of mutation screening are controversial, distinguishing between sporadic and familial cases appears to be important to many patients and their relatives, and NAPOS therefore offers, in hereditary cases, predictive genetic testing and counselling to at-risk adult family members.

Photodermatoses can have a high psychological impact. Jong et al.investigated quality of life (QoL) in patients with a range of photodermatoses, including PCT. They concluded that, overall, photodermatoses had a major impact on QoL, but that PCT had a lower impact on QoL than did other cutaneous porphyrias. Very little knowledge of the psychosocial impact of PCT is available and more information on the subjective experiences is therefore needed to secure optimal treatment, follow-up and counselling of this group. The aim of the present study was therefore to explore the experiences persons with PCT have regarding symptoms, treatment, follow-up and prevention of the disease.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda unmasked by supratherapeutic estrogen during gender-affirming hormone therapy [^111jEH7P]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 55-year-old woman (transgender male-to-female) maintained on oral estradiol for 23 years presented with a 3-month history of burning pain, pruritus, and recurrent blisters on her forearms and hands after exposure to sunlight. One month before symptom onset, the patient initiated a trial of micronized progesterone (100 mg/d) and increased her daily estradiol from 2 mg to 4 mg in an effort to better control gender dysphoria. Her subsequent laboratory findings were notable for a supratherapeutic total estrogen level (1945 pg/mL). Other medications included lisinopril, spironolactone, medroxyprogesterone, and occasional ibuprofen. She denied a personal or family history of liver disease, hepatitis, iron abnormalities, or blistering eruptions. She consumed 2 beers daily and had a 30-pack-year smoking history.

Physical examination confirmed the presence of vesicles and bullae on erythematous bases with scattered milia over the bilateral dorsal forearms, hands, and ears (Figs 1 and 2). Hypertrichosis was not observed or endorsed by the patient. Punch biopsy found a subepidermal blister overlying festooning of the dermal papillae with minimal superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and a negative immunofluorescence examination (Fig 3). A periodic acid–Schiff stain was negative. Laboratory findings revealed mild hepatic transaminitis, negative HIV and hepatitis C antibodies, unremarkable iron studies, elevated total serum porphyrins, urine uroporphyrin and heptaporphyrin, and HFE C282Y heterozygosity (Table I). A liver ultrasound scan was recommended but not obtained. A diagnosis of PCT was discussed with the patient. She was counseled on smoking cessation, limiting alcohol consumption, and photoprotection. She became distressed upon learning that estrogen may be contributing to her symptoms but ultimately decided to temporarily hold estrogen therapy. Hydroxychloroquine, 100 mg twice weekly, was initiated in lieu of repeated phlebotomy due to patient preference. She achieved clinical remission within 5 months without restricting her alcohol or tobacco use. At that time, estradiol was reintroduced via 0.025-mg patch twice weekly without recurrence.

### The cutaneous porphyrias [^115NDVW4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

The porphyrias are a group of mainly inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis where accumulation of porphyrins and/or porphyrin precursors gives rise to 2 types of clinical presentation: cutaneous photosensitivity and/or acute neurovisceral attacks. The cutaneous porphyrias present with either bullous skin fragility or nonbullous acute photosensitivity. This review discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory diagnosis, complications, and current approach to porphyria management. Although focusing mainly on their dermatological aspects, the article also covers the management of acute porphyria, which by virtue of its association with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, may become the responsibility of the clinical dermatologist.

### Current and innovative emerging therapies for porphyrias with hepatic involvement [^117HtR3u]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyrias are rare inherited disorders caused by specific enzyme dysfunctions in the haem synthesis pathway, which result in abnormal accumulation of specific pathway intermediates. The symptoms depend upon the chemical characteristics of these substances. Porphyrins are photoreactive and cause photocutaneous lesions on sunlight-exposed areas, whereas accumulation of porphyrin precursors is related to acute neurovisceral attacks. Current therapies are suboptimal and mostly address symptoms rather than underlying disease mechanisms. Advances in the understanding of the molecular bases and pathogenesis of porphyrias have paved the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this Clinical Trial Watch we summarise the basic principles of these emerging approaches and what is currently known about their application to porphyrias of hepatic origin or with hepatic involvement.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^115x7v4R]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is characterized by fragile skin with blistering on sun-exposed areas. Symptoms typically develop in late adulthood and can be triggered by iron overload, alcohol intake, oestrogens and various liver diseases. Treatment consists of phlebotomy to reduce iron, or increasing urinary porphyrin excretion by administering chlorochin. To optimize patient care, health personnel need to understand the subjective experiences of PCT.

Objectives

To explore the experiences of persons with PCT with regard to symptoms, treatment, follow-up and prevention of the disease.

Methods

Interpretive description was used as a qualitative approach. Twenty-one participants attended three focus groups. All participants had experienced PCT symptoms during the last 5 years.

Results

Participants' experiences varied from trivializing symptoms and fragile skin to what was described as a desperate situation, with huge blisters, skin falling off and feeling as if one was in a 'horror movie'. For some, itching was very troublesome, preventing sleep and delaying skin healing. In managing PCT a shift in focus from skin to blood was described. PCT was perceived as a chronic and systemic disease causing a range of health problems. Strategies for preventing symptoms ranged from doing nothing to frequent controls and check-ups.

Conclusions

Participants had a systemic perception of PCT, and a tendency to attribute a range of health problems to the condition. This study adds insight into the experiences patients have with PCT.

### Dermatologic emergencies… [^113xMK7F]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Key findings in patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever include history of a tick bite, fever, and a characteristic rash. Between 60 and 75 percent of patients with this condition are given an alternate diagnosis at the initial physician visit.
13. The rash appears two to five days after the onset of fever in 80 to 90 percent of patients. 9 Many patients present before the rash appears; therefore, a high index of suspicion is warranted in endemic areas when a patient presents with severe symptoms that mimic a viral illness. The rash begins as small, blanching, nonpruritic macules that develop into a maculopapular rash and progress after several days to petechial lesions. The classic spotted appearance occurs when the petechial lesions coalesce and form ecchymosis. 1–12 It begins around the wrists and ankles and spreads to the palms and soles, eventually covering the extremities and trunk. The face is usually spared.

A rash on the palms and soles is a distinct distribution that occurs in approximately 40 percent of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. 9, 17 However, other exanthems can present with fever and rash on the palms and soles. 16 In patients with severe disease in whom treatment is delayed, complications can include cardiac and renal failure, meningitis, and pneumonitis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis can be performed if neurologic symptoms are present. If a rash is present, direct immunofluorescence of a punch biopsy fixed in special media can detect rickettsial organisms within the vascular endothelium. A standard punch biopsy fixed in formalin may show necrotizing vasculitis. DIAGNOSIS Clinical Findings. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis often have a history of a wound or trauma. Common symptoms include fever and chills, with heat, erythema, edema, and pain over a focal area of skin.

19 The pain is typically out of proportion to the physical findings, which can help distinguish this condition from cellulitis. The erythematous skin develops a dusky blue discoloration. Yellow vesicular and bullous lesions form over the erythematous skin, with some serosanguineous drainage. Impetigo, cellulitis, and toxic shock syndrome can mimic these lesions. After four to five days, the bullae become violaceous, and the skin becomes gangrenous.

EPP and XLP are nonblistering cutaneous porphyrias characterized by excess protoporphyrin in the bone marrow and high levels of circulating protoporphyrin, resulting in photosensitivity and an increased risk of biliary stones and liver damage. Recommended management includes monitoring for liver damage and other disease-related complications. Although the understanding of the molecular basis and clinical presentation of protoporphyrias has advanced, the development of novel and promising new therapies has occurred only recently. Therefore, it is becoming even more important for physicians to be aware of the diagnosis and management of these rare, but often undiagnosed, conditions.

E. Pemphigus vulgaris

Answers:
A. TEN or Lyell's syndrome – Correct. This diagnosis is supported by the extensive epidermal necrosis involving more than 30% of the body surface and the significant mucosal involvement observed in the patient. TEN is a serious and life-threatening dermatological condition characterized by diffuse erythematous and purpuric maculae aggregating into large areas of skin detachment. The presence of Nikolsky's sign, where slight mechanical pressure causes further skin detachment, is indicative of the severe epidermal damage observed in TEN. Given these clinical features and the patient's history of moxifloxacin use, TEN is the most appropriate diagnosis.
B. Stevens-Johnson syndrome – Incorrect. This involves less than 10 percent of the body surface.
C. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome – Incorrect. This typically spares mucosal surfaces and can be excluded based on the extensive involvement and mucosal lesions in this patient.
D. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme major usually presents with less extensive target lesions and skin detachments.
E. Pemphigus vulgaris – Incorrect. This shows intraepidermal acantholysis on histopathology rather than the full-thickness epidermal necrosis seen in TEN.

### International recommendations for screening and preventative practices for long-term survivors of transplantation and cellular therapy: a 2023 update [^114h67w5]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Skin surveillance and sun protection in long-term transplantation survivors — Undergo regular skin self-examination with referral to a dermatologist for suspicious lesions, and tailor examination to individual risk factors, with a minimum frequency of every 6–12 months for malignancy screening and general examination, including for cutaneous chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) based on NIH criteria; regular exams should expose all body areas and include manual palpation to detect sclerosis. Advise patients to avoid direct sun exposure without appropriate protection (proper clothing, hats, applying UVA/ UVB sunscreen to exposed areas), which is particularly important for those on immunosuppression, voriconazole, with a history of total body irradiation (TBI) or skin cGVHD.

### How I treat erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^116ch7TR]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Living with a rare genetic disease

Individuals with protoporphyria can experience severe pain when exposed to sunlight, and efforts to avoid symptoms markedly impair quality of life. The pain experienced is out of proportion to the degree of visible skin damage, which is often minimal or absent. Therefore, patients, especially children and young adults, find explaining this "invisible" condition to others challenging. In managing patients with protoporphyria, addressing and validating psychosocial concerns and encouraging access to online resources, patient support groups, expert centers, clinical trials, and specialized programs for affected children is critical.

### Long-term follow-up and complications after cardiac transplantation [^116TcAs2]. NMDP (1993). Medium credibility.

Dermatologic — examination guidance states that dermatologic exam frequency is "Risk factor dependent", with "Frequency/extent of examination tailored to individual risk factors: prior or present GVHD, sun exposure and radiation history, voriconazole exposure, family history, and history of skin cancer". Notes specify "Regular skin self-examination; refer to a dermatologist for further evaluation of suspicious lesions", and that a "Regular skin exam involves exposure of all body areas and includes manual palpation to detect sclerosis".

### An unusual bullous eruption: olanzapine induced pseudoporphyria [^117XANNt]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 27-year-old man with a background of schizophrenia presented during the summer months with a 2-day history of a blistering eruption predominantly affecting his hands, forearms and face. He had not knowingly been exposed to any chemicals or toxins and was otherwise well. Clinical examination revealed multiple, large, tense blisters affecting the sun-exposed sites. Histology subsequently demonstrated subepidermal blisters with minimal inflammation and negative immunofluorescence. Porphyrin biochemistry including faecal, urinary and serum samples were unremarkable and thus a diagnosis of pseudoporphyria was reached. There were no obvious triggers, however, olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic) had been commenced 2 months previously and was deemed to be the most likely cause. This is the first report of pseudoporphyria being associated with an atypical antipsychotic and highlights the importance of eliciting an accurate drug history by specifically enquiring about any recent medication changes that could account for the clinical presentation.
