## Question

levothiroxin induced hyperthiroidsm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about levothyroxine-induced hyperthyroidism, including mechanisms, clinical features, epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, management, and prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the entity and confirming the mechanism. Then, I should verify the clinical manifestations and how they differ from endogenous hyperthyroidism. Next, I will examine prevalence and risk factors, followed by diagnostic criteria and pitfalls. After that, I need to outline management strategies, including acute overdose and chronic iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis. Finally, I should consider prevention, special populations, and synthesize a practical clinical approach with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and mechanism. Levothyroxine-induced hyperthyroidism is iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis caused by excessive exogenous T4, which increases circulating free T4 and, via conversion, free T3, suppressing TSH and producing a biochemical and clinical hyperthyroid state; this is distinct from endogenous hyperthyroidism in that the thyroid gland itself is typically atrophic or suppressed on imaging, and RAIU is low, reflecting lack of endogenous hormone production [^71fd6b2b] [^1bb493ac].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical manifestations so I don't overgeneralize. The signs and symptoms mirror endogenous hyperthyroidism: weight loss, heat intolerance, sweating, palpitations, sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, anxiety, tremor, insomnia, diarrhea, menstrual irregularities, and occasionally confusion or disorientation; importantly, symptoms may be delayed by days after excess ingestion, and severe cases can progress to arrhythmias, heart failure, or even thyroid storm physiology, albeit rarely with levothyroxine alone compared with T3-containing preparations [^71fd6b2b] [^92f746cf] [^9c2b2bc1].

> I need to check the epidemiology and risk factors next. Over-replacement is common in older adults on levothyroxine, with studies showing that 36% of patients older than 65 years had subnormal TSH, indicating overtreatment; risk increases with age, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and lack of systematic monitoring, and women appear to be overrepresented among inappropriately treated patients, reinforcing the need for vigilant TSH surveillance and dose titration [^885eb1b1] [^9a65ae1b].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic approach and avoid jumping to conclusions. Diagnosis relies on suppressed TSH with elevated free T4, and often elevated free T3, in the context of ongoing levothyroxine therapy; distinguishing features from endogenous causes include a small, atrophic thyroid on exam/imaging, low RAIU, and suppressed thyroglobulin, which together support exogenous hormone excess rather than autonomous thyroid hormone production; in central hypothyroidism, free T4 rather than TSH guides adequacy, so a high free T4 with clinical thyrotoxicosis signals overtreatment in that context as well [^1bb493ac] [^e452671b].

> Let me think about management, and I should double-check dosing adjustments. For chronic iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, the cornerstone is dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of levothyroxine, followed by reassessment of thyroid function in 4–6 weeks and cautious retitration to a euthyroid state; in older adults or those with cardiac disease, consider starting lower and going slower to avoid rebound ischemia or arrhythmias, and in central hypothyroidism, target free T4 in the mid–upper reference range rather than TSH [^4e552c61] [^e452671b].

> But wait, what if this is an acute overdose. For acute massive ingestion, I should confirm that supportive care is prioritized: reduce or stop levothyroxine, consider gastric lavage or activated charcoal if within 1–2 hours and airway protected, treat adrenergic symptoms with beta-blockers, manage arrhythmias and heart failure aggressively, and in severe cases consider antithyroid drugs and iodine to inhibit new hormone synthesis/release, with plasmapheresis or exchange transfusion reserved for refractory deterioration; symptoms can be delayed, so observation is warranted even if initially asymptomatic [^93d157e1] [^92f746cf] [^9c2b2bc1].

> I should confirm prevention strategies because this is where we can mitigate harm. Use weight-based dosing with attention to age and comorbidities, start low in older adults or those with cardiac disease, avoid unnecessary TSH suppression outside of oncologic indications, and monitor TSH every 6–12 months in stable patients, sooner after dose changes or intercurrent illness; be vigilant for drug–drug and dietary interactions that impair absorption or increase requirements, and if switching formulations, recheck thyroid function after steady state to detect altered bioavailability [^4e552c61] [^639f6a74] [^4c28da6c].

> Let me consider special populations, and I need to ensure I tailor recommendations. In older adults, even subclinical hyperthyroidism from over-replacement increases risks of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and fractures, so I should treat cautiously and maintain TSH in the reference range; in pregnancy, increase levothyroxine dose by 20–30% promptly when pregnancy is confirmed and monitor TSH more frequently to avoid under- or over-replacement; in patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors, transient hyperthyroidism from thyroiditis may evolve to hypothyroidism, so I should monitor closely and avoid reflexively escalating levothyroxine during the thyrotoxic phase [^885eb1b1] [^244343bd] [^d17ce625].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that any suppressed TSH on levothyroxine mandates immediate dose cut. Hold on, I should verify exceptions. Suppressed TSH may be intentional in differentiated thyroid cancer for TSH suppression, but even then, the lowest effective TSH should be used and bone and cardiac risks monitored; conversely, in central hypothyroidism, TSH is unreliable, so free T4 guides therapy and a high free T4 indicates overtreatment regardless of TSH [^885eb1b1] [^e452671b].

> Next, I should review a practical clinical algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines. Suspect iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis in any patient on levothyroxine with suppressed TSH and elevated free T4; confirm adherence, interactions, and formulation consistency; if acute overdose is suspected, manage as above; if chronic, reduce or hold levothyroxine, reassess in 4–6 weeks, and retitrate to normalize TSH in primary hypothyroidism or to mid–upper range free T4 in central hypothyroidism; throughout, screen for and mitigate cardiovascular and skeletal risks, and educate patients to report palpitations, weight loss, or anxiety promptly [^4e552c61] [^e452671b].

> In summary, I should confirm that levothyroxine-induced hyperthyroidism is preventable and treatable. It reflects excessive replacement leading to biochemical and clinical thyrotoxicosis, carries meaningful cardiovascular and skeletal risks, especially in older adults, and is best avoided by evidence-based dosing, systematic monitoring, and prompt recognition of overtreatment; when it occurs, dose reduction or temporary cessation with careful retitration restores euthyroidism and reduces adverse outcomes [^885eb1b1] [^4e552c61].

Levothyroxine-induced hyperthyroidism is **iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis** from excessive dosing or poor adherence/monitoring, with risks of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and fractures, especially in older adults [^885eb1b1] [^4669e892]. It is diagnosed by **suppressed TSH with elevated free T4** (and often free T3) in a patient on levothyroxine [^d08bafee]. Management is to **reduce or stop levothyroxine**, reassess in 4–6 weeks, and retitrate to a TSH in the reference range; beta-blockers treat adrenergic symptoms, and acute overdose may need gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or cholestyramine [^93d157e1]. Prevention requires **weight-based dosing**, awareness of drug–food interactions, and routine TSH monitoring every 6–12 months or after dose changes [^4e552c61] [^3a9edc59].

---

## Pathophysiology

Levothyroxine-induced hyperthyroidism arises from **excess exogenous T4**, which increases free T4 and, via conversion, free T3, suppressing TSH and causing thyrotoxicosis [^71fd6b2b]. Unlike endogenous hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland is typically atrophic or suppressed, so RAIU is low and thyroglobulin is suppressed, helping distinguish iatrogenic from endogenous causes [^1bb493ac].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Symptoms and signs mirror endogenous hyperthyroidism and include:

- **Cardiovascular**: palpitations, sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, angina, hypertension, arrhythmias, heart failure [^71fd6b2b].
- **Neurological**: nervousness, anxiety, tremor, insomnia, hyperreflexia, confusion, seizures (rare) [^71fd6b2b].
- **Gastrointestinal**: weight loss, increased appetite, diarrhea, abdominal cramps [^71fd6b2b].
- **Musculoskeletal**: muscle weakness, osteoporosis, fractures (especially in older adults) [^885eb1b1].
- **Dermatological**: heat intolerance, sweating, pruritus, alopecia [^71fd6b2b].
- **Reproductive**: menstrual irregularities, decreased fertility [^71fd6b2b].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the risk of **levothyroxine-induced hyperthyroidism**:

- **Excessive dosing**: Over-replacement is common, especially in older adults; 36% of patients > 65 years on levothyroxine had subnormal TSH in one study [^885eb1b1].
- **Poor adherence**: Inconsistent dosing can cause fluctuating levels and misinterpretation of labs.
- **Drug interactions**: Calcium, iron, proton pump inhibitors, and some foods impair absorption, leading to dose escalation and later toxicity if adherence improves or interactions resolve [^notfound].
- **Age**: Older adults are more susceptible to adverse effects, including atrial fibrillation and fractures [^885eb1b1].
- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis increase risk of complications from overtreatment [^885eb1b1].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion** in a patient on levothyroxine with hyperthyroid symptoms, plus biochemical confirmation:

- **Laboratory tests**: Suppressed TSH with elevated free T4 (and often free T3) confirms thyrotoxicosis [^d08bafee].
- **Differentiation from endogenous hyperthyroidism**: Low RAIU and suppressed thyroglobulin support iatrogenic etiology; absent goiter and negative TSH receptor antibodies also favor exogenous hormone excess [^1bb493ac].
- **Clinical correlation**: Assess adherence, interactions, and recent dose changes before altering therapy [^notfound].

---

## Management

Management centers on **dose adjustment and supportive care**:

- **Dose reduction or discontinuation**: Reduce or temporarily stop levothyroxine, then reassess TSH in 4–6 weeks and retitrate to a TSH in the reference range [^notfound].
- **Beta-blockers**: Use propranolol or metoprolol for adrenergic symptoms (palpitations, tremor, anxiety) while correcting the dose [^notfound].
- **Acute overdose management**: Gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or cholestyramine can reduce absorption; severe cases may need plasmapheresis or exchange transfusion [^93d157e1].
- **Monitoring**: Recheck TSH every 6–12 months or after dose changes; monitor for atrial fibrillation and bone loss in high-risk patients [^notfound].

---

## Prevention

Prevention requires **careful dosing and monitoring**:

- **Weight-based dosing**: Start at 1.6 mcg/kg/day in young, healthy adults; use lower doses in older adults or those with cardiac disease [^0e11c18f].
- **Interaction screening**: Review medications and supplements that impair absorption; separate calcium/iron by 4 hours and take levothyroxine fasting [^3a9edc59].
- **Routine monitoring**: Check TSH 6–8 weeks after initiation or dose changes, then every 6–12 months; adjust to keep TSH in the reference range [^notfound].
- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence, proper administration, and recognition of hyperthyroid symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent with timely correction**, but complications can be significant if unrecognized:

- **Cardiovascular**: Atrial fibrillation, heart failure, angina, arrhythmias [^885eb1b1].
- **Skeletal**: Osteoporosis, fractures, especially in postmenopausal women [^885eb1b1].
- **Neuropsychiatric**: Anxiety, insomnia, cognitive impairment [^71fd6b2b].

---

Levothyroxine-induced hyperthyroidism is a preventable iatrogenic condition; **prompt recognition, dose adjustment, and monitoring** restore euthyroidism and reduce complications.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

Levothyroxine dosing frequency and adherence — once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens: A randomized cross-over trial of once weekly oral administration of 7 times the usual daily levothyroxine (LT4) dose versus daily dosing found weekly therapy produced supratherapeutic T4 for about 24 hours while T3 remained within the reference range, and over 6 weeks other biochemical and clinical markers, including patient symptoms, did not differ from daily therapy. A second similar 6-week cross-over trial showed greater increases in T4 after weekly dosing than daily dosing without symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of hyperthyroidism. For patients in whom daily LT4 intake is unsuccessful, options include observed therapy or reducing the frequency of LT4 ingestion to twice weekly or weekly with a starting dose equal to the weight‑adjusted daily regimen (i.e., 7 times the daily dose); parenteral LT4 is also possible, although no trials were identified.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^ca9f6d0d]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

Endocrine toxicity panel recommendations

The following recommendations are intended to be used within the framework of toxicity management, including direction for at what grade of toxicity to hold and/or permanently cease treatment, considerations for life-threatening toxicities, as well as recommendations on optimal timing and dosing for administration of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents by grade of AE, discussed in the General panel recommendations section. Any endocrine-specific exceptions or additional considerations are noted in the recommendations below.

Patients experiencing endocrine toxicities should be treated with hormone replacement, and immunotherapy should generally be continued as soon as patients are stable (often without interruption). Management of thyroid toxicities and T1DM generally do not require the use of corticosteroid therapy.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism

Thyroid function (TSH, fT4) should be tested every 4–6 weeks during ICI treatment, and should continue to be tested every 6–12 months following the conclusion of ICI treatment.
Patients with elevated TSH and normal fT4 should receive repeat TSH and fT4 testing routinely, and if this pattern persists without hypothyroidism symptoms then levothyroxine treatment should be considered. Levothyroxine should be administered to patients with hypothyroidism at 1.5–1.6 μg/kg/day for young, healthy patients, and should be administered at 25 or 50 μg/day for patients > 65 years of age or with heart disease.
Patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism and/or with elevated TSH and low fT4 should be tested for morning cortisol to identify possible concurrent adrenal insufficiency.
Patients with low TSH and normal fT4 should receive repeat TSH and fT4 testing routinely, and if symptoms of hyperthyroidism or high fT4 develop patients should be treated with beta-blockers. Patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be treated with cardioselective beta-blockers such as atenolol or metoprolol.
Patients with persistently low TSH and high fT4 should be evaluated for hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease etiology.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^b2c45664]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^a19ef6ac]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis — treatment recommendations state that patients with symptomatic subacute thyroiditis should be treated initially with β-adrenergic-blocking drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids should be used instead of NSAIDs when patients fail to respond or present with moderate to severe pain and/or thyrotoxic symptoms (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). β-blockers are used as needed to control thyrotoxic symptoms, and NSAIDs provide pain relief in patients with mild symptoms; with NSAIDs, the median time for resolution of pain is 5 weeks (range 1–20 weeks). Patients who do not respond to full doses of NSAIDs over several days should be treated instead with corticosteroid therapy, with standard recommendations of prednisone 40 mg daily for 1–2 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 2–4 weeks or longer; corticosteroids at similar doses had more rapid resolution of pain (median duration, 8 days) compared with NSAIDs (mean duration, 35 days). An effective alternative regimen reported is an initial daily dose of 15 mg of prednisone with tapering by 5 mg every 2 weeks, though 20% of patients required longer than 8 weeks to discontinue the glucocorticoid; levothyroxine may be employed during the hypothyroid stage but should be withdrawn after 3–6 months.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^4e552c61]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients' symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

- A concentration of serum thyroxine above the accepted normal range has recently been recognized to result from commonly prescribed replacement dosages of levothyroxine sodium. To determine if the high levels of serum T4 have undesirable metabolic effects, despite the fact that the subjects are accepted as euthyroid, we studied 28 patients receiving long-term levothyroxine therapy; 19 patients were considered to be receiving replacement dosages and nine suppressive dosages of levothyroxine. To assess the effect of levothyroxine on target tissue, we measured the thyrotropin response to protirelin and systolic time intervals obtained by simultaneous electrocardiography and echocardiography. Thyrotropin response to protirelin was suppressed in patients with elevated serum T4 levels and normal serum triiodothyronine levels. These patients also had shortened systolic time intervals typical of hyperthyroidism.

Our data indicate that commonly given replacement dosages of levothyroxine may induce undesirable metabolic consequences and that these patients perhaps ought to be seen as having "subclinical hyperthyroidism. " The prescribed dosage of levothyroxine as therapy for hypothyroidism is still frequently excessive. Banovac K, Papic M, Bilsker MS, Zakarija M, McKenzie JM.

### Hypothyroidism (primary) [^36ec36b2]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is six times more common in women, affecting up to 40 in 10,000 each year (compared with 6/10,000 men).

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for clinical (overt) hypothyroidism? What are the effects of treatments for subclinical hypothyroidism? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: levothyroxine, and levothyroxine plus liothyronine.

### Immunotherapy-induced endocrinopathies: assessment, management and monitoring [^83efca16]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Management

The product specifications for ICIs recommend regular monitoring of thyroid dysfunction, so many patients are diagnosed on the basis of abnormal thyroid function tests rather than in response to symptoms. Indeed, many patients are asymptomatic, although typical symptoms of both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are described, and clinical correlation of abnormal results is required; for example, a low TSH result in the presence of normal FT4 and FT3 must be carefully interpreted to differentiate between asymptomatic primary hyperthyroidism or secondary hypothyroidism (see below).

In hyperthyroidism antithyroid drugs are rarely required, although guidelines suggest the use of beta blockers in symptomatic patients, but there is a role for antithyroid drugs where Graves' disease is possible, for example in the presence of orbitopathy or persistent thyrotoxicosis. Glucocorticoids may be required in the rare situation of a painful thyroiditis. Interestingly, although hyperthyroidism frequently progresses to hypothyroidism, there are reports that those treated with glucocorticoids for other immune related events may not progress. High-dose glucocorticoid treatment may also be required in those individuals that develop severe orbitopathy owing to Graves' disease. Whilst thyroiditis can usually be readily distinguished from Graves' disease based on clinical presentation and time course, TSH receptor antibodies, technetium uptake or doppler ultrasonography may have a role in selected cases.

Hypothyroidism is managed with levothyroxine replacement with standard approaches, and most guidelines recommend a similar approach to sporadic thyroid disease, with treatment in the case of a low T4 or persistently raised TSH more than twice the upper limit of normal.

In general, ICI therapy should not be stopped in cases of thyroid irAEs, although interruption of treatment may be required in cases of severe thyrotoxicosis, and cases of severe thyroid eye disease.

Once hypothyroidism has developed, follow-up should be on the same basis as other causes of hypothyroidism and specialist endocrine input may not be required for uncomplicated hypothyroidism.

Drug-associated thyrotoxicosis — causes, timing, and therapies (Table 13) — includes lithium causing painless thyroiditis with onset often > 1 year treated with supportive care and antithyroid drugs; interferon α and interleukin-2 listed as causing painless thyroiditis; GD with onset months treated with supportive care and antithyroid drugs and/or radioactive iodine (GD only); iodinated contrast associated with underlying thyroid autonomy with onset weeks to months treated with antithyroid drugs; radioactive iodine, early causing destruction with onset 1–4 weeks managed with observation and, if severe, corticosteroids; and radioactive iodine for TMNG, late (GD) with onset 3–6 months managed with antithyroid drugs, repeat radioactive iodine, or surgery. Supportive care may include beta-adrenergic blockers during the thyrotoxic stage and levothyroxine if hypothyroidism develops. Although numerous medications may affect thyroid function or cause abnormal thyroid testing results, relatively few actually cause thyrotoxicosis; for those that do, mechanisms are iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, destructive thyroiditis, and induction of thyroid autoimmunity (GD or painless thyroiditis).

### Outcomes and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypothyroidism: a retrospective analysis [^b53deaf7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in cancer treatment cause immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), including thyroiditis leading to hypothyroidism. The management and outcomes of this irAE are not well established.

Objective

The purpose of this analysis is to describe the onset, management, and outcomes of patients experiencing hypothyroidism from ICI.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted of adults receiving ICI therapy at a community cancer center between January 1, 2017, and February 1, 2020. The primary endpoint was to describe onset (timing) of hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] > 10 µIU/mL). Secondary outcomes included describing hypothyroidism symptoms and levothyroxine use, time to documented disease progression, and occurrence of additional adverse effects (AEs).

Results

Of the 200 patients included in the study, 19% developed clinical hypothyroidism (TSH > 10 µIU/mL, or required initiation of or dose increase in levothyroxine). Median time to TSH higher than 10 µIU/mL was 13.3 weeks and symptoms of hypothyroidism occurred in 34% of patients developing clinical hypothyroidism. The median final daily levothyroxine dose was 88 mcg (0.88 mcg/kg). Time to disease progression was longer in those with clinical hypothyroidism (27.4 months vs. 6.8 months, respectively, P = 0.015). Additional AEs occurred in 68% of those developing hypothyroidism versus 49% without hypothyroidism (P = 0.029).

Conclusion and Relevance

Patients with clinical hypothyroidism during ICI treatment may have improved cancer outcomes, but they also are more likely to develop other AEs. Patients requiring thyroid replacement therapy with levothyroxine may benefit from a starting dose between 50 and 100 mcg/day, approximately 0.88 mcg/kg/day.

Graves' disease after 131I therapy — follow-up and monitoring should include an assessment of free T4 and total T3 within the first 1–2 months, with biochemical monitoring continued at 4–6 week intervals if the patient remains thyrotoxic; most patients normalize thyroid function and symptoms within 4–8 weeks, hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks on but more commonly between 2 and 6 months, once euthyroidism is achieved lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended, and since TSH levels may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves they should be interpreted cautiously and only in concert with free T4 and T3 estimates.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^17825f2f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The primary and secondary outcomes at 12 months will also be analysed in the following subgroups by adding the subgroup variable and its interaction with treatment group:
Sex (Male/Female)
Baseline TSH ○ < 10 / ≥ 10 ○ < 7 / 7–9.99 / ≥ 10

In addition, continuous interactions with age at randomisation and baseline TSH will be analysed analogously.

Study outcome analyses will be repeated on the per protocol population as exploratory analyses.

Patient safety and adverse event recording

We have taken particular care in devising a titration algorithm to avoid any possibility of prolonged periods of thyroid hormone over replacement in those allocated to levothyroxine. This should substantially reduce the risks of adverse effects such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac failure. In epidemiological studies these problems are observed in association with biochemical hyperthyroidism and not with TSH within the reference range. Similarly for those allocated to placebo we have developed an algorithm that is designed to detect those who develop overt hypothyroidism are require to start open-label levothyroxine. These measures are designed to ensure safety of those who are randomised into the trial.

Within ThyPRO we are assessing the domain of hyperthyroid symptoms as a possible adverse effect (recorded at baseline, 6–8 weeks, 12 months and final visit).

Adverse events (AEs) are recorded, notified, assessed, reported, analysed and managed in accordance with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). Certain potential adverse events are anticipated or likely as a result of the study and study population. The adverse events detailed below are likely to occur in the context of over replacement of levothyroxine. Our dose titration scheme and study processes of careful monitoring of thyroid function tests are designed to ensure we avoid prolonged periods of thyroid hormone excess.

Full details of all AEs of special interest (new atrial fibrillation, heart failure, fractures, new diagnosis of osteoporosis) including the nature of the event, relationship to study drug and outcome are recorded in the electronic case report form. AEs of special interest are monitored and followed up until satisfactory resolution or stabilization.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnosis and management include characteristic pain radiating to the ears, jaw, or throat with malaise, low-grade fever, and fatigue; laboratory markers show that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein is elevated, mild anemia is common, RAIU is low, and ultrasonography shows diffuse heterogeneity with decreased or normal color-flow Doppler. Patients with mild symptomatic subacute thyroiditis should be treated initially with beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and those failing to respond or with moderate-to-severe symptoms should be treated with corticosteroids. 1/+00 NSAIDs should be considered first-line therapy; if full doses over several days fail, use corticosteroids such as prednisone 40 mg daily for 1–2 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 2–4 weeks or longer depending upon clinical response. During the hypothyroid stage, levothyroxine may be employed but should be withdrawn after 3–6 months with recovery of normal function verified by thyroid function testing.

Endocrine toxicity

It is notable that a number of endocrine toxicities persist even after therapeutic intervention for the irAE and the conclusion of ICI therapy, especially in the case of thyroid dysfunction. This is commonly attributed to permanent organ damage or impairment due to autoimmunity. It is also important to understand that, although rare, polyglandular endocrinopathies are possible, potentially complicating diagnosis and treatment.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are frequently asymptomatic or exhibit ambiguous symptoms, necessitating routine monitoring of parameters such as TSH and total T3/fT4 levels. Hypothyroidism is the more common of the two toxicities, occurring in about 8% of patients receiving anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, 3% of patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 therapy, and 15% of patients receiving combination ICI therapy. Grade ≥ 3 hypothyroidism is rare, occurring in roughly 0%–2% of patients receiving combination ICI therapies. The standard of care for the treatment of hypothyroidism is levothyroxine.

Hyperthyroidism occurs less frequently, in 5% of patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 inhibitors and 4% of patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors. Rarely, ICI therapy may lead to Graves' disease. Symptoms of elevated thyroid hormone may also appear transiently and evolve into hypothyroidismas a result of patients experiencing thyrotoxicosis during the course of thyroiditis, due to the destruction of thyroid follicles and necrosis. Hypothyroidism frequently occurs following this transient hyperthyroidism, as a sequela of ongoing thyroiditis — roughly 90% of patients who develop thyrotoxicosis do not recover full thyroid function, requiring long-term levothyroxine replacement. The median time to thyrotoxicosis is 5 weeks, and the median time to hypothyroidism is 10 weeks.

### Considerations in the diagnosis and management of thyroid dysfunction in older adults [^4669e892]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Thyroid dysfunction is common in older adults and poses diagnostic and management challenges for clinicians. In this narrative review, we present published data focusing on special considerations in the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in older adults. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases was conducted from January 2000 to December 2024 to identify pertinent articles in English for this narrative review. Results: Due to significant cardiovascular risk if untreated, both overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism should be treated in older adults. Findings from observational studies do not support treating older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism with a thyrotropin (TSH) < 7 mIU/L. However, observational data have demonstrated an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and stroke in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH 7.0–9.9 mIU/L and of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure in those with TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, suggesting levothyroxine treatment in these individuals should be considered. Data from clinical trials failed to show improvement with levothyroxine in hypothyroidism symptoms or fatigue in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism compared with placebo. Over- and under-replacement with thyroid hormone is common and should be avoided, as population-based studies have shown associations with adverse cardiovascular and skeletal events. Subclinical hyperthyroidism with a TSH < 0.1 mIU/L should be treated in older individuals as it has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk and bone density loss based on observational data. Randomized controlled trials have shown that long-term low-dose methimazole is a viable alternative to radioactive iodine in older adults with hyperthyroidism. Conclusions: A personalized approach should be undertaken in the diagnosis and management of thyroid dysfunction in older adults. Multiple factors should be considered, including physiological age-related changes in thyroid function, comorbidities, and polypharmacy. Care should be taken to maintain euthyroidism in order to avoid adverse events.

If not contraindicated (e.g., by seizures, coma, or loss of the gag reflex), the stomach should be emptied by emesis or gastric lavage to decrease gastrointestinal absorption. Activated charcoal or cholestyramine may also be used to decrease absorption. Central and peripheral increased sympathetic activity may be treated by administering β-receptor antagonists, e.g., propranolol, provided there are no medical contraindications to their use. Provide respiratory support as needed; control congestive heart failure and arrhythmia; control fever, hypoglycemia, and fluid loss as necessary. Large doses of antithyroid drugs (e.g., methimazole or propylthiouracil) followed in one to two hours by large doses of iodine may be given to inhibit synthesis and release of thyroid hormones. Glucocorticoids may be given to inhibit the conversion of T4 to T3. Plasmapheresis, charcoal hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion have been reserved for cases in which continued clinical deterioration occurs despite conventional therapy. Because T4 is highly protein bound, very little drug will be removed by dialysis.

Monitoring of patients taking antithyroid drugs: An assessment of serum free T4 should be obtained about 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, and the dose of medication adjusted accordingly, and serum T3 also may be monitored since serum free T4 may normalize with persistent elevation of serum T3. Appropriate monitoring intervals are every 4–8 weeks until euthyroid values are achieved with the minimal dose of medication, after which biochemical testing and clinical evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and an assessment of serum free T4 and TSH are required before treatment and at intervals after starting treatment.

Drug-associated thyrotoxicosis (Table 16) — agents, mechanisms, onset, and therapy are summarized as follows: Amiodarone iodine induced (type 1) has onset months to years with therapy of supportive care, ATDs; perchlorate, and surgery, and amiodarone thyroiditis (type 2) occurs often > 1 year with therapy of supportive care, corticosteroids, and surgery. Lithium causes painless thyroiditis and GD with onset often > 1 year and therapy of supportive care, ATDs and/or RAI (GD only), and surgery. Interferon α causes painless thyroiditis; GD with onset months and therapy of supportive care and ATDs and/or RAI (GD only). Interleukin-2 causes painless thyroiditis with onset months and therapy of supportive care. Iodinated contrast in the setting of underlying thyroid autonomy presents in weeks to months and is treated with antithyroid drugs. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors cause destruction with onset 3–12 months and therapy of supportive care. Radioactive iodine, early causes destruction with onset 1–4 weeks and therapy of observation; if severe, administer corticosteroids. Radioactive iodine for TMNG, late is associated with GD with onset 3–6 months and therapy of antithyroid drugs, repeat RAI, and surgery. Supportive care may include beta-adrenergic blockers during the thyrotoxic stage and levothyroxine if hypothyroidism develops, and perchlorate is not available in the United States.

4.7 Thyroid disease

Patients with primary hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism disease should be managed per routine care. Anticipatory guidance should be given to patients taking anti‐thyroidal drugs (ATDs) such as methimazole, given the risk of agranulocytosis and secondary bacterial infection. Symptoms to monitor for while on ATDs — including fever, sore throat and cough — do overlap with symptoms of COVID‐19 thus prompt medical evaluation should be sought if symptoms arise. Additionally, like other infections, COVID‐19 may precipitate thyroid storm in patients with poorly controlled hyperthyroidism. Most patients with thyroid cancer are not at increased risk of infection given that surgical treatment with replacement levothyroxine is standard of care. For the rare patients on chemotherapy, there may be an increased risk of all infections due to immunosuppression. As per the American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, most thyroid cancer surgeries can be safely postponed without risk for worsening disease course given the typically slow tumour growth.

Warnings

WARNING: Thyroid hormones, including Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity for weight loss. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects.

Levothyroxine sodium should not be used in the treatment of male or female infertility unless this condition is associated with hypothyroidism.

In patients with nontoxic diffuse goiter or nodular thyroid disease, particularly the elderly or those with underlying cardiovascular disease, levothyroxine sodium therapy is contraindicated if the serum TSH level is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). If the serum TSH level is not suppressed, Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP should be used with caution in conjunction with careful monitoring of thyroid function for evidence of hyperthyroidism and clinical monitoring for potential associated adverse cardiovascular signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

Thyrotoxicosis factitia — diagnosis hinges on evidence of exogenous hormone ingestion with characteristic laboratory and imaging patterns, and management options in overdose have been described. Thyrotoxicosis factitia includes all causes of thyrotoxicosis due to the ingestion of thyroid hormone; clues to this diagnosis are an absence of goiter, a suppressed serum thyroglobulin level, and a decreased RAIU, though in the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies the distinction from painless thyroiditis can be difficult. In both situations there will be elevated levels of T4, a high T3 to T4 ratio (with exogenous levothyroxine), a small thyroid, and a low thyroidal RAIU, and thyroid ultrasound may be helpful because the thyroid has a heterogeneous echotexture and is normal size or slightly enlarged in painless thyroiditis, while is small with a normal echotexture in an otherwise normal individual who is ingesting thyroid hormone surreptitiously. Fecal levothyroxine has been measured as a means of distinguishing surreptitious use of thyroid hormone from painless thyroiditis, and a disproportionately elevated T3 level suggests that the patient may be ingesting liothyronine or a combination T4/T3 preparation; severe thyrotoxicosis and rarely, thyroid storm, have been reported after overdose or poisoning, and treatment with cholestyramine and charcoal hemoperfusion have been used in this circumstance.

Excessive levothyroxine (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis) — harms and threshold: "The deleterious health effects of iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis include atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis." Accordingly, "we recommend avoiding thyroid hormone excess and subnormal serum thyrotropin values, particularly thyrotropin values below 0.1 mIU/L, especially in older persons and postmenopausal women. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence." Over-treatment is common; "In one study of older individuals taking LT4, 36% of patients over age 65 years had a subnormal serum TSH (233)." Adverse outcomes increase when "serum TSH < 0.1 mIU/L," including atrial fibrillation: "patients older than age 65 years with serum TSH levels < 0.1 mIU/L… had a threefold increase in the risk of atrial fibrillation over a 10-year observation period." Skeletal risks are higher in postmenopausal women, "especially if the serum TSH levels are undetectable," and cardiovascular, dysrhythmia, and fracture admissions and deaths "were higher for those with suppressed TSH values."

Levothyroxine should be administered to patients with hypothyroidism at 1.5–1.6 μg/kg/day for young, healthy patients, and should be administered at 25 or 50 μg/day for patients > 65 years of age or with heart disease. Patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism and/or with elevated TSH and low fT4 should be tested for morning cortisol to identify possible concurrent adrenal insufficiency. Patients with low TSH and normal fT4 should receive repeat TSH and fT4 testing routinely, and if symptoms of hyperthyroidism or high fT4 develop patients should be treated with beta-blockers; patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be treated with cardioselective beta-blockers such as atenolol or metoprolol.

Graves' disease (GD) in children — 131I pretreatment, safety, and follow-up — When children receiving methimazole (MMI) are to be treated with 131I, the medication is stopped 3–5 days before treatment, and patients are placed on beta-blockers until total T4 and/or free T4 estimate levels normalize. Although some physicians restart antithyroid drugs after 131I, this is seldom required in children, and thyroid hormone levels begin to fall within the first week after therapy. Radioactive iodine is excreted by saliva, urine, and stool, and families should adhere to local radiation safety recommendations. After 131I therapy, T3, T4, and/or estimated free T4 levels should be obtained every month; TSH determinations may not be useful early because they may remain suppressed for several months. Hypothyroidism typically develops by 2–3 months post-treatment, at which time levothyroxine should be prescribed. Although uncommon, there are rare reports of pediatric patients with severe hyperthyroidism who developed thyroid storm after receiving 131I.

### Thyroid disease in pregnancy [^fe33234d]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease is the second most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age, and when untreated during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, placental abruption, hypertensive disorders, and growth restriction. Current guidelines recommend targeted screening of women at high risk, including those with a history of thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, or other autoimmune disease; current or past use of thyroid therapy; or a family history of autoimmune thyroid disease. Appropriate management results in improved outcomes, demonstrating the importance of proper diagnosis and treatment. In women with hypothyroidism, levothyroxine is titrated to achieve a goal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level less than 2.5 mIU per L. The preferred treatment for hyperthyroidism is antithyroid medications, with a goal of maintaining a serum free thyroxine level in the upper one-third of the normal range. Postpartum thyroiditis is the most common form of postpartum thyroid dysfunction and may present as hyper- or hypothyroidism. Symptomatic treatment is recommended for the former; levothyroxine is indicated for the latter in women who are symptomatic, breastfeeding, or who wish to become pregnant.

Background

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the current standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

Methods

Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the American College of Physicians system. The final document was organized so that each topic is introduced with a question, followed by a formal clinical recommendation. Stakeholder input was received at a national meeting, with some subsequent refinement of the clinical questions addressed in the document. Consensus was achieved for all recommendations by the task force.

Results

We reviewed the following therapeutic categories: (i) levothyroxine therapy, (ii) non-levothyroxine-based thyroid hormone therapies, and (iii) use of thyroid hormone analogs. The second category included thyroid extracts, synthetic combination therapy, triiodothyronine therapy, and compounded thyroid hormones.

Conclusions

We concluded that levothyroxine should remain the standard of care for treating hypothyroidism. We found no consistently strong evidence for the superiority of alternative preparations (e.g., levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy, or thyroid extract therapy, or others) over monotherapy with levothyroxine, in improving health outcomes. Some examples of future research needs include the development of superior biomarkers of euthyroidism to supplement thyrotropin measurements, mechanistic research on serum triiodothyronine levels (including effects of age and disease status, relationship with tissue concentrations, as well as potential therapeutic targeting), and long-term outcome clinical trials testing combination therapy or thyroid extracts (including subgroup effects). Additional research is also needed to develop thyroid hormone analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile.

### Recurrent Graves' hyperthyroidism after prolonged radioiodine-induced hypothyroidism [^2908eb76]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Radioactive iodine (RAI) is the most cost effective therapy for Graves' disease (GD). Patients with GD who have become hypothyroid after therapeutic RAI, rarely develop recurrence of disease. Herein we describe a case of recurrence of thyrotoxicosis after 2 years of hypothyroidism.

Methods

We present the clinical features, laboratory findings, imaging and management of an unusual case of recurrent hyperthyroidism.

Results

A 48-year-old male presented to the emergency room with a 2-day history of palpitation, chest discomfort and 30 pounds of weight loss. Examination was remarkable for rapid and irregular pulse, diffuse thyromegaly and brisk deep tendon reflexes but no eye changes or tremors. Laboratory tests showed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of < 0.004 (0.3–5.6 mIU/ml), free thyroxine (FT4) 4.96 (0.9–1.8 ng/dl), free triiodothyronine (FT3) > 20 (1.8–4.7 pg/ml), total thyroxine > 800 (80–200 ng/dl). Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. RAI uptake and scan showed a homogenous gland with 54% uptake in 6 h and 45% in 24 h. He was treated with propranolol and propylthiouracil with some clinical improvement. He subsequently underwent RAI therapy and developed hypothyroidism after 8 weeks. Hypothyroidism was treated with levothyroxine. At 2 years after RAI ablation, he again developed symptoms of hyperthyroidism and had suppressed TSH. The levothyroxine dose was stopped, 3 weeks after discontinuing levothyroxine, he remained hyperthyroid with TSH of 0.008 and FT4 of 1.62 and FT3 of 4.8. RAI uptake demonstrated 17% uptake at 24 h.

Conclusion

Recurrent hyperthyroidism in GD is uncommon after development of post-ablative hypothyroidism. Our case illustrates the need for continued surveillance.

### Nivolumab induced myxedema crisis [^a1febfe6]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction is seen infrequently in patients receiving nivolumab. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can occur in patients receiving nivolumab. In clinical trials, grade 1 and 2 hyperthyroidism occurred in 1.4–4.4% of patients receiving nivolumab. Grade 3 hyperthyroidism is reported in one patient with metastatic melanoma receiving nivolumab. The median time to its occurrence was about 2–3 months. Grade 1 and 2 hypothyroidism is estimated to occur in 7–9% of patients receiving nivolumab. Grade 3 hypothyroidism was reported in 3 patients, one with metastatic melanoma and two with renal cell carcinoma. The median time to development of hypothyroidism was 2.9 months. It is recommended to check TSH and free T4 before each treatment.

Management of nivolumab-induced hypothyroidism depends on severity of the disease. If hypothyroidism is mild, simple replacement of levothyroxine is sufficient. If hypothyroidism is moderate or severe as in our case, management often requires multidisciplinary approach to avoid life-threatening cardiac complications associated with levothyroxine replacement. It is recommended to hold nivolumab in patients with severe hypothyroidism but it can be reinstituted once the patient is stabilized, as in our patient.

Checkpoint inhibitors especially nivolumab have revolutionized the treatment of various hematological and solid malignancies. It is not only important for oncologists but as well as for general practitioners to be familiarize with unusual adverse effects of these drugs. Immune mediated thyroid dysfunction remains an important adverse effect of checkpoint inhibitors. It has become our routine practice to check baseline thyroid function tests and monitor them periodically during the nivolumab treatment. It is recommended to check TSH and free T4 before every cycle of nivolumab.

### Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism in patients receiving… [^9a65ae1b]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Synthetic thyroid preparations are taken by about 2 percent of the U. S. population and account for approximately 1 percent of prescriptions each year. Correct use often requires dosage titration or adjustments based on the patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Studies performed over the past 12 years indicate that excess exogenous thyroid hormone contributes to osteoporosis and cardiac problems, including left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation. Watsky and Koeniger performed a retrospective study to determine the prevalence of inappropriate TSH suppression in patients receiving levothyroxine. The records of all patients with a suppressed TSH level were further examined to determine diagnoses and duration of levothyroxine therapy. Suppressive therapy was considered appropriate in patients with thyroid cancer, nodular thyroid disease, goiter and central hypothyroidism.

TSH suppression was considered inappropriate in patients who had suppressed TSH values and were being treated for primary hypothyroidism or were receiving thyroid hormone for questionable indications, such as chronic fatigue or obesity. Out of 1, 652 patients who had received a prescription for levothyroxine during 1994, 905 had at least one TSH value measured at the base laboratory. Of these 905 patients, 110 had a TSH level of less than 0. 1 μU per mL on at least one occasion. Of these 110 patients, 34 had a diagnosis for which suppressive therapy might be appropriate. However, therapy was considered inappropriate in 63 of the 110 patients with TSH suppression. Also of note were 116 patients with TSH values higher than 5. 66 μU per mL, suggesting undertreatment with levothyroxine. The authors conclude that many patients appear to be inappropriately treated with levothyroxine.

They also note that TSH suppression for thyroid cancer and nodular goiter is controversial and not fully supported by the literature. If the cutoff for TSH suppression were a level of 0. 4 μU per mL, as suggested by some authors, the degree of overtreatment in this study group would have been much greater. Women appear to be at greater risk for inappropriate treatment with levothyroxine. The authors encourage physicians to educate patients about the potential toxicity associated with thyroid suppression and to prescribe levothyroxine only for patients who are most likely to benefit from this therapy.

### Hyperthyroidism [^d08bafee]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis causes a variety of symptoms and adverse health outcomes. Hyperthyroidism refers to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, most commonly from Graves' disease or toxic nodular goitre, whereas thyroiditis (typically autoimmune, viral, or drug induced) causes thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is based on suppressed serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), accompanied by free thyroxine and total or free tri-iodothyronine concentrations, which are raised (overt hyperthyroidism) or within range (subclinical hyperthyroidism). The underlying cause is determined by clinical assessment, detection of TSH-receptor antibodies and, if necessary, radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy. Treatment options for hyperthyroidism include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy, whereas thyroiditis is managed symptomatically or with glucocorticoid therapy. In Graves' disease, first-line treatment is a 12-18-month course of antithyroid drugs, whereas for goitre, radioactive iodine or surgery are preferred for toxic nodules or goitres. Evidence also supports long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs as an option for patients with Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre.

### The SNMMI practice guideline for therapy of thyroid disease with 131I 3.0 [^4537d56b]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Graves disease, toxic nodules, and nontoxic nodular goiter — goals of therapy include achieving a nonhyperthyroid status in hyperthyroidism (either a euthyroid state or iatrogenic hypothyroidism compensated to a euthyroid state with oral levothyroxine) and, for large nontoxic nodular goiter, reducing thyroid volume to relieve symptoms from compression in the neck.

### The SNMMI practice guideline for therapy of thyroid disease with 131I 3.0 [^20f5b841]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Radioiodine therapy for thyrotoxicosis — procedure and follow-up indicate that the procedure for administration of 131I for Graves disease, toxic nodules, and nontoxic nodular goiter is the same as for 131I therapy of thyroid cancer. The treated thyrotoxic patient must be closely followed, as 131I-induced hypothyroidism may occur within 2–3 mo of therapy, and levothyroxine replacement therapy should be started when TSH elevation is detected with a goal of a euthyroid, symptom-free state.

Regarding medical management for thyroid disease in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to management of hypothyroidism, pre-pregnancy care, ATA 2017 guidelines recommend to advise patients receiving levothyroxine therapy to independently increase their dose of levothyroxine by 20–30% (such as taking 2 additional tablets weekly of the current daily levothyroxine dosage) and urgently notify their caregiver for prompt testing and further evaluation in case of a suspected or confirmed pregnancy (positive home pregnancy test).
