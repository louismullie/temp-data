## Question

signs and symptoms of stage 6 CLL

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the signs and symptoms of "Stage 6" chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "Stage 6" exists in CLL staging and what the correct staging systems are. Then, I should define what constitutes advanced or high-risk CLL in those systems. Next, I'll enumerate the clinical signs and symptoms and their severity thresholds. After that, I'll consider ancillary laboratory findings and complications that often accompany advanced disease. Finally, I'll cross-check treatment-indication criteria as a proxy for symptomatic advanced disease and briefly comment on prognosis and evaluation [^1117ubjx] [^113HBxgF].

> Wait, let me verify the staging terminology before going any further. There is no "Stage 6" in CLL; the accepted clinical staging systems are Rai (stages 0, I, II, III, IV) and Binet (stages A, B, C), which group patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories and guide when symptoms reflect advanced disease rather than a numbered stage like "6" [^113HBxgF] [^114dpJF9] [^1117ubjx].

> Hold on, I should confirm what qualifies as advanced or high-risk disease in these systems. In modified Rai, high-risk disease corresponds to stage III, defined by disease-related anemia with hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL, and stage IV, defined by thrombocytopenia with platelets less than 100 × 10⁹/L, often with overlapping anemia; in Binet, stage C is defined by hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL and or platelets less than 100 × 10⁹/L irrespective of the number of nodal areas involved [^113HBxgF] [^1117ubjx].

> Let me think about marrow failure manifestations first, since they often drive symptoms at these advanced stages. Anemia typically manifests as fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance or dyspnea on exertion, pallor, and sometimes tachycardia, and in CLL the iwCLL treatment threshold generally uses hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL as clinically significant progressive marrow failure, with Rai high risk using less than 11 g/dL for stage assignment; thrombocytopenia can present with easy bruising, petechiae, mucosal bleeding, or heavier menstrual bleeding when platelets fall towards or below 100 × 10⁹/L; neutropenia, although less central to staging, can present with recurrent or severe bacterial infections in advanced disease [^1117ubjx] [^113HBxgF] [^113fHEh6].

> Next, I should review organomegaly and nodal disease because bulky or progressive involvement carries symptomatic weight. Massive or symptomatic splenomegaly, often defined as 6 cm or more below the left costal margin, can cause left upper quadrant discomfort, abdominal fullness, or early satiety; large or rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy, including nodes 10 cm or larger, may cause pain, compression symptoms, or cosmetic concerns; hepatomegaly can contribute to right upper quadrant discomfort; real-world series of advanced presentations frequently report splenomegaly and nodal disease at high rates, underscoring their clinical prominence in high-risk cohorts [^1117ubjx] [^113fHEh6] [^116TVc2F].

> I need to ensure I capture constitutional or "B" symptoms precisely, since these define symptomatic disease. Unintentional weight loss of at least 10 percent over six months, persistent fevers of at least 38.0 °C for two or more weeks without infection, and drenching night sweats persisting for at least one month without infection are classic, and significant fatigue that interferes with daily activities is also included; some contemporary algorithms operationalize function using ECOG performance status 2 or higher to capture disabling fatigue, but I should be careful and note that the core iwCLL definitions emphasize symptom burden and duration with infection excluded [^1117ubjx] [^113fHEh6] [^111CGXT6].

> But wait, autoimmune complications can masquerade as cytopenias and must be distinguished. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia that is poorly responsive to corticosteroids indicates active disease requiring CLL-directed therapy and often presents with symptomatic anemia or bleeding; in parallel, CLL-related hypogammaglobulinemia contributes to recurrent infections, and in severe cases of IgG less than 4 g/L with significant infections despite prophylaxis and failed vaccination responses, immunoglobulin replacement should be considered as part of supportive care even while addressing the underlying disease [^1117ubjx] [^113yforJ] [^111eTp6R].

> I will now examine extranodal involvement, which, while less common, can define advanced symptomatic disease. Symptomatic or functionally significant infiltration of non-lymphoid organs such as skin, lung, kidney, or gastrointestinal tract is an iwCLL indication for therapy and can present with site-specific symptoms; hmm, wait a minute, I initially wrote "Tree-in" thinking of pulmonary patterns — let me correct that to the "tree-in-bud" sign reported with bronchiolar CLL infiltration, which can present with dyspnea and cough and improve with CLL therapy, illustrating how extranodal disease can be clinically overt when it threatens organ function [^1117ubjx] [^1147ZGr1] [^113yforJ].

> Let me consider laboratory and ancillary markers that, while not "symptoms", correlate with advanced disease biology and symptom risk. Elevated serum β2-microglobulin reflects tumor burden and renal handling and is incorporated into prognostic indices; elevated lactate dehydrogenase may track with higher turnover or transformation risk; hypogammaglobulinemia predisposes to infections; peripheral smear features like smudge cells are often seen but are not stage-defining; these findings contextualize symptom severity and support prognostication alongside clinical staging [^117QeUzF] [^115wFVNq] [^111eTp6R].

> Hold on, I should verify the dynamic features that mark clinically active disease even before severe cytopenias occur. Progressive lymphocytosis, defined as a 50 percent or greater increase in lymphocyte count over two months or a lymphocyte doubling time less than six months after excluding other causes, signals disease activity that commonly precedes or accompanies symptomatic organomegaly or B symptoms and can forecast imminent symptom development if unchecked [^1117ubjx].

> Next, I should review how guideline treatment triggers can serve as a practical proxy for the constellation of signs and symptoms of advanced CLL. Therapy is indicated for any of the following: progressive marrow failure with hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL or platelets less than 100 × 10⁹/L, massive or progressive splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy with the size thresholds noted above, progressive lymphocytosis by kinetics, autoimmune cytopenias unresponsive to steroids, symptomatic or function-threatening extranodal disease, or the defined constitutional symptoms, all of which mirror the real-world symptomatic presentations of high-risk CLL [^1117ubjx] [^114dpJF9].

> I should double-check the real-world correlations to ground these criteria in observed patient cohorts. In a resource-limited series with predominantly advanced presentations, more than 80 percent had anemia, over 75 percent had lymphadenopathy, and more than 90 percent had splenomegaly, with the vast majority falling into Binet C or Rai III–IV, illustrating how cytopenias, bulky disease, and systemic symptoms cluster in high-risk disease and portend poorer outcomes [^116TVc2F].

> Let me briefly comment on prognosis and make sure not to overstate any single dataset. While outcomes vary widely with biology and access to contemporary targeted therapies, high-risk Rai III–IV or Binet C disease consistently carries the worst prognosis within clinical staging systems, and cohorts presenting with advanced disease — especially in settings with limited access to modern agents — show markedly shortened median survivals, which underscores the importance of promptly recognizing the above signs and symptoms to trigger therapy and supportive care without delay [^113HBxgF] [^116TVc2F].

> Finally, I need to ensure evaluation stays clinically focused because symptomatic status is determined by history, exam, and blood counts rather than routine imaging. Physical examination of all nodal areas and palpation of spleen and liver, coupled with serial blood counts, remain standard; routine cross-sectional imaging is not recommended during watchful waiting and rarely changes management at relapse compared with clinical and laboratory monitoring, which helps keep the focus on patient-reported symptoms and functional impacts [^113EYC3u] [^1125RtCp] [^113WsP4Z].

There is **no recognized stage 6** in standard Rai or Binet systems [^112xoDid]; the highest stages are Rai IV and Binet C [^113HBxgF], defined by **anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100×10⁹/L)** [^114dpJF9]. Advanced CLL presents with **fatigue, dyspnea, pallor, bleeding, infections, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and B symptoms** (fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^114dpJF9] [^1117ubjx] [^113fHEh6]. Laboratory findings include **anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphocytosis, elevated LDH** [^114dpJF9], and **hypogammaglobulinemia** [^114CN7bG]. Use Rai or Binet staging to guide management [^1117ubjx].

---

## Clinical staging systems in CLL

Two primary clinical staging systems classify CLL. The **Rai staging system** is commonly used in the United States and categorizes disease into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia [^113HBxgF]; the **Binet staging system** is widely used in Europe and classifies CLL into stages A, B, and C based on the number of involved lymphoid areas and the presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia [^114dpJF9]. Neither system includes **a stage 6**; the highest stages are **Rai stage IV** and **Binet stage C**, both indicating advanced disease with significant cytopenias [^112xoDid].

---

## Clinical features of advanced CLL (Rai stage IV/Binet stage C)

Advanced CLL is characterized by **significant bone marrow infiltration**, leading to anemia and thrombocytopenia [^113fHEh6]. The following signs and symptoms are **common**:

---

### Hematological abnormalities

- **Anemia**: Hemoglobin levels below 11 g/dL, causing fatigue, pallor, and dyspnea [^113HBxgF].

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Platelet counts below 100×10⁹/L, leading to easy bruising, petechiae, and increased bleeding risk [^113HBxgF].

- **Lymphocytosis**: Elevated lymphocyte counts, often exceeding 5×10⁹/L [^113HBxgF].

---

### Constitutional symptoms ("B symptoms")

- **Fatigue**: Persistent and significant, impacting daily activities [^113fHEh6].

- **Fever**: Unexplained fevers ≥ 38.0°C lasting ≥ 2 weeks without infection [^1117ubjx].

- **Night sweats**: Profuse sweating, often drenching, lasting ≥ 1 month without infection [^114dpJF9].

- **Weight loss**: Unintentional weight loss ≥ 10% within 6 months [^1117ubjx].

---

### Lymphadenopathy and organomegaly

Lymphadenopathy and organomegaly are characterized by enlarged lymph nodes that may be **massive (≥ 10 cm)**, progressive, or symptomatic [^1117ubjx]. Splenomegaly can be **massive** (≥ 6 cm below the left costal margin) and cause abdominal discomfort or early satiety [^114dpJF9], and hepatomegaly is less common but can occur [^113fHEh6].

---

### Immune dysfunction and infections

Immune dysfunction includes **hypogammaglobulinemia**, with reduced immunoglobulin levels that increase susceptibility to infection [^114dpJF9] [^113fHEh6], and **recurrent infections** — frequent bacterial, viral, or fungal infections due to immune suppression [^114dpJF9].

---

### Autoimmune complications

Autoimmune complications include **autoimmune hemolytic anemia**, immune-mediated destruction of red blood cells that worsens anemia [^1117ubjx], and **immune thrombocytopenia**, immune-mediated platelet destruction that exacerbates thrombocytopenia [^114dpJF9].

---

### Laboratory findings

Key laboratory abnormalities include **elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**, indicating high tumor burden and cell turnover [^114dpJF9], and **elevated beta-2 microglobulin**, a marker of disease activity and prognosis [^117QeUzF].

---

## Prognostic implications

Advanced CLL (Rai stage IV/Binet stage C) is associated with a **poorer prognosis** than earlier stages [^113HBxgF]. Median survival is significantly shorter, often **2 to 5 years**, depending on patient factors and treatment response [^112xoDid].

---

## Management considerations

Treatment initiation in advanced CLL is guided by **active disease**, significant cytopenias, symptomatic lymphadenopathy or organomegaly, and constitutional symptoms [^1117ubjx]. Current **therapeutic options** include:

- **Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors**: Ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib [^113fHEh6].

- **B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitors**: Venetoclax, often combined with anti-CD20 antibodies (obinutuzumab, rituximab) [^114dpJF9].

- **Chemoimmunotherapy**: Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab (FCR) for selected patients [^113HBxgF].

- **Supportive care**: Management of infections, autoimmune complications, and symptomatic relief [^114dpJF9] [^111eTp6R].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no recognized stage 6** in CLL staging systems [^112xoDid]. Advanced CLL (Rai stage IV/Binet stage C) features significant anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, immune dysfunction, and heightened infection risk. **Management involves targeted therapies**, chemoimmunotherapy, and supportive care tailored to patient-specific factors [^113fHEh6].

### iWCLL guidelines for diagnosis, indications for treatment, response assessment, and supportive management of CLL [^1117ubjx]. Blood (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the iwCLL 2018 guidelines suggest initiating therapy in patients where active disease is clearly documented, alongside at least one of the following criteria being met:

- **Progressive marrow failure**: This is manifested by development or worsening of anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Cutoff levels of hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or platelet counts < 100×10⁹/L are generally regarded as indications for treatment. However, stable platelet counts < 100×10⁹/L over a long period may not automatically require therapeutic intervention.

- **Splenomegaly**: Massive, such as ≥ 6 cm below the left costal margin, or progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly.

- **Lymphadenopathy**: Massive nodes ≥ 10 cm in longest diameter, or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy.

- **Progressive lymphocytosis**: An increase of ≥ 50% over a 2-month period, or a lymphocyte doubling time < 6 months. Factors contributing to lymphocytosis other than CLL should be excluded.

- **Autoimmune complications**: Including anemia or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive to corticosteroids.

- **Extranodal involvement**: Symptomatic or functional extranodal involvement.

- **Disease-related symptoms**: Defined by any of the following:
	- Unintentional weight loss ≥ 10% within the previous 6 months.
	- Significant fatigue.
	- Fevers ≥ 100.5 °F or 38.0 °C for ≥ 2 weeks without evidence of infection.
	- Night sweats for ≥ 1 month without evidence of infection.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2025 update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy [^113HBxgF]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

- **Risk stratification, staging, and indication for treatment**: Two widely accepted clinical staging systems co-exist. The Rai classification was later modified to reduce the number of prognostic groups from five to three. Both systems describe three major prognostic groups with discrete clinical outcomes. These two staging systems are simple, inexpensive, and rely on a physical examination and standard laboratory tests. They do not require ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging.

The Rai staging system defines low-risk disease as patients who have lymphocytosis with leukemia cells in the blood and/or marrow (lymphoid cells > 30%) (former Rai Stage 0). Patients with lymphocytosis, enlarged nodes in any site, and splenomegaly and/or hepatomegaly (lymph nodes being palpable or not) are defined as having intermediate-risk disease (formerly considered Rai Stage I or Stage II). High-risk disease includes patients with disease-related anemia, as defined by a hemoglobin (Hb) level less than 11 g/dL (formerly Stage III), or thrombocytopenia, as defined by a platelet count of less than 100 × 10⁹/L (formerly Stage IV).

The Binet staging system is based on the number of involved areas, as defined by the presence of enlarged lymph nodes greater than 1 cm in diameter or organomegaly, and on whether there is anemia or thrombocytopenia. The areas of involvement considered are (1) head and neck, including the Waldeyer ring (this counts as one area, even if more than one group of nodes is enlarged) and (2) axillae (involvement of both axillae counts as one area).

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Prognostic factors at presentation in a resource-limited center [^116TVc2F]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Determining the prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) using the International Prognostic Index markers, such as TP53 and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene mutation in a resource-limited setting, is challenging due to costs and equipment unavailability. The aim of this study is to identify prognostic factors that are easily accessible to hematologists in low- or medium-income countries.

This retrospective study was conducted at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Data were collected from CLL patient records spanning January 2004 to December 2019, covering a 15-year period. The analysis was performed using SPSS software version 25.

A total of 46 records were reviewed, revealing a median age of 55 years with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.2. All patients presented with symptoms, predominantly splenomegaly (91.3%), anemia (82.6%), and lymphadenopathy (76.1%). About 89.1% were classified at Binet stage C and/or high-risk Rai (Rai stages III and IV), with 10.9% presenting at Binet stage B and/or intermediate-risk Rai (Rai stage II). Immunophenotyping was performed in only 13% of the patients, with 6.5% being evaluated using the Matutes CLL score. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 15.7%, with a median survival of 26 months. A white blood cell (WBC) count and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) greater than 100 × 10⁹/L were identified as significant poor prognostic markers (P = 0.013 and .021, respectively). Thirty-five patients (76.1%) received chemotherapy, yielding a better median survival compared to those who did not (26 vs. 17.5 months). The most common regimen used was cy.

### Limited clinical relevance of imaging techniques in the follow-up of patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia: results of a meta-analysis [^1125RtCp]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical value of imaging is well established for the follow-up of many lymphoid malignancies but not for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A meta-analysis was performed with the dataset of three German CLL Study Group phase 3 trials (CLL4, CLL5, and CLL8) that included 1,372 patients receiving first-line therapy for CLL. Response as well as progression during follow-up was reassessed according to the National Cancer Institute Working Group 1996 criteria. A total of 481 events were counted as progressive disease during treatment or follow-up. Of these, 372 progressions (77%) were detected by clinical symptoms or blood counts. Computed tomography (CT) scans or ultrasounds were relevant in 44 and 29 cases (9% and 6%), respectively. The decision for relapse treatment was determined by CT scan or ultrasound results in only 2 of 176 patients (1%). CT scan results had an impact on the prognosis of patients in complete remission only after the administration of conventional chemotherapy but not after chemoimmunotherapy.

In conclusion, physical examination and blood count remain the methods of choice for staging and clinical follow-up of patients with CLL, as recommended by the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 guidelines. These trials are registered at http://www.isrctn.org as ISRCTN 75653261 and ISRCTN 36294212 and at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00281918.

### Leukemia: An overview for primary care [^1113Q9nd]. American Family Physician (2014). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, particularly concerning differential diagnosis, AAFP 2014 guidelines recommend suspecting common causes such as infection, inflammation, and stress response when evaluating a patient with leukocytosis. Obtain a peripheral blood smear in patients with a WBC count > 20,000/mcL who also have associated anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, enlarged liver, spleen, or lymph nodes, or constitutional symptoms.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: A clinical review [^112xqsbh]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

The most common leukemia is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Every year, there are 15,000 new diagnoses and 5,000 CLL deaths in the United States. Although therapeutic choices were once limited, the treatment of this disease has vastly improved in the last decade.

- **Objective**: Evidence-based review of the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of CLL.

- **Evidence review**: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched through August 28, 2014. English-language peer-reviewed articles published between 2000–2014 were found using the following keywords:

	- **Treatment-related terms**: upfront therapy, upfront therapies, upfront therapeutic, upfront therapeutics, upfront treatment, front-line treatment, first-line treatment, front-line treatments, first-line treatments, front-line therapy, front-line therapies

	- **Research design terms**: randomized, randomized studies, randomized study, clinical trial, clinical trials, phase 3, phase 3 clinical trial

	Abstracts and presentations at scientific meetings were excluded. A total of 277 articles were retrieved, of which 24 met our predefined selection criteria. Treatment recommendations were based on subsequent analysis of these 24 articles.

- **Findings**: The Rai and Binet systems for staging CLL were established in 1975 and 1977, respectively. However, they do not account for new disease categories such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (peripheral blood clonal lymphocytosis that does not meet other criteria for CLL). Two subsets of CLL are now recognized based on risk stratification involving molecular and cytogenetic analyses. Outcomes are based on these analyses.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2015 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment [^1135vT2j]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in Western countries. The disease primarily occurs in elderly patients and exhibits a highly variable clinical course. Leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations that impair apoptosis of clonal B-cells.

- **Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is established by blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B-lymphocytes, which identify a clonal B-cell population carrying the CD5 antigen as well as B-cell markers.

- **Prognosis**: Two prognostic staging systems exist, the Rai and Binet staging systems, which are established by physical examination and blood counts. Various biological and genetic markers also have prognostic value. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)) predict resistance to available chemotherapies. Comprehensive prognostic scores are currently being developed.

- **Therapy**: Patients with active or symptomatic disease or with advanced Binet or Rai stages require therapy. For physically fit patients, chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab remains the standard therapy. For unfit patients, treatment with an anti-CD20 antibody (obinutuzumab, rituximab, or ofatumumab) plus a milder chemotherapy (chlorambucil) may be applied. At relapse, the initial treatment may be repeated if the treatment-free interval exceeds two to three years. If the disease relapses earlier, therapy should be changed using alternative agents such as bendamustine (plus rituximab), alemtuzumab, lenalidomide, ofatumumab, ibrutinib, or idelalisib.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2017 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment [^114gDzs9]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in Western countries and typically occurs in elderly patients, exhibiting a highly variable clinical course. Leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations that impair the apoptosis of clonal B cells.

- **Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is established through blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B lymphocytes, which identify a clonal B-cell population carrying the CD5 antigen and B-cell markers.

- **Prognosis**: Two prognostic staging systems exist, the Rai and Binet staging systems, which are established by physical examination and blood counts. Various biological and genetic markers also have prognostic value. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del(17p)) and/or mutations of the TP53 gene predict resistance to available chemotherapies. A comprehensive prognostic score (CLL-IPI) using genetic, biological, and clinical variables has recently been developed, allowing classification of CLL into very distinct risk groups.

- **Therapy**: Patients with active or symptomatic disease, or with advanced Binet or Rai stages, require therapy. For physically fit patients, chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab remains the standard therapy. For unfit patients, current evidence supports two options for first-line therapy: chlorambucil combined with an anti-CD20 antibody (obinutuzumab, rituximab, or ofatumumab) or continuous therapy with ibrutinib. At relapse, the initial treatment may be repeated if the treatment-free interval has been sufficiently long.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: from molecular pathogenesis to novel therapeutic strategies [^117SHNCq]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

The clinical course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is rather heterogeneous, ranging from a fairly asymptomatic disease that may even regress spontaneously, to a progressive disease that eventually leads to the patient's death. There has always been remarkable interest in determining the prognosis of individual patients. Although many prognostic markers have been identified over the past decades, only a few prevail.

For many years, the prognosis of patients with CLL was defined using purely clinical parameters, such as those included in the Rai and Binet staging systems, the IGHV mutational status, and numerical aberrations as determined by FISH. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, novel drivers were discovered (NOTCH1, SF3B1, BIRC3) and incorporated into these prognostic systems, but none of these attempts succeeded in becoming the standard of care. Indeed, the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) guidelines only recommend evaluating the IGHV status and the presence/absence of TP53 aberrations in routine practice.

The recent CLL International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI) incorporates both clinical and cytogenetic/genomic data (age, clinical staging, β2-microglobulin serum concentration, IGHV mutation status, and TP53 aberrations) into one prognostic score. The CLL-IPI was developed in cohorts of patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) and has been validated in retrospective series. Among the five items, both TP53 and IGHV have the strongest impact on a patient's outcome, and it is therefore not surprising that simplified versions of the CLL-IPI have been suggested.

### Binet's staging system and VH genes are independent but complementary prognostic indicators in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^112ZTSup]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Rai's and Binet's staging systems have significantly contributed to the identification of major prognostic groups in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), though they fail to accurately predict disease progression at the individual level. Biologic factors, such as the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable genes (VH), cytogenetics, CD38 expression, and some serum markers, have recently improved prognostic assessment in CLL. In this study, we analyzed the prognostic value of VH mutational status within the different stages of Binet's classification in 145 patients.

Our series consisted of 83 VH mutated (MT) and 62 VH unmutated (UM) patients. MT cases predominated within Binet's stage A (70%), whereas UM cases predominated among stages B and C (62%).

Median overall survival (OS) was 84 months for UM patients and was not achieved for the MT group (70% 12-year survival, P < 0.0001). Concerning Binet's stage A, both median OS and progression-free survival were significantly shorter for UM patients when compared with those of MT patients (97 months vs. not achieved, P = 0.0017; and 42 vs. 156 months, P < 0.0001), which compared favorably with the classical A' and A" substaging. The VH mutational profile could also segregate stage B and C patients into two groups with different survival patterns (median OS, 78 vs. 120 months for UM and MT patients, respectively; p = 0.002).

The significant survival differences observed between the VH mutational groups, among stage A and stage B and C patients, indicate that Binet's classification provides valuable prognostic information in CLL when combined with VH gene mutational status.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, specifically concerning history and physical examination, the ESMO 2021 guidelines recommend eliciting history and performing physical examinations. This includes careful palpation of all lymph node areas, spleen, and liver in asymptomatic patients with early-stage disease. Such assessments should also be conducted before initiating treatment in patients with advanced or symptomatic stage disease.

### Prognostic models for newly-diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QKa6F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020).

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common cancer of the lymphatic system in Western countries. Several clinical and biological factors for CLL have been identified. However, it remains unclear which of the available prognostic models combining those factors can be used in clinical practice to predict long-term outcomes in people newly diagnosed with CLL.

- **Objectives**: To identify, describe, and appraise all prognostic models developed to predict overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or treatment-free survival (TFS) in newly diagnosed (previously untreated) adults with CLL, and conduct a meta-analysis of their predictive performances.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE (from January 1950 to June 2019 via Ovid) and Embase (from 1974 to June 2019), along with registries of ongoing trials (up to 5 March 2020), for development and validation studies of prognostic models for untreated adults with CLL. Additionally, we screened the reference lists and citation indices of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all prognostic models developed for CLL that predict OS, PFS, or TFS, provided they combined prognostic factors known before treatment initiation. We also included any studies that tested the performance of these models in individuals other than those included in model development (i.e. 'external model validation studies'). We included studies of adults with confirmed B-cell CLL who had not received treatment prior to the start of the study, without restricting the search based on study design.

### A laboratory-based scoring system predicts early treatment in Rai 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^115k4sFT]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

We have not overlooked the uniqueness of including WBC count as a prognostic biomarker in this study. More commonly, B-cell lymphocyte count is employed in the diagnosis and response to therapy in CLL. However, we demonstrate here that, commensurate with previously published studies, WBC count may deserve consideration as a clinically useful surrogate marker of disease burden particularly in the setting of untreated disease where, alongside del17p and unmutated IGHV gene status, it appears to demonstrate prognostic significance. This observation is consistent with previous data demonstrating WBC count, along with IGHV, as independent predictors of TFS in Binet A CLL.

Finally, CD49d, a well-proven independent prognosticator in CLL, including in cases of early-stage disease, failed, perhaps surprisingly, to emerge in multivariable analysis as an independent factor in our Rai 0 training cohort. We hypothesize that the dropout of CD49d in multivariate analysis was due to the close relationship between CD49d and tris12, the latter maintained in the final multivariable model; this idea is supported by bivariate analysis of these two variables wherein CD49d lost significance (data not shown).

In conclusion, we present here a novel laboratory-based scoring system for Rai 0 CLL to aid clinical decision-making in cases of early-stage disease. These findings advocate a role for immunocytogenetic analysis in Rai 0 CLL at the time of diagnosis to aid prognosis, particularly in today's chemo-free era where early intervention is acquiring momentum in the investigative setting. Further investigation is needed.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2025 update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy [^116aL61V]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

The iwCLL guidelines provide a detailed description of the assessment of the treatment response. A comprehensive overview of these response criteria is beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, in essence, the response categories include complete remission, partial remission, stable disease, progression, and refractory disease. Additionally, the assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) is an increasingly important category of response assessment, which results in four different response categories (see Figure 1).

- **Definition of response in clinical trials**: As proposed by the iwCLL, the assessment of MRD is not always a part of routine practice, but it may be used to determine the duration of therapy with targeted agents. MRD stands for minimal residual disease; CR is complete remission; PR is partial remission; MRD− indicates undetectable MRD; MRD+ indicates detectable MRD.

Use of sensitive multicolor flow cytometry, PCR, or next-generation sequencing can detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in many patients who achieve a complete clinical response. Prospective clinical trials have provided evidence that therapies leading to undetectable MRD (uMRD) usually improve long-term clinical outcomes. The value of MRD assessments has been compared to the evaluation of clinical response in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in 554 patients treated in two randomized trials of the German CLL Study Group (CLL8 and CLL10). Patients with uMRD in complete remission (CR), uMRD in partial remission (PR), detectable MRD (dMRD) in CR, and dMRD in PR experienced a median progression-free survival (PFS).

### CLL biology and prognosis [^114sDjof]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) follows an extremely variable course with survival ranging from months to decades. Recently, there has been major progress in the identification of molecular and cellular markers that may predict the tendency for disease progression in CLL patients. In particular, the mutational profile of Ig genes and some cytogenetic abnormalities have been found to be important predictors of prognosis in CLL. However, this progress has raised new questions about the biology and prognosis of the disease, some of which are addressed here.

- **Questions include**:
	1) What is the role of the B-cell receptor (BCR) in CLL pathogenesis?
	2) Is CLL one disease?
	3) Is CLL an accumulative disease?
	4) What is the normal counterpart of the CLL B lymphocyte?
	5) Have the Rai and Binet staging systems become obsolete?
	6) Which is the best surrogate for Ig mutational profiles?

### High-risk subtypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are detectable as early as 16 years prior to diagnosis [^116Lq4wT]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

For 56 participants, lymphocyte counts were recorded at the time of baseline blood sampling (Figure 1D). Lymphocytosis (> 3 × 10⁹ lymphocytes per liter of blood) was evident in 10 of 28 patients up to 8 years before CLL diagnosis, suggesting undiagnosed instances of HC MBL or asymptomatic CLL. In contrast, next-generation sequencing results showed detectable skewing of the IGH gene repertoire in 21 of 28 patients up to 15 years before CLL diagnosis, often in the absence of elevated lymphocyte counts (Figure 1E-F). Selection mechanisms may operate long before lymphocyte counts become abnormal, leading to restriction of the IGH gene repertoire and clonal expansion. Remarkably, some patients with CLL requiring treatment and clinical transformation to an aggressive B-cell lymphoma displayed considerable skewing in the IGH gene repertoire as early as 16 years before CLL diagnosis (Figure 1G-H).

We determined the IGHV mutational status for all 100 future patients with CLL with a dominant clonotype frequency > 2% (Figure 2A). We observed 68 mutated and 32 unmutated dominant clonotypes, in accordance with previous reports of an IGHV mutational status ratio of 2:1 in MBL. Regardless of the association of U-CLL with a poorer prognosis, there was no significant difference in the time to diagnosis between M-CLL and U-CLL. However, patients with a prediagnostic IGHV-unmutated dominant clonotype had a significantly shorter overall survival after CLL diagnosis compared with patients with an IGHV-mutated clonotype (supplemental Figure 2).

### IGHV-associated methylation signatures more accurately predict clinical outcomes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients than IGHV mutation load [^116wFcxu]. Haematologica (2022). High credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have asymptomatic, early-stage disease at the time of diagnosis, but the subsequent disease course is highly variable. Some patients experience early progression, while others live for many years with indolent disease. Immediate treatment after diagnosis does not seem to improve patients' survival. Consequently, to reduce unnecessary harmful complications following therapy, the majority of CLL patients are managed with a "watch and wait" strategy, and treatment is only initiated at disease progression. This progression is assessed according to clinical symptoms defined by the Rai and Binet staging systems. However, with the advent of new therapies, it is well recognized that some patients can potentially benefit from earlier intervention.

Molecular biomarker-based indices, as opposed to clinical staging, are likely to reflect the complex biology of CLL and, therefore, predict patients' outcomes more accurately. However, the development of biomarker-based indices in CLL is still ongoing. Recent large multicenter studies investigating the prognostic power of various known molecular and clinical biomarkers have proposed two new biomarker indices: the International Prognostic Index for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL-IPI) and the International Prognostic Score for Early-stage CLL (IPS-E). The CLL-IPI index is based on TP53 aberrations, IGHV mutation status, B2-microglobulin concentration, clinical Rai/Binet stage, and age, with TP53 aberrations predicting overall survival (OS) most accurately in multivariable analyses.

### Total body computed tomography scan in the initial work-up of Binet stage A chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients: Results of the prospective, multicenter O-CLL1-GISL study [^112VWsD3]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Total body computed tomography (TB-CT) scan is not mandatory in the diagnostic/staging algorithm of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The aim of this study was to determine the value and prognostic significance of TB-CT scan in early stage CLL patients. Baseline TB-CT scan was performed in 240 Binet stage A CLL patients (179 Rai low- and 61 Rai intermediate-risk) who were included in a prospective multicenter observational study (clinicaltrial.gov ID: NCT00917549). The cohort included 69 clinical monoclonal B lymphocytosis (cMBLs). Patients were restaged considering only radiological data.

Following TB-CT scans, 20% of cases were reclassified as radiologic Binet (r-Binet) stage B. R-Binet B patients showed a higher incidence of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities (P = 0.027), as well as a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.001). At multivariate analysis, r-Binet stage [HR = 2.48; P = 0.004] and IGHV mutational status [HR = 3.01; P = 0.002] retained an independent predictive value for PFS. Among 179 Rai low-risk cases, 100 were redefined as r-Rai intermediate-risk based upon TB-CT scan data, showing a higher rate of cases with increased ZAP-70 (P = 0.033) and CD38 expression (P = 0.029), and elevated β2-microglobulin levels (P < 0.0001), as well as a shorter PFS than those with r-Rai low-risk (P = 0.008). R-Rai stage [HR = 2.78; P = 0.046] and IGHV mutational status [HR = 4.25; P = 0.009] retained a significant predictive value for PFS at multivariate analysis. Forty-two percent of cMBL patients were reclassified as r-small lymphocytic lymphomas (r-SLLs) by TB-CT scan. TB-CT scan appears to provide relevant information in early stage CLL.

### Measurable residual disease in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Expert review and consensus recommendations [^115TEFVF]. Leukemia (2021). Low credibility.

Assessment of measurable residual disease (often referred to as "minimal residual disease") has emerged as a highly sensitive indicator of disease burden during and at the end of treatment and has been correlated with time-to-event outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Undetectable-measurable residual disease status at the end of treatment demonstrated independent prognostic significance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, correlating with favorable progression-free and overall survival with chemoimmunotherapy. Given its utility in evaluating depth of response, determining measurable residual disease status is now a focus of outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia clinical trials. Increased adoption of measurable residual disease assessment calls for standards for nomenclature and outcomes data reporting.

In addition, many basic questions have not been systematically addressed. Here, we present the work of an international, multidisciplinary, 174-member panel convened to identify critical questions on key issues pertaining to measurable residual disease in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, review evaluable data, develop unified answers in conjunction with local expert input, and provide recommendations for future studies.

- **Methodology for measurable residual disease determination**: Recommendations are presented regarding methodology for measurable residual disease determination, assay requirements and in which tissue to assess measurable residual disease, timing and frequency of assessment, use of measurable residual disease in clinical practice versus clinical trials, and the future usefulness of measurable residual disease assessment.

### Spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: an unanticipated complication of an undiagnosed disease [^111GB9s2]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The patient fulfilled all four laboratory and two clinical criteria of tumour lysis syndrome according to the modified Cairo and Bishop classification system. Although the case also fulfills criteria proposed exclusively for STLS by Weeks and Kimple, the lack of international recognition necessitates following the Cairo-Bishop classification instead. The typical constellation of metabolic abnormalities in the absence of primary renal pathology, with the presence of bulky CLL, makes STLS the most probable diagnosis.

- **Modified Cairo-Bishop classification of tumour lysis syndrome in adults**. Although lymphocytosis, smudge cells, flow cytometry, and cytogenetics established the diagnosis, considering the rare occurrence of STLS in a low-grade malignancy like CLL, bone marrow aspiration/biopsy and lymph node biopsy were performed in the second week after the patient's condition was stabilized. The absence of immunoblast or centroblast-like large B cell morphology, Reid-Sternberg cell morphology, and negative MUM1/IRF4 immunohistochemistry, along with a relatively low Ki67 index, absence of classical B symptoms and extranodal features, presence of symptomatic hypocalcemia, and lack of TP53, NOTCH1, MYC and CDKN2A mutations, ruled out Richter transformation. Lack of t(11;14) and cyclin D1 expression excluded the possibility of mantle cell lymphoma.

- **Findings from bone marrow biopsy**. Malignant lymphocyte infiltration with suppression of erythrocytic and megakaryocytic series in the bone marrow biopsy suggested CLL as a cause of anemia and thrombocytopenia, adhering to iWCLL guidelines.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment algorithm 2022 [^111CGXT6]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Management of patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an evolving process. The vast majority of CLL patients present with early-stage, asymptomatic disease at diagnosis. According to the 2018 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria, only those patients who meet the established indications for therapy initiation should be considered for treatment.

- **Indications for treatment**:
	- Treatment is indicated when there are autoimmune complications, including autoimmune cytopenias that are poorly responsive to corticosteroids. Additionally, unintentional weight loss of 10% or more within the previous six months, significant fatigue as per the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale of 2 or greater, fevers reaching 38.0 °C for two weeks or longer without evidence of infection, or night sweats lasting for one month or longer without infection all warrant consideration for treatment change or initiation.

- **Non-CLL factors**:
	- Other conditions that may contribute to lymphocytosis, such as infections and corticosteroid use, should be excluded before diagnosing CLL-related complications. Hemoglobin and platelet count thresholds require careful consideration of the rate of decline; in certain patients, counts marginally below these levels may remain stable over an extended period, negating the immediate need for treatment initiation.

A comprehensive approach for patients who do not meet the 2018 iwCLL criteria is provided with an emphasis on risk stratification and supportive care, which are crucial components in the management of these patients.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Prognostic factors at presentation in a resource-limited center [^116PDiTT]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clonal B cell malignant disease characterized by lymphocytosis and the progressive accumulation of clonal B cells in the blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen, which permits easy diagnosis from the peripheral blood. The clinical features of CLL at presentation are related to the accumulation of these leukemic cells.

CLL predominantly affects the elderly, with a median age of 65–72 years at diagnosis. It is a slowly progressive disease, with an 81.7% 5-year survival rate. It accounts for 17%-20% of all hematologic malignancies in Nigeria, with 2–6 per 100,000 new cases diagnosed annually. CLL accounts for one-quarter of the new cases of leukemia, with an age-adjusted incidence of 4.5 per 100,000 persons in the United States. The incidence varies widely across geographical locations, with Asia having a 5–10-fold lower prevalence. It is more common in males and is mostly seen in the elderly (age > 65 years), with some familial tendency being alleged.

Diagnosis requires peripheral blood lymphocytosis, an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of ≥ 5 × 10⁹, and clonality confirmed by immunophenotyping (IMPT). Staging of the tumor is usually done at diagnosis, using the Rai or Binet staging systems, both of which are used for prognosis and decision on the commencement of therapy. These systems use lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, and cytopenias (anemia and thrombocytopenia) to establish prognostic groups that can be used to predict median survival. The Rai and Binet staging systems were some of the first prognostic markers to affect disease management.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically in patients with CMV infection, the iwCLL 2018 guidelines recommend monitoring patients treated with immune-suppressive agents for CMV. Consider antiviral therapy if patients are found to have increased levels of CMV in the blood by PCR, even in the absence of clinical symptoms. Moreover, initiate antiviral therapy for infected patients exhibiting clinical symptoms of active CMV infection.

### Narrative review: Initial management of newly diagnosed, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^115x2tKU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is one of the most common malignant lymphoid diseases in the Western world and is frequently diagnosed by internists. There have been clinically significant changes in the methods of diagnosis, prognostic tools, supportive care, and treatment over the past two decades. Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia now have Rai stage 0 or I disease at diagnosis. Patients with early-stage disease are a heterogeneous group: approximately 30% to 50% will have accelerated disease progression, while the remainder may live for decades and possibly never require therapy.

Recent insights into the biological characteristics of leukemic B cells have led to the discovery of new prognostic tools (immunoglobulin variable-region heavy chain gene mutation status, cytogenetic abnormalities assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, and Z-chain-associated protein kinase-70 protein expression) that can identify patients with early-stage disease who are at high risk for early disease progression. These tools allow physicians to individualize counseling, follow-up, and management based on disease risk. Additionally, new treatments developed over the past two decades (purine nucleoside analogues, monoclonal antibodies, and combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens) have dramatically improved response rates and appear to prolong survival.

In this review, the authors discuss the work-up of lymphocytosis and highlight how to use recently identified prognostic tools to stratify risk in patients with newly diagnosed, early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

### Should IGHV status and FISH testing be performed in all CLL patients at diagnosis? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111j3pPe]. Blood (2016). High credibility.

Since the first description of the natural history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) by David Galton in 1966, the considerable heterogeneity in the disease course has been well recognized. The Rai and Binet staging systems, described approximately 40 years ago, have proven to be robust prognostic tools. Over the past two decades, several novel biological, genetic, and molecular markers have been shown to be useful adjuncts to the Rai and Binet staging systems.

In this systematic review, we examined the role of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutation status and genetic abnormalities determined by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in patients with newly diagnosed CLL. The cumulative evidence presented in this systematic review is sufficient to recommend that FISH and IGHV be performed as standard clinical tests for all patients with newly diagnosed CLL in countries with the resources to do so. In addition to clinical stage, these parameters could represent the minimal standard initial prognostic evaluation for patients with CLL. This approach will allow the application of powerful, recently developed prognostic indices (all of which are dependent on IGHV and FISH results) to all patients with newly diagnosed CLL.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Recent advances in diagnosis and treatment [^1171sgXn]. The Oncologist (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a low-grade B-lineage lymphoid malignancy, but it may have more heterogeneity than previously thought. Many cases require no treatment at all due to an indolent course, while other patients become symptomatic or develop signs of rapid progression. Treatment is usually noncurative and is directed at reducing symptoms. Some molecular risk features may help delineate, at initial diagnosis, which patients will have a more aggressive course.

Newer CLL treatment regimens incorporating purine nucleoside analogues and monoclonal antibodies have increased the rate of molecular complete remissions, potentially leading to better survival times. Reduced intensity allogeneic transplant conditioning regimens have made the potentially curative modality more widely available.

All these treatments have significant risks for infectious complications, which must be carefully weighed against the risks posed by the underlying disease. A proposed risk-based treatment algorithm is discussed.

### Bcl-6 mutation status provides clinically valuable information in early-stage B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^115Hd4R5]. Leukemia (2004). Low credibility.

In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), somatic mutation of IgVH genes defines a subgroup with favorable prognosis, whereas the absence of IgVH mutations is correlated with a worse outcome. Mutations of the BCL-6 gene are also observed in a subset of B-CLL, but the clinical significance of this molecular alteration remains uncertain. We examined the distribution of IgVH and BCL-6 gene mutations in 95 well-characterized patients with Binet stage A B-CLL and correlated them with clinical, laboratory, cytogenetic findings, and disease progression.

Mutations of the BCL-6 gene were observed only in cases harboring mutated IgVH. Unexpectedly, the coexistence of IgVH and BCL-6 mutations was correlated with a shorter treatment-free interval (TFI) compared to cases harboring only IgVH mutation (median, 55 months vs not reached; P = 0.01), resembling the clinical course of unmutated IgVH cases (median TFI, 44 months). As expected, deletions of 17p13 (P53 locus) and 11q22 (ATM locus) were observed in cases with unmutated IgVH, except for one patient who showed mutations of both IgVH and BCL-6. No other statistically significant differences were observed among the genetic subgroups. Our data indicate that BCL-6 mutations identify a subgroup of Binet stage A B-CLL patients with a high risk of progression despite the presence of the mutated IgVH gene.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and more specifically with respect to cytogenetic analysis, the ESMO 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining FISH for the detection of chromosome 17 deletion affecting the tumor protein p53 expression. They also advise obtaining TP53 sequencing, at least exons 4–10 and exons 2–11, for the detection of TP53 gene mutation in the absence of chromosome 17 deletion before initiating treatment in patients with advanced or symptomatic stage disease. Analysis should be obtained as close as possible — preferably within 6 months — prior to the initiation of therapy because genetic lesions may evolve throughout the disease.

### An international prognostic index for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL-IPI): a meta-analysis of individual patient data [^117MSrxM]. The Lancet Oncology (2016). High credibility.

The management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is currently undergoing improvements due to novel therapies and a plethora of biological and genetic variables that add prognostic information to the classic clinical staging systems. We established an international consortium with the aim to create an international prognostic index for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL-IPI) that integrates the major prognostic parameters.

- **Methods**: We used results from a systematic search of the Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group of MEDLINE, Embase, and Central databases for prospective, clinical phase 2 and 3 trials of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, published between Jan 1, 1950, and Dec 31, 2010, which identified 13 trials. We contacted the principal investigators of these 13 trials, of which eight agreed to include individual patient data. We used the individual patient data from these phase 3 trials from France, Germany, Poland, the UK, and the United States to create the full analysis dataset. The full analysis dataset was randomly divided, using a random sample procedure, into training and internal-validation datasets. We did a univariate analysis and multivariate analyses using 27 baseline factors and overall survival as an endpoint. We assigned weighted risk scores to each factor included in the final multivariable model. We assessed the discriminatory value using C-statistics and also the validity and reproducibility of the CLL-IPI by subgroup analysis. We used two additional datasets from the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA; MAYO cohort) and the SCALE Scandi.

### A laboratory-based scoring system predicts early treatment in Rai 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^115eQvmA]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

In the training, composite and two out of the four validation cohorts, the proposed prognostic score approached or exceeded C-index values of 0.7, a threshold necessary to confer utility at the individual patient level. In this regard, however, a more precise evaluation of the individual predictive potential may require the application of complex statistical methods, as recently proposed.

This study raises questions regarding the appropriate timing of immunocytogenetic analysis in early-stage disease, which today is often postponed until the time of disease progression and first treatment. We appreciate the cost-effectiveness of a 'watch-and-wait' approach, particularly since studies investigating the early use of chlorambucil and fludarabine monotherapy, as well as FCR regimens (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide + rituximab), have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes in CLL patients. However, the role of the novel inhibitors in this setting remains to be elucidated, and the results of this study support the notion that early testing can aid risk-adapted treatment strategies and early intervention, particularly in the modern chemo-free era. In this regard, the CLL12 trial (a phase III clinical study currently underway in Germany) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib compared to a 'watch-and-wait' approach in Binet A CLL, using a similar comprehensive scoring system to identify high-risk patients. Another randomized phase II study currently underway at the Mayo Clinic is comparing the efficacy of the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib alone and in combination with the anti-

### Development of a comprehensive prognostic index for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^116NFGq2]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

In addition to clinical staging, a number of biomarkers predicting overall survival (OS) have been identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The multiplicity of markers, limited information on their independent prognostic value, and a lack of understanding of how to interpret discordant markers are major barriers to use in routine clinical practice. We therefore performed an analysis of 23 prognostic markers based on prospectively collected data from 1,948 CLL patients participating in phase 3 trials of the German CLL Study Group to develop a comprehensive prognostic index. A multivariable Cox regression model identified eight independent predictors of OS: sex, age, ECOG status, del(17p), del(11q), IGHV mutation status, serum β2-microglobulin, and serum thymidine kinase. Using a weighted grading system, a prognostic index was derived that separated four risk categories with 5-year OS ranging from 18.7% to 95.2% and having a C-statistic of 0.75. The index stratified OS within all analyzed subgroups, including all Rai/Binet stages.

The validity of the index was externally confirmed in a series of 676 newly diagnosed CLL patients from Mayo Clinic. Using this multistep process including external validation, we developed a comprehensive prognostic index with high discriminatory power and prognostic significance at the individual patient level. The studies were registered as follows: CLL1 trial (NCT00262782, http://clinicaltrials.gov), CLL4 trial (ISRCTN 75653261, http://www.controlled-trials.com), and CLL8 trial (NCT00281918, http://clinicaltrials.gov).

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Prognostic factors at presentation in a resource-limited center [^113S2Ytz]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with a high white blood cell (WBC) count and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) had a longer median overall survival (OS). The median OS for Rai stage 0 patients was 150 months; for stage I, it was 101 months; for stage II, 71 months; and for stages III and IV, it was 19 months each. Patients with Binet-A had a longer median OS of 100 months; stage B patients, 55 months; and stage C patients, 45 months.

Our patients with Rai stages II, III, and IV had a median survival of 41, 26, and 11 months, respectively. Interestingly, none of our patients presented with Binet-A, but patients with Binet-B had a better median survival than those at stage C.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^111svXa8]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Important advances in understanding the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in the past two decades have led to the development of new prognostic tools and novel targeted therapies that have improved clinical outcomes. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the most common type of leukaemia in developed countries, and the median age at diagnosis is 72 years. The criteria for initiating treatment rely on the Rai and Binet staging systems and on the presence of disease-related symptoms.

For many patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, treatment with chemotherapy and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies is the standard of care. The impressive efficacy of kinase inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib and the BCL-2 antagonist venetoclax have changed the standard of care in specific subsets of patients. In this seminar, we review the recent progress in the management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and highlight new questions surrounding optimal disease management.

### High-risk subtypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are detectable as early as 16 years prior to diagnosis [^112AVjnA]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Characterization of prediagnostic and diagnostic samples is demonstrated through several analyses:

- **IGHV mutational status**: Determination of all samples from patients with future CLL with a dominant clonotype frequency > 2%. If no clonotype > 2% dominant clonotype frequency was present in the earliest sample of a patient, dominant clonotypes from any later measurements were used. Mutated clonotypes are shown as red circles, whereas unmutated clonotypes (IGHV mutational status > 98% germline sequence identity) are shown as blue triangles. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for time until CLL diagnosis, stratified by IGHV mutational status, indicates that the log-rank test does not find any significant difference.

- **Overview of CLL subsets**: This includes all CLL subsets identified in the data; major subsets are divided by those associated with aggressive or indolent disease courses. Minor subsets are shown separately in light green. Samples in which the K16 and YDSD motifs and the R110 mutation of light chain subset 2L were confirmed are depicted as purple triangles. Patients with repeated samples are connected by a black line. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the time to CLL diagnosis from prediagnostic sample collection is stratified by BcR stereotyped CLL subsets, with the log-rank test finding no significant difference.

- **Cumulative frequency of clonotypes**: This involves the detection of clonotypes at CLL diagnosis for the prediagnostic and diagnostic sample. Cumulative refers to instances where more than one clonotype was shared in both the prediagnostic and diagnostic sample.

### Spontaneous clinical regression in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^113aDJMq]. British Journal of Haematology (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a B-cell disorder with a median survival of over 10 years from diagnosis for stage A disease. The natural history of stage A disease is generally indolent or only slowly progressive. It is less well known that CLL may undergo spontaneous regression. We report a series of 10 such cases (eight stage A and two stage B) followed at our institutions.

### International prognostic score for asymptomatic early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^111mMx9k]. Blood (2020). Low credibility.

Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are diagnosed with early-stage disease and managed with active surveillance. The individual course of patients with early-stage CLL is heterogeneous, and their probability of needing treatment is hardly anticipated at diagnosis. We aimed at developing an international prognostic score to predict time to first treatment (TTFT) in patients with CLL with early, asymptomatic disease (International Prognostic Score for Early-stage CLL [IPS-E]).

Individual patient data from 11 international cohorts of patients with early-stage CLL (n = 4933) were analyzed to build and validate the prognostic score. Three covariates were consistently and independently correlated with TTFT: unmutated immunoglobulin heavy variable gene (IGHV), absolute lymphocyte count higher than 15 × 10⁹/L, and presence of palpable lymph nodes. The IPS-E was the sum of the covariates (1 point each), and separated low-risk (score 0), intermediate-risk (score 1), and high-risk (score 2–3) patients showing a distinct TTFT.

The score accuracy was validated in 9 cohorts staged by the Binet system and 1 cohort staged by the Rai system. The C-index was 0.74 in the training series and 0.70 in the aggregate of validation series. By meta-analysis of the training and validation cohorts, the 5-year cumulative risk for treatment start was 8.4%, 28.4%, and 61.2% among low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients, respectively. The IPS-E is a simple and robust prognostic model that predicts the likelihood of treatment requirement in patients with early-stage CLL.

### Unusual complications in the management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^113yforJ]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common, indolent disease that typically presents with a proliferation of mature, immunologically dysfunctional CD5+ B-cells, which preferentially occupy the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and lymphoid organs. Immune dysfunction leads to an increase in autoimmune diseases, occurring in approximately 10% of patients with CLL. Autoimmune cytopenias are the most common, but other organs may be affected as well. The treatment of these conditions typically depends on the extent of CLL and the severity of symptoms, generally consisting of CLL-directed therapies, immunosuppression, or both.

CLL may also infiltrate extranodal sites in the body. Symptomatic extranodal CLL, or extranodal disease that threatens normal organ function, is an indication for the initiation of CLL-directed therapy. This review summarizes autoimmune and extranodal complications that can occur in patients with CLL and our suggested approach to their treatment.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Prognostic factors at presentation in a resource-limited center [^114mgo7z]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical features at presentation included a median packed cell volume (PCV) of 24% (range, 8.7%-39%), a total white blood cell (WBC) count of 101.0 × 10⁹/L (range, 26.3–642.0 × 10⁹/L), an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of 88.7 × 10⁹/L (range, 21.3–622.7 × 10⁹/L), and a platelet count of 131.5 × 10⁹/L (range, 12–392 × 10⁹/L).

Using the PCV and platelet count cutoffs from the Rai staging criteria, 33 patients (71.7%) were found to have anemia, while 18 patients (39.1%) had thrombocytopenia. Stage distribution showed 18 patients (39.1%) at Rai stage 4, 23 patients (50%) at Rai stage 3, and 5 patients (10.9%) at Rai stage 2. None of the patients presented at Rai stage 0 or 1, or Binet stage A. A majority, 41 patients (89.1%), presented at Binet stage C, and 5 patients (10.9%) at Binet stage B.

### A laboratory-based scoring system predicts early treatment in Rai 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^111xVtfi]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: The clinical staging systems for CLL, described by Rai and Binet approximately 40 years ago, are still used in clinical practice today to inform prognosis and guide treatment decisions. However, their predictive powers are limited. For example, Pflug et al. reported C-indices of 0.56 and 0.58 for Rai and Binet systems, respectively, when applied to a cohort of 1,948 patients. Novel model scoring systems developed in recent years have significantly improved the accuracy of prognostication by incorporating new biomarkers and hold the potential for the development of more individualized treatment strategies, especially in the age of increasing sophistication of novel agents, alone or in combination. In this regard, the CLL-IPI was developed as an integrative tool to evaluate overall survival for all clinical stages of disease, and although it demonstrated consistency in subgroup analyses circumscribed to early-stage disease, it was not developed specifically to predict TFS.

To our knowledge, this study represents one of the largest attempts to integrate novel biomarkers with traditional clinical factors, with the specific aim of predicting TFS in the setting of Rai 0 CLL. Given the multiplicity of new biomarkers, our goals were as follows: i) to determine which ones individually influence TFS; and ii) to develop a scoring system to stratify risk in patients traditionally thought to harbor indolent disease.

Our training cohort was selected from a consecutive series of 1,201 CLL cases referred to a single center for immunocytogenetic analyses between 2006 and 2017.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 2020: The future has arrived [^116JgFsh]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Low credibility.

The iwCLL guidelines specify when to initiate treatment, considering the diagnostic criteria, patients' symptoms, full blood counts, and physical examination. **Conditions warranting treatment initiation**: The presence of constitutional symptoms, progressive lymphocytosis, a doubling time of less than six months, hemoglobin levels of less than 100 g/L, or a platelet count of less than 100 × 10⁹/L, as well as progressive or symptomatic bulky lymphadenopathy/organomegaly, or treatment-resistant autoimmune thrombocytopaenia or anaemia, are indications to start treatment. In some circumstances, treatment may be initiated at diagnosis. However, it is much more common for patients to be monitored for signs of increasing disease activity, often over many years.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^117VXsqv]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the most common form of leukaemia in Europe and North America, primarily affecting older individuals. It has a highly variable course, with survival ranging from months to decades. Significant progress has been made in identifying molecular and cellular markers that can predict disease progression in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Notably, the mutational profile of immunoglobulin genes and certain cytogenetic abnormalities are important prognostic indicators.

However, these advances have introduced new questions about the biology, prognosis, and management of the disease. In particular, the understanding of the function of the B-cell receptor, the nature of genetic lesions, and the balance between proliferation and apoptosis have influenced our ability to assess prognosis and manage chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Available treatments generally induce remission, though nearly all patients experience relapse, and the disease remains incurable. Advances in molecular biology have enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. Together with the development of new therapeutic agents, these advances have made the management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia more rational and effective. Unfortunately, there is no known way to prevent chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Early detection is widely practised, but it seemingly makes no difference to the patient's eventual outcome.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^1176TSAY]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Management of previously untreated CLL indicates that the vast majority of CLL patients have early-stage asymptomatic disease at diagnosis. Only those patients who meet the 2018 iWCLL criteria for initiation of therapy should be offered treatment.

- **Risk stratification**: Patients who do not meet the 2018 iWCLL criteria for therapy should undergo risk stratification according to the CLL-IPI at the time of diagnosis. Patients in the low- and intermediate-risk category of CLL-IPI, which includes about 75% of patients with a median time to first therapy of approximately 7 years, should be monitored for disease progression every 6–12 months. In contrast, patients in the high- and very high-risk CLL-IPI group, encompassing about 25% of patients with a median time to first therapy of about 2 years, should be monitored for disease progression every 3–6 months.

- **Counseling and monitoring**: Regardless of the CLL-IPI score, all patients should be counseled on (a) the increased risk of infections, particularly focusing on appropriate vaccinations according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines; (b) an increased risk of non-hematologic malignancy with recommendations to follow age-appropriate cancer screening; and (c) an increased risk of skin cancers, necessitating a yearly full body skin exam by dermatology. Patients with high- and very high-risk CLL may be offered treatment in early intervention clinical trials. The German CLL study group is conducting a phase 3 study (CLL12 trial) that randomizes patients accordingly.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, dyspnoea and "tree-in-bud" sign on chest CT scan [^1147ZGr1]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a common disorder. Patients typically present with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and marked lymphocytosis, often exceeding 100,000/μl. Although pulmonary involvement from CLL can be found in more than one-third of patients on autopsy, respiratory symptoms caused by the disease itself are not often reported. Pulmonary involvement mainly includes parenchymal infiltrates, peribronchial and perivascular infiltration, bacterial pneumonia, oedema or infarction, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy. Occasionally, patients may present with a dry cough and progressive dyspnoea, even with a low peripheral white blood cell count.

We report a case of CLL and dyspnoea at rest, with a predominant "tree-in-bud" sign on a chest computed tomography scan, and biopsy-proven bronchiolar infiltration with monoclonal lymphocytes. With bronchoalveolar lavage alone, the diagnosis would have been missed. Chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and fludarabine phosphate led to a prompt clinical and radiological improvement, with a gain in six-minute walking distance from 60 to 210 meters.

### It is feasible and safe to stop specialized follow-up of asymptomatic lower-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^117HqQL3]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

The vast majority of patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) present without an indication for treatment and are typically followed by standard-of-care (SOC) watch and wait (WW) until CLL progression or death. Specialized follow-up (sFU) of asymptomatic patients in WW usually includes physical examination and blood tests every 3 to 12 months, guided by the risk of CLL progression, including the use of the CLL International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI). However, most patients will never require CLL treatment and may therefore be subjected to endless monitoring without clinical consequence. From the patients' perspective, WW is often perceived as "watch and worry" and is associated with psychological distress related to frequent hospital visits. CLL treatment is indicated upon iwCLL criteria, and according to the international prognostic score for early-stage CLL (IPS-E), 8% and 61% of patients with low and high risk, respectively, are treated within 5 years.

Although early detection leads to improved prognoses in almost every cancer, early detection of indolent cancers such as CLL that may never require treatment will only prolong the years alive with an incurable cancer, without clear data on improved overall survival (OS) or quality of life. So far, studies of preemptive treatment in early-stage CLL have failed to improve clinically meaningful outcomes, and thus WW continues to be the SOC in asymptomatic early-stage CLL. Ending specialized surveillance for patients identified with the lowest risk of progression towards the need for treatment may be an appropriate strategy.

### A laboratory-based scoring system predicts early treatment in Rai 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^116bH9es]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical staging using the Binet and Rai classification systems provides a simple and inexpensive approach to assess prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, most patients today are diagnosed in early stages of the disease (Binet A or Rai 0) when these prognosticators fail to provide adequate risk stratification. Although similarly classified as early-stage CLL, Binet A and Rai 0 patients demonstrate heterogeneous clinical courses, ranging from normal life expectancy in the absence of any treatment to unexpectedly short progression-free intervals rapidly requiring clinical intervention.

To overcome the inherent weaknesses of clinical staging systems, other parameters have been sought and proposed by several studies as reliable prognosticators in CLL. These include immunocytogenetic and molecular markers such as deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p) and mutations of the TP53 gene, deletions of the long arm of chromosome 11 (del11q), and trisomy of chromosome 12 (tris12), the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) gene mutational status, as well as biochemical parameters such as beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) and thymidine kinase (TK), and cell surface receptors such as the integrin CD49d.

- **Novel prognostic indices**: Model systems have been developed to integrate these markers into comprehensive scoring systems, such as the CLL International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI), the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG) index, and the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) score. Although validations in the setting of early-stage CLL and/or treatment-free survival have not been detailed here, these advancements represent a significant step towards better risk stratification in CLL management.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: A report from the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia updating the National Cancer Institute-Working Group 1996 guidelines [^112MV34Z]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Standardized criteria for diagnosis and response assessment are needed to interpret and compare clinical trials and for approval of new therapeutic agents by regulatory agencies. Therefore, a National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) published guidelines for the design and conduct of clinical trials for patients with CLL in 1988, which were updated in 1996. During the past decade, considerable progress has been achieved in defining new prognostic markers, diagnostic parameters, and treatment options. This prompted the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iWCLL) to provide updated recommendations for the management of CLL in clinical trials and general practice.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^115wFVNq]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). High credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease that can be associated with a variety of clinical features, such as anemia, lymphadenopathy, hypogammaglobulinemia, and the presence of smudge cells. Patients may also present with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, leukemia cutis, and fever. Other symptoms include hepatomegaly, skin wounds, night sweats, weight loss, and the development of skin nodules. CLL is more commonly diagnosed in elderly patients.

- **Clinical manifestations**: Axillary lymphadenopathy, an increased blood lymphocyte count, elevated serum β-2 microglobulin levels, skin papules, fatigue, and skin plaques are noteworthy. Additionally, patients often exhibit a decreased platelet count, splenomegaly, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.

- **Laboratory findings**: Increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, cervical lymphadenopathy, immune thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum transaminases are also observed in individuals with CLL.

### Comparison of Rai and Binet classifications in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^112xoDid]. Hematology (1997). High credibility.

The Rai Staging System for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a clinical tool used to classify and stage patients with CLL, a type of blood and bone marrow cancer. This system is specifically applicable to patients diagnosed with CLL and helps in predicting disease progression and survival outcomes.

The Rai Staging System stratifies patients into three risk groups: low (Stage 0), intermediate (Stages I and II), and high risk (Stages III and IV), based on the presence of lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and anemia or thrombocytopenia.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to guide treatment decisions and prognosis. For instance, patients in the low-risk group may not require immediate treatment and can be closely monitored, while those in the high-risk group may require aggressive treatment.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Rai Staging System. However, it may not be as applicable or accurate in patients with atypical presentations of CLL or in those with co-existing hematological disorders.

The Rai Staging System for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) calculator assesses the risk group classification based on five clinical input parameters: enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged spleen, enlarged liver, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Based on the patient's responses to these parameters, the calculator determines the risk group and the associated overall survival expectation.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia presenting with localized gynecologic symptoms [^116wp5mP]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Although no cure exists for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), treatment can reduce morbidity and/or improve survival in advanced disease. Identification of patients in an early disease state allows monitoring and treatment as soon as appropriate. We were unable to find previous reports of early CLL disease presenting with gynecologic symptoms. This report seeks to alert gynecologists of their potential role in identifying CLL patients.

- **Case**: A 76-year-old woman presented with rectovaginal pressure. Cervical cone biopsy showed a lymphoproliferative process. Peripheral blood flow cytometry confirmed a diagnosis of early-stage CLL. The patient remains asymptomatic and is currently monitored for disease progression.

- **Conclusion**: Early CLL can present with localized gynecologic symptoms or cervical lesions. The recognition of early disease can assure optimal treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: A review [^113fHEh6]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), defined by a minimum of 5×10⁹/L monoclonal B cells in the blood, affects more than 200,000 people and is associated with approximately 4,410 deaths in the US annually. CLL is associated with an immunocompromised state and an increased rate of complications from infections.

At the time of diagnosis, the median age of patients with CLL is 70 years, and an estimated 95% of patients have at least one medical comorbidity. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients with CLL are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and one-third will never require treatment for CLL. Prognostic models have been developed to estimate the time to first treatment and overall survival. However, for patients who are asymptomatic, irrespective of disease risk category, clinical observation is the standard of care.

Patients with symptomatic disease who have bulky or progressive lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, as well as those with a low neutrophil count, anemia, or thrombocytopenia, and/or symptoms of fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss (B symptoms), should be offered treatment. For these patients, first-line treatment consists of a regimen containing either a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor (acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, or ibrutinib) or a B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor (venetoclax). There is no evidence that starting either class before the other improves outcomes. The covalent BTK inhibitors are typically used indefinitely. Survival rates are approximately 88% at 4 years for acalabrutinib and 94% at 2 years for zanubrutinib.

### Clinical presentation, progression, and outcome of patients with clonal B-cell counts of less than 5 × 10⁹/l, 5 to 10 × 10⁹/l, and more than 10 × 10⁹/l and chronic lymphocytic leukemia immunophenotype [^112hGoib]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

The flow cytometric evaluation of peripheral lymphocytosis has led to a dramatic increase in the diagnosis of early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Few studies exist to better delineate the natural history and differences between MBL and CLL.

Applying the recently updated B-lymphocyte threshold of 5 × 10⁹ B lymphocytes/L for the diagnosis of CLL, we evaluated the differences in initial presentation, disease progression, time to treatment (TTT), and 10-year overall survival rates between patients with less than 5 × 10 × 10⁹/L, 5 to 10 × 10⁹/L, and more than 10 × 10⁹/L B cells. These clinical/treatment parameters were also compared among the MBL, 5 to 10 CLL Rai stage 0, and more than 10 CLL Rai stage 0 groups.

In total, 310 patients were included, with 67 in the less than 5, 75 in the 5 to 10, and 168 in the more than 10 B-cell groups. Statistically significant differences were seen when comparing the 5 to 10 and more than 10 B-cell groups regarding anemia (P = 0.021 for median hemoglobin; p = 0.028 for anemia < 11 g/dL), platelet count (P = 0.041 for median platelet count), splenomegaly (P = 0.013), initial management plan (P = 0.012 for observation; p = 0.0021 for treatment with chemotherapy), and TTT (P = 0.0033). No statistically significant difference was seen among the MBL, 5 to 10, and more than 10 CLL Rai stage 0 groups regarding TTT and 10-year overall survival.

Findings suggest that patients with B-cell counts of 5 to 10 × 10(9)/L behave clinically more similar to patients with larger B-cell counts rather than those with smaller count thresholds.

### Early treatment with FCR versus watch and wait in patients with stage Binet A high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): A randomized phase 3 trial [^111B616y]. Leukemia (2020). High credibility.

We present data from a phase 3 trial (CLL7), which successfully implemented molecular genetic disease characteristics into a risk-tailored treatment allocation strategy for patients with stage Binet A CLL. Twenty-five percent of our ITT study population exhibited a "high-risk" disease type according to our four-factor risk assessment, and these patients clearly segregated from the low-risk group regarding all time-to-event parameters investigated, illustrated by EFS, PFS (Supplementary Fig. 3), and OS.

All four risk parameters used for our study design were chosen due to their confirmed value as prognostic factors for PFS/OS in multivariate analyses performed in the first 147 patients registered in the preceding CLL1 trial (phase 3 comparison of fludarabine vs. W&W in Binet A CLL) in 2004. In particular, we found serum levels of TK (cutoff 10 U/L) rather than beta-2-microglobulin (3.5 mg/L) to be a preferred independent prognostic factor for time-to-event outcomes in our test set analysis and therefore implemented serum TK in our study design. The parameter LDT reflects the disease dynamics and is recommended by guidelines to determine the right time a patient requires therapy. Particularly at an early disease stage, an LDT < 12 months has been identified as an independent indicator of an unfavorable prognosis. Although easily assessable in clinical practice, the parameter is not commonly documented in large trial datasets and is therefore not considered in the latest CLL scoring systems, such as the CLL-IPI.

### Tailored approaches grounded on immunogenetic features for refined prognostication in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^114yA2wT]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Despite mounting evidence for the existence of distinct biological variants of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the 2016 update of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification still considers CLL as a single, homogeneous entity. This is in contrast to other hematologic malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which are segregated into different subgroups based on the integration of genetic, morphological, immunophenotypic, and clinical features.

Since the introduction of the Rai and Binet clinical staging systems in the 1970s, it has become increasingly evident that the clinical heterogeneity in CLL is linked to and reflects the underlying biological heterogeneity. As a result, several initiatives have focused on identifying biomarkers to refine prognostication, particularly for cases presenting with early-stage disease, which now represent the majority of patients (80–85%).

Consequently, numerous prognostic indices have been proposed; however, none have been adopted in everyday clinical practice. This is partly due to the fact that different variables have been assessed in each evaluated cohort, while the actual routine diagnostic and monitoring practices vary between different institutions. Moreover, most reported cohorts were relatively small, thus inherently limited in their capacity to both encompass the remarkable clinico-biological heterogeneity of CLL and reveal possible interactions and interdependencies among the evaluated prognosticators.

The clonotypic B-cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) is a unique molecular signature.
