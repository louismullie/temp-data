## Question

A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 12-month history of upper abdominal pain. The pain is worse after eating, which she reports as 7 out of 10 in intensity. Over the last year, she has also had nausea, heartburn, and multiple episodes of diarrhea with no blood or mucus. Eight months ago, she underwent an upper endoscopy, which showed several ulcers in the gastric antrum, the pylorus, and the duodenum, as well as thick gastric folds. The biopsies from these ulcers were negative for H. pylori. Current medications include pantoprazole and over-the-counter antacids. She appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and there is tenderness to palpation in the epigastric and umbilical areas. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. A repeat upper endoscopy shows persistent gastric and duodenal ulceration with minimal bleeding. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
A. Secretin stimulation test
B. Urea breath test
C. 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring
D. Fasting serum gastrin level

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next diagnostic test for a 36-year-old woman with refractory, recurrent peptic ulcers, negative H. pylori, and ongoing symptoms despite PPI therapy, raising concern for Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits gastrinoma. Then, I should verify how PPI therapy confounds gastrin testing and what the safest way is to obtain a valid fasting gastrin. Next, I will review the diagnostic thresholds and when to add a secretin stimulation test. After that, I should consider what not to do next, including urea breath testing and pH monitoring. Finally, I will outline the broader workup once biochemical diagnosis is established, including MEN1 screening and imaging, and then state the single best next step with rationale.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture. Severe, recurrent, or atypically located peptic ulcers in the stomach and duodenum, especially when H. pylori is absent and symptoms persist despite PPIs, should prompt evaluation for Zollinger–Ellison syndrome due to a gastrinoma; the presence of diarrhea further supports this diagnosis, as chronic diarrhea is common in ZES from acid load and direct secretory effects of gastrin [^114uuRaS] [^113vL7v7] [^112sMM9X].

> Wait, let me verify the confounding effect of PPIs before ordering any test. PPIs raise fasting serum gastrin by 2–3 fold on average, and secretin stimulation can be falsely positive if antisecretory therapy is on board; therefore, to avoid a false-positive diagnosis, gastrin should be measured fasting and off PPI for at least a week, with H2 blockers held for 48 hours if feasible, while balancing the risk of uncontrolled acid hypersecretion during the washout period [^115bZ5m9] [^112j3vvg] [^1117MFrC] [^113ccr9g].

> Hold on, I should verify the exact testing sequence. The first-line diagnostic test is a fasting serum gastrin obtained after withholding PPIs for more than 1 week; a value greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal in the context of gastric acid hypersecretion is essentially diagnostic of ZES, whereas values less than 10 times ULN are indeterminate and require a secretin stimulation test to confirm autonomous gastrin release from a tumor, with a positive rise greater than 110 pg/mL over baseline supporting gastrinoma [^114uuRaS] [^113vL7v7] [^111ug6uy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to go straight to a secretin test now, but that would be premature. The secretin stimulation test is the correct confirmatory study when fasting gastrin is equivocal, not the initial screening test; it should be performed off PPIs to avoid a false-positive result, and it helps distinguish gastrinoma from other causes of hypergastrinemia such as atrophic gastritis or retained antrum, which can also elevate gastrin but do not show a paradoxical gastrin rise after secretin [^114uuRaS] [^113vL7v7] [^1117MFrC].

> I need to ensure I exclude common mimics before labeling this as ZES. Negative H. pylori biopsies reduce the likelihood of infection-related ulcer disease, but I should still consider autoimmune atrophic gastritis and retained antrum as alternative causes of hypergastrinemia; measuring gastric pH and reviewing endoscopic biopsies for atrophy and ECL cell changes can help differentiate these entities when gastrin is only modestly elevated, reserving secretin testing for cases with strong clinical suspicion despite intermediate gastrin values [^114uuRaS] [^113vL7v7] [^116oZ6e9].

> Let me consider what not to do next. A urea breath test is inappropriate here because H. pylori has already been excluded by prior biopsies and repeating it would not explain refractory ulcers; 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring addresses reflux, not acid hypersecretion from a gastrinoma, and would not help establish the diagnosis in this context [^114uuRaS].

> Next, I should review the broader workup once biochemical diagnosis is established. If fasting gastrin is markedly elevated or secretin testing is positive, I should proceed with cross-sectional imaging using contrast-enhanced multiphasic CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis, consider endoscopic ultrasound for small duodenal or pancreatic primaries, and evaluate for MEN1 with serum calcium, PTH, and prolactin, followed by genetic counseling and testing when indicated, given the frequency of duodenal gastrinomas and hereditary syndromes [^114uuRaS] [^111prWpE] [^114wp5ae].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is to obtain a fasting serum gastrin level after holding PPI therapy for at least 1 week, using H2 blockers short term if needed for symptom control, and then proceeding to a secretin stimulation test if gastrin is equivocally elevated to confirm autonomous gastrin secretion consistent with gastrinoma [^114uuRaS] [^113vL7v7] [^1117MFrC].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **measure a fasting serum gastrin level** [^114uuRaS] after stopping PPIs for at least 1 week [^112j3vvg] to evaluate for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) [^113vL7v7], given the patient's refractory, recurrent ulcers and negative H. pylori testing. If the fasting gastrin is elevated (> 10 times normal), a **secretin stimulation test** [^111ug6uy] should be performed to confirm the diagnosis [^113vL7v7]. Urea breath testing is not indicated because H. pylori was already excluded, and 24-hour pH monitoring is not helpful for gastrinoma evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for refractory peptic ulcer disease with negative H. pylori testing includes:

- **Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES)**: A gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumor causing severe acid hypersecretion, multiple ulcers, and diarrhea [^113vL7v7].

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use**: Even minimal or intermittent use can cause ulcers.

- **Crohn's disease**: Can involve the stomach and duodenum, causing ulcers.

- **Idiopathic gastric acid hypersecretion**: Rare, but possible [^116j8w44].

Given the clinical presentation — multiple refractory ulcers, diarrhea, and negative H. pylori testing — ZES is high on the differential and should be **prioritized** [^114uuRaS].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Step 1: fasting serum gastrin level

Key differences include:

| **Aspect** | **Fasting serum gastrin level** | **Secretin stimulation test** |
|-|-|-|
| Rationale | The initial screening test for ZES is a fasting serum gastrin level [^113vL7v7]. Elevated gastrin (> 10 times normal) in the setting of acid hypersecretion is highly suggestive of ZES [^113vL7v7] | If the fasting gastrin is elevated but not diagnostic (5–10 times normal), a secretin stimulation test is indicated to confirm ZES [^113vL7v7] |
| Protocol | PPIs should be discontinued for at least 1 week prior to testing to avoid false-positive results [^112j3vvg] [^114uuRaS]. If PPIs cannot be stopped, H2 blockers can be used temporarily [^115a8FyC] | Administer secretin intravenously (2 units/kg) and measure gastrin at baseline and at 2, 5, 10, and 15 minutes. A rise in gastrin > 120 pg/mL above baseline is diagnostic of ZES [^114ZPvC7] |
| Interpretation | A fasting gastrin level > 10 times normal (typically > 1000 pg/mL) in the presence of gastric acid hypersecretion (gastric pH < 2) is diagnostic of ZES [^113vL7v7] | A positive secretin test confirms autonomous gastrin secretion from a gastrinoma [^113vL7v7] |

---

### Step 3: imaging studies

If ZES is confirmed biochemically, **localization imaging** is indicated:

- **Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**: High sensitivity for detecting small duodenal and pancreatic gastrinomas [^notfound].

- **Cross-sectional imaging**: Multiphasic CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis [^111prWpE].

- **Somatostatin receptor-based imaging (SSTR-PET)**: Useful for detecting occult or metastatic disease [^notfound].

---

## Why other options are not appropriate

- **Urea breath test**: Not indicated as H. pylori has already been excluded by biopsy [^notfound].

- **24-hour esophageal pH monitoring**: Useful for GERD evaluation, but not for gastrinoma diagnosis [^notfound].

- **Secretin stimulation test without fasting gastrin**: Premature; should only be performed if fasting gastrin is elevated but not diagnostic [^113vL7v7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is to **measure a fasting serum gastrin level** [^114uuRaS] after stopping PPIs for at least 1 week [^112j3vvg]. If elevated (> 10 times normal), a secretin stimulation test should be performed to confirm ZES [^notfound]. This approach aligns with current guidelines and ensures accurate diagnosis and management of refractory peptic ulcer disease [^111prWpE].

Objective: To investigate the effect of age and gender on basal and food-stimulated serum calcitonin (CT), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and gastrin levels among healthy adults. Methods: Ninety-six healthy adults (76 men and 20 women) aged between 21 and 43 years were recruited. Serum CT, PTH, and gastrin levels were measured after a 9-hour overnight fast, and 1 and 3 hours postprandially. Results: PTH levels decreased early and increased late after feeding. This change was significant in men but not in women. CT levels increased in response to food intake in men but not in women. Gastrin levels were significantly increased after feeding in both men and women. Mean basal and food stimulated CT, PTH, and gastrin levels did not significantly differ between genders. Fasting and post-prandial PTH levels were higher while gastrin levels were lower in older subjects (> 30 years old) compared to younger subjects (≤ 30 years old). Fasting and postprandial CT levels were not significantly different between age groups. Conclusion: Age had a significant effect on fasting and food-stimulated PTH and gastrin hormone levels. The effect of age on PTH levels was independent of baseline vitamin D levels. Men showed significant changes in CT and PTH levels in response to feeding compared to women, although the mean hormone levels were not significantly different between men and women.

Gastrin level measurement

Gastrin level were measured at two time points: First, from blood sample obtained from the patient after 8 h fast, and second, from blood samples obtained one hour after a small meal.

Patient and public involvement

Both patients were selected for genetic testing of the ICR and PERCC1 based on their chronic intestinal failure for which no cause had been identified. The rationale, risks and benefits of this targeted genetic testing was discussed with the patients and (for the minor patient) their parents. Following identification of the point mutation, patients and parents participated in discussions with the clinical team regarding best next steps from both a clinical and research perspective, thus leading to measurement of fasting and post-prandial serum gastrin levels, and the joint decision to publish these cases in a journal and present the findings for discussion at conferences with the wider medical community.

Serum Gastrin Effects

Fasting serum gastrin levels were assessed in two double-blind studies of the acute healing of EE in which 682 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) received 10, 20, or 40 mg of pantoprazole sodium for up to 8 weeks. At 4 weeks of treatment there was an increase in mean gastrin levels of 7%, 35%, and 72% over pretreatment values in the 10, 20, and 40 mg treatment groups, respectively. A similar increase in serum gastrin levels was noted at the 8-week visit with mean increases of 3%, 26%, and 84% for the three pantoprazole dose groups. Median serum gastrin levels remained within normal limits during maintenance therapy with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets.

In long-term international studies involving over 800 patients, a 2 to 3 fold mean increase from the pretreatment fasting serum gastrin level was observed in the initial months of treatment with pantoprazole at doses of 40 mg per day during GERD maintenance studies and 40 mg or higher per day in patients with refractory GERD. Fasting serum gastrin levels generally remained at approximately 2 to 3 times baseline for up to 4 years of periodic follow-up in clinical trials.

### Prognostic value of initial fasting serum gastrin levels in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome [^115ekSjr]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the value of the initial fasting serum gastrin (FSG) at presentation in patients with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES) in predicting primary tumor characteristics and survival.

Patients and Methods

A total of 239 patients were treated for ZES between December 1981 and September 1998, with a mean follow-up of 9.1 ± 0.6 years. At initial evaluation, 86 patients (36%) had mild (0 to 499 pg/mL), 61 (25.5%) had moderate (500 to 1,000 pg/mL), and 92 (38.5%) had severe (> 1,000 pg/mL) elevations in FSG. Primary tumor location and size, presence of lymph node or hepatic metastases, and survival were analyzed based on the level of initial FSG.

Results

In patients with sporadic ZES, but not in those with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) and ZES, there was a significant relationship between the level of initial FSG and tumor size and location of primary tumor, frequency of lymph node and liver metastases, and survival. The median 5- and 10-year survival decreased with increasing initial FSG (P < .001) in patients with sporadic ZES; MEN-1 patients lived longer than sporadic ZES patients (P = 0.012), and survival in this group was not associated with the level of initial FSG. Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with death from disease in patients with sporadic ZES were liver metastases (P = 0.0001), a pancreatic site (P = 0.0027), and primary tumor size (P = 0.011) but not initial FSG (P > .30).

Conclusion

The severity of FSG at presentation is associated with size and site of tumor and the presence of hepatic metastases, factors that are significant independent predictors of outcome. The level of FSG at presentation may be useful in planning the nature and extent of the initial evaluation and management in patients with sporadic ZES.

### Cholecystokinin: clinical aspects of the new biology [^112HDbUn]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurement of CCK

It is obvious that progress in understanding the basic CCK biology as well as the roles of CCK in pathophysiology, diagnostics, and therapy has been and henceforth will have to be based on reliable measurements. So far, such reliability has been a problem. Therefore, a comment about the premises for accuracy of CCK assays and about the methods required to obtain the desired accuracy:

Assay premises

CCK is a most, if not the most, difficult peptide system to measure accurately in biological fluids, particularly so in plasma. The difficulty is caused by the biochemistry of CCK: first, the molecular heterogeneity with different peptides (CCK‐58, ‐33, ‐22, and ‐8) requires assays that measure these forms with equimolar potency. Second, the concentrations of CCK peptides in circulation are very low for a hormone. In mammals, the concentrations in fasting are often femtomolar. After meals, they increase to a few picomolar levels (3–5 pM). Measurement of these levels require high‐affinity antibodies in the immunoassays. Third, the related sister hormone, gastrin (Fig. 2), circulates in 10‐fold higher concentrations in plasma. Consequently, far most antibodies raised for immunoassays against CCK will cross‐react with gastrin peptides. Finally, the high protein concentrations in plasma may interfere unspecifically with immunoassay measurements. Therefore, preanalytical extraction from protein‐rich fluids is necessary.

### Vonoprazan fumarate (Voquezna) [^112PT9LE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Serum Gastrin Effects

The effect of vonoprazan on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in clinical trials for the healing of erosive esophagitis, maintenance of healed erosive esophagitis, and relief of heartburn associated with non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In patients with erosive esophagitis treated with VOQUEZNA 20 mg once daily, the mean fasting gastrin levels at Week 2 increased from baseline and levels were similar at Week 2 and Week 8. During maintenance treatment for healed erosive esophagitis with VOQUEZNA 10 mg once daily, the mean gastrin levels remained elevated and returned to normal within 4 weeks of discontinuation of treatment.

In patients with non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease treated with VOQUEZNA 10 mg once daily, the mean fasting gastrin levels increased from baseline, remained elevated during treatment, and returned to normal within 4 weeks of discontinuation of treatment.

Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum CgA levels. The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Enterochromaffin-Like Cell (ECL) Effects

Human gastric biopsy specimens were obtained from 135 patients treated with vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg once daily for up to 260 weeks. An increase in the incidence of hyperplasia of the parietal cells and G-cells was observed, which is consistent with the pharmacological action of a potassium-competitive acid blocker. No neoplastic changes were observed [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1), (13.2)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Steady state pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg following once daily administration and vonoprazan 20 mg following twice daily administration from data collected across multiple studies are summarized in Table 12.

4.1.1 Risk stratification

As smaller PanNETs are increasingly identified because of more sensitive imaging techniques, the main challenge is accurate risk stratification to assess which patients or which tumours are most at risk for adverse outcomes and therefore should undergo more aggressive treatment and surveillance. In the last decade, much evidence was gained regarding this topic, but true personalized risk‐based treatment and surveillance is unfortunately not yet possible.

Several research groups have reported genotype–phenotype correlations with specific genotypes associated with a more aggressive dpNET‐related natural course (Table S1). However, either these results could not be validated in independent cohorts, or this has not yet been attempted, therefore these associations presently cannot guide clinical practice.

In NF‐PanNETs important 'classical' risk factors for (distant) metastases are tumour size (risk increasing with increasing size) and tumour grade (higher risk in WHO grade 2 tumours). Significant tumour growth while under surveillance is also considered a risk factor.

In gastrinomas, which are duodenal in origin and usually small, regional lymph node metastases are found in up to 80% at diagnosis, although they do not seem to have a negative impact on overall survival. In two independent studies, age, level of fasting serum gastrin (FSG), size of (coexisting) PanNETs and liver metastasis were associated with aggressive tumour growthand decreased survival of patientswith an MEN1‐related gastrinoma. Overall 5‐ and 10‐year survival rates of patients with a gastrinoma in the DMSG cohort were 83% and 65% respectively, significantly worse compared to age‐ and gender‐matchedpatients with MEN1 without gastrinoma.

Recent data from the GTE have also provided more insight in factors associated with the development of PanNET and gastrinoma related distant metastases and death. They identified PanNET size > 2 cm and age > 40 as independently associated with the development of distant metastases and death. Patients with Zollinger‐Ellison syndrome (ZES) had an increased risk of developing distant metastases, but when distant metastases developed an increased risk of death was not seen in this subgroup.

### Esomeprazole sodium [^116W4mpj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Serum Gastrin Effects

The effect of esomeprazole on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in approximately 2,700 patients in clinical trials of oral esomeprazole for up to 8 weeks and in over 1,300 patients treated for up to 12 months. The mean fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner. The increase in serum gastrin concentrations reached a plateau within two to three months of therapy and returned to baseline levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cell Effects

There are no data available on the effects of intravenous esomeprazole on ECL cells.

Human gastric biopsy specimens have been obtained from more than 3,000 patients (both children and adults) treated orally with omeprazole in long-term clinical trials. The incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia has been found in these patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

In over 1,000 patients treated with oral esomeprazole (10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg/day) for up to 12 months, the prevalence of ECL cell hyperplasia increased with time and dose. No patient developed ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia in the gastric mucosa.

Endocrine Effects

Esomeprazole had no effect on thyroid function when given in oral doses of 20 mg or 40 mg for 4 weeks. Other effects of esomeprazole on the endocrine system were assessed in studies of omeprazole. Oral doses of omeprazole 30 mg or 40 mg per day for 2 to 4 weeks had no effect on carbohydrate metabolism, circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin.

### All you need to know about gastrinoma today | Gastrinoma and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: a thorough update [^113vL7v7]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a distinct syndrome characterized by hyperchlorhydria-induced peptic ulcer disease and chronic diarrhea. It is the result of a gastrin-excess state caused by a duodenal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor referred to as gastrinoma. This gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumor is usually sporadic in nature, or part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome. The high rate of malignancy associated with gastrinomas substantiates the need for early diagnosis. In order to diagnose ZES with laboratory tests, patients under antacid medication are required to stay off proton pump inhibitors for at least oneweek and H2 receptor antagonists for 48h. Fasting serum gastrin level measurement serves as an initial and fundamental diagnostic test, boasting a sensitivity of 99%. Gastrinoma patients will present with a gastrin level greater than 100pg/mL, while a serum gastrin level higher than 1000pg/mL, in the presence of gastric pH < 2, is considered diagnostic. Since more common causes of hypergastrinemia exist in the setting of hypochlorhydria, ruling those out should precede ZES consideration. Such causes include atrophic gastritis, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-associated pangastritis, renal failure, vagotomy, gastric outlet obstruction and retained antrum syndrome. The secretin stimulation test and the calcium gluconate injection test represent classic adjuvant diagnostic techniques, while alternative approaches are currently being introduced and evaluated. Specifically, the secretin stimulation test aids in differentiating ZES cases from other hypergastrinemic states. Its principle is based on secretin stimulation of gastrinoma cells to secrete gastrin, while inhibiting normal G cells. The rapid intravenous infusion of 4μg/kg secretin over 1min is followed by gastrin level evaluation at specific intervals post-infusion. Localization of the primary tumor and its metastases is the next diagnostic step when gastrinoma-associated ZES is either suspected or biochemically confirmed. Endoscopic ultrasound has showcased sensitivity as high as 83% for pancreatic gastrinomas and is considered the primary modality in such cases, although its tumor detection rates are substantially lower in duodenal lesions. Gallium-68 radiotracers, especially DOTATOC with positron emission tomography, are currently setting the standard in tumor localization, enhancing traditional imaging techniques and showcasing high sensitivity and specificity. Although gastrinomas have been reported in various anatomic locations, the vast majority arise in a specific site named the "gastrinoma triangle", involving parts of the duodenum, pancreas and extra-hepatic biliary system. Proton pump inhibitors serve as the cornerstone of symptomatic ZES treatment. Surgery is routinely performed in localized sporadic ZES, irrespective of imaging results. ZES in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 requires work-up for evaluation and treatment of hyperparathyroidism, while surgery might be an option for selected cases. In cases of advanced and metastatic disease, there is a variety of potential treatments, ranging for somatostatin analogs to chemotherapeutic drugs, liver-directed therapies and liver transplantation, while neither hepatic metastases, nor locally invasive disease necessarily preclude surgical management. This article thoroughly and critically reviews available literature and provides an extensive and multidimensional overview of ZES, along with current controversies regarding management of this disease.

### Esomeprazole magnesium (Nexium) [^114XbX9a]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Esomeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole is protonated and converted in the acidic compartment of the parietal cell forming the active inhibitor, the achiral sulphenamide. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, esomeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Antisecretory Activity

Adults

The effect of esomeprazole on intragastric pH was determined in adult patients with symptomatic GERD in two separate studies. In the first study of 36 patients, NEXIUM 40 mg and 20 mg delayed-release capsules were administered once daily over 5 days as shown in Table 5:

In a second study, the effect on intragastric pH of NEXIUM 40 mg delayed-release capsules administered once daily over a five-day period was similar to the first study, (% time with pH > 4 was 68% or 16.3 hours).

Pediatrics

In infants (1 to 11 months old, inclusive) with GERD given NEXIUM for delayed-release oral suspension 1 mg/kg once daily, the percent time with intragastric pH > 4 increased from 29% at baseline to 69% on Day 7, which is similar to the pharmacodynamic effect in adults.

Serum Gastrin Effects

The effect of esomeprazole on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in approximately 2,700 patients in clinical trials of oral esomeprazole for up to 8 weeks and in over 1,300 patients for up to 12 months. The mean fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner. The increase in serum gastrin concentrations reached a plateau within two to three months of therapy and returned to baseline levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

### Gastrointestinal-renal axis: role in the regulation of blood pressure [^1124dsjc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The importance of gastrin in the regulation of sodium excretion and blood pressure is also supported by the gastrin (Gast) gene‐deficient mice (Gast −/−). Gast −/− mice do not increase their sodium excretion after ingestion of sodium and develop salt‐sensitive hypertension. 145 We and others have reported the diuretic and natriuretic effects of gastrin in both rats and humans. 11, 74, 134, 146 This may be related to the ability of gastrin to inhibit Na + ‐K + ‐ATPase and NHE3 activities in RPT cells. 11, 75, 147 Moreover, the inhibition of renal sodium transport by gastrin may be tissue specific because gastrin increases H + ‐K + ‐ATPase activity in gastric parietal cells. 148 Our studies also showed that the diuretic and natriuretic effects of gastrin, as well as its inhibitory effect on Na + ‐K + ‐ATPase activity, are lost in SHRs, suggesting that aberrant regulation of gastrin on the natriuresis may have a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. 11, 149 The fasting serum gastrin levels are similar in normotensive and hypertensive adults; however, the increase of serum gastrin levels is higher in the latter group than in the former group after a mixed meal. 107

### Human secretin (Chirhostim) [^111ug6uy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Stimulation of Gastrin Secretion to Aid in the Diagnosis of Gastrinoma:

Preparation:

Instruct patients to fast for at least 12 hours prior to beginning the test.

Sample Collection:

Before administering ChiRhoStim®, draw two blood samples for determination of fasting serum gastrin levels (baseline values).
Administer ChiRhoStim®at a dose of 0.4 mcg/kg of body weight intravenously over 1 minute [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Collect post-injection blood samples after 1, 2, 5, 10, and 30 minutes for determination of serum gastrin concentrations.

Sample Interpretation:

Gastrinoma is strongly suspected in patients who show an increase in serum gastrin concentration of more than 110 picograms (pg) per mL over baseline levels on any of the post injection samples.

Stimulation of Pancreatic Secretions to Facilitate the Identification of the Ampulla of Vater and Accessory Papilla During Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP):

When difficulty is encountered by the endoscopist in identifying the ampulla of Vater or in identifying the accessory papilla in patients with pancreas divisum:

Administer ChiRhoStim®at a dose of 0.2 mcg/kg of body weight intravenously over 1 minute [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
Visible excretion of pancreatic fluid from the orifices of these papillae will enable their identification and facilitate cannulation.

To avoid an incorrect stimulation test result, discontinue the following drugs for the recommended amount of time prior to administration of ChiRhoStim®:

anticholinergic drugs: at least 5 half-lives. (2.1, 5.1, 7.1)
H2-receptor antagonists: at least 2 days. (2.1, 5.2, 7.2)
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): consult the prescribing information for specific PPIs. (2.1, 5.2, 7.2)

The recommended dosage by indication is shown in the table:

Determine the number of vials to be reconstituted based on the patient's weight and prescribed dose (2.2)
ChiRhoStim® must be reconstituted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection prior to administration (2.2)

### Gastrin, Helicobacter pylori, and colorectal adenomas [^112qcsmt]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Hypergastrinemia and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection have been associated with an increased risk for colorectal neoplasia in some studies. However, data from large prospective studies of both associations are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether serum gastrin levels and/or infection with Hp are associated with the subsequent development of colorectal adenomas.

Methods

Subjects (all with a history of adenoma formation) were drawn from 2 previously completed adenoma chemoprevention trials. Participants underwent clearing colonoscopy at baseline with follow-up colonoscopy 1 and 4 years after enrollment. We used commercially available assays on fasting blood specimens to measure serum gastrin levels and Hp serologies 1 year after randomization. Risk ratios for adenoma and advanced adenoma development during the subsequent 3 years were computed by generalized linear regression.

Results

Of the 1794 subjects randomized in the 2 trials, 685 had available serum and were included in the analyses. Gastrin levels were significantly higher in the 239 subjects with Hp titers indicating infection (mean, 88.3 pg/mL) than in those not infected (mean, 73.9 pg/mL; P < .001). In fully adjusted models, gastrin levels were not associated with incident adenoma development (risk ratio [RR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–1.54) or advanced adenoma formation (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.33–2.03). A positive Hp serology was associated with a decreased risk for adenoma formation (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.96).

Conclusions

Neither hypergastrinemia nor serologic evidence of Hp infection were associated with an increased risk for recurrent adenoma development. These results do not support the notion that gastrin promotes colorectal carcinogenesis, at least at the stage of adenoma development.

### Clinical practice guidelines for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [^115TKKuD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Men1-associated Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) — diagnosis and localization are based on demonstrating an increased fasting serum gastric concentration with hyperacidity (gastric pH, < 2), and ZES in MEN1 is linked to primary hyperparathyroidism such that correction of hypercalcemia can improve disease manifestations; imaging with ultrasonography, endoscopic ultrasonography, CT, MRI, selective abdominal angiography, or somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy is helpful, a selective arterial secretagogue injection (SASI) test may help localize the gastrinoma, and intraarterial calcium injection with hepatic venous gastrin sampling can regionalize gastrinomas. Successful treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism with restoration of normocalcemia will significantly ameliorate clinical symptoms and biochemical abnormalities in as many as 20% of MEN1 patients with ZES.

### New developments in gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms [^113xhsmX]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Development of Potential Novel g-NEN Biomarkers

Biomarkers are important adjuncts in the treatment and follow-up of patients with many diseases. For example, the measurement of secretory markers such as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and vasoactive intestinal peptide can be very helpful in monitoring the success of therapy in patients who have specific functional pancreatic NETs. However, a clinically useful universal g-NEN biomarker which identifies both functional and non-functional tumours, which correlates with disease aggressiveness or progress and which is useful for diagnosis and surveillance does not currently exist. Currently employed serum g-NEN biomarkers such as gastrin and chromogranin A concentrations are unfortunately largely ineffective. For example, elevated fasting serum gastrin concentrations are non-specific, and hypergastrinaemia can result from chronic atrophic gastritis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, persistent Helicobacter pylori infection and patients taking proton pump inhibitors. The combination of low pepsinogen I/II ratio with high gastrin levels has therefore been proposed as more specific method to characterise and risk stratify patients who have autoimmune atrophic gastritis and type I g-NENs. Measurement of serum chromogranin A concentration also has significant clinical limitations, particularly its lack of sensitivity in determining tumour stage and location, but the results can also be influenced by the specific assay that is used, limiting direct comparison of results that have been obtained at different laboratories. These limitations have led to interest in developing novel biomarkers for g-NENs. This includes the development of potential novel immunohistochemical biomarkers, as these have been shown to provide valuable prognostic and predictive information in other tumour types.

### Randomised clinical trial: 3-year interim analysis results of the VISION trial to evaluate the long-term safety of vonoprazan as maintenance treatment in patients with erosive oesophagitis [^113Fnehs]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Schedule of assessments

At the start of the healing phase, patient demographics, medical history and prior drug treatment were assessed, and H. pylori urea breath (after initial endoscopy) and CYP2C19 genotype were tested. Endoscopy was scheduled at weeks 0, 4 and 8 of the healing phase, and at weeks 48, 108, 156, 204, and 260 of the maintenance phase. The gastric biopsy for histopathological evaluation of the gastric mucosa and of gastritis (undertaken centrally by two pathologists specialised in gastrointestinal histopathology) was scheduled at week 0 of the healing phase and at weeks 48, 108, 156, 204, and 260 of the maintenance phase. At week 0, the biopsy sample was collected from the fundic gland region of the mid-greater curvature of the stomach and vestibular curvature within 2 cm of the pyloric ring. At subsequent timepoints, samples were collected near the Week 0 biopsy site. The presence or absence of H. pylori was determined by Giemsa staining and the evaluation of endocrine cells was determined by immunostaining with chromogranin A. Fasting serum gastrin, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory tests, medication adherence, concomitant drugs, and AEs were assessed at every visit in the healing phase after week 0 and every visit from week 12 onwards in the maintenance phase. AEs of interest included diarrhoea, gastrointestinal infections, bone fracture and pneumonia. Measurement of fasting levels of serum pepsinogen I and II and serum chromogranin A levels was scheduled at weeks 0, 4 and 8 of the healing phase, and at weeks 24, 48, 108, 156, 204, and 260 of the maintenance phase. Serum samples were collected under fasted conditions (after at least 10 h of fasting) preferably at the same time of the day for each patient. Analysis was performed at a central laboratory test measurement institution.

### Gastrin protects against myocardial ischemia / reperfusion injury via activation of RISK (reperfusion injury salvage kinase) and SAFE (survivor activating factor enhancement) pathways [^111s221g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Increased postprandial gastrin levels have been associated with a postprandial decrease of blood pressure in hypertensive patients. 7 Moreover, in hypertensive patients, fasting serum gastrin levels were inversely correlated with blood pressure, suggesting that gastrin is involved in the regulation of blood pressure. 7, 32 Our laboratory found that the intrarenal infusion of gastrin induces natriuresis and diuresis. 8 Similarly, increased plasma gastrin concentrations have also been reported in patients with acute myocardial infarction 13; however, the pathophysiological significance of the phenomenon is not well characterized. Some studies have suggested that the increased gastrin level might represent an adaptive response to hypoxic conditions, 14 because similar adaptive responses have been detected in gut cancer. 51, 52 The results of the present study confirm the protective effect of elevated blood levels of gastrin against IRI. To make sure that the effect of gastrin on myocardial IRI is not limited to only animal experiments, we surveyed unstable angina pectoris patients after PCI who may have suffered myocardial IRI during balloon dilatation. We found that patients with higher gastrin levels had lower cardiac injury, which indicates a potential protective effect of gastrin on cardiomyocytes in PCI patients.

Collectively, our findings showed that increased levels of plasma gastrin in patients with myocardial infarction may play a protective effect against IRI. The activation of the RISK and SAFE pathways could trigger prosurvival and antiapoptotic effects to prevent myocardial cell death from the onset of acute myocardial infarction.

Adults

The effect of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules on intragastric pH was determined in adult patients with symptomatic GERD in two separate studies. In the first study of 36 patients, esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg and 20 mg capsules were administered once daily over 5 days as shown in Table 5:

In a second study, the effect on intragastric pH of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg administered once daily over a five-day period was similar to the first study, (% time with pH > 4 was 68% or 16.3 hours).

Serum Gastrin Effects

The effect of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in approximately 2,700 patients in clinical trials of oral esomeprazole for up to 8 weeks and in over 1,300 patients for up 12 months. The mean fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner. This increase in serum gastrin concentrations reached a plateau within two to three months of therapy and returned to baseline levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

### Guidelines for the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (including carcinoid) tumours (NETs) [^115a8FyC]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

The laboratory diagnosis of gastrinoma may be difficult. Both gastrin and CgA are raised in gastrinoma. However, both gastrin and CgA are also raised in many common conditions, particularly when gastric acid is reduced or absent — for example, in patients with atrophic gastritis or in those receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and gastric biopsy is always required to differentiate gastrinoma from atrophic gastritis; secretin stimulation and intragastric pH may also be needed in some cases.

When circulating gastrin and CgA are raised, a fasting specimen is required; autoimmune atrophic gastritis must be excluded, and Helicobactor pylori should be eradicated. Recurrent peptic ulcer disease, especially with gastrointestinal bleeding in the absence of H pylori, gives a strong suspicion of gastrinoma. PPIs and H 2 antagonists raise both circulating CgA and gastrin (online appendix 2). PPIs should be withdrawn with great caution and ideally stopped 10 days to 2 weeks before any planned estimation of circulating fasting gastrin. In patients with suspected gastrinoma, oral H 2 antagonists may be used instead for this period, but it is advisable for these to also be interrupted 48 h before the test. Patients with a gastrinoma should be advised that it is dangerous to stop PPIs without supervision. Where a question regarding the diagnosis remains, a secretin test may be performed, with or without gastric acid studies.

Patients with gastrinoma may present with circulating gastrin < 10% above the reference range. The majority of gastrinomas are located in the duodenum rather than in the pancreas.

All patients with gastrinoma should be considered as candidates for MEN1 syndrome. Fasting calcium, parathyroid hormone and prolactin measurements should be made.

Insulinoma may be difficult to diagnose, as circulating insulin concentrations are often within the reference range in these patients. The insulin level, however, will be inappropriate to the blood glucose. Measurement of C peptide or pro-insulin is helpful. The majority of insulinomas are benign, and CgA will not be raised unless the tumour is metastatic. A 48–72 h fast under hospital supervision with serial blood glucose analysis is the gold standard diagnostic tool and will usually trigger hypoglycaemia within 24 h. In ∼5% of patients, however, the hypoglycaemia may only be revealed postprandially.

### Pantoprazole improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116GUMY3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Proton pump inhibitors, by elevating plasma gastrin, can influence glucose-insulin homeostasis. Because there are no controlled clinical trials, the present study was planned to evaluate the effect of pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, on glucose-insulin homeostasis in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

Research Design and Methods

IN this 12-wk, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with T2DM were allocated to either the pantoprazole or placebo treatment in an equal ratio. Alterations in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and gastrin were measured at baseline and at 12 wk.

Results

Thirty-one eligible patients were randomized to receive either the pantoprazole (n = 16) or placebo (n = 15). Twelve weeks of pantoprazole therapy significantly increased plasma gastrin and insulin levels and improved β-cell function (P < 0.05 for all parameters), along with a significant decrease in HbA1c (7.6 ± 1.17 to 6.8 ± 1.16; P < 0.001). The decrease in HbA1c correlated with an increase in gastrin and insulin (r = 0.54, P = 0.010; and r = 0.67, P = 0.01, respectively).

Conclusions

Pantoprazole therapy increases plasma gastrin and insulin levels, thereby improving the glycemic control in T2DM. The effect of pantoprazole on glucose-insulin homeostasis requires further study.

### Elevated serum gastrin is associated with a history of advanced neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus [^111kdoaR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are frequently prescribed to patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE), but in a subset, they can induce significant hypergastrinemia. Elevated levels of gastrin have been associated with tumorigenic effects in a number of gastrointestinal cancers. We decided to investigate the association between serum gastrin levels and dysplasia in BE.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional study and enrolled patients with BE without dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), or adenocarcinoma (AC), as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease controls, all chronically taking PPIs. Fasting serum gastrin was measured, and data were collected on patient characteristics, medication use, and the highest degree of BE neoplasia.

Results

A total of 95 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 64.7 (± 10.0) years, and 70.5% were male. The median serum gastrin level was 40 pM. There was no significant difference in gastrin levels with increased degrees of BE neoplasia (overall P = 0.68). In multivariable analysis, the highest quartile of gastrin was associated with significantly increased odds of advanced neoplasia (HGD or AC) (odds ratio (OR): 5.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20–24.8).

Conclusions

In BE patients taking PPIs, an elevated serum gastrin is associated with a history of HGD or AC. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether patients with nondysplastic BE and elevated serum gastrin are at increased risk for neoplastic progression.

### Esomeprazole strontium [^112KcXff]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. The S- and R-isomers of omeprazole are protonated and converted in the acidic compartment of the parietal cell forming the active inhibitor, the achiral sulphenamide. By acting specifically on the proton pump, esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity. This effect is dose-related up to a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg and leads to inhibition of gastric acid secretion.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Antisecretory Activity

The effect of esomeprazole magnesium on intragastric pH was determined in patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease in two separate studies. In the first study of 36 patients, 44.6 mg of esomeprazole magnesium (equivalent to 40 mg of esomeprazole) and 22.3 mg of esomeprazole magnesium (equivalent to 20 mg of esomeprazole) were administered over 5 days. The results are shown in Table 3:

In a second study, the effect on intragastric pH of esomeprazole magnesium 44.6 mg administered once daily over a five-day period was similar to the first study, (% time with pH > 4 was 68% or 16.3 hours).

Serum Gastrin Effects

The effect of esomeprazole magnesium on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in approximately 2,700 patients in clinical trials up to 8 weeks and in over 1,300 patients for up to 6 to 12 months. The mean fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner. This increase reached a plateau within two to three months of therapy and returned to baseline levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

### Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium (vimovo) [^115H4hrs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Interaction with Aspirin

In a healthy volunteer study, 10 days of concomitant administration of naproxen 220 mg once-daily with low-dose immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) showed an interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin as measured by % serum thromboxane B2inhibition at 24 hours following the day 10 dose [98.7% (aspirin alone) vs 93.1% (naproxen and aspirin)]. The interaction was observed even following discontinuation of naproxen on day 11 (while aspirin dose was continued) but normalized by day 13. In the same study, the interaction was greater when naproxen was administered 30 minutes prior to aspirin [98.7% vs 87.7%] and minimal when aspirin was administered 30 minutes prior to naproxen [98.7% vs 95.4%].

Following administration of naproxen 220 mg twice-daily with low-dose immediate-release aspirin (first naproxen dose given 30 minutes prior to aspirin), the interaction was minimal at 24 h following day 10 dose [98.7% vs 95.7%]. However, the interaction was more prominent after discontinuation of naproxen (washout) on day 11 [98.7% vs 84.3%] and did not normalize completely by day 13 [98.5% vs 90.7%] [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Antisecretory Activity

The effect of VIMOVO on intragastric pH was determined in 25 healthy volunteers in one study. Three VIMOVO combinations (naproxen 500 mg combined with either esomeprazole 10, 20, or 30 mg) were administered twice daily over 9 days. The results are shown in the following table:

Serum Gastrin Effects

The effect of esomeprazole on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in approximately 2,700 patients in clinical trials up to 8 weeks and in over 1,300 patients for up to 6–12 months.

The mean fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner. This increase reached a plateau within two to three months of therapy and returned to baseline levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high.

### Non-endoscopic diagnosis of atrophic gastritis with a blood test. correlation between gastric histology and serum levels of gastrin-17 and pepsinogen I: a multicentre study [^115c9FAj]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Serum levels of gastrin-17 (S-G-17) and pepsinogen I (S-PGI) are biomarkers of gastric antral and corpus mucosa, respectively. In a prospective multicentre investigation, we determined whether these tests, together with the assay of Helicobacter pylori antibodies, are a non-endoscopic tool for the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis.

Materials and Methods

The series comprised 404 consecutive adult outpatients undergoing diagnostic upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy for various dyspeptic symptoms in five outpatient clinics. Gastric biopsies from the antrum and corpus (at least two biopsies from both sites) were available from all patients, and they were evaluated according to the guidelines of the updated Sydney system. S-PGI and S-G-17 were assayed with ELISA methods using monoclonal antibodies to pepsinogen I and amidated gastrin-17. In addition to the fasting level (S-G-17(fast)), a postprandial S-G-17 (S-G-17(prand)) level was measured 20 min after ingestion of a protein-rich drink. H. pylori antibodies were determined using a polyclonal EIA method.

Results

S-G-17(prand) (and S-G-17(fast)) and S-PGI levels decreased with increasing grade of atrophy of the antrum or corpus, respectively. S-G-17(prand) levels were significantly lower in patients with advanced (moderate or severe) atrophic antral H. pylori gastritis than in those with non-atrophic H. pylori gastritis. All patients with a resected antrum demonstrated S-G-17(prand) levels that were almost undetectable. Of the nine patients with an H. pylori-positive moderate or severe atrophic antral gastritis, six had S-G-17(prand) levels below 5 pmol/l. Similarly, S-PGI levels were significantly lower in patients with advanced corpus atrophy than in those without. Of the 45 patients with moderate or severe corpus atrophy in endoscopic biopsies, 35 patients had S-PGI levels < 25 microg/l. By using the cut-off levels for S-G-17(prand) and S-PGI with the best discrimination, the sensitivity and specificity of the blood test panel in delineation of patients with advanced atrophic gastritis (either in the antrum or the corpus, or both) were 83% and 95%, respectively. The predictive values of the positive and negative test results were 75% and 97%, respectively. In the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis, the application of S-G-17(fast) showed a slightly lower sensitivity and specificity than the application of S-G-17(prand) as a biomarker for antral atrophy.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of atrophic gastritis obtained with the blood test panel of S-G-17, S-PGI and H. pylori antibodies is in good agreement with the endoscopic and biopsy findings. The panel is a tool for non-endoscopic diagnosis and screening of atrophic gastritis.

### Lansoprazole [^1168sAPV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Other Gastric Effects in Humans

Lansoprazole did not significantly affect mucosal blood flow in the fundus of the stomach. Due to the normal physiologic effect caused by the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, a decrease of about 17% in blood flow in the antrum, pylorus, and duodenal bulb was seen. Lansoprazole significantly slowed the gastric emptying of digestible solids. Lansoprazole increased serum pepsinogen levels and decreased pepsin activity under basal conditions and in response to meal stimulation or insulin injection. As with other agents that elevate intragastric pH, increases in gastric pH were associated with increases in nitrate-reducing bacteria and elevation of nitrite concentration in gastric juice in patients with gastric ulcer. No significant increase in nitrosamine concentrations was observed.

Serum Gastrin Effects

In over 2100 patients, median fasting serum gastrin levels increased 50% to 100% from baseline but remained within normal range after treatment with 15 to 60 mg of oral lansoprazole. These elevations reached a plateau within two months of therapy and returned to pretreatment levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum CgA levels. The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

### Nonsense mutation in the novel PERCC1 gene as a genetic cause of congenital diarrhea and enteropathy [^112auGaV]. Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

In our original publication describing the first PERCC1 -associated phenotype (Oz-Levi et al.), we established a link between loss of PERCC1 expression and EEC dysfunction. mRNA in situ hybridization of wildtype mice and examination of transgenic mice encoding a PERCC1 -mCherry fusion protein indicated that Percc1 -expressing cells were primarily EECs (including gastrin-secreting G cells in the stomach) in early fetal development. Further supporting the link between PERCC1 and EEC function, RNAseq data revealed that Percc1 knockout mice had significant reductions in Gastrin, Somatostatin and Ghrelin expression, as well as low serum gastrin levels. Consistent with these observations, an interesting clinical finding shared by both probands reported herein is that of low serum gastrin levels during fasting, which fail to respond to a meal challenge. Chromogranin A/synaptophysin staining in patient A did not demonstrate a reduction in intestinal EEC numbers. This is consistent with our previous effort, demonstrating increased immunoreactivity to Chromogranin A in biopsies obtained from the duodenal villi and stomach pyloric mucosae of two patients of the original cohort harboring the ΔL/ΔL deletion of ICR, when compared to healthy controls, as well as similar findings in the chr17 ΔICR/ΔICR mouse model (unpublished data). These findings suggest that EECs do form in early development in these patients, but it is their disrupted subsequent differentiation to EEC subtypes and their dysfunction that underlies the pathomechanism of this disorder. We can further speculate that the low gastrin levels seen in our current two patients may be an incidental marker of general EEC dysfunction, and that it is the intestinal EEC dysfunction which contributes to the clinical phenotype of diarrhea and intestinal failure. However, the mechanistic relevance of the clinical finding of low serum gastrin and its potential as a diagnostic clue in CODEs remain to be elucidated in further studies.

### Predictors of gastrin elevation following proton pump inhibitor therapy [^115qFGzs]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Goals

The goal of this study was to elucidate the most important predictors for elevation of gastrin in patients on long-term PPI therapy through analysis of data from 2 published studies in Icelandic patients with erosive GERD.

Background

Gastrin elevation is a known but variable consequence of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Concerns have been raised about the clinical importance of chronic PPI induced gastrin elevation.

Study

This cross-sectional analysis included patients with endoscopically verified erosive esophagitis receiving long-term PPI therapy. PPI exposure in dosage over weight (mg/kg) and dosage over body surface area (mg/m) was compared with fasting gastrin levels in two separate multiple linear regression models. Data was collected on age, gender, weight, H. pylori infection, smoking, PPI duration and type.

Results

Overall data from 157 patients (78 females) were analyzed. Median serum gastrin levels were higher in females than males (92 vs. 60pg/mL; P = 0.001). Simple linear regression showed a correlation between serum gastrin levels and gender (P = 0.0008) as well as PPI exposure in mg/kg (P = 0.0001) and mg/m (P = 0.0001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that PPI exposure, both in mg/kg (β = 0.95 [CI = 0.4–1.5]; P = 0.001) and mg/m (β = 0.02 [CI = 0.0–0.0]; P = 0.0015) along with female gender (β = 0.2 [CI = 0.0–0.4]; P = 0.02) predicted higher gastrin values.

Conclusions

Dosage and female gender seem to play an important role in the development of gastrin elevation on PPI therapy. A significant correlation was found between fasting serum gastrin and dosage of PPIs over weight and body surface area.

### Elevated serum gastrin levels in jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome: a marker of severe KCNQ1 dysfunction? [^116AYXcv]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The potassium channel I(Ks), which is encoded by the KCNQ1 gene, is expressed in organ systems including the inner ear, kidneys, lungs, intestine, and stomach in addition to the heart. Increasing evidence indicates that I(Ks) in the stomach plays an essential role in enabling gastric acid production. It is not known whether gastric acid production is disordered in patients with long QT type 1. Serum gastrin levels become elevated in subjects with disordered gastric acid production.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate serum gastrin levels, as a surrogate for impaired gastric acid secretion, in patients with KCNQ1 mutations, and to see if gastrin levels correlate with severity of cardiac disease.

Methods

Fasting serum gastrin levels were measured using a standardized immunometric technique in an index case and 12 subjects with known KCNQ1 mutations.

Results

An adult female with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS; with KCNQ1 nonsense mutations p. Arg518X and p. Arg190AlafsX95) presented with multiple gastric carcinoid tumors and grossly elevated serum gastrin levels (943–1,570 pmol/L; normal 6–55 pmol/L) and absent acid secretion. Gastrin levels in two girls with JLNS, unrelated to the index case (missense mutations p. Leu266Pro and Gly269Ser), also were high (305 and 229 pmol/L). Gastrin levels were normal in 10 KCNQ1 heterozygous single mutation carriers, even in those with severe long QT syndrome, including three heterozygous family members of the JLNS subjects.

Conclusion

JLNS may be associated with elevated gastrin levels, impaired acid secretion, and risk of gastric carcinoid tumors. Among KCNQ1 single mutation carriers, gastrin levels were normal and did not appear to be linked to the severity of clinical expression of long QT syndrome.

### The relationship between gastric emptying, plasma cholecystokinin, and peptide YY in critically ill patients [^115fqtUZ]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The substantially higher fasting plasma CCK and PYY concentrations in our critically ill patients with delayed GE are consistent with our previous reports on critically ill patients with feed intolerance. The observation that the rate of GE is inversely related to the fasting levels of CCK and PYY suggests that they may contribute to the regulation of GE in critically ill patients. Although the strength of the correlation was only modest, the relationship should not be regarded as weak, as this was a cross-sectional study. The mechanisms underlying the elevated fasting levels of these hormones are unknown. Nutritional deprivation is likely to be relevant since inadequate nutritional support is common in critically ill patients, fasting slows GE even in healthy subjects, and fasting CCK and PYY concentrations are higher in patients with anorexia nervosa and malnutrition. The lack of differences in fasting hormonal concentrations between patients with and without nutritional support in the present study suggests that the duration of nutritional deprivation may have been insufficient for this effect to become apparent. Prolonged exposure of nutrients from previous feeds related to coexistent small intestinal hypo-motility is an unlikely factor as all patients in the present cohort had been fasted for at least 8 hours. Renal impairment is also unlikely to contribute significantly to our observations as the proportion of patients with renal impairment was small and plasma CCK concentrations in this group did not differ from those with normal renal function. Although the majority of our patients received acid suppression therapy and therefore may have had increased serum gastrin levels, the cross-reactivity between gastrin and CCK is less than 2% and is unlikely to contribute to the elevated CCK concentrations.

### Correlation between serum gastrin and cellular proliferation in Barrett's esophagus [^11776wkC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) are commonly treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) to minimize the exposure of esophageal mucosa to stomach acid. However, the use of these medications can lead to significant hypergastrinemia in a subset of patients, which is concerning due to the known tumorigenic and proliferative effects of gastrin. The present pilot study aims to investigate a potential correlation between serum gastrin and cellular proliferation in BE.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of patients with nondysplastic BE on PPI therapy. Fasting serum gastrin was measured on the same day as esophageal biopsies were obtained. These biopsies were then stained with Ki-67 nuclear antibody. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship between Ki-67 index and ln(gastrin).

Results

A total of 10 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 62.6 (± 8.4) years and 5 patients were male. The median serum gastrin level was 45.2 pM (interquartile range [IQR] 33–113) and the median Ki-67 index was 49.6% (IQR 23–64). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between Ki-67 index and ln(gastrin) (r = 0.64; p = 0.05).

Conclusions

In nondysplastic BE patients on PPI therapy, serum gastrin levels were significantly correlated with cellular proliferation. These pilot data lend support to a potential causal effect of gastrin on neoplastic progression in BE. Longitudinal studies of patients with BE are needed to determine whether hypergastrinemia is a risk factor for the development of dysplasia and adenocarcinoma or could be used as a biomarker for disease progression.

### False-positive secretin stimulation test for gastrinoma associated with the use of proton pump inhibitor therapy [^113ccr9g]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 22-year-old woman who was referred for evaluation of possible Zollinger-Ellison syndrome because of hypergastrinemia and a positive secretin stimulation test. She was being treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for severe gastroesophageal reflux disease during her initial evaluation. At cessation of PPI therapy, her fasting serum gastrin levels normalized, as did her response to secretin injection. Previous reports describing false-positive secretin tests have been limited to cases of hypergastrinemia in the setting of chronic atrophic gastritis, presumably a result of achlorhydria. This case represents a clearly documented instance of PPI-related hypergastrinemia with a false-positive secretin test, with subsequent normalization of serum gastrin and a negative secretin test after withdrawal of PPI therapy. The current case emphasizes the need to assess the acid secretory status of individuals with hypergastrinemia and to discontinue the use of potent antisecretory agents, principally PPIs, to avoid the erroneous diagnosis of gastrinoma and before embarking on expensive and potentially invasive evaluations for the purpose of tumor localization.

### Esomeprazole-induced hyperchromograninemia in the absence of concomitant hypergastrinemia [^1143GVjJ]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Background

A 37-year-old female, who had a neuroendocrine pancreatic neoplasm, underwent duodeno-cephalo-pancreatectomy. In the 2 years following surgery, she had normal levels of serum chromogranin A (CgA), gastrin and other tumor markers. About 3 years after surgery, owing to the onset of reflux-like dyspeptic symptoms, the patient started treatment with the PPI esomeprazole. During PPI treatment, the patient's serum CgA level rose to more than three times the upper limit of normal, although her gastrin levels remained in the normal range. These findings were interpreted as being suggestive of neuroendocrine tumor relapse.

Investigations

Thoraco-abdominal CT, In¹¹¹-octreotide total body scan, CT of sella turcica, Tc(99m)-sestamibi neck scan, mutational analysis of chromosome 11q13 (site of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [MEN1] gene). Discontinuation of, and rechallenge with, esomeprazole.

Diagnosis

Esomeprazole-induced hyperchromograninemia in the absence of elevated levels of fasting serum gastrin.

Management

Discontinuation of acid-suppressive treatment and continuation of oncologic follow-up.

### Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium [^112RRYk9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Antisecretory Activity

The effect of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets on intragastric pH was determined in 25 healthy volunteers in one study. Three naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets combinations (naproxen 500 mg combined with either esomeprazole 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg) were administered twice daily over 9 days. The results are shown in the following table:

Serum Gastrin Effects

The effect of esomeprazole on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in approximately 2,700 patients in clinical trials up to 8 weeks and in over 1,300 patients for up to 6 to12 months. The mean fasting gastrin level increased in a dose-related manner. This increase reached a plateau within two to three months of therapy and returned to baseline levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high.

Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cell Effects

In over 1,000 patients treated with esomeprazole (10, 20 or 40 mg/day) up to 6 to12 months, the prevalence of ECL cell hyperplasia increased with time and dose. No patient developed ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia in the gastric mucosa.

Endocrine Effects

Esomeprazole had no effect on thyroid function when given in oral doses of 20 or 40 mg for 4 weeks. Other effects of esomeprazole on the endocrine system were assessed using omeprazole studies. Omeprazole given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2 to 4 weeks had no effect on carbohydrate metabolism, circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin.

Effects on Gastrointestinal Microbial Ecology

Decreased gastric acidity due to any means including proton pump inhibitors, increases gastric counts of bacteria normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors may lead to slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter and, in hospitalized patients, possibly also Clostridium difficile.

### Diagnostic performance of the normal range of gastrin calculated using strict criteria based on a combination of serum markers and pathological evaluation for detecting gastritis: a retrospective study [^111ut8se]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The gastrin cut-off value of 126 pg/mL has a good positive predictive value (97.0%) for detecting gastritis, suggesting that it can be used as a marker for recommending endoscopy. However, it is noteworthy that some patients with gastritis do not have high serum gastrin concentrations. The identification of these patients remains a challenge for the future.

### Omeprazole (omeprazole / sodium bicarbonate) [^115w564M]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum Gastrin Effects

In studies involving more than 200 patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1 to 2 weeks of once-daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole in parallel with inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued treatment. In comparison with histamine H2-receptor antagonists, the median increases produced by 20 mg doses of omeprazole were higher (1.3 to 3.6-fold vs. 1.1- to 1.8-fold increase). Gastrin values returned to pretreatment levels, usually within 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

Other Effects

Systemic effects of omeprazole in the central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2 to 4 weeks, had no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin.

No effect on gastric emptying of the solid and liquid components of a test meal was demonstrated after a single dose of omeprazole 90 mg. In healthy subjects, a single intravenous dose of omeprazole (0.35 mg/kg) had no effect on intrinsic factor secretion. No systematic dose-dependent effect has been observed on basal or stimulated pepsin output in humans. However, when intragastric pH is maintained at 4.0 or above, basal pepsin output is low, and pepsin activity is decreased.

### The relationship of gastrinoma in MEN 1 to Helicobacter pylori infection [^11594spD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Helicobacter pylori and Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN 1) are risk factors for hypergastrinemia. Gastrin-secreting neoplasms of the foregut mucosa are both a source of, and potentially stimulated by, hypergastrinemia.

Objective

To determine the relationship between H pylori exposure and the prevalence and severity of hypergastrinemia in patients with MEN 1.

Design, Setting & Patients

Cross-sectional analysis of patients with a common MEN1 gene mutation managed at a tertiary referral hospital that underwent fasting serum gastrin and H pylori serum IgG measurement.

Intervention

H pylori IgG and serum gastrin concentration, determined via immunoassay.

Main Outcome Measures

The prevalence and severity of hypergastrinemia and its relationship to past H pylori exposure.

Results

Thirty-four of 95 (36%) patients were H pylori IgG seropositive. H pylori seropositive patients were significantly more likely to exhibit hypergastrinemia compared with seronegative patients (relative risk [RR] 1.72, P = 0.023). H pylori exposure also predicted severe hypergastrinemia (RR 3.52, P = 0.026 and RR 9.37, P = 0.031 for patients with gastrin ≥ ×4 and ≥ ×8 the upper limit of normal [ULN], respectively). Gastrin concentrations ≥ ×10 ULN occurred exclusively in H pylori seropositive patients (0/61 vs 6/34, P = 0.001). Serum gastrin and alpha subunit were positively associated in H pylori-exposed (β = 0.69, P = 0.001), but not in H pylori-unexposed patients.

Conclusion

Past H pylori exposure was associated with increased prevalence and severity of hypergastrinemia in MEN 1 patients. Past H pylori-related hypergastrinemia may contribute to the pathogenesis of ongoing gastrin hypersecretion by susceptible foregut neuroendocrine tissues.

### Idiopathic gastric acid hypersecretion presenting as a diarrheal disorder and mimicking both Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and Crohn's disease [^116j8w44]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Many gastric acid hypersecretory states (basal acid output of greater than 15.0 mEq/h) exist for which the etiology is known, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, antral exclusion, antral predominant Helicobacter pylori gastritis (antral G cell hyperplasia), chronic gastric outlet obstruction, short gut syndrome and basophilic leukemias. However, many hypersecretory patients have no identified etiology for their acid hypersecretion and are designated as idiopathic gastric acid hypersecretors with a basal acid output of greater than 10 mEq/h and a normal serum gastrin level. Because of the gastric acid hypersecretion these patients also commonly have an increased frequency of stools. Idiopathic gastric acid hypersecretion represents a known cause of gastric acid hypersecretion that is far more common than Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and it has a markedly different treatment regimen and natural history. We report a case of a patient with idiopathic gastric acid hypersecretion previously misdiagnosed as having Crohn's disease because of a presenting complaint of diarrhea and mimicking Zollinger-Ellison syndrome because her fasting serum gastrin level was elevated when incorrectly measured in the presence of antisecretory treatment.

### New developments in gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms [^1175LAks]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Current Classification and Management of Gastric NENs

Gastric NENs are thought to arise from subepithelial, histamine-secreting, enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells and are conventionally subdivided into three main types which have very different and distinct pathophysiologies (Fig. 1). Type I g-NENs are associated with autoimmune atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria, while type II g-NENs develop in some patients who have gastrinomas, increased gastric acid secretion, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) and multiple neuroendocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. Both type I and type II g-NENs are associated with elevated fasting serum gastrin concentrations, and many patients have a relatively indolent disease course and good prognosis. Hypergastrinaemia exerts a proliferative effect on ECL-cells in the stomach, leading to linear and micronodular ECL-cell hyperplasia and subsequently dysplasia and NEN development. By contrast, type III g-NENs are sporadic tumours, and gastrin is not thought to be involved in their pathogenesis. Type III g-NENs tend to behave more aggressively and often have a poorer prognosis.

### Omeprazole absorption and fasting gastrinemia after roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^1121hDmg]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the bariatric surgeries most frequently performed worldwide. Since this operation may predispose to the formation of peptic ulcer of the gastrojejunal anastomosis, the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) is recommended during the first postoperative year. However, so far, there is no detailed knowledge about the absorption of this medication during the immediate postoperative period and consequently about its effectiveness in blocking acid secretion. The objective was to assess the possible endoscopic peptic changes, the absorption of omeprazole (OME), and the status of fasting gastrinemia before and after RYGB operation.

Materials and Methods

OME absorption, the production of its metabolites omeprazole sulfone (OMES) and 5-hydroxyomeprazole (HOME), and basal (fasting) gastrinemia were determined in patients submitted to RYGB before and 2 months after the operation. Upper digestive endoscopy (UDE) was also performed before and 6 months after the operation.

Results

Twenty patients were studied. Preoperatively, all these patients had some peptic changes and 55% tested positive for Helicobacter pylori. Six months after surgery, ten patients still showed endoscopic changes and one patient tested positive for H. pylori. During the postoperative period, there was a reduction of OME absorption and of the production of its metabolites 90 min after administration of the drug, and reduction of serum gastrin levels.

Conclusion

The standard OME dose (40 mg) administered after bariatric surgery is insufficient to achieve serum levels that can effectively block the production of hydrochloric acid, permitting the formation of peptic injuries in many patients.

### Nonsense mutation in the novel PERCC1 gene as a genetic cause of congenital diarrhea and enteropathy [^1157MySe]. Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentations

Patient A is a 12 year-old male, born to non-consanguineous parents of mixed Irish/Sri-Lankan/Malaysian descent (father Irish; mother 1/2 Irish, 1/4 Sri-Lankan, 1/4 Malaysian), with one healthy older sibling and two half-siblings. He was born weighing 3.18 kg following an uncomplicated term pregnancy and presented aged 3 weeks with watery diarrhea and hypernatremic dehydration. He underwent extensive investigations (Table 1), including negative trio-based exome sequencing (ES), and endoscopic biopsies which showed normal chromogranin A and synaptophysin staining and normal enteroendocrine cell (EEC) number (5–6 per crypt). Investigations did not support a metabolic or mitochondrial disorder. He is cognitively normal and growing appropriately on home parenteral nutrition (4 nights per week, 67 non-protein calories/kg, 56 ml/kg). He is hyperphagic and has a diverse diet but has 5–7 steatorrheal (298 g fat/day) stools per day. Serum gastrin levels were low and failed to respond to meal challenge [fasting and post-prandial gastrin 34 and < 33 ng/L, respectively (normal range 33–85 ng/L)].

Patient B is a 19 year-old male, born to consanguineous parents (first cousins) of Irish ethnicity. He presented at 2 weeks of age with watery diarrhea and hypernatremic dehydration following an uncomplicated pregnancy, birth weight 3.04 kg. Diarrhea resolved on cessation of oral feeds, and extensive investigations failed to identify a cause (Table 1). He is cognitively normal and has reached an adult height of 179.1 cm (75th centile). He is tapering his home PN regime, currently on PN 1 night/week (15 non-protein calories, 32 ml/kg) with a diverse oral diet, passing 3–5 loose stools/day. Serum gastrin levels were low and failed to respond to meal challenge [fasting and post-prandial gastrin 24 and 22 mU/L, respectively (normal range 23–113 mU/L)]. Single (proband only) exome sequencing was negative.

### Secretin stimulation test and early diagnosis of gastrinoma in MEN1 syndrome: survey on the MEN1 florentine database [^114ZPvC7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare inherited endocrine cancer syndrome. Multiple gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) affect 30% to 80% of MEN1 patients, with the most common functioning GEP-NET being gastrinoma. Biochemical identification of hypergastrinemia may help to recognize the presence of gastrinomas before they are detectable by instrumental screening, enabling early diagnosis and start of therapy, preferably before tumor progression and metastases occurrence.

Objective

Evaluate the effectiveness of secretin stimulation test to precociously diagnose the presence of gastrin-secreting tumors.

Design

Results of secretin stimulation tests, performed between 1991 and February 2020, were retrospectively analyzed, as aggregate, in a cohort of MEN1 patients with GEP-NETs.

Setting

Data were extracted from the MEN1 Florentine database.

Patients

The study included 72 MEN1 patients with GEP-NETs who underwent a secretin stimulation test for the evaluation of gastrin secretion.

Outcomes

A positive secretin stimulation test was assumed with a difference between basal fasting serum gastrin (FSG) and the maximum stimulated value of gastrin over 120 pg/mL.

Results

The secretin stimulation test showed a secretin-induced hypergastrinemia in 27.8% (20/72) of patients with GEP-NETs, and a positive test in 18 cases. The test allowed the identification of a positively stimulated hypergastrinemia in 75.0% (3/4) of patients who presented a basal FSG within the normal range.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of gastrinoma is complex, difficult, and controversial. Results of this study confirm that a positive secretin stimulation test allows early diagnosis of gastrinomas, even in the presence of borderline or normal levels of nonstimulated FSG.

### Plasma levels of progastrin but not amidated gastrin or glycine extended gastrin are elevated in patients with colorectal carcinoma [^111AdHcn]. Gut (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between plasma gastrin levels and colorectal cancer is controversial. When confounding factors which increase plasma gastrin levels are taken into account, it has been shown that gastrin levels are not elevated in patients with colorectal cancer. However, these studies only measured amidated gastrin. Total gastrin (which includes unprocessed, partially processed, and mature forms of gastrin) has been shown to be elevated in patients with colorectal cancer.

Aims

The aim of this study was to determine whether fasting plasma levels of progastrin, amidated gastrin, or glycine extended gastrin are elevated in patients with colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps compared with controls.

Methods

Progastrin, amidated gastrin, and glycine extended gastrin were estimated by radioimmunoassay using the following antibodies: L289, 109–21, and L2. Blood samples were analysed for Helicobacter pylori by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

Median progastrin levels were significantly higher in the cancer group (27.5 pmol/l) than in the polyp (≤ 15 pmol/l) or control (≤ 15 pmol/l) group (p = 0.0001 There was no difference in median levels of amidated gastrin between groups. Median levels of amidated gastrin were significantly higher in H pylori positive patients (19 pmol/l) than in H pylori negative patients (8 pmol/l) (p = 0.0022). Median plasma progastrin levels were significantly higher for moderately dysplastic polyps (38 pmol/l) compared with mildly dysplastic (15 pmol/l) and severely dysplastic (15 pmol/l) polyps (p = 0.05).

Conclusions

Plasma levels of progastrin, but not amidated gastrin or glycine extended gastrin, are significantly elevated in patients with colorectal cancer compared with those with colorectal polyps or controls, irrespective of their H pylori status. We conclude that measuring plasma progastrin levels in patients with colorectal cancer is warranted.

### The effects of long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors on meal stimulated gastrin [^115atXjC]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dyspepsia develops in healthy volunteers after withdrawal of proton-pump inhibitors. This phenomenon, attributed to rebound acid hypersecretion, is thought to be mediated by reflex hypergastrinemia.

Aims

To measure fasting and postprandial gastrin in patients on long-term proton-pump inhibitor treatment and correlate gastrin levels with the duration of treatment and other potential predictors.

Methods

In this cross sectional study patients, with erosive esophagitis, on long-term proton-pump inhibitor treatment and healthy controls underwent gastrin measurements at baseline and four times following a meal and Helicobacter pylori status was determined.

Results

A total of 100 patients and 50 controls were studied. Pre- and postprandial gastrin levels were higher in patients (p < 0.001). No significant correlation was found between the area under the gastrin-curve and the treatment duration. Female patients had significantly higher gastrin levels than males pre- and postprandial, whereas such differences was not found in the control group. Female gender was the only independent predictor of s-gastrin levels (OR 2.50 compared to males, 95% CI: 1.08–5.76, p = 0.032) in the patient group.

Conclusion

Gastrin values were higher in patients compared to controls. There was no correlation between gastrin levels and treatment duration. Female patients had significantly higher gastrin values than males.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116Q8JEm]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Hormone-secreting PanNETs — testing approach and chromogranin A considerations: these cases often require additional imaging, such as EUS and SSTR-based imaging; because many PanNETs secrete hormones, biochemical evaluation should also be considered in patients with PanNETs, and evaluation is generally guided by symptoms indicating excess hormone secretion, while screening for hormones in asymptomatic individuals is not routinely recommended; classic syndromes include insulinomas with fasting or nocturnal hypoglycemia and gastrinomas with recurrent peptic ulcers, with additional presentations including glucagonomas with hyperglycemia or diabetes mellitus and/or migratory necrolytic erythema, somatostatinomas with hyperglycemia or diabetes mellitus and/or diarrhea/steatorrhea, and VIPomas with watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria; Chromogranin A levels are elevated in ≥ 60% of patients with either functioning or nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors, and levels elevated to twice the normal limit or higher are associated with shorter survival times for metastatic NETs (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.9–4.0; P < .001), and Chromogranin A was also found to be a prognostic factor in a prospective study of patients treated with everolimus; however, care should be taken because spuriously elevated levels have been reported in patients using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), those with renal or liver failure, those with hypertension, and those with chronic gastritis.

### Study of gender differences in proton pump inhibitor dose requirements for GERD: a double-blind randomized trial [^113VFygE]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Goals

To determine the proportion of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease who are on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) who could reduce their prior dosage by half, and identify predictors of successful step-down.

Background

Appropriate hypergastrinemia results from gastric acid inhibition. A gender difference in fasting gastrin with higher levels among women than among men on long-term PPI therapy has been demonstrated.

Study

Patients with endoscopically verified erosive esophagitis on long-term PPI therapy were randomized double blindly to step down their dose by half or continue with the same dose for 8 weeks. Fasting gastrin levels were measured before and after treatment. The primary endpoint was successful step-down throughout the study period.

Results

Overall, 100 patients were randomized, 49 (24 females) to continue with the same dose as before and 51 (25 females) to step down. Female patients had higher gastrin levels compared with male patients: 78 pg/mL (IQR, 50 to 99) versus 50 pg/mL (IQR, 36 to 74) (P = 0.007). Among those randomized to the step-down intervention only 3/25 (12%) women failed to complete the 2 months of lower-dose therapy versus 9/25 (36%) men (P = 0.09). Female gender (P = 0.048) was the strongest predictor for successful step-down (odds ratio = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01–1.60). The chance of failing to maintain symptom control was twice as high in the reduction group (24%) as compared with the control group (13%) (P = 0.2).

Conclusions

Female patients on long-term PPI therapy were 3 times more likely to tolerate half of their prior dose. Female gender had higher probability for successful step-down. These results indicate that women with gastroesophageal reflux disease might manage with lower doses of PPIs as compared with men.

### Endoscopic ultrasound-guided lauromacrogol embolization for suspected Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: a novel approach [^111xtTTq]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Zollinger–Ellison syndrome is a rare condition caused by gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors, leading to severe gastric acid hypersecretion, peptic ulcers, and diarrhea. Accurate diagnosis remains challenging, requiring characteristic clinical symptoms, hypergastrinemia, and tumor localization through advanced imaging techniques. Though conventional treatments include high-dose proton pump inhibitors, somatostatin analogs, or surgery, we present a groundbreaking case of suspected Zollinger–Ellison syndrome successfully managed with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided lauromacrogol embolization, offering a minimally invasive yet highly effective therapeutic alternative.

A 58-year-old woman presented with a 5-month history of refractory watery diarrhea (up to 20 episodes daily) and weight loss of 10 kg. Previous hospitalizations showed partial response to octreotide but no improvement with antispasmodics or probiotics. Laboratory investigations revealed markedly elevated fasting serum gastrin (913.0 pg/mL). Upper endoscopy demonstrated multiple atypical duodenal and jejunal ulcers (Fig. 1), and ¹⁸F-octreotide positron emission tomography and computed tomography identified a 1.5-cm hypermetabolic nodule (maximum standardized uptake value 77.7) in the gastric antrum, suggestive of a gastrinoma. Subsequent EUS evaluation confirmed a hypoechoic, hypervascular submucosal mass originating near the pyloric orifice (Fig. 2). Although EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration yielded no malignant cells, the collective clinical, biochemical, and radiological findings strongly supported a diagnosis of Zollinger–Ellison syndrome.

### Withdrawing PPI therapy after healing esophagitis does not worsen symptoms or cause persistent hypergastrinemia: analysis of dexlansoprazole MR clinical trial data [^1115vKEX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Baseline demographics for the cohort of patients (N = 287) who were healed after 4–8 weeks of treatment with dexlansoprazole MR or lansoprazole and then randomized to placebo in the maintenance studies are shown in Table 1. Among the 287 patients, 5 were not included in the diary summary because of missing baseline diary. Of the other 282 patients, 60 were not included in the month 1 diary summary, including 48 who prematurely discontinued before day 30 and 12 additional patients who were in the maintenance study for at least 30 days but did not have sufficient diary data during the first 30 days. Of the 222 patients who were included in the month 1 diary summary, 125 patients were in the maintenance study for at least 30 days and the other 97 prematurely discontinued before day 30, but had sufficient diary data. Baseline median of mean heartburn symptom severity of the 222 patients included in the month 1 symptom analysis was 1.36. Of the 124 included in the EE rebound analysis, 31% had grade A esophagitis at baseline, 38% had grade B esophagitis, 27% had grade C esophagitis, and 4% had grade D esophagitis.

Gastrin evaluation

There was no evidence of RAHS as assessed by serum gastrin levels in this analysis. Among patients randomized to maintenance with placebo with available serum gastrin levels, mean (s.d.) gastrin level at baseline (pretreatment; n = 216) was 59.9 (31.4) pg/ml. The changes from baseline to day −1 of maintenance trials (n = 207), to maintenance month 1 (n = 130), and to maintenance month 3 (n = 52) were 85.5 (120.8) pg/ml, 3.5 (42.3) pg/ml, and 3.2 (66.8) pg/ml, respectively. As would be expected, gastrin values did increase from baseline to day −1 of the maintenance studies while patients were receiving active treatment. In patients randomized to placebo, mean gastrin values at months 1 and 3 were essentially unchanged from baseline. This indicates that gastrin levels normalized within 1 month of discontinuing PPIs and remained flat. Furthermore, data do not suggest any difference in the findings between those who used a PPI within 90 days of informed consent compared with those who did not (Figure 1).

### Absence of gastrointestinal infections in a cohort of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and other acid hypersecretors receiving long-term acid suppression with lansoprazole [^114eJUaV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

The protocol for patient evaluation and management has been previously published. Briefly, patients with gastric acid hypersecretion were defined as a basal acid output > 15 mmol/h in patients without prior antrectomy or > 5 mmol/h after antrectomy. ZES was diagnosed by elevated fasting or secretin-stimulated gastrin levels and/or histologic identification of a gastrinoma. Sixty six patients had been treated for a median of 0.8 years, range 0.1–5, with omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors before entering this study. Gastric acid analysis measuring basal and maximal stimulated acid secretion was performed at entry and at six month intervals following normalization of acid secretion with lansoprazole. Lansoprazole doses were individually titrated in each patient to maintain basal acid output (BAO) < 5 mmol/h a benchmark based on upper limit for healthy control subjects or < 2 mmol/h post-antrectomy.

Following initial stabilization of gastric acid secretion as noted above, patients were evaluated on a six monthly basis with history, physical examination, endoscopy with gastric biopsies, gastric analysis, serum gastrin, and other routine blood chemistry studies. Patients were also interviewed at each visit for any intercurrent illnesses, hospitalization/illness, and change in medications. All patients underwent interval physical examination and then underwent endoscopy by one of the authors throughout the study. In addition, over the last two years (2006–2007), when patients were seen in follow-up, they were specifically queried regarding the development of any gastrointestinal infections or other diarrheal illnesses while receiving lansoprazole with particular attention to episodes where the patient sought medical attention, had stool studies performed, or received antibiotics for therapy. All medical records for these hospitalizations were obtained whenever possible. In addition, patients were specifically queried about the use of antibiotics during the hospitalization or any received as an outpatient.

### Fasting and nutrient-stimulated plasma peptide-YY levels are elevated in critical illness and associated with feed intolerance: an observational, controlled study [^116cANmY]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Effect of critical illness on fasting and nutrient-stimulated CCK concentrations

In both groups, there was an increase in the absolute plasma CCK concentration after 20 minutes of duodenal nutrient infusion. Both fasting and nutrient-stimulated CCK concentrations were higher in patients than in healthy subjects (fasting: 7.3 ± 1.3 versus 4.7 ± 0.5 pmol/l; P < 0.05; and nutrient-stimulated: AUC (0–180 min) 1 kcal/minute: 608 ± 115 versus 395 ± 30 pmol/l.min; P < 0.05; 2 kcal/minute: 789 ± 98 versus 518 ± 89 pmol/l.min; P = 0.05; Figure 1b). In both groups, the plasma CCK concentration had returned to baseline level by 180 minutes. The magnitude of elevation in CCK concentration was greater in patients during the 2 kcal/minute infusion (AUC (0–180 min): 255 ± 34 versus 176 ± 22 pmol/l.min, P = 0.045), but not the 1 kcal/minute infusion (AUC (0–180 min): 110 ± 42 versus 140 ± 26 pmol/l.min, P = 0. 42), compared with healthy subjects.

Feed tolerance and gastro-intestinal hormone response in critical illness

In feed-intolerant patients, both fasting and nutrient-stimulated plasma PYY and CCK concentrations were higher than in the remainder of the group (Figure 2). In feed-intolerant patients, there was a trend for a greater magnitude of elevation in both PYY (AUC (0–180 min): 2,743 ± 589 versus 1,526 ± 335 pmol/l.min; P = 0.09) and CCK (AUC (0–180 min): 258 ± 43 versus 148 ± 35 pmol/l.min; P = 0.07) concentrations compared with feed-tolerant patients. Both fasting and nutrient-stimulated PYY and CCK levels were similar between feed-tolerant patients and healthy subjects.

### Gastrin secretion after bariatric surgery-response to a protein-rich mixed meal following roux-En-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy: a pilot study in normoglycemic women [^117VTkDY]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recent investigations have linked elevated gastrin levels to the improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are effective treatments for T2DM, but it is not known if this is related to postoperative alterations of gastrin secretion.

Methods

Twenty women previously operated with RYGB or SG and 13 female controls were enrolled and evaluated for body mass index, lipids, C-peptide, HbA1c, and anti-H. pylori IgG. Glucose, gastrin, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) concentrations were measured before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after ingestion of a protein-rich mixed meal.

Results

Six participants primarily selected were excluded due to usage of proton pump inhibitors, positive H.pylori IgG, or history of T2DM, yielding the following groups: RYGB (n = 9), SG (n = 8), and controls (n = 10). There were no differences in age, body mass index, HbA1c, or C-peptide levels between groups. RYGB had significantly lower area under the curve (AUC) for glucose during the test compared to controls (p = 0.013). RYGB showed lower serum gastrin levels compared to SG and controls (p < 0.05 for all). There was a non-significant increased gastrin release in SG compared to controls (p = 0.091). For SG and controls, there was a negative correlation between glucose and gastrin response (p = 0.0043).

Conclusion

Gastrin secretion is diminished after RYGB. Hypergastrinemia was not present after SG, but a tendency of enhanced gastrin secretion was observed. These findings require further investigation in prospective studies.

### A possible pre-zollinger-ellison state: report on a novel lesion [^113Xibpx]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a patient with a potential harbinger of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

Methods

We present a case of a 29-year-old woman with persistent galactorrhea and gastric distress, who was a member of an extensive multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I kindred. Both clinical and laboratory findings are reviewed.

Results

Laboratory studies were notable for persistent hypercalcemia and increased levels of parathyroid hormone and fasting pancreatic polypeptide. Because of nonspecific upper gastrointestinal distress, which was sometimes responsive to antacids, the patient underwent further diagnostic evaluation. Baseline gastrin levels were normal. A secretin challenge test yielded normal results. At upper endoscopy, visual findings in the stomach and duodenum were unremarkable. A raised nodule (4 by 2 by 2 mm) was removed from an otherwise normal-appearing duodenum as a routine biopsy procedure. The acinar architecture, the inconspicuous nucleoli, and the granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm of the cells were diagnostic of a neuroendocrine tumor. Histologic immunohistochemical staining was positive for gastrin but negative for pancreatic polypeptide. RNA studies were not technically possible. Subsequently, serum pancreatic polypeptide levels normalized. The patient ultimately had hyperplastic parathyroid glands resected.

Conclusion

The duodenal lesion may be a very early gastrinoma, a preclinical manifestation of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The role of early resection of such lesions remains to be determined.

### Long-term dynamics of gastric biomarkers after eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection [^114wZgHS]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Secretion of pepsinogen I (PgI), pepsinogen II (PgII), fasting gastrin-17 (fG-17) and stimulated gastrin-17 (sG-17) changes after Helicobacter pylori eradication. Few data are available on the long-term dynamics of gastric biomarkers after H. pylori eradication. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamics of gastric biomarkers in H. pylori-positive patients after eradication over a 3-year period and to compare the levels with initially H. pylori-negative patients.

Materials and Methods

Blood samples for the detection of gastric biomarkers were obtained from dyspeptic patients coming for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. In H. pylori-positive patients, after eradication therapy, three follow-up blood samples were drawn after 12, 24 and 36 months; in H. pylori-negative patients, two samples were taken - at 12 and after 30 months. Median values of biomarkers in follow-up samples were compared with the baseline sample.

Results

The final sample included 110 patients (median age 67 years, M/F ratio 27/83). In patients after H. pylori eradication (n = 83) PgI, PgII, fG-17 and sG-17 had decreased significantly during a 36-month period, whereas the PgI/PgII ratio had increased significantly from 5.59 to 11.64.

Conclusion

In H. pylori-positive dyspeptic patients, after eradication therapy, a decrease in PgI, PgII, fG-17 and sG-17 was observed after 36 months whereas an increase in the PgI/II ratio suggested an improvement in gastric atrophy. The median levels of gastric biomarkers in patients after H. pylori eradication therapy may become similar to biomarker levels among initially H. pylori-negative individuals.

### Normal and proton pump inhibitor-mediated gastrin levels in infants 1 to 11 months old [^116naRPv]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Scant data exist on the normal range of serum gastrin in infants. In phase I and III trials of rabeprazole in gastroesophageal reflux disease, we studied serum gastrin levels in infants 1 to 11 months old, and assessed normal ranges and the effect of acid-suppressive drugs.

Methods

Overall, 349 treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced (previously exposed to proton pump inhibitors and/or H2-receptor antagonists) infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease were screened for baseline serum gastrin. Repeat gastrin was monitored at early termination or end of study, allowing assessment of 1 to 8 week daily rabeprazole (5- or 10-mg) treatment on gastrin levels.

Results

Median (5%-95% range) baseline gastrin was 118 ng/L (39–315) in the treatment-naïve group (n = 251), driven mostly by high levels (121.5 [48–326] ng/L) in the 1- to < 4-month-old subgroup. Treatment-experienced infants (n = 98) had elevated baseline gastrin levels (152 [48–487] ng/L; P = 0.0011) with no clear difference between previously proton pump inhibitor-exposed and H2-receptor antagonist-exposed groups. At the end of study, mean (standard deviation) levels were unchanged from baseline in infants withdrawn from rabeprazole to placebo (124 [94] ng/L), but elevated from baseline in those continuing treatment with 5-mg (245 [151] ng/L) and 10-mg (332 [222] ng/L) rabeprazole during the study.

Conclusions

Gastrin levels in treatment-naïve infants were elevated through 8 months of age. Between 8 and 12 months of age, they declined so that the median level was within the upper limit of the normal adult range (< 100 ng/L). Previous exposure to acid-suppressive medications and short-term exposure to rabeprazole significantly increased gastrin levels in infants younger than 1 year.

### The gastrin receptor antagonist netazepide (YF476) in patients with type 1 gastric enterochromaffin-like cell neuroendocrine tumours: review of long-term treatment [^114pxabK]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Netazepide (YF476) is a recently developed, orally active gastrin receptor antagonist that, in short trials in patients with type 1 gastric enterochromaffin-like cell neuroendocrine tumours, has been shown to induce a significant reduction in the number and size of tumours as well as serum chromogranin A (CgA). The aim of this review is to evaluate the long-term effect and safety of netazepide.

Patients and Methods

Five patients previously treated with netazepide in an open-label trial were offered continuous treatment with netazepide 25mg once daily. Upper endoscopy was performed every 6 months. The tumours were counted and measured, and tissue samples were obtained from the flat corpus mucosa. Enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia was classified according to Solcia and colleagues and volume density of CgA immunoreactive (IR) cells was calculated. Fasting serum CgA and fasting serum gastrin were measured every 3 months.

Results

All tumours regressed completely in three of five patients; time until total disappearance was 3, 9 and 12 months. In the other two patients, the number of tumours was reduced from 13 to 5 and from 14 to 3. Serum CgA showed a rapid and sustained decrease (P < 0.001). The mean reduction in serum CgA was 4.1 ± 0.5nmol/l. Similarly, volume density of CgA IR cells in the flat corpus mucosa decreased (P < 0.001), with the mean change being 2.0 ± 0.4%. Serum gastrin and volume density of gastrin IR cells in the antral part of the stomach remained unchanged (P = 0.2 and 0.7, respectively).

Conclusion

Long-term administration of netazepide is effective and safe.

### Prospective controlled trial of a standardized meal stimulation test in the detection of pancreaticoduodenal endocrine tumours in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^1149s1Py]. The British Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Use of a standardized meal stimulation test has been recommended for the early diagnosis of pancreaticoduodenal endocrine tumours (PETs) in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). The diagnostic value of this test was re-evaluated.

Methods

In a prospective, controlled trial 58 standardized meal stimulation tests (563 kcal) were performed in 12 patients with MEN 1 and histologically, biochemically and/or radiologically confirmed PETs (group 1), 11 carriers of an MEN 1 mutation with no evidence of PETs (group 2) and in 27 healthy controls (group 3). Serum pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and gastrin concentrations were measured before and during the test meal.

Results

Patients in group 1 had significantly higher mean basal serum PP and gastrin concentrations than patients in group 2 and controls (P < 0.05). In all three groups an increase in serum PP was observed after meal stimulation, but there was no significant difference between the groups. No increase in gastrin level was found in any of the groups after meal stimulation.

Conclusion

The standardized meal stimulation test does not reliably indicate the presence of PETs in patients with MEN 1, whereas raised basal serum PP and gastrin levels do. The expensive and time-consuming meal test can be excluded from MEN 1 screening programmes.

Effects of Bariatric Surgery on the Secretion of GI‐Derived Hormones and Blood Pressure

Bariatric surgery may affect the secretion of gut‐derived hormones and blood pressure. Different surgical methods may have different effects on the secretion of the same GI hormone. For example, fasting plasma gastrin levels are normal in laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery, 150 while sleeve gastrectomy results in increased fasting plasma gastrin levels. 151 The postprandial gastrin secretion induced by a mixed meal is also enhanced by sleeve gastrectomy. 152 By contrast, procedures that reroute the nutrient passage to the intestines, bypassing the gastric antrum, such as Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass (RYGB), prevent the increase in plasma gastrin following a mixed meal. 152, 153, 154

Depending on the subjects or postoperative time, bariatric surgery has different effects on the GI hormone responses. The first 2 weeks after RYGB in obese nondiabetic subjects, fasting plasma levels of insulin, ghrelin, and peptide YY (PYY) are decreased, but insulin sensitivity increased. 153 The postprandial response to a mixed meal is increased for C‐peptide, GLP‐1, GLP‐2, PYY, CCK, and glucagon; by contrast, the postprandial response was decreased for ghrelin, leptin, and gastrin and unchanged for glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, amylin, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin. 153 In obese patients with type 2 diabetes, 15 days after RYGB, fasting plasma levels of pancreatic polypeptide, glucagon, and GLP‐1 are increased; but the pancreatic polypeptide response to a mixed meal is decreased while that of glucagon and GLP‐1 remains increased. 155 After 1 year in these same patients, PYY response to a mixed meal is increased, while amylin, ghrelin, and GLP‐1 are decreased. 155 The same study also found that the hormonal responses after sleeve gastrectomy are similar to those with RYGB except that fasting and meal‐induced plasma pancreatic polypeptide levels remain increased but unchanged for amylin. 155

### Occult insulinoma with treatment refractory, severe hypoglycaemia in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome; difficulties faced during diagnosis, localization and management; a case report [^112M7QxV]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Multiple cutaneous collagenomas

Her Random plasma glucose level was 23.3 mg/dL on admission. She was treated with intravenous 20% dextrose boluses followed continuous infusion. But the patient continued to develop recurrent, severe hypoglycaemic episodes. Due to the prolonged reduced conscious level during the episodes of hypoglycaemia, elective intubation was carried out to protect the airway and to prevent aspiration.

Initial laboratory evaluation including full blood count and inflammatory markers were within normal parameters. Non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT) of brain was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was normal except for very low sugar levels. Serum insulin level was 300 mU/L (fasting level < 25 mU/L) with a c-peptide level of 15.63 ng/mL (fasting level 0.78–1.89 ng/mL) which was drawn during an episode of confirmed severe hypoglycaemia. Toxicology screening did not reveal presence of oral hypoglycaemic agents. Her serum fasting gastrin level 70 pg/mL. Prolactin was 11,716 mU/L (300–500 mU/L). Serum Calcium (corrected to an albumin level of 3.2 g/dL) was 16.1 mg/dL(8.6–10.3 mg/dL) and serum phosphate level was 1.3 mg/dL(3–4.5 mg/dL). Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 329.7 pg/mL (18.4–80 pg/mL). 24-h urinary calcium excretion was 828.82 mg/dL (100–300 mg/24 h). The findings were suggestive of endogenous hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and primary hyperparathyroidism. Thyroid stimulating hormone(TSH), Thyroxine (fT4), Cortisol, Growth hormone and Follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), Luteinizing hormone (LH), total Testosterone and DHEA levels were within the respective normal range.

### Screening and surveillance practices for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1-related neuroendocrine tumours in European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society centers of excellence (ENETS CoE)-an ENETS MEN1 task force questionnaire study [^111mgitq]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2.1 Biochemical screening

All CoEs screen patients for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) with serum calcium measurement and, with the exception of three of the four Dutch CoEs, also with parathyroid hormone (PTH) (Table 2, Figure S1). Practices with regard to biochemical screening for duodenopancreatic NETs are heterogeneous, as can be seen in Table 2. Larger centres more often screen with fasting serum gastrin (FSG), glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). Additionally, some important variations among countries could be detected (Figure S1). Chromogranin A (CgA), glucagon, PP and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are more often determined in the United Kingdom (UK) (Figure S1) compared to other countries. Swiss CoEs also measure CgA, glucagon and PP more often. The majority of German CoEs also determine CgA. With regard to pituitary screening (Table 2), 93% of CoE screen with prolactin and 80% with insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF‐1). Additionally thyroid hormones are measured frequently. Sex hormones (including gonadotropins) and cortisol are measured less frequently as part of screening, CoEs with ≥ 50 patients less often than CoEs with < 50 patients. No country‐specific pattern regarding pituitary biochemical screening was observed (Figure S1).

Biochemical screening in asymptomatic adults with MEN1.

3.2.2 Gastrinoma diagnosis and esophagogastroduodenoscopy

Nearly all CoEs use FSG for diagnosing gastrinoma, in 55% of cases combined with gastric pH and less often other tests (Table 3). The secretin stimulation test is used by 10 CoEs from 8 different countries (Figure S2H). No differences are seen based on MEN1 patient volume (Table 3) or country (Figure S2). Most reported use of EGD is for regular screening/surveillance in patients with hypergastrinemia or for specific indications (Table 3). Larger volume CoEs perform routine EGD in patients with hypergastrinemia more often, but this was not significant (Table 3). Gastric pH is more often determined in some countries including the UK and Germany (Figure S2). In Italy, many CoEs use the secretin stimulation test in contrast to other countries (Figure S2).

### Replacement of oral proton pump inhibitors with intravenous pantoprazole to effectively control gastric acid hypersecretion in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome [^113ZzdMo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) or other conditions requiring oral doses of proton pump inhibitors, it frequently becomes necessary to use parenterally administered gastric acid inhibitors. However, i.v. histamine-2 receptor antagonists are not effective at usual doses and lose their effectiveness because of tachyphlaxis. With the approval in the United States of i.v. pantoprazole, a substituted benzimidazole available in i.v. formulation, it will become possible to acutely manage gastric acid secretion in the acute care setting of a hospital. This study was developed to monitor the safety and establish the efficacy of i.v. pantoprazole as an alternative to oral proton pump inhibitors for the control of gastric acid hypersecretion in patients with ZES.

Methods

The efficacy of replacing oral PPI therapy with i.v. pantoprazole was evaluated in 14 ZES patients. After study enrollment, patients taking their current doses of oral PPI (omeprazole or lansoprazole) were switched to pantoprazole i.v. for 6 days during an 8-day inpatient period in the clinical research center. Effective control was defined as an acid output (AO) of < 10 mEq/h (< 5 mEq/h in patients with prior gastric acid-reducing surgery).

Results

The mean age of the 14 patients enrolled in the study was 52.4 yr (range = 38–67). Mean basal AO was 0.55 ± 0.32 mEq/h and mean fasting gastrin was 1089 pg/ml (range = 36–3720). Four patients were also diagnosed with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type I syndrome, nine were male, and two had previously undergone acid-reducing surgery. Before study enrollment, gastric acid hypersecretion was controlled in nine of 14 patients with omeprazole (20–200 mg daily) and five of 14 with lansoprazole (30–210 mg daily). In the oral phase of the study all patients had adequate control of gastric acid secretion, with a mean AO of 0.55 ± 0.32 mEq/h (mean ± SEM). Thereafter, 80 mg of i.v. pantoprazole was administered b.i.d. for 7 days by a brief (15 min) infusion and the dose was titrated upward to a predetermined maximum of 240 mg/24 h to control AO. A dose of 80 mg b.i.d. of i.v. pantoprazole controlled AO in 13 of 14 of the patients (93%) for the duration of the study (p > 0.05 compared to baseline values for all timepoints). One sporadic ZES patient (oral control value = 0.65 mEq/h on 100 mg of omeprazole b.i.d. p.o.) was not controlled with 80 mg of i.v. pantoprazole b.i.d. and dosage was titrated upward to 120 mg b.i.d. after day 2.

Conclusions

There were no serious adverse events observed. Intravenous pantoprazole provides gastric acid secretory control that is equivalent to the acid suppression observed with oral proton pump inhibitors. Most ZES patients (93%) maintained effective control of AO previously established with oral PPIs when switched to 80 mg of i.v. pantoprazole b.i.d.; however, for difficult-to-control patients, doses > 80 mg b.i.d. may be required.

### Update on the clinical management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^114zvxQ1]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastric NETs are almost exclusively seen in patients with a gastrinoma, and patients with hypergastrinemia are therefore advised to undergo EGD surveillance for gastric NETs at least every 3 years.

Patients with MEN1 are screened for insulinoma by yearly history taking and fasting glucose. The gold standard for the biochemical diagnosis of insulinoma in patients fulfilling Whipple's triad is a supervised fast. Although multiple insulinomas do occur in 8%–40% in surgical series, most of the multiple PanNETs comprise a single insulinoma and multiple concomitant NF‐PanNETs. For determining surgical strategy, correctly identifying the insulinoma is very important. In this respect, 68 Ga‐Exendin‐4 PET‐CT is very promising.

4.1.3 Intervention

Presently, surgery is the only curative treatment for MEN1‐related dpNETs. However duodenopancreatic surgery is associated with high short‐ and long‐term morbidity. Therefore careful consideration of timing and extent of surgery in multidisciplinary teams in centres of excellence is necessary. Especially since new NETs will likely develop in the remnant duodenopancreatic tissue due to the hereditary background.

Current consensus is that surgical resection in NF‐PanNETs is indicated for those > 2 cm or progressing during surveillance. Presence of suspicious lymph nodes and — if tissue is available — a WHO grade ≥ 2 may also guide intervention decisions.

For MEN1‐related gastrinomas, the if, when and how of a surgical intervention are still controversial and there is an excellent review on the contemporary surgical management by the Marburg team. Important considerations are (1) the often excellent long‐term survival of patients with gastrinomas even in the absence of surgical management (2) acid‐related complications usually can be very effectively controlled with high‐dose PPI (3) approximately a quarter of the patients will develop distant metastases and approximately 15% shows aggressive growth and we currently cannot adequately predict in which category an individual patient will fall (4) cure for MEN1‐related gastrinoma can be achieved if the right organ (duodenum) is addressed and systematic local lymph node resection is performed and (5) such a surgery is associated with high morbidity.

### Identification of Helicobacter pylori-related gastric cancer risk using serological gastritis markers and endoscopic findings: a large-scale retrospective cohort study [^112d58yv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

We enrolled 22,736 patients who underwent endoscopic examination and serum marker evaluations at Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan, between 1990 and 2014. First, we removed duplicate data and excluded patients with missing values. We checked the medical records, and 8448 patients were matched with the Hiroshima Prefecture Regional Cancer Registry Database by name, sex, address, and birth date. In this database, the death certificate notification, death certificate only, and incidence mortality ratio were 6.7%, 4.1%, and 2.53, respectively.

We processed the medical records and excluded patients with possible confounding factors for PG levels, such as proton pump inhibitor use, prior successful eradication therapy, post-gastrectomy, severe hepatorenal dysfunction, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, and autoimmune gastritis. Among the remaining 5131 patients, we reviewed records of endoscopic examinations and selected 1507 patients (mean age, 62.5 years; 985 men and 522 women) who underwent endoscopic examination more than three months after blood sampling. For cancer-free patients, we considered the latest day of endoscopic examination without findings of gastric cancer as a censored case.

Evaluation of serum markers

Fasting blood samples were collected from participants, and the serum samples were stored at − 20 °C until use. Serum PG I and PG II levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (Abbott, Tokyo, Japan) from 1990 to 1999, chemiluminescent immunoassay (Abbott) from 1999 to 2001, enzyme immunoassay (E-plate test; Eiken, Tokyo, Japan) from 2001 to 2003, and latex agglutination test (L-Z test; Eiken) from 2003 to 2014. Patients with PG I levels > 70 ng/mL or PG I/PG II levels > 3 ng/mL were considered to have high PG levels. Serum Hp-Ab titers were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (E-plate; Eiken). The cut-off value was set to 3 U/mL. Using the definition of the ABC method, we classified patients with high PG levels and negative Hp-Ab, high PG levels and positive Hp-Ab, low PG levels and positive Hp-Ab and low PG levels and negative Hp-Ab, into groups A, B, C and D, respectively.

### Lansoprazole (Prevacid) [^116ZCs3w]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.10	Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome

In open studies of 57 patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with or without multiple endocrine adenomas, PREVACID significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion and controlled associated symptoms of diarrhea, anorexia and pain. Doses ranging from 15 mg every other day to 180 mg per day maintained basal acid secretion below 10 mEq/hr in patients without prior gastric surgery and below 5 mEq/hr in patients with prior gastric surgery.

Initial doses were titrated to the individual patient need, and adjustments were necessary with time in some patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. PREVACID was well-tolerated at these high-dose levels for prolonged periods (greater than four years in some patients). In most ZES patients, serum gastrin levels were not modified by PREVACID. However, in some patients, serum gastrin increased to levels greater than those present prior to initiation of lansoprazole therapy [see Indications and Usage (1.10)].

### Risk factors for esophagitis in extreme acid hypersecretors with and without Zollinger-Ellison syndrome [^114re6k8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Whereas severe duodenal ulcer is the hallmark of acid hypersecretion in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZE) and similar states, the esophagus also is at high risk. We quantified the incidence of esophagitis and various risk factors that might contribute to it.

Methods

Sixty-eight acid hypersecretors (basal acid output > 15 mmol/h), 50 patients with ZE, and 18 patients without ZE with normal gastrin levels were studied by gastric analysis, serum gastrin levels, and endoscopy. In 44 of 68 patients, esophageal manometry was performed after the esophagus had healed.

Results

Erosive esophagitis, grade 2 or worse, was found in 65%; an additional 15% had heartburn only, for a total reflux disease incidence of 80%. ZE accounted for 95% of severe esophagitis. Patients with and without esophagitis had the same high overnight fasting gastric residual volume and acidity, as well as basal and peak acid and pepsin outputs. However, patients with esophagitis had a lower median lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) of 15.5 vs. 23 mm Hg in those without symptoms; the critical discriminator threshold was 16 mm Hg. Multivariate analysis further identified frequent vomiting and obesity as positive predictors of esophagitis, whereas Helicobacter pylori was a strong negative predictor (odds ratio, 0.16), possibly related to an elevated LESP in patients infected with H. pylori.

Conclusions

Erosive esophagitis is very common in acid hypersecretors. Identified risk factors that could promote abnormal esophageal exposure to the high acid and pepsin levels in our population of hypersecretors were vomiting, LESP < 16 mm Hg, and obesity, whereas H. pylori appeared to protect the esophagus not by reduced acid, but through an elevated LESP.

### Mutations in the SLCO ₂ A1 gene and primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy: a clinical and biochemical characterization [^111qBtcs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

We previously demonstrated that deficiency of the prostaglandin transporter (SLCO2A1) is a cause of primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO). However, its clinical and metabolic characteristics have not been well defined.

Objective

The objective of the study was to expand this mutational spectrum to better delineate the SLCO2A1 deficiency phenotype and investigate the clinical and metabolic characteristics of a cohort of subjects with PHO.

Design, Setting, Patients, and Main Outcome Measure

Eleven affected individuals and their available healthy family members from 9 unrelated Chinese families with PHO (7 of which were previously undescribed) were clinically studied. The SLCO2A1 gene was screened and analyzed. Urinary levels of prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) and prostaglandin E metabolite (PGE-M) were measured using competitive ELISAs. The serum levels of total T, estradiol, sex hormone-binding protein, LH, FSH, and fasting gastrin were detected.

Results

Nine different SLCO2A1 mutations were identified in affected individuals in the 7 previously undescribed families, 7 of which (Glu165X, Ala286GlnfsX35, Gln356AlafsX77, Gly369Asp, Gly379Glu, Glu465Lys, and c.861+2T > C) were novel. The urinary levels of PGE₂ and PGE-M were much higher in the SLCO2A1-deficient individuals and decreased with age. There was no relationship between sex hormones and PGE₂ or PGE-M. There was no significant difference in the levels of fasting serum gastrin between PHO patients with watery diarrhea and their relatives.

Conclusions

The present findings broaden the allelic spectrum of SLCO2A1 mutations. The urinary levels of PGE₂ and PGE-M in the SLCO2A1-deficient individuals decreased with age. The measurement of the excreted PGE₂ and PGE-M may have implications in the differential diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of PHO.

### Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: classical considerations and current controversies [^114xBB5q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is an endocrinopathy characterized by gastrin-secreting tumors, responsible for causing the formation of multiple, refractory, and recurrent peptic ulcers in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum. Two main variants have been described, sporadic and those found in association with parathyroid and pituitary tumors, a genetic disorder known as multiple endocrine neoplasia-1 (MEN-1). Biochemical serum evaluation for elevated gastrin, followed by radiological or nuclear localization of the primary lesion, is mandated for establishing diagnosis. The mainstays of treatment include management of hypersecretory state with medical suppression of gastric acid production and surgical resection of primary tumor for the prevention of malignant transformation and metastatic complications. Medical therapy with proton pump inhibitors has virtually eliminated the need for acid-reducing surgical procedures. Surgical approach to sporadic and MEN-1-associated ZES varies based on our understanding of the natural history of the condition and the probability of cure; however, resection to a negative microscopic margin is indicated in both cases. Postoperative surveillance involves measurement of gastrin level, followed by imaging if elevation is detected. Re-excision of recurrent or resection of metastatic disease is a subject of controversy; however, at the present time aggressive cytoreductive approach is favored.

### Current best practice in the management of neuroendocrine tumors [^114qHQZK]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Gastroduodenal NENs

Gastric NENs (g-NENs) originate from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells located in the gastric glands and are divided in three categories: type 1 that are associated with achlorhydria and chronic atrophic gastritis; type 2 that are related to Zollinger–Ellison syndrome; and type 3 gastric NENs that are rare and more aggressive tumors not related to any gastric mucosal abnormality.

Type 1 tumors are the most common (70–80%) and are of low malignant potential, usually being grade 1 neoplasms. They are typically found as polypoid lesions, usually multiple, in the gastric body and fundus during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and are thought to derive from preceding ECL-hyperplastic lesions, that are usually discovered in the neighboring mucosa. Fasting gastrin serum levels should be determined and are always increased while CgA levels may also be elevated. Further evaluation should include screening for anti-parietal and anti-intrinsic factor autoantibodies as well as for autoimmune thyroiditis.

G-NENs type 1 display a low metastatic risk directly associated with the tumor size. EUS helps to determine the depth of tumor invasion in the gastric wall. ENETS guidelines recommend resection of lesions > 10 mm or those affecting the muscularis propria. Surveillance or resection can be selected for tumors < 10 mm as there are no randomized data comparing the two options and recent studies have observed no tumor-related deaths in patients who were submitted to endoscopic surveillance. Biopsy forceps can be used for small lesions but endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is generally recommended for lesions > 5 mm. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is useful for the removal of submucosal lesions as it has the benefit of en-bloc resection allowing for complete histological examination. Local excision or partial gastrectomy should be considered in the case of invasion beyond the submucosa or positive resection margins after EMR, or in those of higher grade. In addition, surgery should be performed in the case of lymph node or distant metastases, or in poorly differentiated tumors. Surgical antrectomy could be an option to suppress hypergastrinemia, but the completeness of antrectomy is debated so this alternative is not widely recommended.

### Withdrawing PPI therapy after healing esophagitis does not worsen symptoms or cause persistent hypergastrinemia: analysis of dexlansoprazole MR clinical trial data [^115AzRYQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVES:

Withdrawal of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may induce symptoms in healthy volunteers, suggesting that discontinuing PPI therapy induces acid-peptic disease. Similar assessments in patients with documented acid-related disorders are lacking.

METHODS:

We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 287 Helicobacter pylori -negative erosive esophagitis (EE) patients healed after 4 or 8 weeks of therapy with dexlansoprazole modified release (MR) or lansoprazole, and then randomized to placebo in 6-month maintenance trials. We compared serum gastrin levels and 24-h heartburn severity before enrollment in the healing trials (baseline) and after receiving placebo in the 6-month maintenance trials.

RESULTS:

Mean gastrin values at maintenance months 1 and 3 were essentially unchanged (median changes, 1.0 and −1.0 pg/ml), showing that gastrin normalized within 1 month of discontinuing PPIs and remained flat. Mean heartburn severity at maintenance month 1 was < 1 on a 5-point scale (1 = mild) and significantly lower than at baseline (median decrease, 0.41 points; P ≤ 0.001). Heartburn severity in patients healed at week 4 or 8 with either PPI was generally similar, suggesting that neither longer exposure nor more potent therapy was associated with rebound. In those with month 2 data, mean heartburn severity at months 1 and 2 was significantly lower than baseline (median decrease, 0.54 and 0.58 points; both P < 0.001), indicating an ongoing symptom response for 2 months after PPI withdrawal.

CONCLUSIONS:

In H. pylori -negative EE patients, there was no indication of recurring heartburn symptom worsening beyond baseline levels within 2 months of discontinuing 4–8 weeks of PPI therapy.

14.7 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions

In open studies of 136 patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions, such as Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) syndrome with or without multiple endocrine adenomas, omeprazole delayed-release capsules significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion and controlled associated symptoms of diarrhea, anorexia, and pain. Doses ranging from 20 mg every other day to 360 mg per day maintained basal acid secretion below 10 mEq/hr in patients without prior gastric surgery, and below 5 mEq/hr in patients with prior gastric surgery.

Initial doses were titrated to the individual patient need, and adjustments were necessary with time in some patients [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Omeprazole was well tolerated at these high dose levels for prolonged periods (> 5 years in some patients). In most ZE patients, serum gastrin levels were not modified by omeprazole. However, in some patients serum gastrin increased to levels greater than those present prior to initiation of omeprazole therapy. At least 11 patients with ZE syndrome on long-term treatment with omeprazole developed gastric carcinoids. These findings are believed to be a manifestation of the underlying condition, which is known to be associated with such tumors, rather than the result of the administration of omeprazole [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in older patients with subnormal or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations [^112HHdyc]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the effect of small doses of oral cyanocobalamin supplements in older patients with low or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations but no other evidence of pernicious anemia (PA).

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy of oral cyanocobalamin 10 microg and 50 microg daily for 1 month.

Setting

Two geriatric hospitals in the North Western Health Care Network, Melbourne, Australia.

Participants

Thirty-one inpatients with serum vitamin B12 levels between 100 and 150 pmol/L, without PA, other malabsorption disorders, or progressive neurological or terminal illness. The mean age was 81.4 years.

Intervention

After informed consent, a medical and drug history was taken and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) completed. A dietitian made assessment of oral cobalamin intake. Blood was taken for serum vitamin B12, serum and red cell folate assay, full blood examination, fasting serum gastrin, parietal and intrinsic factor antibodies, fasting serum homocysteine, and creatinine. Patients were then randomized to receive 10 microg oral cyanocobalamin, 50 microg oral cyanocobalamin, or placebo treatment for 1 month, after which the investigations and clinical examinations were repeated.

Measurements

Percentage change in the level of vitamin B12, homocysteine, folate, and red cell parameters and absolute changes in MMSE were calculated and compared between groups. The groups were compared on the number of responders who improved their level of B12 by 20%. Chi-square calculations on changes in serum vitamin B12 concentration were also performed.

Results

Mean serum vitamin B12 ± standard deviation improved by 51.7 ± 47.1% in the 50-microg group, 40.2 ± 34.4% in the 10-microg group, and 11.7 ± 24.5% in the placebo group. The change in the 50-microg cyanocobalamin group was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (P = 0.044). The change in the 10-microg cyanocobalamin group was not significantly different from that in the placebo group (P = 0.186). Eight of 10 subjects in each treatment group were classified as responders, compared with two of 11 in the placebo group (P = 0.004). Homocysteine levels fell in patients receiving cyanocobalamin, but this fall failed to reach statistical significance. There were no significant changes in the other parameters measured.

Conclusion

Cyanocobalamin supplementation of 50 microg but not 10 microg daily produced a significant increase in serum vitamin B12. This result has implications for the management of patients with subnormal or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations and for food fortification with vitamin B12.

### Dyspeptic symptom development after discontinuation of a proton pump inhibitor: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115Haxdz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Conflicting data exist on whether discontinuation of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is associated with rebound secretion of gastric acid.

Methods

A total of 48 healthy Helicobacter pylori-negative volunteers (24 females) were randomized in a double-blinded manner to treatment with either pantoprazole 40 mg or placebo once daily for 28 days. Dyspeptic symptoms were registered daily using the Glasgow dyspepsia score (GDS) 2 weeks before, during, and 6 weeks after treatment. Plasma levels of gastrin and serum levels of chromogranin-A levels were measured before, during, and after treatment.

Results

During the 2 weeks before treatment, the placebo group had a mean GDS of 0.20 + or - 0.7 compared with the pantoprazole group score of 0.54 + or - 1.3 (NS). No significant differences between the symptom severity scores of the two groups were shown during the treatment period. During the first week after discontinuation of treatment, the pantoprazole group had a mean symptom score of 5.7 + or - 11.7 vs. 0.74 + or - 2.6 in the placebo group (P < 0.01). A total of 11 out of 25 (44%) subjects in the pantoprazole group developed dyspepsia compared with 2 out of 23 (9%) in the placebo group (P < 0.01). During the second week of follow-up, the pantoprazole group had a mean symptom score of 1.6 + or - 3.4 compared with 0 + or - 0 in the placebo group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the mean symptom score for the pantoprazole group (1.1 + or - 0.6) compared with the placebo group (0.4 + or - 0.3) during the third week of follow-up. Symptom scores during the first week after treatment correlated with basal (P < 0.01) and meal-stimulated (P < 0.01) gastrin levels at the end of treatment.

Conclusions

A 4-week course of pantoprazole seems to induce dyspeptic symptoms in previously asymptomatic healthy H. pylori-negative subjects. The correlation between symptom score and gastrin levels suggests that these symptoms are due to acid rebound hypersecretion and seem to be related to the degree of acid inhibition.

### Symptom management for well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: ASCO guideline [^113Ht7yp]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Gastrinoma (Zollinger–Ellison Syndrome) — acid suppression, surgery, and monitoring: Gastrinomas are most frequently located in the duodenum (70%) or pancreas (25%), comprise 15% of all panNETs, and diagnosis is challenging because use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can improve symptoms and delay a diagnosis of NETs. Surgical resection is only successful for < 50% of patients with gastrinoma in the long term, and SSAs have been recommended for these tumors for their antiproliferative effects. The PPI recommendation is for long-acting PPIs such as omeprazole (60 mg once per day) or equivalent dose of lansoprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, and dexlansoprazole, once or twice a day, and twice-daily therapy is recommended to protect against acute absorption problems. PPIs cause prolonged inhibition of gastric acid secretion (> 3–4 days) and are highly effective for inhibiting gastric acid secretion of patients with ZES and other conditions, and monitoring of vitamin B12 levels is suggested because of the potential for malabsorption because of hypochlorhydria.

14.5 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions

In open studies of 136 patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions, such as Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) syndrome with or without multiple endocrine adenomas, omeprazole delayed-release capsules significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion and controlled associated symptoms of diarrhea, anorexia, and pain. Doses ranging from 20 mg every other day to 360 mg per day maintained basal acid secretion below 10 mEq/hr in patients without prior gastric surgery, and below 5 mEq/hr in patients with prior gastric surgery.

Initial doses were titrated to the individual patient need, and adjustments were necessary with time in some patients [See Dosage and Administration (2)] omeprazole was well tolerated at these high dose levels for prolonged periods (> 5 years in some patients). In most ZE patients, serum gastrin levels were not modified by omeprazole. However, in some patients serum gastrin increased to levels greater than those present prior to initiation of omeprazole therapy. At least 11 patients with ZE syndrome on long-term treatment with omeprazole developed gastric carcinoids. These findings are believed to be a manifestation of the underlying condition, which is known to be associated with such tumors, rather than the result of the administration of omeprazole.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111Zm1a7]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although somatostatin analogues (octreotide or lanreotide) could be used to reduce serum gastrin and gastric acid secretion, initial treatment is aimed at controlling the hypersecretion of gastric acid with an antisecretory drug. Dose titration using gastric acid analysis is the ideal way to best determine the lowest effective dose of medical therapy. Indeed, giving enough medication just to control symptoms is not considered adequate, and it is important that acid secretion is reduced below 10 mEq/h (or below 5 mEq/h in the post-surgical stomach) to avoid ulcer recurrence and complications. According to available guidelines, a PPI is the drug of choice, but high doses (3–4 times the standard dose, once daily) are required compared with those used in other acid-related disorders. Patients with complicated ZES (severe GERD, Billroth II resections, and MEN-1 with untreated hyperparathyroidism, etc.) are more difficult to treat and may require twice-a-day PPI dosing. The intravenous route (e.g. pantoprazole 80 mg every 8 hours) may be required initially. Once symptoms have been controlled, the tumor can be investigated for surgical excision. When curative removal is not possible, antisecretory therapy must be continued indefinitely. In patients who have undergone successful curative gastrinoma resection, PPIs may also be required because, in more than half of them, a hypersecretory state persists. Interruption of PPI treatment (and consequent acid rebound) can have detrimental consequences, including severe peptic complications (strictures, perforations, etc.). Patient compliance to treatment is, therefore, crucial and should be regularly assessed. Over time, many patients could have the drug dose lowered.

The efficacy and safety of PPIs has revolutionized the management of ZES, so that total gastrectomy is no longer required. Long-term antisecretory treatment with PPIs has remained effective for more than 10 years, without development of tachyphylaxis or any dose-related adverse effect. Even at the high doses required for patients with ZES, PPIs have a notable record of safety. An analysis of ZES patients can provide important insights into some of the safety issues, concerning long-term acid suppression.

### Perforated peptic ulcer [^112sMM9X]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

A diurnal peak of ulcer perforations has been observed with more perforations occurring in the morning, possibly related to circadian variation in acid-secretion. Perforation risk is increased by fasting, such as during Ramadan, which may also be due to variation in acid release and exposure. Ulcer perforation is noted to occur after bariatric surgery, after crack-cocaine or amphetamine use, and after chemotherapy with angiogenesis inhibitors such as bevacizumab. Patients with acid-hypersecretion, including those with a gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) are at risk for perforationand a gastrinoma should be ruled out in patients with multiple or recurrent ulcers.

Validation of serum gastrin concentrations and comparison between patients with high and normal gastrin concentrations in the endoscopically-evaluated group.

We evaluated the diagnostic performance of normal serum concentrations of gastrin as determined from laboratory values for normal stomach patients, who were diagnosed as such by pathological evaluation. This normal concentration of gastrin was then used to distinguish patients with atrophic gastritis from true A in the endoscopically-evaluated group (Fig. 2 a). The optimal cut-off value of gastrin, according to the Youden index, was 96 pg/mL. The cut-off value based on the upper limit of the serum concentration of gastrin in normal stomach cases in the pathologically-evaluated group was 126.03 pg/mL. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for gastritis at the cut-off value of 126.03 pg/mL were 52.8%, 92.6%, 97.0%, and 31.0%, respectively. In addition, ROC curves showed high diagnostic performance of gastrin for gastritis, with an area under the ROC (AUC) curve of 0.80 (Fig. 2 b).

Patients with gastrin concentrations ≤ 126.03 pg/mL (cut-off value) were determined to have normal gastrin; these patients were significantly younger and included a higher proportion of true A patients than high gastrin group. These patients also had significantly lower serum PG II concentrations and a significantly higher PG I concentration and PG I/II ratio. There was no significant difference in the number of patients who developed cancer at follow-up between the high and normal gastrin groups (Table 4).

### Peptic ulcer disease… [^115MCixn]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease refers to damage of the inner part of the stomach's gastric mucosa, the first part of the small intestine, or sometimes the lower esophagus. An ulcer in the stomach is called a gastric ulcer, while one in the first part of the intestines is a duodenal ulcer. The most common symptoms of a duodenal ulcer are waking at night with upper abdominal pain, and upper abdominal pain that improves with eating. With a gastric ulcer, the pain may worsen with eating. The pain is often described as a burning or dull ache. Other symptoms include belching, vomiting, weight loss, or poor appetite. About a third of older people with peptic ulcers have no symptoms. Complications may include bleeding, perforation, and blockage of the stomach. Bleeding occurs in as many as 15% of cases. Older people are more sensitive to the ulcer-causing effects of NSAIDs.

The diagnosis is typically suspected due to the presenting symptoms with confirmation by either endoscopy or barium swallow. H. pylori can be diagnosed by testing the blood for antibodies, a urea breath test, testing the stool for signs of the bacteria, or a biopsy of the stomach. Other conditions that produce similar symptoms include stomach cancer, coronary heart disease, and inflammation of the stomach lining or gallbladder inflammation. Diet does not play an important role in either causing or preventing ulcers. Treatment includes stopping smoking, stopping use of NSAIDs, stopping alcohol, and taking medications to decrease stomach acid. The medication used to decrease acid is usually either a proton pump inhibitor or an H2 blocker, with four weeks of treatment initially recommended.
- abdominal pain, classically epigastric, strongly correlated with mealtimes.

In case of duodenal ulcers, the pain appears about three hours after taking a meal and wakes the person from sleep;
- bloating and abdominal fullness;
- waterbrash;.
- nausea and copious vomiting;
- loss of appetite and weight loss, in gastric ulcer;
- weight gain, in duodenal ulcer, as the pain is relieved by eating;
- hematemesis; this can occur due to bleeding directly from a gastric ulcer or from damage to the esophagus from severe/continuing vomiting. In people over the age of 45 with more than two weeks of the above symptoms, the odds for peptic ulceration are high enough to warrant rapid investigation by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The timing of symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers.

A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal, associated with nausea and vomiting, as gastric acid production is increased as food enters the stomach. Pain in duodenal ulcers would be aggravated by hunger and relieved by a meal and is associated with night pain. A burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach area lasting between 30 minutes and 3 hours commonly accompanies ulcers. This pain can be misinterpreted as hunger, indigestion, or heartburn. Pain is usually caused by the ulcer, but it may be aggravated by the stomach acid when it comes into contact with the ulcerated area. The pain caused by peptic ulcers can be felt anywhere from the navel up to the sternum, it may last from a few minutes to several hours, and it may be worse when the stomach is empty. Also, sometimes the pain may flare at night, and it can commonly be temporarily relieved by eating foods that buffer stomach acid or by taking anti-acid medication.

### Gastritis… [^116zk7Kk]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Gastritis is the inflammation of the lining of the stomach. It may occur as a short episode or may be of a long duration. There may be no symptoms but, when symptoms are present, the most common is upper abdominal pain. Other possible symptoms include nausea and vomiting, bloating, indigestion, loss of appetite and heartburn. Complications may include stomach bleeding, stomach ulcers, and stomach tumors. When due to autoimmune problems, low red blood cells due to not enough vitamin B12 may occur, a condition known as pernicious anemia. Endoscopy, a type of X-ray known as an upper gastrointestinal series, blood tests, and stool tests may help with diagnosis. Other conditions with similar symptoms include inflammation of the pancreas, gallbladder problems, and peptic ulcer disease. Signs and symptoms Many people with gastritis experience no symptoms at all.

However, upper central abdominal pain is the most common symptom; the pain may be dull, vague, burning, aching, gnawing, sore, or sharp. Pain is usually located in the upper central portion of the abdomen, but it may occur anywhere from the upper left portion of the abdomen around to the back. Other signs and symptoms may include the following:

- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Belching
- Bloating
- Early satiety
- Loss of appetite. Causes There are two categories of gastritis depending on the cause of the disease. There is erosive gastritis, for which the common causes are stress, alcohol, some drugs, such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and Crohn's disease. And, there is non-erosive gastritis, for which the most common cause is a Helicobacter pylori infection.

Helicobacter pylori Helicobacter pylori colonizes the stomachs of more than half of the world's population, and the infection continues to play a key role in the pathogenesis of a number of gastroduodenal diseases. Colonization of the gastric mucosa with Helicobacter pylori results in the development of chronic gastritis in infected individuals and, in a subset of patients, chronic gastritis progresses to complications. Critical illness Gastritis may also develop after major surgery or traumatic injury, burns, or severe infections. Gastritis may also occur in those who have had weight loss surgery resulting in the banding or reconstruction of the digestive tract.

Autoimmune Autoimmune gastritis, also known as pernicious anemia, is a chronic asymptomatic gastritis caused by an autoimmune attack on the cells that create intrinsic factor in the stomach, necessary for absorption of vitamin B12. This can result in a type of anemia, and an irreversible neurological damage, if left untreated. Diet Evidence does not support a role for specific foods, including spicy foods and coffee, in the development of peptic ulcers. People are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them. There is little specific advice on diet published by authoritative sources. The National Health Service of the United Kingdom advises avoiding spicy, acidic or fried foods which may irritate the stomach. Pathophysiology Acute Acute erosive gastritis typically involves discrete foci of surface necrosis due to damage to mucosal defenses.

### Evaluation of epigastric discomfort and management… [^112Q91CJ]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement recently published a guideline on the evaluation and management of dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The guideline, available online atwww. icsi. org, applies to the treatment of adult male patients and nonpregnant adult female patients who have had epigastric discomfort on more than 25 percent of days during the previous four weeks. The information does not apply to patients with symptoms that are characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatic disease, or biliary tract disease. Dyspepsia The procedure of choice for the evaluation of dyspepsia is endoscopy. If a radiologist with special training in gastrointestinal radiology is available, multiphase barium upper gastrointestinal studies are an acceptable alternative.

When a patient presents with dyspepsia, the physician should be alert for "alarm features" that may signal the presence of an underlying disease that requires urgent endoscopic evaluation and treatment. The ICSI suggests performance of endoscopy within one day if a patient with dyspepsia has melena, hematemesis, or acute-onset dysphagia, and within seven to 10 days if the patient has anemia, persistent vomiting, or involuntary loss of more than 5 percent of body weight. The ICSI notes that referral to a gastroenterologist is appropriate when a patient has a documented history of ulcer. When a patient presents with dyspepsia and a documented history of ulcer but has no alarm features or reflux symptoms, case management begins with serologic testing for. If H. pylori testing is positive, the ICSI recommends eradicative therapy. If H.

pylori testing is negative, the patient should be given full-dose histamine-H 2 receptor agonist therapy; in addition, consideration should be given to stopping smoking, if indicated, and, if possible, discontinuing the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If the patient with dyspepsia has no documented ulcer, the likelihood of GERD is extremely high when the primary symptom is heartburn or acid regurgitation. An algorithm for the management of GERD is presented in Figure 2. If a patient with dyspepsia but no GERD or documented ulcer is 50 years or older, the ICSI notes that it is appropriate to perform nonurgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy to rule out gastric cancer. Patients younger than 50 years should be tested for. H. pylori. If the serologic test is positive, eradicative therapy should be given.

If the test is negative, the ICSI recommends empiric in H 2RA therapy; addition, smoking cessation and stopping NSAID use should be considered. If NSAID use cannot be discontinued, a 12-week duration of therapy is recommended. With treatment, symptoms of gastric and duodenal ulcers generally improve after four weeks. Data suggest that antiulcer treatment should be continued for eight weeks. In most patients, H 2RA therapy is most effective. H 2RA therapy should be continued for a total of 12 weeks in the patient who needs NSAID therapy for the treatment of peptic ulcers, especially gastric ulcers. If the patient does not relapse within 12 months, the dyspepsia has resolved. If relapse occurs, endoscopy should be performed. If symptoms do not improve after four weeks despite treatment, the ICSI recommends endoscopy. If the endoscopic examination reveals an ulcer, biopsy for. H. pylori or a urea breath test should be performed.
