## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about rhabdomyolysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining rhabdomyolysis and establishing diagnostic thresholds. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why it matters clinically. Next, I will classify etiologies and identify high-risk populations. After that, I need to outline clinical presentation and the diagnostic workup, including pitfalls. Then, I will assess complications and risk stratification. Finally, I will detail acute management, special scenarios, and follow-up, and close with prevention and counseling, making sure each step is supported by appropriate sources and that I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic thresholds, because everything else hinges on getting this right. Rhabdomyolysis is best conceptualized as a clinical syndrome of skeletal muscle breakdown with release of intracellular contents into the circulation, typically defined by muscle symptoms plus a creatine kinase (CK) elevation greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater than 1000 IU/L, with myoglobinuria and acute kidney injury (AKI) indicating more severe disease; however, I should note that some authors use a more stringent CK threshold around 50,000 IU/L to define exertional rhabdomyolysis, which I will reconcile shortly [^1123GacT] [^114qoNNp] [^117Dh53T]. Wait, let me verify the timing of CK dynamics: CK typically rises within 12 hours, peaks at 24–72 hours, and returns toward baseline over about 5 days, which is crucial for interpreting serial measurements and planning follow-up labs [^113vW8Xu].

> Hold on, I should verify the pathophysiology before moving to management implications. The unifying mechanism is sarcolemmal disruption with unregulated calcium influx, ATP depletion, and activation of calcium-dependent proteases leading to myocyte necrosis; myoglobin released into plasma can precipitate in the renal tubules, especially in acidic urine, contributing to cast formation, tubular obstruction, and oxidant injury, while hypovolemia and renal vasoconstriction further amplify AKI risk; reperfusion after ischemia can exacerbate injury via reactive oxygen species, which is why early, aggressive volume expansion is foundational [^117SPTVb] [^114BLNZp] [^111mXdEU].

> Next, I should review etiologies and make sure I capture both traumatic and nontraumatic causes. Traumatic causes include crush injury, prolonged compression or immobilization, and compartment syndrome; nontraumatic causes include exertion, drugs and toxins (notably statins, especially with CYP3A4 interactions, and illicit substances), infections (viral myositis is common in pediatrics), metabolic derangements, genetic myopathies, and temperature extremes such as heat stroke or malignant hyperthermia; I need to emphasize that in children, infections predominate, whereas in older adults, immobilization after falls is frequent [^113rKW9S] [^115WUnUi] [^111BbLJD] [^1158gJ38].

> I will now examine the clinical presentation, but wait, let me verify that I am not over-relying on the classic triad. Patients may present with myalgia, weakness, and swelling of affected muscle groups, and dark tea- or cola-colored urine suggests myoglobinuria. However, many cases are subtle or asymptomatic, so a high index of suspicion is warranted in the right context, particularly in trauma, exertional settings, or with nephrotoxic drugs, and symptoms may lag hours to days after the inciting event [^113Nf4QD] [^114ij2Pr].

> Let me think about the diagnostic workup and ensure I do not miss key tests. Core labs include serial CK (often peaking 24–72 hours), basic metabolic panel with electrolytes, creatinine, and bicarbonate, liver enzymes recognizing AST/ALT may be elevated from muscle injury, LDH, phosphate, calcium, and urinalysis with dipstick for blood in the absence of RBCs suggesting myoglobinuria. I should double-check that myoglobin testing is supportive but not required, given its short half-life and variable availability, and that risk tools like the McMahon score can help prognosticate AKI or mortality risk, though they do not dictate therapy [^113vW8Xu] [^114qoNNp] [^115jGSJ2].

> But wait, what if the CK is only modestly elevated — does that exclude rhabdomyolysis? I should confirm that no safe CK threshold excludes renal risk, and that clinical context plus end-organ involvement matters more than a single number; indeed, AKI has been reported at CK levels around 5000 IU/L, and risk prediction models incorporate demographics, etiology, and biochemical markers rather than CK alone, so I need to avoid anchoring on CK magnitude without the full picture [^112WZ4M1] [^115jGSJ2].

> Next, I should review complications and risk stratification, and I need to ensure I prioritize life-threatening issues. AKI is the most common systemic complication, occurring in roughly 10–55% depending on the cohort, with higher mortality in ICU populations and when rhabdomyolysis coexists with AKI. Hyperkalemia can precipitate arrhythmias, compartment syndrome may evolve silently, and metabolic acidosis is common. I should confirm that risk tools and serial assessments guide disposition and monitoring intensity rather than any single admission value [^117VtKA8] [^114Skvxb] [^111Bsg8M].

> Now, I will outline acute management, and I should double-check that I am aligning with consensus guidance. Immediate priorities are to stop further muscle injury, initiate early aggressive IV crystalloid resuscitation targeting urine output of 1–3 mL/kg/hour (up to about 300 mL/hour in adults), and correct electrolytes, especially hyperkalemia, without delay; either lactated Ringer's or saline (0.9% or 0.45%) is acceptable, with goal-directed titration to avoid both under-resuscitation and fluid overload; I should confirm that bicarbonate and mannitol are not routinely recommended for AKI prevention given insufficient evidence, though bicarbonate may be used to correct systemic acidosis if present [^115ZxpDm] [^1162Sowg] [^1138FSbc] [^115FbbjU] [^111bKUG1].

> Hold on, I should verify indications for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and avoid overcalling it. RRT is indicated for standard AKI indications such as refractory hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, volume overload, or uremic complications, and should not be initiated solely to prevent AKI in rhabdomyolysis; I need to ensure that oliguria or anuria refractory to fluids prompts timely nephrology involvement rather than escalating fluids indefinitely [^117L9yXt] [^1146qjuR].

> Let me consider special scenarios, starting with exertional rhabdomyolysis, and I should confirm when to investigate for underlying myopathy. Most cases reflect a physiological response to unaccustomed exertion and require rest, hydration, and graded return to activity; however, red flags such as recurrent episodes, disproportionate severity, family history, or persistent CK elevation warrant evaluation for genetic or metabolic muscle disease using a structured approach like the RHABDO schema and targeted testing; return-to-play should be cautious, typically avoiding strenuous activity until CK normalizes and symptoms resolve, then progressing slowly [^114yd8g7] [^115d6pPD] [^111q5ZbC].

> I need to check pediatric-specific nuances, because etiologies and outcomes differ. In children, viral infections are the leading cause, AKI occurs in about one fifth of cases, but progression to chronic kidney disease is uncommon. Management principles mirror adults with early IV fluids and close monitoring, and I should remember that COVID-19 can rarely present with rhabdomyolysis, so testing may be warranted in the right epidemiologic context [^111BbLJD] [^111t9w5z] [^113d7UUB].

> For older adults, let me reconsider the typical trigger and prognosis. Prolonged immobilization after falls is a frequent cause, and age-related comorbidities and polypharmacy, including statins, increase risk; I should confirm that mortality is nontrivial in this group, underscoring the need for early recognition, fall prevention, and careful medication reconciliation [^1158gJ38] [^111BGDUL].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring, and I need to ensure I specify lab cadence. Serial CK measurements should continue until a peak is identified and the trend is reliably downward, often over 24–72 hours, with electrolytes and renal function checked frequently; after discharge, CK and creatinine may still rise for several days, so repeating labs every 72 hours until CK is below 1000 IU/L and creatinine normalizes is prudent, and failure of CK to decline should prompt evaluation for ongoing injury or underlying myopathy [^111bexD2] [^113UztNd].

> Finally, I should address prevention and counseling, and I will double-check that I include practical advice. Prevention centers on hydration during exertion, heat acclimatization, avoiding risky drug combinations with statins, and recognizing early symptoms. Patients should be counseled that rhabdomyolysis can affect anyone, including elite athletes, and that dehydration does not cause rhabdomyolysis but worsens its complications, so prompt fluid intake and medical evaluation at the first sign of severe myalgia with dark urine are essential [^1129QRht] [^115NFtLi].

Rhabdomyolysis is a **clinical syndrome** characterized by skeletal muscle breakdown with release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream, most notably creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin, which can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) and electrolyte disturbances [^114hocVS] [^1123GacT]. Diagnosis relies on **CK > 5× ULN or > 1,000 IU/L**, with myoglobinuria and AKI indicating severity [^114qoNNp] [^1123GacT]. Management centers on **early aggressive IV fluids** to maintain urine output ≥ 1 mL/kg/h, correction of electrolytes, and monitoring for complications; sodium bicarbonate and diuretics are not routinely recommended for AKI prevention [^115ZxpDm] [^115FbbjU] [^111bKUG1]. Prognosis is generally favorable with prompt treatment, but AKI occurs in ~21% of pediatric cases and ~57% of older adults, and mortality is higher with delayed care or comorbidities [^111t9w5z] [^111BGDUL] [^111mXdEU].

---

## Pathophysiology

Muscle injury disrupts the sarcolemma, releasing **CK**, myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), potassium, phosphate, and intracellular calcium [^113vW8Xu]. Myoglobin precipitates in renal tubules, causing obstruction and **direct nephrotoxicity**, while hypovolemia and aciduria worsen renal injury [^112WZ4M1]. Electrolyte disturbances — **hyperkalemia**, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic acidosis — are common and can precipitate arrhythmias and other complications [^111Bsg8M].

---

## Etiology

Rhabdomyolysis has diverse causes; **trauma and exertion** are common, but medications, toxins, infections, metabolic disorders, and genetic factors also contribute [^115WUnUi]:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Traumatic | - Crush injuries <br/> - Compartment syndrome <br/> - Prolonged immobilization [^116SRnv9] |
| Non-traumatic | - Extreme exertion <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Heat stroke <br/> - Malignant hyperthermia [^115WUnUi] |
| Medications/toxins | - Statins <br/> - Fibrates <br/> - Cocaine <br/> - Alcohol <br/> - Snake venom [^115WUnUi] |
| Infections | - Influenza <br/> - COVID-19 <br/> - Legionella <br/> - Salmonella [^115WUnUi] |
| Metabolic/genetic | - Hypokalemia <br/> - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Glycogen storage diseases <br/> - Mitochondrial disorders [^116mXx2Z] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Classic features include **myalgia, muscle weakness, and dark urine (myoglobinuria)** [^114ij2Pr]. Additional findings may include swelling, tenderness, fever, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status [^113Nf4QD]. Symptoms typically develop within hours to days after the inciting event [^114ij2Pr].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Laboratory tests**: CK > 5× ULN or > 1,000 IU/L; myoglobin, LDH, potassium, creatinine, AST elevations support diagnosis [^114qoNNp] [^1123GacT].
- **Urine analysis**: Positive urine myoglobin (tea-colored urine) with absent RBCs on microscopy [^116mXx2Z].
- **Serial CK monitoring**: Peaks at 24–72 hours; downtrending CK indicates improvement [^113vW8Xu].

---

## Complications

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Occurs in ~21% of pediatric cases and ~57% of older adults [^111t9w5z] [^111BGDUL].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis [^111Bsg8M] [^112WZ4M1].
- **Compartment syndrome**: Requires urgent surgical intervention [^113UztNd].
- **Arrhythmias**: Due to electrolyte imbalances [^1138FSbc].

---

## Management

- **Immediate actions**: Stop the inciting cause, initiate aggressive IV fluids (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) targeting urine output ≥ 1 mL/kg/h [^115ZxpDm] [^113qDRET].
- **Electrolyte correction**: Prompt management of hyperkalemia, acidosis, and other abnormalities [^1138FSbc].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent CK, renal function, electrolytes, and urine output checks [^111bexD2] [^112d4681] [^113UztNd].
- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: Indicated for refractory hyperkalemia, acidosis, or volume overload [^112d4681].

---

## Controversial therapies

- **Sodium bicarbonate**: Insufficient evidence for routine use in preventing AKI [^115FbbjU].
- **Mannitol and loop diuretics**: Not recommended for AKI prevention due to lack of evidence [^112d4681].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable with early treatment**, though AKI is common and mortality is higher with delayed care or comorbidities. Pediatric patients have a good prognosis with low progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^111t9w5z], whereas older adults face higher mortality and complication rates [^111BGDUL].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **hydration during exertion**, avoiding risky drug combinations, and recognizing early symptoms. Education for athletes, workers, and patients on high-risk medications is essential [^notfound].

---

Rhabdomyolysis is a **potentially life-threatening condition** requiring rapid recognition and aggressive management. Early, aggressive IV fluids and electrolyte correction are the cornerstones of therapy, with prognosis dependent on prompt intervention and underlying comorbidities.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^115NFtLi]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis risk and nocebo considerations — clinical rhabdomyolysis can involve myoglobinuria and can cause acute renal injury and is estimated to occur in < 1/10,000 individuals treated with a statin over five years, with risk higher in patients with risk factors for SAMS. There is no biochemical test or clinical syndrome complex to determine whether muscle symptoms are directly attributable to statin use, and muscle symptoms ascribed to statins are at least 5-fold more frequent in observational studies than in RCTs; in contrast to the placebo effect, the nocebo effect is characterized by the expectation or anticipation of harm, with patients misattributing muscle discomfort to the statin instead of other etiologies such as increased body aches from physical activity.

Table 1
Definitions of statin-associated muscle symptoms proposed by the EAS Consensus Panel

In the vast majority of cases, SAMS are not accompanied by marked CK elevation. For SAMS with CK elevations > 10× ULN, usually referred to as myopathy, the incidence is approximately 1 per 10 000 per year with a standard statin dose (e.g. simvastatin 40 mg daily). The risk varies, however, among different statins, and increases not only with the dose of statin, but also with factors associated with increased statin blood concentrations (e.g. genetic factors, ethnicity, interacting drugs, and patient characteristics) (see Box 1). Rhabdomyolysis is a severe form of muscle damage associated with very high CK levels with myoglobinaemia and/or myoglobinuria with a concomitantly increased risk of renal failure. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis in association with statin therapy is ∼1 in 100 000 per year. In view of the rarity of CK elevations during statin therapy, it is not recommended to routinely monitor CK. Even if an asymptomatic elevation of CK is detected, the clinical significance is unclear.

Box 1
Risk factors for statin-associated muscle symptoms. Adapted from Mancini et al.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms are more likely to be caused by statins when elevated CK levels decrease after cessation of either the statin or the interacting drug, or when symptoms regress markedly within a few weeks of cessation of the statin and/or reappear within a month of drug re-challenge. Time to reappearance of symptoms is also influenced by the dose of statin and the duration of the re-challenge. Individual patient drug–placebo clinical trials have been suggested as an approach to confirming diagnosis of SAMS, but are not feasible in the routine outpatient setting.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^113UztNd]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute treatment of exertional rhabdomyolysis

The management of exertional rhabdomyolysis depends on the clinical presentation, with extensive coverage of treatment options beyond the scope of this article. Clinicians should have a low threshold for referral to the intensive care unit, particularly where the serum CK concentration is > 10 000 U/L, the patient needs active cooling, or there is end-organ dysfunction such as obtundation. Giving high-volume intravenous fluids early, aiming for urine outputs of above 200 mL/hour, seems beneficial; serum electrolytes should be checked frequently. Urinary alkalinisation improves myoglobin removal, though there is no evidence that sodium bicarbonate or mannitol helps. Plasma exchange — but not haemodialysis — removes myoglobin. Compartment syndrome requires immediate referral to orthopaedics or plastic surgery. All potentially causative drugs should be stopped, including statins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, supplements (weight loss treatments or creatinine), recreational drugs and others.

After discharge, the serum CK and renal function should be monitored every 72 hours; the CK or creatinine may not peak until after day 4. Monitoring can stop when the serum CK returns to below 1000 IU/L, though its failure to return to normal concentration should prompt consideration of underlying myopathy, as in case 2.

Key points
- Rhabdomyolysis is a serious medical condition that can lead to permanent disability or death.
- Workplace risk factors include heat exposure and physical exertion.
- Rhabdo symptoms can look similar to heat-related illnesses and dehydration; only testing can tell the difference.
- Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent death and disability. What it is Rhabdo is a serious medical condition. Rhabdo occurs when damaged muscle tissue releases its proteins and electrolytes into the blood. These substances can damage your organs and lead to:

- Death
- Dangerous heart rhythms
- Seizures
- Kidney damage or kidney failure
- Permanent disability
- Nausea and vomiting Rhabdo can occur from any type of muscle damage. This includes heat, overuse, accidents, or other causes.

Signs and symptoms If you develop rhabdo, you might have 1 or more of these symptoms: Muscle cramps, aches, or painsthat are more severe than expected Dark urine Feeling weak or tired, unable to complete tasks or finish a workout you were able to do previously. Treatment and recovery Early treatment can prevent serious medical problems. It also increases your chances of a quick recovery and return to work without any lasting negative health effects. Workers with symptoms of rhabdo should:

- Stop activity
- Drink more liquids
- Seek immediate careat the nearest medical facility If heat stroke is suspected, follow these first aid steps. Keep Reading: Treatment of Rhabdomyolysis. Myths and misconceptions It's a common misconception that only unfit or out of shape people get rhabdo. People in great shape, such as firefighters, marathon runners, and professional athletes, get rhabdo.

It can happen to anyone and even after activities you have done in the past without a problem. People also falsely believe dehydration causes rhabdo. Dehydration doesn't cause rhabdo but it can make it worse. Dehydration impairs the body's ability to get rid of the proteins and electrolytes in the blood stream released from damaged muscle. These proteins and electrolytes cause organ damage.

### Beyond muscle destruction: a systematic review of rhabdomyolysis for clinical practice [^115tmXeJ]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Information sources

Two authors (LOC and ML) independently searched the medical literature published in three databases (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and ScienceDirect) for articles that included in their title or abstract the keywords "rhabdomyolysis" or "crush syndrome". The search covered all articles from January 2006 to December 2015; we selected this period to increase knowledge and provide an updated review based on the existing literature from the past 10 years. All types of articles, including reviews (narrative and systematic), randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-control cohorts, case series, and case reports were screened for relevant content. Abstracts from the selected articles were read and, if considered eligible for further review, the complete article was obtained.

Search approach

Data collection and extraction were divided into two steps. The first step was intended to identify the articles with data relevant for extraction regarding definition, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. In order to qualify for inclusion the article was to contain any information regarding the following: definition, etiological classification, pathophysiology, or diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis.

The second step was intended to identify original research articles that included data regarding the epidemiology (e.g. risk factors, population and subgroup incidence, common etiologies, and morbidity and mortality) or treatment of rhabdomyolysis. To this end we searched MEDLINE using the keywords noted above ("rhabdomyolysis" or "crush syndrome") and added a filter selecting "humans" in the "Species" field. We selected for inclusion only original research articles which contained specifics of human epidemiological data or treatment. Excluded were articles referring to treatment of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI only, case reports, and laboratory investigations of rhabdomyolysis. Repeated publications and articles not in English or Spanish were also excluded. Figure 1 shows a flowchart for study selection.

Fig. 1
Flowchart for study selection

Data collection

Controversies regarding article eligibility for data extraction were resolved by a third author (JV). The references from the selected articles that had been retrieved were also screened for additional possible references. After determining the relevance of each paper, the articles were divided into several files according to their topic relevance (definition, etiology and epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment). There was no limit to the number of files an article could appear in. Finally, the data from each topic file were summarized. No additional statistical analysis was performed.

Regarding medical management for rhabdomyolysis, more specifically with respect to intravenous fluids, AAST 2022 guidelines recommend to administer either lactated Ringer's solution or saline (0.9% or 0.45%) for resuscitation in patients with rhabdomyolysis. Consider starting at a rate of 400 mL/hour, with goal-directed therapy of urine output of 1–3 mL/kg/hour, and up to 300 mL/hour.

### A systematic review on the definition of rhabdomyolysis [^1123GacT]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis (RML) is an interdisciplinary condition due to muscle cell injury followed by the release of cell components into circulation. Etiology of RML has a broad range; a serious complication is acute kidney injury (AKI). Despite its high relevance, there is no established formal definition for RML.

Objectives

A systematic review, focusing on RML definition, providing a recommendation for clinicians.

Method

Systematic literature research in PubMed and Embase (1968–07/2018).

Results

The database research presented 8136 articles in PubMed and 2151 in Embase. After screening, 614 papers were retained for statistical analysis. A retrospective study was the most used design (44%). A definition of RML was stated in 231 studies (37.6%), including a precise creatine kinase level (CK) cut-off most frequently (67.1%). In 53/231 (22.9%) studies the CK cut-off was > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN), and in 64/231 (27.7%) studies > 1000 IU/L. Further components of definitions were elevated CK without specific thresholds, and clinical symptoms. Exclusion criteria referring to the definition of RML were established in 113 studies, including myocardial, renal, cerebral and neuromuscular characteristics.

Conclusion

At present, we recommend a clinical syndrome of acute muscle weakness, myalgia, and muscle swelling combined with a CK cut-off value of > 1000 IU/L/ or CK > 5× ULN for the standard definition of a mild RML. Additionally measured myoglobinuria and AKI indicate a severe type of RML. Exclusion criteria as well as the chronological sequence need to be considered for a conclusive RML definition.

### Clinical perspectives of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis [^115kubXD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Fear of muscle toxicity remains a major reason that patients with hyperlipidemia are undertreated. Recent evaluations of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis offer new insights on the clinical management of both muscle symptoms and hyperlipidemia after rhabdomyolysis. The incidence of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is higher in practice than in controlled trials in which high-risk subjects are excluded. Accepted risks include age; renal, hepatic, and thyroid dysfunction; and hypertriglyceridemia. New findings suggest that exercise, Asian race, and perioperative status also may increase the risk of statin muscle toxicity. The proposed causes and the relationship of drug levels to statin rhabdomyolysis are briefly reviewed along with the problems with the pharmacokinetic theory. Data suggesting that patients with certain metabolic abnormalities are predisposed to statin rhabdomyolysis are presented. The evaluation and treatment of patients' muscle symptoms and hyperlipidemia after statin rhabdomyolysis are presented. Patients whose symptoms are related to other disorders need to be identified. Lipid management of those whose symptoms are statin-related is reviewed including treatment suggestions.

ACC/AHA lipid performance measures appendix — statin therapy evidence and dosing notes indicate that "All of these RCTs demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events", and that "Individual responses to statin therapy varied in the RCTs and should be expected to vary in clinical practice". Evidence details include "Evidence from 1 RCT: only down-titration if unable to tolerate atorvastatin 80 mg in the IDEAL (Incremental Decrease through Aggressive Lipid Lowering) study (47)". Safety language specifies, "Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in RCTs, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis". Reporting guidance states, "Proportion or percentage of patients meeting the measure at discharge", and abbreviations include "BID indicates twice daily".

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^112WZ4M1]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis

Exertional rhabdomyolysis is the combination of muscle symptoms (myalgia, weakness and swelling) and a substantial rise in serum CK (> 50 000 IU/L) in the setting of exercise. Serum CK rises after exercise are common and are asymptomatic in up to half of cases. Mean serum CK values 24 hours after marathons are 3322 IU/L for men (22× baseline) and 946 IU/L for women (9× baseline). The clinical significance of the serum CK concentration is unclear: 6000 IU/L has been cited as the minimum necessary for renal failurebut case reports indicate acute kidney injury may occur with a serum CK of 5000 IU/Land other studies suggest no safe serum concentration of CK. Pragmatically, a rise in CK to > 5000 U/L and/or evidence of end-organ damage (eg, myoglobinuria or decline in renal/liver function) is sufficient for a diagnosis of exertional rhabdomyolysis. Patients with exertional rhabdomyolysis may also experience fever, nausea and decreased/absent urine production. Supportive biochemical findings include hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypercalcaemia or hypocalcaemia and metabolic acidosis.

Most cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis are caused by heat-related injuries, specifically heat stroke and heat injury. The WHO's International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision includes four overlapping categories relating to exertional heat conditions (table 1). These symptoms are worth enquiring about since rhabdomyolysis in the context of a clear-cut heat-related condition usually does not require further investigation.

### Bench-to-bedside review: rhabdomyolysis – an overview for clinicians [^111dhbCP]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis ranges from an asymptomatic illness with elevation in the creatine kinase level to a life-threatening condition associated with extreme elevations in creatine kinase, electrolyte imbalances, acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Muscular trauma is the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis. Less common causes include muscle enzyme deficiencies, electrolyte abnormalities, infectious causes, drugs, toxins and endocrinopathies. Weakness, myalgia and tea-colored urine are the main clinical manifestations. The most sensitive laboratory finding of muscle injury is an elevated plasma creatine kinase level. The management of patients with rhabdomyolysis includes early vigorous hydration.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^113vW8Xu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

What laboratory findings aid in the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

The most commonly implicated variables include elevated serum concentrations of CK (> 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L), myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), potassium, creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Elevated urine myoglobin provides additional evidence. A low threshold of suspicion in the proper clinical context is warranted to initiate appropriate therapy. A strategy for disease monitoring with serial CK measurement should be additionally undertaken. Interval CK values should be followed until a peak concentration is identified (typically at 24–72 hours), discontinued once the CK is reliably downtrending.

Discussion

Traumatic or non-traumatic injury to the skeletal muscle cellular membrane leads to an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, disrupting cellular homeostasis and leading to cell death. Injury may be exacerbated by the generation of reactive oxygen species after restoration of blood flood to the affected tissue (reperfusion injury). The resulting effect is the accumulation of CK, myoglobin, LDH, and potassium in the circulation. In a recent systematic review, the laboratory definition of rhabdomyolysis varied to include an elevated CK level > 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L, with the CK-MM subtype being the most reflective of skeletal muscle injury.CK values may become elevated within 12 hours of injury, peak at 24 to 72 hours, and return to normal in roughly 5 days, depending on the degree of injury and appropriate therapy.

Myoglobin becomes elevated in the circulation once intrinsic binding proteins are overwhelmed. Given a shorter half-life (1–3 hours) versus CK, myoglobin may elevate and resolve prior to CK depreciating its clinical utility. Myoglobin may also be evident in the urine and, although the sensitivity has been reported up to 100%, the specificity varies widely from 15% to 88%. Although a causal relationship may exist between rhabdomyolysis and elevations in hepatic aminotransferases (AST, ALT: alanine transaminase), this is of unclear value as both enzymes exist within skeletal muscle and may become elevated as a result of primary muscle injury.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^111Xh7su]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is the combination of symptoms (myalgia, weakness and muscle swelling) and a substantial rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) > 50 000 IU/L; there are many causes, but here we specifically address exertional rhabdomyolysis. The consequences of this condition can be severe, including acute kidney injury and requirement for higher level care with organ support. Most patients have 'physiological' exertional rhabdomyolysis with no underlying disease; they do not need investigation and should be advised to return to normal activities in a graded fashion. Rarely, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the initial presentation of underlying muscle disease, and we review how to identify this much smaller group of patients, who do require investigation.

### 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and rhabdomyolysis: considerations in the renal failure patient [^111Lhjy9]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

An intense debate has developed as to the risk-benefit ratio of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) following the withdrawal of cerivastatin. The development of rhabdomyolysis in cerivastatin-treated patients should have surprised few since myotoxicity is an accepted class effect of statins. What has sprung from the cerivastatin experience though is a concern for other members of this class. Such misgivings, although understandable, are ill advised. Without question, differences exist in the risk of rhabdomyolysis occurrence amongst the various statins. In this regard, pravastatin and fluvastatin are least likely to produce rhabdomyolysis, which, in part, relates to the fact they are not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 pathway. When muscle damage occurs with statins it is most often the result of a drug-drug interaction rather than a specific adverse response to statin monotherapy. Such drug-drug interactions increase plasma concentrations of a statin and thereby increase the risk of myotoxicity. A growing consensus exists which supports an expanded use of statins in a range of patient groups including the renal failure patient. Polypharmacy and altered drug metabolism increase the risk of myotoxicity, albeit to an ill-defined degree, in this population. Many factors should enter into the choice of a statin in the multiply medicated renal failure patient.

Simvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are one of the most frequently prescribed class of medications in the United States, with over 15 million Americans taking these drugs. Relatively rare adverse effects related to the known toxic effects of these drugs are more common than generally realized. Clinically significant statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is an uncommon but life-threatening adverse effect. We describe a case of simvastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Current knowledge of the pharmacology of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and the drug interactions that potentiate these adverse effects are discussed. The clinical features of rhabdomyolysis and current treatment recommendations are presented.

### Risks associated with statin therapy: a systematic overview of randomized clinical trials [^112oqEzQ]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Although statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, concerns about adverse effects may deter physicians from prescribing these agents. We performed a systematic overview of randomized statin trials to quantify the risks of musculoskeletal, renal, and hepatic complications associated with therapy.

Methods and Results

Major statin trials were identified by electronic search of the MEDLINE database from 1966 to December 2005. We included English language reports of adults with documented hyperlipidemia; double-blind, random allocation of ≥ 100 patients to statin monotherapy versus placebo; and reports of myalgia, creatine kinase elevations, rhabdomyolysis, transaminase elevations, and discontinuation due to adverse events. Among 74,102 subjects enrolled in 35 trials (follow-up range, 1 to 65 months), statin therapy (excluding cerivastatin) did not result in significant absolute increases in risks of myalgias (risk difference/1000 patients [RD], 2.7; 95% CI, -3.2 to 8.7), creatine kinase elevations (RD, 0.2; 95% CI, -0.6 to 0.9), rhabdomyolysis (RD, 0.4; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.9), or discontinuation due to any adverse event (RD, -0.5; 95% CI, -4.3 to 3.3). The absolute risk of transaminase elevations was significantly higher with statin therapy (RD, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.5 to 6.9).

Conclusions

On the basis of data available from published clinical trials, statin therapy is associated with a small excess risk of transaminase elevations, but not of myalgias, creatine kinase elevations, rhabdomyolysis, or withdrawal of therapy compared with placebo. Further study is necessary to determine whether the results from these published clinical trials are similar to what occurs in routine practice, particularly among patients who are older, have more severe comorbid conditions, or receive higher statin doses than most patients in these clinical trials.

### Rhabdomyolysis in older adults: outcomes and prognostic factors [^111BGDUL]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a common condition in older adults, often associated with falls. However, prognostic factors for rhabdomyolysis have mainly been studied in middle-aged populations.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that age influences rhabdomyolysis prognostic factors.

Methods

This retrospective single-center observational study included all patients with a creatine kinase (CK) level greater than five times normal, admitted to Rennes University Hospital between 2013 and 2019. The primary endpoint was 30-day in-hospital mortality rate.

Results

343 patients were included (median age: 75 years). The mean peak CK was 21,825 IU/L. Acute renal failure occurred in 57.7% of the cases. For patients aged 70 years and over, the main etiology was prolonged immobilization after a fall. The 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was 10.5% (23 deaths). The Charlson score, number of medications and CK and creatinine levels varied according to age. Multivariate analysis showed age to be a factor that was associated, although not proportionally, with 30-day in-hospital mortality.

Conclusion

Factors influencing rhabdomyolysis severity were not randomly distributed according to age. The term rhabdomyolysis encompasses various clinical realities and is associated with different mechanisms. More research is needed to better understand the physio-pathological and prognostic factors of rhabdomyolysis, especially in older adults.

### Rhabdomyolysis in older adults: outcomes and prognostic factors [^1158gJ38]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis is a clinic-biological entity in which striated muscle cells break down and release their contents into the bloodstream. The diagnosis is based on clinical and biological symptoms such as muscle pain, dark-tea colored urine, myoglobinuria and excessive potassium levels. It is confirmed by increased creatine kinase (CK) levels. The most commonly used threshold of CK for diagnosis is usually 1000 UI/l or five times the upper limit of normal levels. Pathophysiological studies of this condition have shown striated muscle cells necrosis, through either direct injury (trauma/prolonged compression) or adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, leading to a sudden increase in intracellular calcium. Striated muscle cells necrosis leads to the release of their contents into the serum (potassium, calcium, sodium, phosphorus, myoglobin, and CK). Precipitation of myoglobin in the renal tubules and vasoconstriction secondary to hypovolemia can lead to renal failure of varying severity, sometimes fatal.

Different etiologies have been described, and these can be grouped according to their mechanisms: hypoxic, traumatic, chemical, or biological. In adults, the most frequent causes are traumatic, iatrogenic, and infectious. Prolonged immobilization, usually after a fall, is the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis in older adults. Its occurrence increases with age and comorbidities. In France, approximately 450,000 people over 65 years of age experience a fall each year, resulting in more than 9,000 deaths in 2013. A multicenter French study on 1467 subjects found that 14% of patients aged 65 years or more, hospitalized for an injury caused by a fall, had rhabdomyolysis.

An American study proposed a composite score predictive of the risk of acute renal failure and mortality linked to rhabdomyolysis. It included initial CK level, the presence of acute renal failure, etiology, age, and values of phosphate, calcium, and bicarbonate. This approach was supported by subsequent studies confirming that the composite score better predicted complications than the initial CK level alone. However, these studies are based on data obtained in middle-aged patients (median age: 50.7 years). We found few studies that looked at prognostic factors according to age.

Conclusions

This review provides a comprehensive view on AKI induced by RM. Thorough knowledge of the pathophysiology will lead to new approaches for diagnosis and treatment, leading to the preservation of the kidney. Renal replacement methods have a supportive role but they are not the first line of treatment for AKI-induced RM, especially in cases of preserved diuresis. The kidney is a miraculous organ but it can be overwhelmed if the threshold is exceeded. We should try to preserve kidney function where possible by looking at the whole picture.

- sufficiently fit or well-trained athlete with a history of intense training/exercise

- no personal or family history of rhabdomyolysis

- existence of other group or team-related cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis during the same exercise sessions

### Pathogenesis and treatment of renal dysfunction in rhabdomyolysis [^114BLNZp]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a major cause of acute renal failure, and recent experimental data have provided a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the renal dysfunction. Renal failure is due to renal vasoconstriction, tubular damage caused by oxidant injury, and possibly tubular obstruction. Recent studies have provided greater insight into the rationale behind current therapy and potential treatment strategies. This review thus aims to summarise current understanding of the causes, pathogenesis and treatment of renal failure caused by rhabdomyolysis.

Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical condition characterized by destruction of skeletal muscle with release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream. Intracellular contents released include electrolytes, enzymes, and myoglobin, resulting in systemic complications. Muscle necrosis is the common factor for traumatic and non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis. The systemic impact of rhabdomyolysis ranges from asymptomatic elevations in bloodstream muscle enzymes to life-threatening acute kidney injury and electrolyte abnormalities. The purpose of this clinical consensus statement is to review the present-day diagnosis, management, and prognosis of patients who develop rhabdomyolysis.

The rate of administration of intravenous fluids in rhabdomyolysis should be targeted to the patient as there is significant risk of volume overload should an excessive amount of fluid be given without goal-directed therapy. A starting rate of 400 cc/hour with a range of 200 cc/hour to 1000 cc/hour is considered reasonable but should be titrated to urine output, ensuring the patient is receiving adequate resuscitation without suffering from fluid creep.

Urine output is the traditional method by which one can determine the adequacy of resuscitation in rhabdomyolysis. The most commonly cited urine output goals for intravenous fluid rehydration are 1 mL/kg/hour to 3 mL/kg/hour, and up to 300 mL/hour. However, should the patient remain anuric despite escalating rates of intravenous fluid administration, the need for RRT may be necessary as ongoing aggressive fluid resuscitation without renal clearance could lead to significant and life-threatening volume overload.

Are diuretics and/or bicarbonate administration beneficial?

Recommendation

Clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate and/or diuretic use (mannitol, loop diuretics) for prevention of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI are limited by a lack of appropriate control groups, standardized definitions, retrospective design, and low statistical power. Given these significant limitations, the use of sodium bicarbonate or diuretics for prevention of AKI in rhabdomyolysis is not recommended.

Discussion

The precise mechanism of AKI in rhabdomyolysis is controversial and likely multifactorial. The two important factors in the development of myoglobin-induced renal toxicity are hypovolemia and aciduria. Ferrihemate, which is a breakdown product of myoglobin, in the presence of a low pH can generate free radicals which can lead to direct renal cell injury. Furthermore, heme proteins can potentiate renal vasoconstriction, which may have been initiated by hypovolemia and can activate the cytokine cascade. Pigmented casts, which are the hallmark of rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI, have been suggested to arise as a result of an interaction between the Tamm-Horsfall protein and myoglobin in an acidic environment. Other mechanisms that have been suggested propose that the precipitation of heme protein and its ability to generate free radicals at a low pH with resultant toxicity to the tubules is what may give way to cast formation. Ultimately, AKI is the result of the combination of vasoconstriction, oxidant injury, and tubular obstruction, which leads to decreased glomerular filtration.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^111AHmcL]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis is characterised by muscle breakdown associated with strenuous exercise or normal exercise under extreme circumstances. Key features are severe muscle pain and sudden transient elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels with or without associated myoglobinuria. Mild cases may remain unnoticed or undiagnosed. Exertional rhabdomyolysis is well described among athletes and military personnel, but may occur in anybody exposed to unaccustomed exercise. In contrast, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the first manifestation of a genetic muscle disease that lowers the exercise threshold for developing muscle breakdown. Repeated episodes of exertional rhabdomyolysis should raise the suspicion of such an underlying disorder, in particular in individuals in whom the severity of the rhabdomyolysis episodes exceeds the expected response to the exercise performed. The present review aims to provide a practical guideline for the acute management and postepisode counselling of patients with exertional rhabdomyolysis, with a particular emphasis on when to suspect an underlying genetic disorder. The pathophysiology and its clinical features are reviewed, emphasising four main stepwise approaches: (1) the clinical significance of an acute episode, (2) risks of renal impairment, (3) clinical indicators of an underlying genetic disorders and (4) when and how to recommence sport activity following an acute episode of rhabdomyolysis. Genetic backgrounds that appear to be associated with both enhanced athletic performance and increased rhabdomyolysis risk are briefly reviewed.

Defining rhabdomyolysis

There is no universally agreed clinical definition of rhabdomyolysis, but a working definition would encompass the twin features of symptomatic muscle involvement and a substantial rise in serum CK, usually > 50 000 IU/L. Muscle symptoms include myalgia, weakness and/or swelling. The presence of myoglobinuria is not required and many laboratories do not routinely measure serum and urinary myoglobin. Nevertheless, patients should be asked about changes in urine coloration, which may be the classical 'Coca-Cola' of myoglobinuria. Urine should be dipstick tested: haemoglobin without erythrocytes indicates myoglobinuria.

### Diagnostic evaluation of rhabdomyolysis [^116mXx2Z]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by severe acute muscle injury resulting in muscle pain, weakness, and/or swelling with release of myofiber contents into the bloodstream. Symptoms develop over hours to days after an inciting factor and may be associated with dark pigmentation of the urine. Serum creatine kinase and urine myoglobin levels are markedly elevated. Clinical examination, history, laboratory studies, muscle biopsy, and genetic testing are useful tools for diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, and they can help differentiate acquired from inherited causes of rhabdomyolysis. Acquired causes include substance abuse, medication or toxic exposures, electrolyte abnormalities, endocrine disturbances, and autoimmune myopathies. Inherited predisposition to rhabdomyolysis can occur with disorders of glycogen metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Less common inherited causes of rhabdomyolysis include structural myopathies, channelopathies, and sickle-cell disease. This review focuses on the differentiation of acquired and inherited causes of rhabdomyolysis and proposes a practical diagnostic algorithm. Muscle Nerve 51: 793–810, 2015.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a condition characterized by primary (mechanical) or secondary (metabolic) skeletal muscle injury, resulting in cell death and release of potentially toxic substances into circulation. Management often centers on prevention or treatment of the primary complication of the condition, acute kidney injury (AKI). Here we briefly review the causes, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of rhabdomyolysis.

In what patient populations should rhabdomyolysis be suspected?

Trauma patients

Recommendation

Rhabdomyolysis should be suspected in patients with a large burden of traumatic injury involving muscular tissue, especially patients with crush injuries involving the extremities or mangled extremities. Patients with vascular injuries or muscle ischemia with subsequent reperfusion are also at higher risk for rhabdomyolysis.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis is the result of skeletal muscle breakdown with release of potentially toxic substances such as electrolytes, myoglobin, and sarcoplasmic proteins into the bloodstream. The pathophysiology underlying all cases of rhabdomyolysis is disruption of the myocyte cell membrane and leakage of cell contents into circulation. This may result from direct myocyte injury related to trauma or from metabolic disturbances affecting supply of ATP within the myocyte.

Traumatic injuries are a common cause of rhabdomyolysis. One study has shown some degree of biochemical evidence of rhabdomyolysis (abnormal creatine kinase (CK)) among 85% of critically injured patients admitted to a trauma intensive care unit setting, although only 10% developed renal failure and only 5% required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Patients with multisystem trauma, crush injuries involving the extremities or torso, and those with compartment syndrome of one or more extremities are at highest risk. Other independent risk factors for rhabdomyolysis among trauma patients include age older than 55 years, Injury Severity Score greater than 16, penetrating trauma with vascular injury, severe extremity injury, male sex, and body mass index greater than 30 kg/m². Patients who fall with subsequent prolonged immobilization are also at higher risk for rhabdomyolysis, particularly if their limbs are compressed by their head or torso for a significant period of time, leading to muscle hypoxia. Conditions leading to skeletal muscle ischemia, such as direct compression or compartment syndrome, may lead to irreversible damage to the muscle; much of the injury may actually occur with reperfusion, in addition to injury sustained during the period of ischemia. Trauma is a common cause of rhabdomyolysis, but less than 20% of all cases of rhabdomyolysis are thought to be related to direct injury; metabolic or medical causes of rhabdomyolysis are more common.

CK elevation

The presence of elevated serum myoglobin was once used routinely to diagnose rhabdomyolysis; however, this parameter is not widely available for diagnostic testing and unreliable because myoglobin is rapidly cleared from the blood. Laboratory testing in urine (a positive dipstick for blood with absence of red blood cells on microscopic urinalysis serves as an indirect marker of urinary myoglobin) offers a fast screening tool if serum myoglobin testing is not readily available. Serum CK is the most reliable diagnostic marker of rhabdomyolysis. It usually peaks 24–36 hours after exertion and then decreases back to baseline at a rate of about 40% per day (figure 2).

Figure 2
Rise and fall of myoglobin and creatine kinase (CK) during the course of rhabdomyolysis. Myoglobin is the first enzyme that increases, but returns to normal levels within the first 24 hours after onset of symptoms. CK increases a few hours later, reaches its peak value within the first 24 hours, and remains at these levels for 3 days. Even though the presence of myoglobin in serum is the key feature of rhabdomyolysis, CK is considered to be a more useful marker for the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of muscular injury due to its delayed clearance from the plasma and the wide availability for diagnostic testing. (Reprinted from Giannoglou et al Copyright 2007, with permission from Elsevier).

There is no consensus in the literature concerning the exact level of CK increases required to fulfil the definition of ERM, with suggested CK levels ranging from > 5, > 10, > 20 or even > 50 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). There is, however, some agreement that the limit of a CK value of > 5 times the ULN is very conservative, as it does not take into account documented baseline differences as a function of gender, ethnicity and training levels. These ULN levels vary considerably: 217 and 414 IU/L in Caucasian women and men, and 336 and 801 IU/L in African women and men, respectively.

### Rhabdomyolysis [^112CTP3q]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening syndrome resulting from the breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers with leakage of muscle contents into the circulation. The most common causes are crush injury, overexertion, alcohol abuse and certain medicines and toxic substances. Several inherited genetic disorders, such as McArdle's disease and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, are predisposing factors for the syndrome. Clinical features are often nonspecific, and tea-colored urine is usually the first clue to the presence of rhabdomyolysis. Screening may be performed with a urine dipstick in combination with urine microscopy. A positive urine myoglobin test provides supportive evidence. Multiple complications can occur and are classified as early or late. Early complications include severe hyperkalemia that causes cardiac arrhythmia and arrest. The most serious late complication is acute renal failure, which occurs in approximately 15 percent of patients with the syndrome. Early recognition of rhabdomyolysis and prompt management of complications are crucial to a successful outcome.

### Rhabdomyolysis: a review [^117SPTVb]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis, a syndrome of skeletal muscle breakdown with leakage of muscle contents, is frequently accompanied by myoglobinuria, and if sufficiently severe, acute renal failure with potentially life-threatening metabolic derangements may ensue. A diverse spectrum of inherited and acquired disorders affecting muscle membranes, membrane ion channels, and muscle energy supply causes rhabdomyolysis. Common final pathophysiological mechanisms among these causes of rhabdomyolysis include an uncontrolled rise in free intracellular calcium and activation of calcium-dependent proteases, which lead to destruction of myofibrils and lysosomal digestion of muscle fiber contents. Recent advances in molecular genetics and muscle enzyme histochemistry may enable a specific metabolic diagnosis in many patients with idiopathic recurrent rhabdomyolysis.

### A risk prediction score for kidney failure or mortality in rhabdomyolysis [^115jGSJ2]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "McMahon score for kidney failure or mortality in rhabdomyolysis" for rhabdomyolysis.

The McMahon score is a clinical tool designed for predicting kidney failure or mortality in patients with rhabdomyolysis. The primary components of the McMahon score include patient's age, sex, initial creatinine, initial calcium, initial creatine phosphokinase, whether the rhabdomyolysis is secondary to seizures, syncope, exercise, statins, or myositis, initial phosphate, and initial bicarbonate. Each of these components is assigned a specific value based on the patient's condition, and the total score is used to estimate the risk of kidney failure or mortality. The McMahon score is particularly useful in guiding clinical decision-making and patient management in cases of rhabdomyolysis.

The McMahon Score calculator estimates the risk of kidney failure or mortality in individuals with rhabdomyolysis, considering a combination of clinical and demographic factors. The calculator processes input across eight specific areas:

1. **Age (years)**
- **≤ 50**: 0 points
- **51–70**: 1.5 points
- **71–80**: 2.5 points
- **> 80**: 3 points

2. **Sex**
- **Male**: 0 points
- **Female**: 1 point

3. **Initial creatinine (mg/dL)**
- < 1.4: 0 points
- 1.4–2.2: 1.5 points
- > 2.2: 3 points

4. **Initial calcium (mg/dL)**
- < 7.5: 2 points
- ≥ 7.5: 0 points

5. **Initial creatine phosphokinase (U/L)**
- **> 40,000**: 2 points
- **≤ 40,000**: 0 points

6. **Cause of rhabdomyolysis (secondary to seizures, syncope, exercise, statins, or myositis)**
- **Yes**: 0 points
- **No**: 3 points

7. **Initial phosphate (mg/dL)**
- < 4.0: 0 points
- 4.0–5.4: 1.5 points
- > 5.4: 3 points

8. **Initial bicarbonate**
- **< 19 mEq/L**: 2 points
- **> 19 mEq/L**: 0 points

To calculate the total score, each selected option is transformed into a numerical value as per the above scale, then aggregated to produce a score ranging from 0 to 19.

The interpretation of the total score is straightforward:

- A score less than 6 indicates a low risk of death or acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy.
- A score of 6 or higher denotes a high risk of these adverse outcomes.

This score helps guide clinical decisions, highlighting the urgency and level of intervention required based on risk.

### Pediatric rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of etiologies, management, and outcomes [^112J6gzH]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Two authors independently screened through the full-text records and extracted all the necessary data for review and analysis on a standard Excel spreadsheet. The data extracted from each study included the name of the primary author, date of publication, the study's geographical region, total number of patients with rhabdomyolysis, the mean/median age, gender distribution, definition of rhabdomyolysis, treatment strategies, etiologies of rhabdomyolysis, and outcomes of patients with rhabdomyolysis (i.e. mortality rate and incidence of AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD)). All the discrepancies in the extracted data were resolved through debates between the reviewers or by soliciting the input of a third reviewer.

### Pediatric rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of etiologies, management, and outcomes [^116Mk77V]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Since AKI is a life-threatening complication of rhabdomyolysis, it is vital to understand the predictors of AKI. However, only few studies in the current meta-analysis investigated the predictors of AKI. For instance, a logistic regression conducted by Yao and colleagues revealed that electrolyte disorder was a significant predictor of AKI but there was no association between age, gender, or peak CK levels and the development of AKI. On the other hand, Pinto et al. found that patients AKI were more likely to be older, have myoglobinuria, and have received intravenous bicarbonate, but there was no significant relationship between gender or peak CK levels and AKI. Collectively, these findings indicate that CK level and gender are not significant predictors of AKI in pediatric patients with rhabdomyolysis. However, further research in large-sample prospective trials is required to establish the independent predictors of AKI in pediatric rhabdomyolysis.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^111q5ZbC]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Returning to normal activities

The risk of recurrence is low if there is no suggestion of an underlying genetic cause: 1%–2% suffered recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis in the US Army study, the risk may be lower in the general population.

Most experts recommend a graded return to exercise. Exercise should be avoided in the first month and until symptoms have disappeared and the serum CK normalised. Light exercise can then be started and gradually increased in extent and duration if symptoms of weakness and/or myalgia do not recur. Eccentric training is best avoided, at least to start with, as is strenuous unaccustomed exercise. Patients with suspected underlying myopathies/genetic disorders need a stricter approach, as described elsewhere.

### Statin myopathy: an update [^111QZ7hZ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Statin therapy has become the mainstay of treatment for lipid lowering, demonstrating cardiovascular risk reduction. Associated with statin popularity are misconceptions and fears of untoward side effects on muscle. This review clarifies the terminology relating to statin-related muscle disease; explores potential pathogenic mechanisms; reviews current estimates of statin myopathy prevalence; and examines diagnosis and management.

Recent Findings

The fundamental mechanism of statin myopathy remains elusive but is believed to be a class effect. The most common explanation for the cause of toxic muscle injury invokes the deficiency of one of three main synthetic products in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase pathway. Recent studies have revealed several patients with statin-induced rhabdomyolysis who also have metabolic muscle defects, indicating that statin use may unmask presymptomatic metabolic myopathies. Although statin-related myotoxicity is believed to be a noninflammatory, toxic myopathy, experimental evidence suggests that it may be triggered by an autoimmune reaction or, conversely, initiate an autoimmune process. The precise mechanism is uncertain.

Summary

As a class, statins appear to be usually safe, well tolerated agents with an excellent risk: benefit profile. The etiology and pathogenesis of statin myopathy are poorly understood owing to the relative rarity of its existence.

In higher ASCVD risk, "the goal should be to treat with the guideline-recommended maximally tolerated statin dose", and "Patients who experience rhabdomyolysis with statin therapy may need to discontinue statin use indefinitely, although reversible causes should be sought". When symptoms persist or recur despite reassess–rediscuss–rechallenge, "nonstatin therapy should be considered when there is net clinical benefit".

### Rhabdomyolysis [^115Qf2cD]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a well-known clinical syndrome of muscle injury associated with myoglobinuria, electrolyte abnormalities, and often acute kidney injury (AKI). The pathophysiology involves injury to the myocyte membrane and/or altered energy production that results in increased intracellular calcium concentrations and initiation of destructive processes. Myoglobin has been identified as the primary muscle constituent contributing to renal damage in rhabdomyolysis. Although rhabdomyolysis was first described with crush injuries and trauma, more common causes in hospitalized patients at present include prescription and over-the-counter medications, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The diagnosis is confirmed by elevated creatine kinase levels, but additional testing is needed to evaluate for potential causes, electrolyte abnormalities, and AKI. Treatment is aimed at discontinuation of further skeletal muscle damage, prevention of acute renal failure, and rapid identification of potentially life-threatening complications. Review of existing published data reveals a lack of high-quality evidence to support many interventions that are often recommended for treating rhabdomyolysis. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore renal perfusion and increase urine flow is agreed on as the main intervention for preventing and treating AKI. There is little evidence other than from animal studies, retrospective observational studies, and case series to support the routine use of bicarbonate-containing fluids, mannitol, and loop diuretics. Hyperkalemia and compartment syndrome are additional complications of rhabdomyolysis that must be treated effectively. A definite need exists for well-designed prospective studies to determine the optimal management of rhabdomyolysis.

Conservative measures in rhabdomyolysis to prevent acute kidney injury

The first step in medical intervention is usually treatment of underlying disease. In the case of preserved diuresis in the setting of RM, we must initiate conservative measures, which usually include massive hydration, use of mannitol, urine alkalization and forced diuresis (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Therapeutic approaches in rhabdomyolysis for prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury. AKI, acute kidney injury; KDIGO, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes; RM, rhabdomyolysis; RRT, renal replacement therapy; S cr, serum creatinine; UO, urine output.

Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore renal perfusion and increase the urine flow rate is agreed on as the main intervention for preventing and treating AKI. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid solutions is the ubiquitous intervention in critical care medicine. One caveat, however, is that these therapeutic measures are not useful in the context of severe oliguria or anuria and may lead to interstitial and pulmonary edema. Clinicians have to be careful about oliguria which is a normal response to hypovolemia and should not be used solely as a trigger or end point for fluid resuscitation, particularly in the post-resuscitation period. Further, while aggressive volume resuscitation may preserve cardiac output and renal perfusion pressure, in the presence of oliguria it is an independent predictor for developing secondary abdominal compartment syndrome with decreased renal perfusion pressure or can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^111Humhd]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ERM) is the general term for muscle breakdown associated with strenuous exercise and is well described among athletes and military personnel. Although there is no universally accepted definition, ERM is often defined as a clinical syndrome associated with severe muscle pain, sudden elevation (and subsequent fall) of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels with or without myoglobinuria. Individuals experiencing ERM present to a variety of physicians, in particular to general practitioners and physicians working in sports medicine, emergency and internal medicine, neurology and the neuromuscular field, and for the military. As a result of the diversity of medical personnel having to deal with ERM, most physicians will have experience with some but not necessarily all aspects of this important condition.

ERM results in the entry of skeletal muscle contents, in particular CK and myoglobin, into the systemic circulation. In most cases, the condition has a mild course characterised by postexertional myalgia with mild-to-moderate CK increases, mild pigmenturia, and will often not even come to medical attention. However, in a minority of patients the clinical course can be severe, resulting in marked hyperCKaemia, compartment syndrome, acute renal injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cardiac arrhythmias secondary to electrolyte imbalances, and even cardiac arrest if left untreated. The annual rhabdomyolysis prevalence has been reported as 26 000 cases in the USA, with 47% meeting the diagnostic criteria of ERM. In other studies, a lower percentage of ERM has been suggested, a discrepancy which reflects differences in the cohorts studied.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^115FofgK]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with muscle symptoms and elevated serum creatine kinase levels (> 4× upper limit of normal)

For patients at low CVD risk who have symptoms with CK > 4× ULN, the statin should be stopped and the need for statin reassessed. If considered important, a lower dose of an alternative statin should be tried and CK monitored. For patients at high CVD risk with muscle symptoms and a CK of > 4× ULN (but < 10× ULN), statin therapy can be continued with concomitant monitoring of CK, but stopped (at least temporarily) if the levels exceed 10× ULN. In this case, that particular statin regimen should not be restarted. If CK levels decrease after stopping the statin, restarting at a lower statin dose with CK monitoring should be tried. If, however, CK elevation persists, there may be an underlying myopathy (e.g. hypothyroidism or a metabolic muscle disorder), and referral to a neuromuscular specialist should be considered.

In patients with a CK > 10× ULN for which no secondary cause (e.g. exercise) can be found, statin therapy should be stopped because of the potential risk of rhabdomyolysis. If the CK level subsequently returns to normal, re-challenge with a lower dose of an alternative statin and careful monitoring of symptoms and CK may be considered. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected, statin should not be reintroduced. Rhabdomyolysis should be considered if there is severe muscular pain, general weakness and signs of myoglobinaemia or myoglobinuria. These patients, and those with very high CK levels (e.g. > 40× ULN), should be referred for evaluation of renal damage (urinalysis, serum creatinine levels). Intravenous hydration and urine alkalinisation are recommended for the treatment of rhabdomyolyis depending on severity and the presence of kidney injury. If indicated, non-statin LDL-C lowering agents should be used (see below).

### Recent advances in our understanding of genetic rhabdomyolysis [^115d6pPD]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the genetics of rhabdomyolysis.

Recent Findings

Rhabdomyolysis is the acute breakdown of myofibres resulting in systemic changes that can be life-threatening. Environmental triggers, including trauma, exercise, toxins and infections, and/or gene defects can precipitate rhabdomyolysis. A schema (aptly titled RHABDO) has been suggested for evaluating whether a patient with rhabdomyolysis is likely to harbour an underlying genetic defect. It is becoming increasingly recognized that defects in muscular dystrophy and myopathy genes can trigger rhabdomyolysis, even as the sole or presenting feature. Variants in genes not previously associated with human disease have been identified recently as causative of rhabdomyolysis, MLIP, MYH1 and OBSCN. Our understanding of the pathomechanisms contributing to rhabdomyolysis have also improved with an increased awareness of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in LPIN1, FDX2, ISCU and TANGO2 -mediated disease.

Summary

An accurate genetic diagnosis is important for optimal clinical management of the patient, avoiding associated triggers and genetic counselling and cascade screening. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the genetics contributing to rhabdomyolysis, many patients remain without an accurate genetic diagnosis, suggesting there are many more causative genes, variants and disease mechanisms to uncover.

### Pediatric rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of etiologies, management, and outcomes [^111t9w5z]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, our research indicated that infection was the predominant cause of rhabdomyolysis in children, followed by trauma and exercise. Other etiologies such as drugs, seizures, connective tissue disorders, muscular dystrophy, metabolic anomalies, burns, sepsis, and multiorgan failure comprise less than 10% of rhabdomyolysis cases but should not be overlooked as potential etiologies of rhabdomyolysis in children. Moreover, we found that AKI occurs in about 21.3% of children with rhabdomyolysis, but the mortality rate and CKD incidence are low. These findings imply that although AKI is a common complication, the prognosis of pediatric patients with rhabdomyolysis is good and very few patients progress to CKD. We also found limited data on the treatment strategies for children with rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, large-sample prospective trials are needed to identify effective treatments for pediatric rhabdomyolysis.

However, children have been affected as well, with ∼2.4% to 3.7% of cases reported. This case is the first published case of an adolescent presenting with rhabdomyolysis as the first sign of novel coronavirus disease 2019, with extremely elevated creatinine kinase levels, approaching almost 400000 U/L. This case adds to the growing body of literature of a variety of life-threatening manifestations associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and highlights the importance of how prompt recognition of these unique presentations of the disease is important to mitigate complications.

### Pediatric rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of etiologies, management, and outcomes [^111BbLJD]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially fatal disorder resulting from skeletal muscle injury that compromises the integrity of the sarcolemma. In adults, trauma and drugs have been reported as some of the most common causes of rhabdomyolysis. However, the causes of rhabdomyolysis in children vary widely from those in adults. Therefore, the current meta-analysis investigated etiologies, treatment, and outcomes of pediatric rhabdomyolysis.

Our results have shown that infections are the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis in children, accounting for about 40.6% of rhabdomyolysis cases. This finding compares favorably with a previous review article, which reported that infections constitute about one-third of rhabdomyolysis cases observed in pediatric patients. Various bacterial and viral infections have been associated with rhabdomyolysis; however, the available literature suggests that viral infections constitute the majority of infection-induced rhabdomyolysis. Indeed, Harmer and colleagues observed that infections were the predominant cause of rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients in the UK, with 75% attributed to viral myositis. Mannix et al. also indicated that viral myositis constituted 38.2% of all rhabdomyolysis cases in juvenile patients. In addition, Park and colleagues found that out of 26 infection-related rhabdomyolysis cases, 65% were attributed to influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and enterovirus. These findings are further supported by a previous state-of-the-art review, which reported that viral infections are one of the leading triggers for rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients.

### Managing statin myopathy [^1124PhEZ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% of patients treated with statins experience some form of muscle-related side effects in clinical practice. These can range from asymptomatic creatine kinase (CK) elevation, to muscle pain, weakness, and its most severe form, rhabdomyolysis. Higher risk patients for statin myopathy are those older than 80, with a small body frame, on higher statin doses, on other medications, or with other systemic diseases including hepatic or renal diseases, diabetes mellitus, or hypothyroidism. The cause of statin myopathy is presumed to be the same for its variable presentation but has not been defined. In patients with myopathic symptoms, their symptoms and CK levels determine whether statin therapy can be continued or must be stopped.

### Pediatric rhabdomyolysis [^114Yb6p8]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Pediatric rhabdomyolysis is a common diagnosis that pediatricians need to be able to recognize because prompt treatment can prevent potential complications, such as acute kidney injury. The triggers for rhabdomyolysis are extensive, with viruses being the most common cause in pediatric patients. The pathophysiology behind rhabdomyolysis is complex and still being researched, but having a firm understanding of the cascade that results when muscle injury occurs is essential for proper management. Guidelines for managing pediatric rhabdomyolysis currently do not exist, but this article aims to review the available literature and give clinicians a general approach to aid in history taking, physical examination, diagnosis, acute management, follow-up, and prevention.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^115s1LDh]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Rhabdomyolysis is a relatively uncommon but important condition seen in critically ill and injured patients. Surgical critical care providers should be familiar with the less frequently encountered metabolic etiologies of rhabdomyolysis, in addition to the well-known traumatic causes. The diagnosis is made with a combination of clinical and laboratory findings and should lead to prompt intervention to halt any processes causing muscle damage and to prevent or treat known complications of the disease. A consensus summary for the diagnosis and management of rhabdomyolysis is provided in (table 2). Although traditional therapies such as urine alkalinization and diuresis are often employed in an effort to prevent rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI, evidence-based treatments with outcome benefits are lacking. There is a critical need for quality research.

### Early fluid resuscitation in patients with rhabdomyolysis [^111mXdEU]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Extensive rhabdomyolysis is often lethal unless treated immediately. Early mortality arises from hypovolemic shock, hyperkalemia, acidosis and myoglobinuric acute kidney injury (AKI). Many individuals with rhabdomyolysis could be saved, and myoglobinuric AKI prevented, by early vigorous fluid resuscitation with ≥ 12 l daily intravenous infusion of alkaline solution started at the scene of injury. This regimen stabilizes the circulation and mobilizes edema fluids sequestered in the injured muscles into the circulation, corrects hyperkalemia and acidosis, and protects against the nephrotoxic effects of myoglobinemia and hyperuricosuria. This regime results in a large positive fluid balance, which is well tolerated in young, carefully monitored individuals. In patients with rhabdomyolysis caused by muscle crush syndrome, mortality has been reduced from nearly 100% to < 20% over the past 70 years through utilization of this intervention. This Perspectives discusses the lifesaving and limb-saving potential of early vigorous fluid resuscitation in patients with extensive traumatic and nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis.

### The myopathy of statins [^1136tDmJ]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Statins are first-line drugs for prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic disease. Despite the fact that statins are generally well tolerated and have a positive impact on human health, their myotoxic properties should keep physicians on alert. Mechanisms of statin-induced myopathy are still not fully understood. Phenotypic characteristics of patients, individual statin properties, and metabolic interaction with other drugs are important factors that may increase risk for statin myopathy. The lowest effective dose of statin should be used during treatment. Early recognition of myopathy and discontinuation of statin is critical in preventing serious sequelae such as rhabdomyolysis with all its complications.

### The risk of hepatotoxicity, new onset diabetes and rhabdomyolysis in the era of high-intensity statin therapy: does statin type matter? [^116pGtXH]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on cholesterol management have placed greater emphasis on high-intensity statin dosing for those with known cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus. Differences in risk of hepatotoxicity, new onset diabetes and rhabdomyolysis specifically between the high-intensity statins and the most common moderate-intensity statin, simvastatin, were not found to a significant degree in this review. Rather, baseline characteristics and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) appear to be more important regarding the risk of these adverse effects. Pharmacogenetic differences in statin metabolism may explain individual susceptibility, however genetic testing is not felt to be cost effective at this time. More importantly, statin choice should consider concomitant use of the many prevalent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, and when present, rosuvastatin selection is recommended to reduce DDIs and risk of statin-induced adverse effects.

### Myotoxicity associated with lipid-lowering drugs [^1133yvRH]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lipid-lowering drugs are associated with myotoxicity, which ranges in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis resulting in renal failure and death. Although rhabdomyolysis is rare, muscle symptoms and serum creatine kinase elevations are sufficiently frequent during the course of lipid-lowering drug therapy to pose diagnostic challenges for the clinician. Progress in our understanding of this form of myotoxicity is reviewed.

Recent Findings

Muscle pain and weakness are the cardinal symptoms and often interfere with vigorous exercise. These symptoms may occur with or without serum creatine kinase elevations. The risk of myotoxicity is increased by combination statin-fibrate therapy as well as by factors that elevate tissue levels of the lipid-lowering drug, including the dose, drug-drug interactions, and host factors. Underlying neuromuscular diseases may become clinically apparent during statin therapy and may predispose to myotoxicity. The pathophysiology of myotoxicity most probably involves metabolic effects of the statins on the isoprenoid pool and on mitochondrial function.

Summary

Management of myotoxicity requires an evaluation of risk factors prior to prescribing lipid-lowering drugs, attention to muscle symptoms, and withdrawal of drug in the event of significant abnormalities.

### Rhabdomyolysis and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [^113rKW9S]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review rhabdomyolysis and discuss the role of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and their interactions with other agents in precipitating this condition, and to present case reports of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis.

Data Source

Relevant clinical literature was accessed using MEDLINE (January 1985-October 2000). The following search terms were used: rhabdomyolysis, adverse events, drug interactions, statins, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis occurs when extensive muscle damage results in the release of cellular contents into systemic circulation. Major complications include acute renal failure, cardiac abnormalities, and compartment syndrome. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis is supportive, with the primary aim of preventing renal and cardiac complications. Statin monotherapy or combination therapy may result in myopathy, which rarely progresses to rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism for drug interactions with the statins involves their property of lipid or water solubility. This characteristic determines the degree of hepatoenteric or renal metabolism of the statins. All statins except pravastatin undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Other pharmacologic agents that are also metabolized via this pathway may interact with the statins and cause rhabdomyolysis. The risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is increased significantly when statins are used concomitantly with such drugs as fibrates, cyclosporine, macrolide antibiotics, and azole antifungals.

Conclusions

Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but clinically important adverse event of statin monotherapy or combination therapy. Thorough understanding of this condition may help prevent or minimize adverse health outcomes in patents receiving statin therapy.

### Rhabdomyolysis in intensive care unit-distinctive clinical indicators and prognosis [^114Skvxb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The mortality rate for patients with rhabdomyolysis closely relates to the underlying cause and concurrent comorbidities. Rhabdomyolysis with AKI is a common occurrence, and the impact of rhabdomyolysis on mortality may be mediated through AKI development. ICU patients diagnosed with both rhabdomyolysis and AKI have a reported mortality rate of 59%. Our research found an all-cause in-hospital mortality rate of 27.2% for ICU patients, increasing to 35.3% for those with rhabdomyolysis. Additionally, 10.6% of ICU patients opted to discontinue treatment due to poor prognoses, rising to 17.6% among those with rhabdomyolysis. The significantly higher rate of poor outcomes (POR) in the RML group (52.9%) compared to the control group (33.3%) underscores the association between the adverse prognostic and rhabdomyolysis in ICU settings. Our study investigating rhabdomyolysis and/or AKI revealed that both conditions were independently associated with higher rates of POR. Regarding the finding that the combination of rhabdomyolysis and AKI does not result in a significantly elevated POR compared to having either condition alone, several potential explanations can be considered. First, there may be a pathophysiological overlap between rhabdomyolysis and AKI, as both conditions share related mechanisms, such as myoglobin-induced tubular injury, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation, which may result in non-additive effects on POR. Second, statistical limitations, including the small sample size of patients with both conditions, may have reduced the study's power to detect significant differences in POR. Third, confounding variables, such as male gender, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation, identified as independent risk factors for poor outcomes, may overshadow the combined impact of rhabdomyolysis and AKI. Fourth, effective ICU management strategies, including early recognition and treatment of rhabdomyolysis and AKI, may mitigate their combined impact on outcomes. Further research with larger sample sizes and more detailed analyses of disease severity and treatment effects is needed to better understand these findings. Our findings indicate that AKI patients treated with blood purification therapy (BPT) in the ICU experience high rates of poor outcomes, irrespective of rhabdomyolysis. This likely reflects that BPT is reserved for severe or refractory conditions, meaning it targets critically ill patients already at high risk of adverse events and mortality.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for rhabdomyolysis, more specifically with respect to laboratory follow-up, AAST 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain serial CK measurement for monitoring until a peak concentration is identified (typically at 24–72 hours), and discontinue once the CK is reliably downtrending.

### Acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis and renal replacement therapy: a critical review [^114dCcDM]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis, a clinical syndrome caused by damage to skeletal muscle and release of its breakdown products into the circulation, can be followed by acute kidney injury (AKI) as a severe complication. The belief that the AKI is triggered by myoglobin as the toxin responsible appears to be oversimplified. Better knowledge of the pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis and following AKI could widen treatment options, leading to preservation of the kidney: the decision to initiate renal replacement therapy in clinical practice should not be made on the basis of the myoglobin or creatine phosphokinase serum concentrations.

### Beyond muscle destruction: a systematic review of rhabdomyolysis for clinical practice [^115ce2P4]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome that comprises destruction of skeletal muscle with outflow of intracellular muscle content into the bloodstream. There is a great heterogeneity in the literature regarding definition, epidemiology, and treatment. The aim of this systematic literature review was to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the epidemiologic data, definition, and management of rhabdomyolysis.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted using the keywords "rhabdomyolysis" and "crush syndrome" covering all articles from January 2006 to December 2015 in three databases (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and ScienceDirect). The search was divided into two steps: first, all articles that included data regarding definition, pathophysiology, and diagnosis were identified, excluding only case reports; then articles of original research with humans that reported epidemiological data (e.g., risk factors, common etiologies, and mortality) or treatment of rhabdomyolysis were identified. Information was summarized and organized based on these topics.

Results

The search generated 5632 articles. After screening titles and abstracts, 164 articles were retrieved and read: 56 articles met the final inclusion criteria; 23 were reviews (narrative or systematic); 16 were original articles containing epidemiological data; and six contained treatment specifications for patients with rhabdomyolysis.

Conclusion

Most studies defined rhabdomyolysis based on creatine kinase values five times above the upper limit of normal. Etiologies differ among the adult and pediatric populations and no randomized controlled trials have been done to compare intravenous fluid therapy alone versus intravenous fluid therapy with bicarbonate and/or mannitol.

### Signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis… [^114ij2Pr]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The main rhabdomyolysis symptoms are muscle pain, dark urine, and feeling weak or tired.
- Seek medical attention immediately if you experience any symptoms.
- Rhabdo symptoms can mimic other conditions like heat cramps and dehydration.
- A healthcare provider can perform a specific blood test to determine if you have rhabdo. Signs and symptoms It's important to learn the signs and symptoms of rhabdo that may be present. Learning the symptoms can help you figure out if you or someone else needs to seek medical attention. If you develop rhabdo, you might have one or more of these symptoms: Muscle cramps, aches, or painsthat are more severe than expected Dark urine Feeling weak or tired, unable to complete tasks or finish a workout you were able to do previously. When will symptoms appear. Symptoms of rhabdo may not begin until hours or days after the initial muscle injury.

For some people, symptoms might not start to appear until several days after the initial injury. Seek medical care immediately If you have any of these symptoms at any time, do not ignore them. Seek medical treatment right away. Earlier diagnosis means an earlier start to treatment and a greater chance of recovery without permanent health effects. Testing for rhabdo You can't tell by symptoms alone if you have rhabdo. Other conditions like dehydration and heat cramps can cause the same symptoms. The only way to know for sure is to obtain a blood test. Blood tests for rhabdo Repeated blood tests for the muscle protein creatine kinase are the only accurate test for rhabdo. If you suspect that you may have rhabdo, ask a healthcare provider to check your CK levels with a blood test.
- CK enters the bloodstream when muscle tissue is damaged.
- When rhabdo is present, CK levels will rise.

You will need repeat blood tests to determine if CK levels are going up or down:

- Like symptoms, the rise in CK may not appear right away.
- Test CK levels until 2 consecutive tests show levels lowering.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^115TCakZ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Physiological exertional CK elevation

Several studies have investigated the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis among healthy individuals exposed to unaccustomed physical exertion, such as military recruits during basic military training and athletes. Kenney et al studied a cohort of 499 healthy individuals who participated in a 2-week basic military training, including eccentric strength training. The cohort included individuals of various ethnicities. The term 'clinically symptomatic ERM' was defined more stringently than the above: elevated serum CK, muscle weakness and myoglobinaemia and/or myoglobinuria. Hence, patients with myalgia in the absence of weakness were not included. Based on this definition, no cases of ERM were encountered. The mean and median CK values were within normal limits (for sex and race) at baseline, peaked with maximal elevation at day 7 and returned to normal at day 14. Serum CK levels were nearly universally elevated during training, but they were also increased in nearly one-fourth of the participants at baseline. At day 7, 27% of participants had CK levels > 5 times the ULN, and 11% had levels > 10 times the ULN, with values ranging from 56 to 35 056 IU/L on day 7. There was no correlation whatsoever between CK levels and the amount of exertion, environmental conditions, or myalgia, or weakness. In fact, quite surprisingly, and contrary to received opinion, CK elevations were less pronounced during the hot, humid months. One possible explanation was the less rigorous training during the hot months. Hence, the authors proposed that patients with serum CK levels < 50 times the ULN, no definite muscle swelling or weakness, no myoglobinuria, and without laboratory evidence of ARF or electrolyte imbalance have most likely expressed a physiological response to exercise and should not be classified as having 'clinically significant ERM'. Furthermore, the authors suggested that CK is only one of the factors predicting morbidity and mortality in ERM, which is in line with a recent risk stratification model.

The presence of rhabdomyolysis secondary to multiple infections has been reported, predominantly viral, but also bacterial and fungal. It is well known that COVID-19 can present a wide variety of complications during the course of infection; however, the presence of rhabdomyolysis as an initial condition has not been reported so far. We report a case of rhabdomyolysis as an initial presentation in a patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection.

Metabolic etiologies

Recommendation

Rhabdomyolysis should be suspected in any patient with a medical condition causing increased metabolic demands on myocytes in excess of the available supply of ATP. This may result from extreme exertional demands on skeletal muscle from exercise, exogenous agents such as drugs or toxins, genetic defects or myopathies affecting the muscle cell, and infections.

Discussion

Any process that impairs ATP production by skeletal muscle and any state where skeletal muscle energy requirements exceed the available ATP may lead to rhabdomyolysis. With ATP depletion, active transport pumps are no longer able to maintain low levels of intracellular calcium; unregulated increases in intracellular calcium lead to activation of calcium-dependent enzymes with eventual breakdown of the muscle cell. Exertional causes of rhabdomyolysis may include extreme and prolonged exercise or seizure activity such as status epilepticus. Most commonly, drugs and toxins lead to rhabdomyolysis. Alcohol abuse or dependence may actually be the most common risk factor for rhabdomyolysis; ethanol has direct adverse effects on muscle tissue metabolism and cellular integrity including inhibition of active transport pumps. Other illicit substances such as cocaine, heroin, and phencyclidine may also be implicated in cases of rhabdomyolysis. Lipid-lowering agents, especially statins, are a common cause of rhabdomyolysis, particularly in patients with concomitant renal or liver insufficiency. Infections such as influenza, Epstein-Barr virus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Staphylococcus aureus may rarely lead to rhabdomyolysis. Genetic diseases including disorders of glycolysis or glycogenolysis, lipid metabolism defects, or mitochondrial disorders are rare causes of rhabdomyolysis. Finally, rhabdomyolysis may be seen in patients with extreme alterations in body temperature due to conditions such as malignant hyperthermia, heat stroke, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Metabolic etiology for rhabdomyolysis is very broad and a number of different risk factors may need to be considered in this population.

Management

What is the optimal crystalloid type, rate of administration, and urine output goals to prevent AKI in rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

Either lactated Ringer's solution or saline (0.9% or 0.45%) is an acceptable fluid for resuscitation in rhabdomyolysis. A starting rate of 400 mL/hour can be initiated, with goal-directed therapy of urine output of 1 mL/kg/hour to 3 mL/kg/hour, and up to 300 cc/hour.

Discussion

Although early-volume resuscitation in rhabdomyolysis is well accepted as a mainstay of promoting renal tubule flow, diluting nephrotoxins such as myoglobin, and supplying adequate renal perfusion to prevent AKI, the best type of crystalloid for this purpose remains controversial. The two most commonly cited fluids used for this resuscitation are lactated Ringer's solution and saline (0.9% or 0.45%). Saline is promoted due to its lack of potassium; in rhabdomyolysis, crush injury can lead to hyperkalemia and there is a theoretic concern for worsening this issue by using a potassium-containing fluid for resuscitation. Conversely, receiving large amounts of resuscitation with normal saline can lead to metabolic acidosis, which can be counterproductive if urine alkalinization is desired. The only randomized controlled trial comparing these crystalloid fluid types evaluated patients with doxylamine-induced rhabdomyolysis. Of note, in this study, urine pH was a targeted end goal, with a goal pH > 6.5. In patients who received lactated Ringer's solution, urine and serum pH were significantly higher after 12 hours of aggressive resuscitation with significantly less need for bicarbonate administration to achieve goal urine pH, and there was no difference between groups in serum potassium level. However, there was also no difference in median time to serum CK less than 200 IU/L, which arguably is the most clinically relevant outcome in the study. There have been no other randomized controlled trials comparing lactated Ringer's solution and normal saline or 0.45% saline and therefore no clear recommendation as to which fluid type is better. It does appear that use of either type of fluid is safe in the treatment of rhabdomyolysis, so although this area certainly requires further study, at this time the type of fluid used for management of rhabdomyolysis may be at the discretion of the treating physician.

### Beyond muscle destruction: a systematic review of rhabdomyolysis for clinical practice [^117VtKA8]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical entity characterized by the destruction of skeletal muscle with resultant release of intracellular enzymatic content into the bloodstream that leads to systemic complications. The classic presentation of this condition is muscle pain, weakness, dark tea-colored urine (pigmenturia), and a marked elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) five to ten times above the upper limit of normal serum levels. The global incidence of rhabdomyolysis remains unknown but several population risk groups have been identified (i.e. morbid obese patients, chronic users of lipid-lowering drugs, post-operative patients).

The term "crush syndrome" is usually used to describe muscle destruction after direct trauma, injury, or compression. It was first described in 1941, when Bywaters and coworkers established a relationship between muscle necrosis and a brown pigment found by autopsy in the renal tubules of patients buried for several hours during a bomb attack in London. Manmade and natural disasters comprise the majority of cases of crush syndrome-associated rhabdomyolysis with development of life-threatening complications to this day.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common systemic complication of rhabdomyolysis. It occurs at an incidence ranging between 10 and 55% and is associated with a poor outcome, particularly in the presence of multiple organ failure. Therefore, preservation of renal function with intravenous (IV) fluid therapy remains the cornerstone of rhabdomyolysis treatment. The importance of rapid initiation of IV fluid therapy in the management of patients with rhabdomyolysis was first documented by Ron and coworkers in 1984; among the seven patients treated with fluids on-site during a disaster, none developed AKI. This finding received further support in additional studies suggesting that prompt IV fluid administration is associated with better patient outcome.

No guidelines for the management of rhabdomyolysis are available; nor have any randomized controlled trials of treatment been conducted. Recommendations for fluid therapy in rhabdomyolysis have yet to be established in terms of fluid type, volume, and time of initiation. Management of rhabdomyolysis is currently based on observations from retrospective studies, case reports, and case series which describe diverse and often parallel medical treatments for this syndrome and for its most common complication, AKI.

### Risk factors for severe acute kidney injury among patients with rhabdomyolysis [^114vP6pP]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The occurrence of AKI increases the mortality rate of patients with RM. The early evaluation and diagnosis are crucial for the prevention of AKI and improved patient prognosis. Our study demonstrated several risk factors for RM-induced stage II-III AKI and in-hospital mortality in RM patients with AKI. These findings may facilitate the effective prevention and management of RM patients with AKI. However, it also has several limitations. We will conduct further research to improve the study.

Key points
- Seek medical treatment as soon as you suspect rhabdomyolysis.
- Early treatment can prevent serious complications.
- If treated early, most rhabdo patients return to work in a few days without any lasting effects.
- Treatment options depend on how severe the rhabdo is. Treatment options Seek treatment as soon as you suspect rhabdo. If treated early, most rhabdo patients return to work in a few days without any lasting effects. Treatment options depend on how severe the rhabdo is. Only a healthcare provider can determine how severe it is through blood tests, electrocardiograms, etc. Treatment for less severe cases
- Drinking fluids
- Getting out of the heat
- Resting. Treatment for moderate to severe cases Moderate to severe cases may need intravenous fluids and hospital admission. IV fluids IV fluids help flush out the muscle proteins and electrolytes.

IV fluids can prevent dangerous heart rhythms and loss of kidney function. Hospital admission Workers may need to stay at a hospital to prevent severe complications from rhabdo. At a hospital, medical professionals can monitor and treat severe cases for:

- Abnormal heart rhythms
- Decreased kidney function
- Seizures
- Elevated compartment pressures
- High potassium levels.

### The etiology of rhabdomyolysis: an interaction between genetic susceptibility and external triggers [^1128c9Fw]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis is a complex condition relevant to many medical disciplines, involving the rapid dissolution of damaged or injured skeletal muscle. This disruption of skeletal muscle integrity leads to the direct release of intracellular muscle components, including myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase and electrolytes, into the circulation and extracellular space. Clinical manifestations range from a largely asymptomatic illness with isolated serum CK level elevation (hyperCKaemia) to a life‐threatening condition with profound myoglobinuria, often leading to acute renal failure. Definitions vary, but rhabdomyolysis is most commonly defined as a clinical syndrome of severe myalgia, muscle weakness and swelling, with sudden elevation of CK levels, with or without the presence of myoglobinuria, and subsequent fall of CK levels.

Three retrospective cohort studies in a hospital setting, performed in 2005, 2009 and 2012, described the demographics and different causes of rhabdomyolysis. All three studies, performed when diagnostic genetic testing was not yet widely available, focused on external triggers as a cause for the rhabdomyolysis event and identified exogenous toxins as the most frequently reported trigger, followed by traumatic muscle injury [1, 2, 3]. However, recent reports suggest that rhabdomyolysis events can be attributed to a combination of certain environmental factors (e.g. strenuous exercise and/or febrile infection) and a predisposing genotype [4]. A combination of external triggers and genetic predisposition may thus be required for an individual to exceed the threshold for developing rhabdomyolysis (Fig. 1), and the majority of rhabdomyolysis events may therefore have to be considered multifactorial. To identify episodes of rhabdomyolysis suggestive of an underlying genetic susceptibility, we have introduced the acronym RHABDO (Box 1) [5, 6]. This acronym was developed based on an extensive literature review and has been adopted in a recent review on exertional rhabdomyolysis [7]. It aims to distinguish the patients in whom the external triggers are sufficient to explain the episode of rhabdomyolysis from those in whom the external triggers insufficiently explain the (severity of the) rhabdomyolysis event.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^114yd8g7]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is the combination of symptoms (myalgia, weakness and muscle swelling) and a substantial rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) > 50000 IU/L; there are many causes, but here we specifically address exertional rhabdomyolysis. The consequences of this condition can be severe, including acute kidney injury and requirement for higher level care with organ support. Most patients have 'physiological' exertional rhabdomyolysis with no underlying disease; they do not need investigation and should be advised to return to normal activities in a graded fashion. Rarely, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the initial presentation of underlying muscle disease, and we review how to identify this much smaller group of patients, who do require investigation.

Results

Study selection

A total of 2552 potential studies were identified across the five databases mentioned earlier. 991 of these articles were excluded after they were confirmed to be exact or close duplicates. Another 1183 articles whose titles and abstracts were irrelevant to our study objective were excluded. We also did not retrieve 302 articles designed as case reports, narrative reviews, abstracts without full texts, or letters to the editor. Finally, 15 unique observational studies satisfied the full-text screening and were included in the analysis. The remaining 61 articles were excluded due to the following reasons: 6 were non-English articles, 11 had less than 10 participants, and 44 involved adult patients (Fig. 1).

Characteristics of included studies

Fifteen studies involving 10,514 children with rhabdomyolysis were included. All the studies were retrospective in nature and conducted in single centers. These studies were published between 2000 and 2024. In addition, various definitions were used for rhabdomyolysis. These definitions were based on serum CK levels, serum myoglobin levels, and urine myoglobin level (Table 1).

Data synthesis

Definition

The clinical studies were very heterogeneous with regard to the definition of rhabdomyolysis; although most authors diagnosed rhabdomyolysis based on CK levels five times the upper limit of normal levels (> 1000 U/L), others used alternative criteria for diagnosis (Table 1). In the clinical setting, symptoms were not usually taken into consideration when defining rhabdomyolsysis; however, the most commonly included ones were muscle pain and muscle weakness while the presence of dark urine was not used to define this entity in most studies. When rhabdomyolysis is associated with the use of lipid-lowering drugs (statins, fibrates, or a combination of both), the CK level cutoff is considered ten times the upper limit of normal. The definition of severity of rhabdomyolysis varied among studies, some defining "severe rhabdomyolysis" based on different CK cutoff values (> 5000 U/L up to > 15,000 U/L).

### Prevention of kidney injury following rhabdomyolysis: a systematic review [^116B1SRS]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic literature review to evaluate evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of rhabdomyolysis-associated acute renal failure (ARF).

Data Sources

PubMed (1966-December 2012), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Science Citation Index, and Cochrane databases (1970-December 2012) were searched. There were no language restrictions.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies selected dealt with treatment of rhabdomyolysis (crush syndrome) or prevention of ARF in patients with rhabdomyolysis. Articles excluded did not present original data or described only the management of ARF after it developed. Single case reports were excluded. Extracted data included study type; population; definitions of rhabdomyolysis and ARF; fluid, sodium bicarbonate, and mannitol dosages; and study findings.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. No controlled trials compared intravenous fluid administration plus sodium bicarbonate to fluid administration alone. Three concluded that there was no significant difference in the rates of ARF between patients receiving and those not receiving sodium bicarbonate; however, urine alkalinization was not documented. Eight investigations concluded that delayed fluid administration increased the risk of ARF. No controlled study compared volumes of fluid administered or targeted urine output goals. Fluid type, therapy duration, and monitoring parameters varied widely; 4 used a urine output goal in adults of more than 300 mL/h or 300 mL/h or more. No evidence supported a preferred fluid type or that sodium bicarbonate with or without mannitol was superior to fluid therapy alone.

Conclusions

Intravenous fluids should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably within the first 6 hours after muscle injury, at a rate that maintains a urine output in adults of 300 mL/h or more for at least the first 24 hours. Sodium bicarbonate should be administered only if necessary to correct systemic acidosis and mannitol only to maintain urine output of 300 mL/h or more despite adequate fluid administration.
