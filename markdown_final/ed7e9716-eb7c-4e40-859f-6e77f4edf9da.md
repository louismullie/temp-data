## Question

What are the potential causes of hypogonadism in this patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about identifying the potential causes of hypogonadism in a given patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true biochemical hypogonadism with proper sampling and repeat testing. Then, I should classify whether this is primary versus secondary using LH/FSH. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis based on age and common etiologies, while actively checking for reversible contributors. After that, I should review medication and comorbidity screens, including obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, liver disease, hyperprolactinemia, and systemic illness. Finally, I will consider special contexts such as oncologic therapy and HIV, and close with when to image the pituitary and when a karyotype is warranted [^116Q7pEX] [^113CJiev] [^111bLhC9].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis rather than assume it from a single low value. I need to ensure we have symptoms/signs consistent with androgen deficiency and then verify low fasting total testosterone on two separate mornings between 7 and 10 AM, because diurnal variation and transient suppressors can mislead us; if total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal, I should add accurate free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis or a validated calculation before labeling the patient hypogonadal [^116Fdiwb] [^1124vnU2] [^112oc1u4].

> Wait, let me verify the axis localization next. Measuring LH and FSH is pivotal to distinguish primary testicular failure (elevated gonadotropins) from secondary hypothalamic–pituitary dysfunction (low or inappropriately normal gonadotropins), and this choice will shape both the differential and management; for example, gonadotropin therapy can restore spermatogenesis in secondary hypogonadism but not in primary hypogonadism [^113CJiev] [^112UQRiA] [^111bLhC9].

> I will now examine likely primary testicular causes, especially in older men. Klinefelter syndrome remains a leading genetic cause and is underdiagnosed into adulthood; if testes are very small, typically ≤ 4 mL, I should order a karyotype because recognizing KS clarifies lifelong management and fertility counseling; other primary causes include prior testicular trauma, torsion, radiation, chemotherapy, mumps orchitis, HIV-associated testicular failure, and simply age-related Leydig cell decline, which is generally irreversible and may present with testosterone < 200 ng/dL and elevated gonadotropins in men over 70 [^113Zso7f] [^114XKuPY] [^11738iP2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in secondary hypogonadism, which is often reversible. Severe obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome commonly suppress the HPT axis; weight loss can normalize testosterone and gonadotropins, so I should prioritize lifestyle and treat comorbidities first and consider testosterone only if hypogonadism persists after sustained weight loss; chronic systemic illness, liver disease, renal failure, and heart failure can also suppress gonadotropins and are often modifiable contributors [^113NEiH4] [^113E5ViQ] [^111SfpQr].

> I need to check medications next because iatrogenic suppression is frequent. Opioids, glucocorticoids, and anti-androgens can suppress gonadotropins; anabolic–androgenic steroid use can cause prolonged secondary hypogonadism on withdrawal; if identified, deprescribing or tapering these agents is the first step, with recovery often taking months after cessation [^111bLhC9] [^114jpTYe] [^111FqDAF].

> Let me consider pituitary and hypothalamic pathology carefully. Hyperprolactinemia from a prolactinoma or medications is a classic reversible cause; I should measure prolactin and, if elevated, review drugs and obtain pituitary MRI. Other sellar causes include nonfunctioning adenomas, craniopharyngioma, infiltrative disease, hemochromatosis, and post-radiation hypopituitarism; I should also assess for panhypopituitarism with morning cortisol, TSH, and free T4 when clinically indicated [^115K21QN] [^113h4z3o] [^113LZfHa].

> But wait, what if the patient is on or recently received immune checkpoint inhibitors. I should double-check for ICI-related hypophysitis or direct gonadal effects, which can present with central hypogonadism; given underreporting in trials, I need to proactively ask about sexual symptoms and check LH/FSH/testosterone before, during, and after therapy, as persistent hypogonadism may require long-term hormone replacement and fertility counseling in younger men [^112jfQfK] [^115VcFFz].

> I should confirm whether any red flags mandate urgent imaging or genetics. Pituitary MRI is indicated for serum total testosterone < 150 ng/dL, persistent hyperprolactinemia, symptoms of mass effect, or undetectable LH/FSH; a karyotype is appropriate when testes are very small or when primary hypogonadism is suspected without another clear cause, particularly in younger men or those with azoospermia or markedly elevated gonadotropins [^114EM4gb] [^115K21QN] [^111EbdnM].

> Let me reconsider the overall framework to avoid misclassification. Functional or reversible hypogonadism is common in older or obese men with comorbidities, whereas organic hypogonadism due to structural or genetic HPT pathology is less common but must be excluded; using LH/FSH to pivot the workup, screening medications and systemic disease, and reserving imaging and karyotype for those with low gonadotropins, very low testosterone, or clinical red flags keeps the evaluation efficient and accurate [^111SfpQr] [^1132LYjC] [^111bLhC9].

---

Hypogonadism in this patient most likely reflects **secondary (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism** due to obesity, metabolic syndrome, or chronic systemic illness [^111SfpQr], given the low testosterone with low/normal LH/FSH [^11738iP2]. Other contributors include **opioids, glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, hyperprolactinemia, sleep apnea, and liver/renal disease** [^111bLhC9] [^111rFVFJ]. Less likely are primary testicular causes (Klinefelter, prior orchitis, radiation, trauma) or pituitary/hypothalamic disease (tumor, infiltrative disease, hemochromatosis) [^113Zso7f] [^115K21QN]. Evaluation should include **repeat morning testosterone, LH/FSH, prolactin, SHBG, iron studies, and targeted imaging** if indicated [^116Q7pEX] [^111EbdnM].

---

## Classification of hypogonadism

Hypogonadism is classified as **primary (hypergonadotropic)** — testicular failure with elevated LH/FSH — or **secondary (hypogonadotropic)** — hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction with low/normal LH/FSH [^113Zso7f]. The pattern of gonadotropins guides the differential and management [^116Q7pEX].

---

## Potential causes of hypogonadism in this patient

Given low testosterone with low/normal LH/FSH, **secondary hypogonadism** is most likely; consider the following:

---

### Functional (reversible) causes

- **Obesity and metabolic syndrome**: Common in older men; adiposity lowers testosterone via insulin resistance, leptin, and inflammatory cytokines; weight loss can normalize testosterone [^113NEiH4] [^113E5ViQ].

- **Chronic systemic illness**: Diabetes, liver/renal disease, COPD, and heart failure suppress the HPT axis; testosterone often normalizes with disease control [^111bLhC9].

- **Medications**: Opioids, glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, and anti-androgens suppress gonadotropins; review and stop when possible [^111FqDAF] [^111bLhC9].

- **Hyperprolactinemia**: Prolactin inhibits GnRH; causes include prolactinomas, antipsychotics, and SSRIs [^115K21QN].

- **Sleep apnea**: Intermittent hypoxia suppresses the HPT axis; CPAP can improve testosterone [^113Y6q86].

---

### Organic (irreversible) causes

- **Pituitary or hypothalamic tumors**: Adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, or infiltrative disease can cause hypogonadotropism [^113Zso7f].

- **Pituitary infarction or trauma**: Sheehan's syndrome or head injury can damage the pituitary [^113Zso7f].

- **Genetic syndromes**: Kallmann syndrome or CHH present with absent/minimal puberty and anosmia [^116opZbq].

---

### Primary testicular causes (less likely given low/normal LH/FSH)

- **Klinefelter syndrome**: Typically shows small testes and elevated gonadotropins [^115Knnsb].

- **Testicular trauma, radiation, or orchitis**: Usually elevate LH/FSH [^113Zso7f].

- **Aging**: Gradual testosterone decline with compensatory LH/FSH rise [^11738iP2].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

To determine the cause, use a **stepwise approach**:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Repeat morning total testosterone and SHBG | Confirm hypogonadism and assess SHBG abnormalities [^116Fdiwb] |
| 2 | LH and FSH | Differentiate primary vs secondary hypogonadism [^113CJiev] |
| 3 | Prolactin | Screen for hyperprolactinemia [^115K21QN] |
| 4 | Iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation) | Evaluate for hemochromatosis [^115K21QN] |
| 5 | Pituitary MRI | If low testosterone < 150 ng/dL, hyperprolactinemia, or symptoms of mass effect [^114EM4gb] |
| 6 | Medication review | Identify reversible drug-induced causes [^111EbdnM] |
| 7 | Sleep apnea screening | Polysomnography if symptomatic [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause in this patient is **secondary hypogonadism** from obesity, metabolic syndrome, or chronic illness, with medication effects, hyperprolactinemia, sleep apnea, and liver/renal disease as additional contributors. Primary testicular failure and pituitary/hypothalamic disease are less likely but should be excluded with targeted testing and imaging when indicated [^111SfpQr] [^111EbdnM].

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypogonadism [^1124vnU2]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

A systematic approach to diagnose hypogonadism initially establishes the presence of symptoms/signs of testosterone deficiency, considers other potential causes of manifestations, and excludes conditions that transiently suppress testosterone. Hypogonadism is confirmed by measuring fasting serum total testosterone in the morning on at least 2 separate days, or free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis or calculated free testosterone in men with conditions that alter sex hormone-binding globulin or serum total testosterone near lower limit of normal. To guide management, further evaluation is performed to identify the specific cause of hypogonadism and whether it is potentially reversible or an irreversible pathologic disorder.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, EAA 2020 guidelines recommend to diagnose functional hypogonadism only after the exclusion of organic causes of hypogonadism. Measure LH in addition to morning total testosterone in all patients with suspected functional hypogonadism to differentiate between the primary and secondary causes.

What Additional Diagnostic Evaluation Would Be Helpful in an Older Man With a Low Serum Testosterone Concentration That Has Been Appropriately Confirmed?

We have now confirmed that this patient has low serum testosterone concentrations. Does he have nongonadal illness or hypogonadism? The first step is the determination of serum gonadotropin concentrations. Elevated serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations would be consistent with primary hypogonadism. Primary hypogonadism increases to 2% to 7% prevalence in men over age 70; age over 70 is associated with a progressive decline of serum testosterone concentration and a rise of serum LH concentration (to > 15 IU/L) in many men. If this man has elevated FSH and LH concentrations, then he is hypogonadal. If he has low or normal serum gonadotropin concentrations, then he should be evaluated for causes of hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction. To minimize phlebotomies and expedite the evaluation, we recommend ordering early morning, fasting serum total testosterone, SHBG, and gonadotropins at the first clinic visit.

Using serum gonadotropins as a pivot in the evaluation of possible hypogonadism is very useful. Although many causes of hypogonadism may affect the central (hypothalamus and/or pituitary) and peripheral (testes) components of the HPT axis, the serum gonadotropins indicate the site of the principal dysfunction. Primary hypogonadism defined by low testosterone concentrations and elevated gonadotropins is generally irreversible in older men, whereas many causes of secondary hypogonadism might be reversible. Thus, affirmation of elevated serum gonadotropins (FSH > LH) clinches the diagnosis of primary hypogonadism in a man with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of hypogonadism and a low serum testosterone concentration.

Although classic pathologic causes of hypogonadism have been described as organic and potentially reversible, nonclassic causes of hypogonadism such as obesity have been described as functional; we recommend classifying hypogonadism as primary or secondary and potentially reversible or irreversible. Klinefelter syndrome is an example of irreversible primary hypogonadism. Very high BMI (usually ≥ 40 kg/m²) (for review see), severe systemic disease, endogenous Cushing syndrome, endogenous hyperprolactinemia, and treatment with corticosteroids, opioids, and anti-dopaminergic medications are common causes of potentially reversible secondary (or combined secondary and primary) hypogonadism. This typology of potentially reversible or irreversible primary and secondary hypogonadism is informative and clearer and more useful than organic and functional.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hypogonadism and infertility: a neglected issue in immuno-oncology [^112jfQfK]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

This lack of data is astonishing given the vast number of clinical trials performed over the last decade. For instance, none of the pivotal trials leading to Food and Drug Administration (FDA approval of ICIs in the different indications has provided information regarding fertility, menopause status, sex hormone levels, or sexual health-related quality of life. However, the assessment of gonadal function in reproductive-age men and women undergoing ICIs cannot be deferred any longer. ICIs are increasingly applied in the curative setting as adjuvant therapy where the risk of ICI-related hypogonadism, premature menopause or infertility, and their long-term consequences need to be balanced against the reduction of absolute risk of disease recurrence and discussed with the patient as it might affect the acceptance of such prophylactic therapies. In addition, the cancer incidence in young adults is increasing, with currently about 5% of all cancers being diagnosed in patients 20–39 years of age. It is therefore likely that in the future more reproductive-age men and women will be exposed to ICIs and need to be informed about the potential for gonadal toxicity. Similarly, multiple clinical trials are testing ICIs in pediatric patients and ICIs are already approved for several indications in this population. The current state of evidence does not provide any meaningful conclusions that can be used to counsel patients and their families regarding the risk of hypogonadism and its potential effects on the children's physical and mental development.

### What is the optimal therapy for young males with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism? [^11142ntu]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), consequent to congenital or acquired disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, presents as absent/delayed/arrested sexual maturation and infertility. Optimal management includes: (a) confirmation of the diagnosis and prognosis, (b) timing and choice of therapeutic intervention and (c) consideration of future fertility prospects. Therapy is usually initiated with testosterone to induce development of secondary sexual characteristics, taking the patient (often diagnosed late) through puberty. Monitoring of the impact of the condition on long-term health and psychosocial function is necessary. Treatment is likely to be life-long, requiring regular monitoring for its optimization and avoidance of adverse responses. Induction of spermatogenesis requires either pulsatile gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) or gonadotropin administration. Gonadotropins can be self-administered subcutaneously and are not inferior to the more costly GnRH. 'Reversible genetic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism' is a recently described entity which has implications for the long-term management of patients with HH.

Key Points

Question

Does testosterone replacement therapy in men with hypogonadism increase the risk of high-grade or any prostate cancer or other adverse prostate events?

Findings

During 14 304 person-years of follow-up of 5204 men (aged 45–80 years) with hypogonadism in this randomized clinical trial, incidences of high-grade or any prostate cancer, acute urinary retention, invasive surgical procedures, and new pharmacologic treatment were low and did not differ significantly between groups.

Meaning

The study's findings will facilitate a more informed appraisal of the potential prostate risks of testosterone replacement therapy.

### Testosterone and male infertility [^113nZf8k]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Hypogonadism and its therapies have a significant impact on male fertility potential. It is necessary to determine the etiology to treat and counsel the patient appropriately on therapeutic options. For the hypogonadal male on exogenous testosterone, management should begin with cessation of the exogenous testosterone and supplemental subcutaneous human chorionic gonadotropin and an oral follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-inducing agent to allow reestablishment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and spermatogenesis. Further supplemental therapy with recombinant FSH in some patients may be necessary to achieve optimal semen parameters.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1136CcxY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Society for endocrinology guideline for understanding, diagnosing and treating female hypogonadism [^115wHh7i]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Female hypogonadism (FH) is a relatively common endocrine disorder in women of premenopausal age, but there are significant uncertainties and wide variation in its management. Most current guidelines are monospecialty and only address premature ovarian insufficiency (POI); some allude to management in very brief and general terms, and most rely upon the extrapolation of evidence from the studies relating to physiological estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women. The Society for Endocrinology commissioned new guidance to provide all care providers with a multidisciplinary perspective on managing patients with all forms of FH. It has been compiled using expertise from Endocrinology, Primary Care, Gynaecology and Reproductive Health practices, with contributions from expert patients and a patient support group, to help clinicians best manage FH resulting from both POI and hypothalamo-pituitary disorders, whether organic or functional.

Adult-onset hypogonadism — consensus statement: Adult-onset hypogonadism is a measurable syndrome characterized by low testosterone, associated symptoms, and low or normal gonadotropin levels. Men with adult-onset hypogonadism who are candidates for treatment with testosterone should be counseled regarding the benefits and risks of treatment. Patients who are treated should be monitored regularly.

### Managing congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism: a contemporary approach directed at optimizing fertility and long-term outcomes in males [^115CyioA]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Causes of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism

Differentiating HH into congenital and acquired aetiologies has important clinical implications. First, congenital causes are uncommon but tend to have a more significant impact on reproductive function because of the early disruption to gonadal development. Second, acquired causes may either be permanent or medically reversible, requiring very different management approaches, hence necessitating accurate elucidation of underlying pathology.

### Central causes of hypogonadism – functional and organic [^117TgPEh]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Whether caused by environmental factors, lesions, genetic mutations, drug interactions, or unknown origins, the path of the central causes of hypogonadism frequently leads back to the GnRH pulse generator. In some cases, the cause can be unequivocally traced to a single factor, such as some of the congenital syndromes previously described. In most instances, however, hypogonadism is occult or functional. Because of the wide spectrum and complexity of underlying causes, a definitive diagnosis, especially in functional causes of the disorder, is not always attainable.

Abstract

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials.

### Etiology and treatment of hypogonadism in adolescents [^114D3jkq]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Adequate functioning at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is necessary for normal gonadal development and subsequent sex steroid production. Deficiencies at any level of the axis can lead to a hypogonadal state. The causes of hypogonadism are heterogeneous and may involve any level of the reproductive system. This review discusses various causes of hypogonadism, describes the evaluation of hypogonadal states, and outlines treatment options for the induction of puberty in affected adolescents. Whereas some conditions are clearly delineated, the exact etiology and underlying pathogenesis of many disorders is unknown.

### Clinical review: why is androgen replacement in males controversial? [^11757dfP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Symptoms and signs consistent with androgen deficiency and low testosterone levels are recognized frequently in clinical practice. Recent population-based epidemiological studies indicate that low testosterone levels in men are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The clinician must be able to counsel patients to help them determine whether testosterone replacement therapy is appropriate for them.

Evidence Acquisition

The authors have conducted a literature search in PubMed, and we have reviewed references in the multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have been published on this topic.

Evidence Synthesis

We have attempted to provide the reader with an appreciation of the evidence that can be used to support the diagnosis of androgen deficiency, the efficacy of treatment, the potential risks of treatment, the therapeutic options, and the recommendations for monitoring treatment.

Conclusions

We think that published clinical experience justifies testosterone replacement therapy in males who have not initiated puberty by age 14 and in males with low testosterone levels due to classical diseases of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The benefit:risk ratio is less certain in older men and in those with chronic diseases associated with low testosterone levels. The decision to treat in this setting is much more controversial because there are few large clinical trials that have demonstrated efficacy and no large clinical trials that have determined potential risks of increasing the incidence of clinical prostate cancers or cardiovascular events. We provide a critical review of the evidence that supports treatment and potential risks and ways to reduce the risks if the physician and patient elect testosterone replacement.

### Male hypogonadism: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^111SfpQr]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Organic male hypogonadism due to irreversible hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) pathology is easily diagnosed and treated with testosterone-replacement therapy. However, controversy surrounds the global practice of prescribing testosterone to symptomatic men with low testosterone and non-gonadal factors reducing health status, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and ageing (ie, functional hypogonadism), but without identifiable HPT axis pathology. Health optimisation remains the gold-standard management strategy. Nevertheless, in the last decade large clinical trials and an individual patient data meta-analysis of smaller clinical trials confirmed that testosterone therapy induces modest, yet statistically significant, improvements in sexual function without increasing short-term to medium-term cardiovascular or prostate cancer risks in men with functional hypogonadism. Although testosterone improves bone mineral density and insulin sensitivity in these men, trials from the last decade suggest insufficient evidence to determine the safety and effectiveness of use of this hormone for the prevention of fractures or type 2 diabetes. This Review discusses the pathogenesis and diagnosis of male hypogonadism and appraises the evidence underpinning the management of this condition.

### Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in a patient with morbid obesity [^112bVxkR]. Obesity Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Obesity has recently become one of the most important public health problems. It is associated with a high rate of mortality, mainly because of cardiovascular disease, and can cause hormonal abnormalities such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Weight loss is very beneficial for obese patients, because it results in improvement or even normalization of these conditions. In this report, we describe a morbidly obese patient with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which was probably caused by hyperprolactinemia and exacerbated by obesity-induced hormonal imbalances. After medical treatment for hyperprolactinemia and bariatric surgery, the patient's hormonal status became normal. Although morbid obesity can cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men, the differential diagnosis should include other potential causes of hypogonadism if free testosterone levels are below normal.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113dj8vX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic illness and low testosterone concentrations — treatment individualization: Many chronic disorders are associated with an increased risk of low testosterone concentrations and related symptoms, but the paucity of randomized controlled trial data on efficacy or safety precludes a general recommendation for testosterone therapy in these conditions. Clinicians must individualize the decision to treat or not to treat based on the severity of symptoms, the degree of testosterone deficiency, confounding effects of the comorbid illness, patient preferences, and the uncertainty of the risks and benefits of therapy.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111bLhC9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Classification and causes of hypogonadism — definitions and therapeutic implications: Causes of hypogonadism may be organic or functional, a distinction that has important clinical implications. Organic hypogonadism (also referred to as "classical" hypogonadism) is caused by a congenital, structural, or destructive disorder that results in permanent hypothalamic, pituitary, or testicular dysfunction (primary or secondary hypogonadism). In contrast, functional hypogonadism is caused by conditions that suppress gonadotropin and T concentrations but that are potentially reversible with treatment of the underlying etiology. The classification of hypogonadism as primary or secondary has therapeutic implications, as spermatogenesis can be stimulated and fertility can be restored with appropriate gonadotropin therapy in patients with secondary hypogonadism but not in patients with primary hypogonadism. Additionally, evaluating secondary hypogonadism may uncover a deficiency/excess of other pituitary hormones or a hypothalamic or pituitary tumor that may require management, and secondary hypogonadism can result from functional causes (e.g., obesity, opioids, or systemic illness) that might be reversible by treating the underlying condition or discontinuing the offending medication. Table 1 lists causes under Primary Hypogonadism — Organic (e.g. KS; Cryptorchidism; Some types of cancer chemotherapy, testicular irradiation/damage, orchiectomy; Orchitis; Testicular trauma, torsion; Advanced age) and Functional (e.g. Medications [androgen synthesis inhibitors]), and under Secondary Hypogonadism — Organic (e.g. Hypothalamic/pituitary tumor; Iron overload syndromes; Infiltrative/destructive disease of hypothalamus/pituitary; Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) and Functional (e.g. Hyperprolactinemia; Opioids, anabolic steroid use, glucocorticoids; Nutritional deficiency/excessive exercise; Severe obesity, some sleep disorders; Organ failure [liver, heart, and lung]; Comorbid illness associated with aging).

### Testis development and fertility potential in boys with Klinefelter syndrome [^115Knnsb]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the leading genetic cause of primary hypogonadism and infertility in men. The clinical phenotype has expanded beyond the original description of infertility, small testes, and gynecomastia. Animal models, epidemiologic studies, and clinical research of male subjects with KS throughout the lifespan have allowed the better characterization of the variable phenotype of this condition. This review provides an overview on what is known of the epidemiology, clinical features, and pathophysiology of KS, followed by a more focused discussion of testicular development and the clinical management of hypogonadism and fertility in boys and men with KS.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112oc1u4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — diagnosis of hypogonadism: We recommend diagnosing hypogonadism in men with symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum total testosterone and/or free testosterone concentrations (when indicated). We recommend against routine screening of men in the general population for hypogonadism. In men who have hypogonadism, we recommend distinguishing between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary–hypothalamic) hypogonadism by measuring serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations. In men with hypogonadism, we suggest further evaluation to identify the etiology of hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or testicular dysfunction.

### Medical treatment of hypogonadism in men [^111Mtdh5]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urologists may commonly diagnose hypogonadism in adult men experiencing an age-related decline in serum testosterone. Low serum testosterone in conjunction with symptoms such as decreased libido, fatigue, memory deficit, or decreased vitality is described as testosterone deficiency syndrome. There are numerous therapeutic options, although each is unique in its formulation, administration, and side-effect profile. For this reason, treatment can prove to be challenging for each unique patient case. The clinician must carefully monitor key serum markers before and during treatment. With careful dosing and monitoring, therapeutic benefit can be achieved reliably and sustainably.

### Anabolic steroid-induced hypogonadism: diagnosis and treatment [^114jpTYe]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop an understanding of hypogonadal men with a history of anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use and to outline recommendations for management.

Design

Review of published literature and expert opinions. Intended as a meta-analysis, but no quality studies met the inclusion criteria.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

Men seeking treatment for symptomatic hypogonadism who have used nonprescribed AAS.

Intervention(S)

History and physical examination followed by medical intervention if necessary.

Main Outcome Measures(S)

Serum testosterone and gonadotropin levels, symptoms, and fertility restoration.

Result(S)

Symptomatic hypogonadism is a potential consequence of AAS use and may depend on dose, duration, and type of AAS used. Complete endocrine and metabolic assessment should be conducted. Management strategies for anabolic steroid-associated hypogonadism (ASIH) include judicious use of testosterone replacement therapy, hCG, and selective estrogen receptor modulators.

Conclusion(S)

Although complications of AAS use are variable and patient specific, they can be successfully managed. Treatment of ASIH depends on the type and duration of AAS use. Specific details regarding a patient's AAS cycle are important in medical management.

Male hypogonadism (MH) is a common endocrine disorder. However, uncertainties and variations in its diagnosis and management exist. There are several current guidelines on testosterone replacement therapy that have been driven predominantly by single disciplines. The Society for Endocrinology commissioned this new guideline to provide all care providers with a multidisciplinary approach to treating patients with MH. This guideline has been compiled using expertise from endocrine (medical and nursing), primary care, clinical biochemistry, urology and reproductive medicine practices. These guidelines also provide a patient perspective to help clinicians best manage MH.

### Hypogonadism: its prevalence and diagnosis [^116ZkfHk]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome, which results from the failure of the testes to produce physiologic levels of testosterone and a normal number of spermatozoa due to defects at one or more levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Primary hypogonadism results from malfunction at the level of the testes due to a genetic cause, injury, inflammation, or infection. Hypothalamic and/or pituitary failure leads to secondary hypogonadism, most often as a result of genetic defects, neoplasm, or infiltrative disorders. The signs and symptoms of hypogonadism depend on the age of onset, severity of androgen deficiency, and underlying cause of androgen deficiency.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^111EbdnM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Approach to diagnosis and management of possible hypogonadism in men ≥ 50 years. 1 Recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia; osteoporosis (see Table 1). 2 Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) that was measured in the absence of high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. It is generally useful to repeat the measurement in this clinical setting. 3 Measure TT when patient is at baseline health. Confirm low TT with a second fasting sample. At a minimum, the confirmatory measurement should be done on a fasting sample drawn between 7 and 10 Am. 4 Assess serum free testosterone (FT) on confirmatory sample using an accurate method if the serum TT is 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected (see Table 2). Although some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone given the limitations discussed in the manuscript and focus instead on interpretation of SHBG along with total testosterone, this approach is congruent with assessing serum free testosterone with an accurate method. 5 Investigation for cause of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disorder includes clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, review of medications that affect the HPT axis and measurement of serum prolactin. Measurement of serum T4 might be useful if panhypopituitarism is suspected. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated. Evaluation of hyperprolactinemia also includes review of medications and measurement of TSH. Sellar imaging also indicated if there are symptoms of a sellar mass, serum LH is undetectable, or serum total testosterone is < 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L). 6 This includes optimization of management of chronic disease, stopping medications that can suppress the HPT axis if possible (eg, opioids, glucocorticoids), evaluation and treatment of depression and sleep apnea. 7 Consider karyotype for assessment for Klinefelter syndrome; offer testosterone treatment if there is no contraindication (including desire to conceive in the next 1–2 years). 8 The decision to offer testosterone therapy should take into consideration the likelihood of benefit and the potential risk. The benefits are highest in men with lower testosterone concentrations and men with concordantly low total and free testosterone concentrations. A trial of testosterone therapy may be offered if the following conditions are met: 1) there are no contraindications; 2) there has been a discussion regarding potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy and the uncertainties regarding long-term health outcomes; 3) patient-specific goals have been set; and 4) there is agreement that testosterone treatment will be stopped if these goals are not achieved. See text in manuscript. 9 Reassessment of men with high BMI consists of assessment for symptoms and signs of hypogonadism and re-measurement of testosterone. If there are symptoms of hypogonadism and low serum testosterone after 6–12 months of lifestyle changes, then testosterone therapy may be considered. Medical therapy to achieve weight loss and/or bariatric surgery should be considered for men whose BMI remains > 30 kg/m² after 6 months of lifestyle changes. Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; FT, free testosterone; HPT, hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TT, total testosterone; SHBG, sex hormone binding globulin.

### Expert consensus document: European consensus statement on congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism – pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^116opZbq]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) is a rare disorder caused by the deficient production, secretion or action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is the master hormone regulating the reproductive axis. CHH is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with > 25 different causal genes identified to date. Clinically, the disorder is characterized by an absence of puberty and infertility. The association of CHH with a defective sense of smell (anosmia or hyposmia), which is found in ∼50% of patients with CHH is termed Kallmann syndrome and results from incomplete embryonic migration of GnRH-synthesizing neurons. CHH can be challenging to diagnose, particularly when attempting to differentiate it from constitutional delay of puberty. A timely diagnosis and treatment to induce puberty can be beneficial for sexual, bone and metabolic health, and might help minimize some of the psychological effects of CHH. In most cases, fertility can be induced using specialized treatment regimens and several predictors of outcome have been identified. Patients typically require lifelong treatment, yet ∼10–20% of patients exhibit a spontaneous recovery of reproductive function. This Consensus Statement summarizes approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of CHH and discusses important unanswered questions in the field.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115K21QN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Evaluation for determining the etiology of hypogonadism — In men with hypogonadism, we suggest further evaluation to identify the etiology of hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or testicular dysfunction. For secondary hypogonadism, clinicians should perform serum prolactin and iron saturation measurements, and in certain cases, pituitary function testing and magnetic resonance imaging of the sella turcica to determine the cause of gonadotropin deficiency. For primary hypogonadism of unknown etiology, especially in those with testicular volume < 6 mL, clinicians should obtain a karyotype to diagnose KS. Values and preferences place high value on identifying men with secondary hypogonadism who might have pituitary or hypothalamic disorders that require management in addition to testosterone (T) treatment.

### Male hypogonadism [^117GZtpu]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Male hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome that results from failure to produce physiological concentrations of testosterone, normal amounts of sperm, or both. Hypogonadism may arise from testicular disease (primary hypogonadism) or dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit (secondary hypogonadism). Clinical presentations vary dependent on the time of onset of androgen deficiency, whether the defect is in testosterone production or spermatogenesis, associated genetic factors, or history of androgen therapy. The clinical diagnosis of hypogonadism is made on the basis of signs and symptoms consistent with androgen deficiency and low morning testosterone concentrations in serum on multiple occasions. Several testosterone-replacement therapies are approved for treatment and should be selected according to the patient's preference, cost, availability, and formulation-specific properties. Contraindications to testosterone-replacement therapy include prostate and breast cancers, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, severe lower-urinary-tract symptoms, and erythrocytosis. Treatment should be monitored for benefits and adverse effects.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114XKuPY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

How Should This Man Be Evaluated?

Does This Man Have Clinically Evident Androgen Deficiency?

The first step is to determine his pretest probability of hypogonadism. There is significant overlap of the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Because of his report of depressed mood and fatigue, the patient was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool that screened negative for major depression.

Careful assessment for symptoms and signs that are more specific for hypogonadism is a key first step in the evaluation (Table 1). In the initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Ageing Study, 3 sexual symptoms (low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections) were the only symptoms (out of a total of 19 candidate symptoms) that were consistently associated with a low serum testosterone in a syndromic fashion; diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. Of note, this epidemiology study cannot determine causality. Because reduced sexual activity has been proposed to lower serum testosterone, the observed association of sexual symptoms with low serum testosterone concentrations in the European Male Ageing Study might reflect reverse causation. In the European Male Aging Study, the prevalence of these sexual symptoms was 25% to 35% even in men with a normal serum testosterone. His symptoms of fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and have low diagnostic value. They may be caused by systemic disease (see below). However, the constellation of symptoms of sexual dysfunction and low serum testosterone justify further evaluation for androgen deficiency.

Table 1.
Clinical features of testosterone deficiency in men

The patient lacks more specific clinical signs of hypogonadism (Table 1), but these findings, such as new-onset or increased gynecomastia that is almost always characterized by breast pain and tenderness, deficient male pattern body hair (that is generally only seen in longstanding hypogonadism), hot flashes that might occur with acute onset of hypogonadism (eg, bilateral orchidectomy), and/or small (< 15 cc) testes are not common in hypogonadal middle-aged or older men. Although small testes are an uncommon finding in older men with newly diagnosed hypogonadism, Klinefelter syndrome, the most common cause of classic organic hypogonadism, is typically characterized by very small testes (≤ 4 cc each), is underdiagnosed (by 50% or more), and might not be diagnosed until middle or older age.

### When and when not to use testosterone for palliation in cancer care [^112dmymn]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Hypogonadism is common throughout the illness trajectory of patients with cancer. About two thirds of male patients with advanced cancer have hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal dysfunction and low testosterone levels. Chronic inflammation, comorbidities, cachexia, chemotherapy, and medications such as opioids, megestrol acetate, and corticosteroids contribute to primary and secondary hypogonadism. Studies have reported increased symptom burden, diminished quality of life, and poor prognosis associated with low testosterone levels in males with cancer. The Endocrine Society has published clinical practice guidelines for replacing testosterone in symptomatic patients with chronic illness and in patients receiving opioids; however, the role of testosterone therapy specifically in patients with cancer is not addressed. This review explores the potential benefits and limitations of testosterone replacement on the basis of current evidence.

### Association of male hypogonadism with risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 [^116n8JNy]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is male hypogonadism a risk factor for hospitalization for COVID-19?

Findings

In this cohort study of 723 men, those with hypogonadism had significantly higher odds than men with eugonadism of being hospitalized, independent of other known risk factors for COVID-19–related hospitalization. Men receiving testosterone therapy had a similar risk of hospitalization as men with eugonadism.

Meaning

This study suggests that men with hypogonadism are more likely to be hospitalized after COVID-19 infection compared with men with eugonadism and men receiving adequate testosterone therapy.

### Approach to the patient with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [^111Vn3ua]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) or secondary hypogonadism is defined as a clinical syndrome that results from gonadal failure due to abnormal pituitary gonadotropin levels. HH may result from either absent or inadequate hypothalamic GnRH secretion or failure of pituitary gonadotropin secretion. Several congenital and acquired causes, including functional and organic forms, have been associated with this condition. One important aspect of the HH diagnosis is that it may reflect the presence of a tumor of the hypothalamic pituitary region or even a systemic disease. On the other hand, functional forms of HH, characterized by a transient defect in GnRH secretion, are relatively common in women, in response to significant weight loss, exercise, or stress leading to hypothalamic amenorrhea. HH is typically characterized by low circulating sexual steroids associated with low or inappropriately normal gonadotropin levels. The precise and early diagnosis of HH can prevent negative physical and psychological sequelae, preserve normal peak bone mass, and restore the fertility in affected patients.

### Fertility issues for patients with hypogonadotropic causes of delayed puberty [^114NQTfg]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Delayed puberty presenting with low gonadotropins has multiple causes. Self-limited delay (constitutional delay) is generally considered benign, but adult height and bone mineral density may be compromised, and fertility has not been studied. Functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to a stressor is thought to resolve with removal of the stressor, but reproductive endocrine dysfunction can sometimes persist. Most but not all patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, a typically long-lasting condition, can achieve fertility with exogenous hormone therapy. Future studies are needed to determine fertility outcomes in self-limited delayed puberty and to more clearly define prognostic factors for fertility in functional and idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

### Paediatric and adult-onset male hypogonadism [^115z8uiU]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is of relevance in many processes related to the development, maturation and ageing of the male. Through this axis, a cascade of coordinated activities is carried out leading to sustained testicular endocrine function, with gonadal testosterone production, as well as exocrine function, with spermatogenesis. Conditions impairing the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis during paediatric or pubertal life may result in delayed puberty. Late-onset hypogonadism is a clinical condition in the ageing male combining low concentrations of circulating testosterone and specific symptoms associated with impaired hormone production. Testosterone therapy for congenital forms of hypogonadism must be lifelong, whereas testosterone treatment of late-onset hypogonadism remains a matter of debate because of unclear indications for replacement, uncertain efficacy and potential risks. This Primer focuses on a reappraisal of the physiological role of testosterone, with emphasis on the critical interpretation of the hypogonadal conditions throughout the lifespan of the male individual, with the exception of hypogonadal states resulting from congenital disorders of sex development.

### Managing congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism: a contemporary approach directed at optimizing fertility and long-term outcomes in males [^116oLt3Q]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH) is defined as a clinical syndrome of gonadal failure due to deficient hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. Whereas men with primary testicular dysfunction have irreversibly diminished spermatogenic capacity, gonadotrophin therapy provides men with HH the opportunity to restore endogenous testosterone production and spermatogenesis. Indeed, the prospect of fertility can be greatly enhanced by appropriate spermatogenesis induction treatment, backed by modern assisted reproduction technology in less robust responders, or those with less fertile partners. However, it has been long recognized that a significant proportion of men with congenital forms of HH do not respond favourably to conventional treatment approaches and, in this article, we explore possible reasons for this. Insights into the ontogenesis of the male reproductive tract and accumulating clinical evidence now support novel strategies in which interventions at various stages of life in individuals with more severe disease can potentially improve long-term sexual and reproductive outcomes.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hypogonadism and infertility: a neglected issue in immuno-oncology [^115VcFFz]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

The perturbation of sex hormone levels at the pituitary or gonadal level is not solely an issue of fertility and sexual health but might also affect efficacy and toxicity of ICIs. It has been reportedthat men derive a greater benefit from ICIs compared with women, which could be attributable to many biological factors including differences in the host hormonal milieu that affect response to ICIs. A systematic investigation of the potential impact of ICIs on gonadal function could be done by retrospectively analyzing sex hormone levels in serum from patients included in randomized clinical trials on adjuvant ICIs. Additionally, there are numerous clinical trials testing neoadjuvant ICIs in locally advanced tumors without prior anticancer therapy, a potential gonadotoxic effect of ICIs could be prospectively determined in these patients. Also, pooled analysis of real world data from large centers applying ICIs could provide important information regarding the clinical relevance of ICI-related hypogonadism. For a proper estimation of its true incidence, systematic collection of a minimal dataset including menopause status and measurement of LH, FSH and estradiol or testosterone levels, respectively, for all patients before starting ICIs and at occurrence of an irAE and every 3 months during therapy as well as during follow-up should be done. In particular, patients presenting with hypophysitis need long-term monitoring for gonadotropin deficiency in order to map the risk of persistent hypogonadism. Considering that patients with cancer rarely report spontaneously on their sexual health, physicians should regularly inquire on signs of hypogonadism such as erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, menstrual irregularities, vaginal dryness and hot flushes in order to detect patients at risk.

Confirming or excluding a potential effect of ICIs on gonadal function will not only help improve the counseling and treatment of patients with cancer in their reproductive years and the quality of life of cancer survivors but also contribute to a better understanding of the influence of sex hormones on efficacy and toxicity of these therapies.

Values and preferences in diagnosis: Our diagnostic strategy reflects our preference to avoid labeling men as having hypogonadism and requiring T therapy based on low T concentrations due to transient medical disorders, biological variations in T concentrations, technical variations and inaccuracy in T measurements, or SHBG abnormalities.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116hpcDJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Screening for hypogonadism — because of the lack of consensus on the extent to which hypogonadism is an important public health problem, as well as the lack of data on the performance characteristics of candidate screening tools, we do not recommend population screening. Therefore, screening for hypogonadism does not fulfill the necessary criteria to justify population-level screening. For case detection in clinical settings, we suggest that clinicians not use the available case-finding questionnaires for detecting T deficiency in men receiving health care for unrelated reasons, and we suggest that clinicians consider using TT concentration measurements for case detection in men with certain clinical disorders in whom the prevalence of hypogonadism is high and T treatment might be indicated. The recommendation not to routinely screen men in the general population places a high value on avoiding labeling, testing, treating, and monitoring healthy men for whom the benefits and risks are unclear, and places a low value on the potential benefits of early detection and treatment of T deficiency in men who have not sought medical attention.

Results of this meta-analysis have potentially important implications for the management of men with hypogonadism. Worldwide prescribing of testosterone for hypogonadism is increasing; however, conflicting messages on testosterone safety might have caused variations in treatment among patients. We have conducted the most comprehensive study to date investigating the safety of testosterone treatment of hypogonadism. Testosterone treatment did not increase cardiovascular event risk in the short term to medium term. Furthermore, we did not identify subgroups with high cardiovascular risk. An ongoing trial is investigating the longer-term safety of testosterone, and future studies are needed to analyse the risk–benefit and cost-effectiveness of testosterone therapy. However, the current results provide some reassurance about the short-term to medium-term safety of testosterone to treat male hypogonadism.

### Managing congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism: a contemporary approach directed at optimizing fertility and long-term outcomes in males [^114VMKgD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Hormonal induction of spermatogenesis offers men with azoospermia due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH) the promising prospect of fertility restoration. However, an important exception is the subset of individuals affected by congenital hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (CHH), also known as Kallmann syndrome if associated with anosmia, who often display dismal responses to fertility induction, despite prolonged therapy. This primarily stems from the loss of minipuberty, which is a crucial phase of testicular maturation in early life that has a far-reaching impact on eventual spermatogenic capacity. Further exacerbating the compromised reproductive health is the failure to initiate timely pubertal induction in many CHH patients, resulting in suboptimal genital and psychosexual development. In this paper, the clinical implications and management of male HH across the lifespan is comprehensively reviewed, with a special focus on novel strategies that have the potential to modify disease severity and maximize fertility potential in CHH by addressing the inadequacies of conventional approaches.

His serum FSH was 4.1 IU/L (reference range, 1.0–7.0 IU/L), and LH was 3.2 IU/L (reference range, 1.0–8.0 IU/L).

What Additional Diagnostic Evaluation Is Necessary to Exclude Classic Organic Hypothalamic-Pituitary Pathology in a Man With Low Serum Total Testosterone and Normal Serum Gonadotropin Concentrations?

Most middle-aged and older, obese men with a low testosterone will have secondary hypogonadism with normal serum gonadotropin concentrations. Men with secondary hypogonadism should be clinically assessed for Cushing syndrome and sleep apnea. Evaluation for identifiable hypothalamic and pituitary pathology should be individualized because the yield is typically low. In men ≥ 50 years old with low serum testosterone and normal gonadotropin concentrations, clinical experience suggests that the probability of classic organic hypothalamic-pituitary pathology is inversely related to BMI, age, number of comorbidities, and testosterone concentration. In older, obese men, pseudohypogonadism due to obesity is the most common cause for the biochemical constellation of low serum total testosterone (due to low SHBG), normal serum free testosterone, and normal gonadotropins, reflecting a eugonadal state. In secondary hypogonadism due to structural or genetic hypothalamic-pituitary disorders, gonadotropins are often low or undetectable.

Pituitary imaging in secondary hypogonadism — When evaluating middle-aged and older men with secondary hypogonadism, the cost-effectiveness of pituitary imaging to exclude pituitary and/or hypothalamic disease is unknown, and surveys have revealed a low prevalence of hypothalamic–pituitary abnormalities. Clinicians can improve the diagnostic yield of pituitary imaging by performing it in men with panhypopituitarism, persistent hyperprolactinemia, serum TT < 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L), or symptoms of tumor mass effect such as visual impairment, visual field defect, or new onset headache. Many men with secondary hypogonadism have potentially reversible or treatable causes of gonadotropin suppression and low T concentrations that may be managed without need for testosterone treatment.

### Testosterone replacement options [^117PeeQx]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment of male hypogonadism is complicated by the multitude of treatments available, the lack of a clear understanding of the differences between treatment modalities, barriers to treatment, and patient misperceptions, unrealistic expectations, and anxieties. This article is intended to help the practitioner better understand the challenges of testosterone replacement options in order to better counsel and treat their patients with hypogonadism.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113Y6q86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The patient does not have unexplained anemia that might suggest hypogonadism. His osteopenia is consistent with, but not specific for sex steroid deficiency. Observational and experimental studies consistently suggest that bone health is typically compromised at serum total testosterone concentrations of < 200 ng/dL (6.9 nmol/L).

His initial assessment identifies comorbidities that could be partially responsible for his clinical presentation. Reduced pedal pulses and erectile dysfunction indicates likely atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk. The clinical history suggests uncontrolled sleep apnea that could be the primary cause of his fatigue and suppressed HPT axis and a factor in his erectile dysfunction. Of note, hypoxemia in older men with sleep apnea can be associated with increases in hematocrit and thus could mask testosterone deficiency–associated anemia in this man.

There are no clinical features suggesting classic organic causes of hypogonadism, including Klinefelter syndrome, hypopituitarism, pituitary mass effect, or endogenous Cushing syndrome, and he is not taking medications that can suppress the HPT axis, such as opioids or glucocorticoids. Moreover, there is no history of common risk factors for primary and secondary hypogonadism such as testicular trauma, radiation to the pelvis, chemotherapy, significant head trauma, or radiation to the head or neck. In summary, his clinical probability of classic pathologic hypogonadism is low to moderate. His symptoms might be due to depression (with a false negative result in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9), atherosclerotic disease of the penile vasculature, obesity, sleep apnea, or some combination of these causes. Because the man has had a very low serum testosterone measured, it is incumbent to exclude hypogonadism with an appropriate evaluation (Fig. 1).

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — prostate cancer risk discussion and monitoring: In hypogonadal men 55 to 69 years old, who are being considered for testosterone therapy and have a life expectancy > 10 years, we suggest discussing the potential benefits and risks of evaluating prostate cancer risk and prostate monitoring and engaging the patient in shared decision making regarding prostate cancer monitoring. For patients who choose monitoring, clinicians should assess prostate cancer risk before starting testosterone treatment and 3 to 12 months after starting testosterone. In hypogonadal men being considered for testosterone therapy who are 40 to 69 years old and at increased risk of prostate cancer, we suggest discussing prostate cancer risk with the patient and offering monitoring options.

### Systemic effects of the hormonal treatment of male hypogonadism with preliminary indications for the management of COVID-19 patients [^116gjrsj]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Male hypogonadism, defined as an inadequate production of testosterone (T), is associated with a greater morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological studies identified T deficiency as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Also, low serum T levels impact on glucose homeostasis through a worse glucose uptake, utilization, and disposal, and the general negative impact on metabolism. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive and updated overview of the effects of T replacement therapy on metabolic and cardiovascular systems and prostate tissue in patients with hypogonadism, including molecular mechanisms through which T exerts its actions. Furthermore, recent findings on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemiology have shown a greater mortality in male compared with female patients and a role of T in promoting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection of the host cells has been demonstrated. Hence, the secondary aim of this review is to provide preliminary indications on the management in patients with COVID-19.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^1113xBos]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult-onset hypogonadism (AOH) in middle-age and older men is described as a syndrome with low testosterone (T) and low or normal gonadotropins that is distinct from classical primary or secondary hypogonadism because it may include elements of both presentations. The Sexual Medicine Society of North America defines AOH as a clinical and biochemical syndrome characterized by T deficiency with symptoms and signs due to testicular and/or hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) dysfunction, and it is characterized by failure to mount an adequate compensatory pituitary response to low T with gonadotropin levels low or in the normal range. For contrast, primary hypogonadism is identified by low T with elevated gonadotropin levels (luteinizing hormone [LH]; follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]), whereas secondary hypogonadism results from gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) deficiency such as pituitary or hypothalamic failure and may arise from HP injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation. The panel also deliberated on a diagnostic process for AOH, the rationale for T therapy, and a monitoring protocol for T-treated patients.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^113goj3z]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical signs and symptoms — adult-onset hypogonadism: Adult-onset hypogonadism is an often overlooked condition because hypogonadal men often ignore their symptoms, and the clinical signs and symptoms are variable and nonspecific with a gradual onset and slow progression. Because T influences all steps of the male sexual response cycle, sexual dysfunction is common and can be the presenting symptom; symptoms may include hypoactive sexual desire, reduced nocturnal and morning erections, reduced sex-induced erections, delayed ejaculation, and reduced semen volume. The clinical practice guidelines of the Endocrine Society and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists as well as other authors suggest that physicians should measure the T levels of men with any of the symptoms and signs given in Table 2. The physical examination may not be helpful in making an AOH diagnosis.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1132LYjC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Men with low serum testosterone concentrations can be characterized as having classic hypogonadism (sometimes called organic hypogonadism) due to an identifiable pathology or disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT, gonadal) axis, or they can be characterized as eugonadal with suppression of the gonadal axis due to a systemic disorder or condition. A low serum testosterone due to suppression of the gonadal axis by a systemic disorder is analogous to the changes in thyroid function seen in euthyroid sick syndrome and is sometimes described as functional hypogonadism. Similar to euthyroid sick syndrome (or nonthyroidal illness), men with low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis by systemic disease might have underlying normal HPT function. Because the serum testosterone might normalize if the underlying disorder is treated and health restored, eugonadal sick syndrome or nongonadal illness might be more accurate terms than functional hypogonadism. These terms have the advantage of identifying the underlying gonadal axis as normal and not conflating functional with reversible; pathologies and disorders associated with classic hypogonadism are also potentially reversible (eg, hyperprolactinemia, iron overload syndromes). Classic pathologic hypogonadism is relatively uncommon with estimated lifetime prevalence < 1%. Low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis is common and increases with age and body mass index (BMI). Some experts use the term late-onset hypogonadism for functional hypogonadism in older men. The terms functional hypogonadism and late-onset hypogonadism suggest that testosterone treatment might be beneficial, a concept that has not been proven.

### Panel testing for the molecular genetic diagnosis of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism-a clinical perspective [^112yxk2E]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis and management of CHH

Unlike with many other rare diseases, CHH is amenable to treatment with replacement of either GnRH, gonadotropin or sex steroid hormones. Whilst early intervention is optimal, even with treatment in adult life interventions can result in restoration of fertility in both men and women in approximately 75% of patients. However, both delayed presentation and diagnosis are common in this condition, as clinical assessment can be challenging with subtle symptoms and signs of hypogonadism that can be missed. There are many instances of first diagnosis in adult life, when patients present with hypogonadism, lack of libido and reduced energy levels and bone density, or are diagnosed during investigations for infertility. In women, where the condition is less prevalent it is also less frequently considered, and, without the red flag features of micropenis, cryptorchidism and small volume testes that may be diagnostic clues in men, can present an even more elusive clinical picture.

This diagnostic challenge is particularly pertinent for paediatric endocrinologists looking after adolescents with delayed puberty. In these patients, the presentation of isolated or constitutional delay in puberty – a common and usually self-limiting condition - may be indistinguishable from CHH by traditional biochemical investigations. Both conditions will present with low sex steroid and gonadotropin concentrations, and even recently adopted biomarkers (such as inhibin B) do not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to discriminate GnRH deficiency from constitutional delay. Additionally, patients with partial CHH may enter puberty but then stall, lending further complexity to the diagnostic algorithm.

Therefore, the potential for genetic testing to investigate a patient with suspected CHH or KS, in order to make a clear diagnosis where clinical phenotypic and biochemical features have not provided one, is an attractive avenue to pursue. The imperative to make this diagnosis in a timely manner in adolescence is driven not only by the need to reduce invasive and costly investigations and uncertainty for the patient, but also because the timing and nature of treatment differs depending on the underlying condition. For patients with CHH, therapy to induce puberty will be given promptly and at an earlier age and male patients can be offered treatment with gonadotropins to increase their potential for future fertility. Delays in diagnosis have also been shown to lead to significant psychological and emotional distress for the patients and their families.

### Female hypogonadism: evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis [^112tfS8z]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Female hypogonadism refers to deficient or abnormal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis that clinically presents with menstrual cycle disturbances. Female hypogonadism can be due to a congenital or acquired cause, and the defect can be at the level of the hypothalamus, pituitary or ovary. A careful history, physical exam and selected laboratory testing can often determine the locus of the defect and whether it results from a structural or hormonal problem. Laboratory testing generally relies on basal hormone levels; however, timing of blood sampling in relation to menses is important to interpretation of the data.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1176zTxe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In this article, we use a case-based approach to outline the assessment and management of men older than 50 years presenting with features of androgen deficiency and a low testosterone level, based on a review of the literature (PubMed), using the search terms " male hypogonadism", " testosterone deficiency", " androgen deficiency", " functional hypogonadism", " late onset hypogonadism", as well as the clinical experience of the authors. We will focus on the diagnosis and management of possible androgen deficiency (Fig. 1). Fertility will not be discussed. Many of the principles and recommendations that we discuss are pertinent to men under age 50. However, we focus on men ≥ 50 years old in this manuscript because of the following: 1) the prevalence of low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology increases significantly in men starting at age 40–50; 2) most of the high-quality epidemiological and randomized controlled studies of men with low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology were performed in men ≥ 50 years old; 3) the diagnostic evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years old differs from younger because a) evaluation for hypothalamic and pituitary disease with sellar imaging and evaluation for iron overload syndromes is often unnecessary in older men; b) infertility due to HPT dysfunction is less commonly important for men ≥ 50 years old; and c) long-term suppression of the HPT axis (iatrogenic androgen deficiency) is much more likely to occur with exogenous testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years old.

Diagnostic evaluation of suspected testosterone deficiency begins with "Measure morning fasting total T* (and free T* if altered SHBG or borderline total T, Table 2)". Abnormal results are "Confirm by repeating morning fasting total T (and free T5)", after which "Diagnosis of hypogonadism is confirmed"; if instead "Normal total T or Normal or low total T and normal free T", then "Consider other causes of symptoms and signs". Following confirmation, "Measure LH and FSH" (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) to differentiate "LH and FSH low or inappropriately normal (Secondary hypogonadism)" — with actions to "Consider potentially reversible functional causes, Table 1", "Measure prolactin, iron saturation", "Evaluate other pituitary hormones (if clinically indicated5)", and "Pituitary MRI (if indicated7)" — from "LH and FSH high (Primary hypogonadism)", for which to "Obtain karyotype to diagnose Klinefelter syndrome (if clinical indication)". The figure specifies that "The lower limit of the normal total testosterone (TT) harmonized to the CDC standard in healthy nonobese young men is 264 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L) (9); this limit could be used for TT assays that are CDC certified" and that "Free testosterone (FT) should be measured by an equilibrium dialysis method or estimated from total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin using a formula that accurately reflects FT by equilibrium dialysis".

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study suggest that men with hypogonadism are more likely than men with eugonadism to be hospitalized after COVID-19 infection. They also suggest that men with hypogonadism who receive adequate TTh to achieve normal testosterone concentrations have a reduction in the risk of COVID-19–related hospitalization. Prospective clinical trials are needed to explore the efficacy of TTh in preventing hospitalizations after COVID-19 and similar respiratory illnesses among men with hypogonadism.

Diagnosis of hypogonadism in men — etiology and definitions — Primary hypogonadism results in low T concentrations, impairment of spermatogenesis, and elevated gonadotropin levels, with causes including Klinefelter syndrome (KS), cryptorchidism, some types of cancer chemotherapy, radiation to the testes, trauma, torsion, infectious orchitis, HIV infection, anorchia syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy. Secondary hypogonadism results in low T concentrations, impairment of spermatogenesis, and low or inappropriately normal gonadotropin levels, with causes including hyperprolactinemia; severe obesity; iron overload syndromes; the use of opioids, glucocorticoids, or androgen-deprivation therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists; androgenic–anabolic steroid (AAS) withdrawal syndrome; idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; hypothalamic or pituitary tumors or infiltrative disease; head trauma; and pituitary surgery or radiation.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^113E5ViQ]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult-onset hypogonadism and co-occurring conditions — secondary hypogonadism associations show that in a sample of 4220 men presenting to a sexual dysfunction clinic, 89% of those diagnosed with secondary hypogonadism did not have a diagnosable source and most of these patients (70.7%) had a concomitant metabolic disease. Adult-onset hypogonadism more often occurs in men who have chronic disease states that are more common as men age, and high body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared), central adiposity, and the MetS are associated with low serum total T.
