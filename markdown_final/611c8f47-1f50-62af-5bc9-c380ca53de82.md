## Question

CanJardiance be used with stage 4 renal disease and DMN?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Jardiance (empagliflozin) can be used in stage 4 chronic kidney disease with diabetic nephropathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact eGFR threshold that defines stage 4 CKD and how that maps to regulatory labeling. Then, I should verify what the pivotal trials (especially EMPA-KIDNEY) actually enrolled and what outcomes they showed in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Next, I will review contemporary guideline positions from ADA, KDIGO, and CCS. After that, I need to check safety considerations and practical monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note any exceptions or caveats, making sure I reconcile any apparent contradictions between older labeling and newer evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition and the regulatory baseline. Stage 4 CKD corresponds to eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m², and the original FDA labeling for empagliflozin advised against use for glycemic control when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², which would seem to exclude stage 4 by default for glycemic indications [^727b3dc4] [^79c7f20e].

> Wait, let me verify the trial evidence that might override that older stance. EMPA-KIDNEY enrolled adults with CKD, including a substantial proportion with eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and demonstrated that empagliflozin 10 mg reduced the risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death, with benefits consistent across eGFR subgroups down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m², which directly informs a renoprotective indication rather than a glycemic one [^2fc9f356] [^781ff0ca] [^727b3dc4].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline evolution because practice often moves ahead of labeling. The ADA 2025 Standards recommend initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit in T2DM and CKD when eGFR is 20 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher, explicitly to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events, which operationalizes EMPA-KIDNEY into a lower eGFR threshold than the older glycemic-only label [^5d00ef8b]. KDIGO 2022 similarly supports SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD progression risk reduction across a range of eGFR, including many patients with eGFR below 30, and emphasizes that the initial eGFR dip is expected and not a reason to stop therapy if clinically appropriate [^d4cbd075]. The CCS 2022 guideline likewise recommends SGLT2 inhibitors for adults with CKD at risk of progression when eGFR is at least 25 mL/min/1.73 m², aligning with the expanded cardiorenal indications [^84d3784c].

> I need to ensure I distinguish glycemic from cardiorenal indications. The diminished glucose-lowering effect at low eGFR means empagliflozin should not be started for glycemic control when eGFR is below 30, but the renal and cardiovascular benefits persist independent of glycemic effects, which is why regulators and guidelines now endorse use for CKD risk reduction even when eGFR is 20–29, albeit with counseling about limited A1c impact [^727b3dc4] [^d421f231] [^5d00ef8b].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring so I don't jump to conclusions. The main risks include volume depletion and genital mycotic infections, with higher rates in older adults and those on diuretics; clinically, I should check volume status, adjust diuretics as needed, and monitor creatinine and potassium after initiation, recognizing that a modest, reversible eGFR decline is expected and not an automatic reason to stop therapy if the patient is otherwise stable [^727b3dc4] [^f7d51ad6] [^d4cbd075]. I should double-check that no new safety signals emerged in EMPA-KIDNEY for eGFR below 30; none were identified that would contraindicate use in appropriately selected patients with close follow-up [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on an ACE inhibitor or ARB and has significant albuminuria? Does that change the calculus? The renal benefits of empagliflozin are additive to RAAS blockade, and subgroup analyses in EMPA-KIDNEY show consistent effects across albuminuria categories, supporting continuation or initiation of empagliflozin on top of maximally tolerated RAAS therapy when eGFR is 20 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher [^781ff0ca] [^5d00ef8b].

> I should confirm dosing and practical details. For CKD risk reduction, the recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, with no dose adjustment required for renal impairment, and no need to stop solely due to a further eGFR decline after initiation if the patient remains clinically stable and benefits are anticipated, which aligns with KDIGO guidance on not discontinuing for the initial eGFR dip [^5c6959c9] [^d4cbd075].

> Putting this together, I need to be precise. Yes, Jardiance (empagliflozin) can be used in stage 4 CKD with diabetic nephropathy when the intent is cardiorenal protection and the eGFR is at least 20 mL/min/1.73 m², recognizing that glycemic efficacy is minimal at this level and that therapy should be supervised with attention to volume status and lab monitoring. It should not be started for glycemic control alone when eGFR is below 30, and use below eGFR 20 or in dialysis remains unsupported by current evidence and labeling [^5d00ef8b] [^727b3dc4] [^2fc9f356].

---

Empagliflozin (Jardiance) **can be used in stage 4 CKD with diabetic nephropathy** when eGFR is ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², as it reduces kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events independent of glycemic effects [^5d00ef8b] [^781ff0ca]. It is **not recommended for glycemic control** when eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² because glucose-lowering efficacy is minimal at low GFR [^727b3dc4] [^d421f231]. Use the standard 10 mg daily dose with close monitoring of eGFR, electrolytes, and volume status; discontinue if eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m² or if adverse effects occur [^5c6959c9] [^d4cbd075].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting use in stage 4 CKD

Recent trials show empagliflozin provides **renoprotective and cardiovascular benefits** in advanced CKD, including stage 4:

- **EMPA-KIDNEY trial**: Included patients with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², including 35% with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Empagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28% (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64–0.82), with consistent benefits across eGFR subgroups, including those with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^781ff0ca] [^2fc9f356].

- **CREDENCE trial**: Although primarily enrolling patients with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², a post hoc analysis of 174 participants with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² showed consistent renal benefits with canagliflozin, a class analogue, supporting the class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in advanced CKD [^0fd8ae76].

- **DAPA-CKD trial**: Dapagliflozin, another SGLT2 inhibitor, demonstrated significant renal and cardiovascular benefits in patients with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m², including those with advanced CKD, further reinforcing the class effect [^63f33ec6].

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to stage 4 CKD

Empagliflozin's benefits in advanced CKD are **independent of glycemic control** and mediated by:

- **Reduction of intraglomerular pressure**: Via inhibition of SGLT2-mediated sodium reabsorption, restoring tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing hyperfiltration, which persists even at low eGFR [^980ca291] [^d421f231].

- **Antiproteinuric effects**: Significant reductions in albuminuria, a marker of slowed nephropathy progression [^d421f231].

- **Cardiovascular benefits**: Reduced blood pressure, improved arterial stiffness, and decreased sympathetic activity, contributing to lower cardiovascular risk [^980ca291].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide **clear recommendations** for empagliflozin use in advanced CKD:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ADA 2025 | Initiate SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin, in patients with T2DM and CKD with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^5d00ef8b] |
| KDIGO 2022 | Recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD progression risk reduction in patients with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², regardless of diabetes status [^notfound] |
| CCS 2022 | Recommend SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce kidney failure, cardiovascular death, and heart failure hospitalization in adults with CKD and eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m² [^84d3784c] |

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

While empagliflozin is generally well tolerated, **clinicians should monitor**:

- **Initial eGFR decline**: A transient, reversible eGFR dip of ~3–5 mL/min/1.73 m² is expected within 2–4 weeks; monitor renal function and electrolytes during this period [^d4cbd075].

- **Volume depletion**: Increased risk in elderly or those on diuretics; assess volume status and adjust diuretics as needed [^f7d51ad6].

- **Hyperkalemia**: Monitor potassium, especially in patients on ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

- **Genital infections**: Higher incidence reported; counsel patients on hygiene and prompt treatment.

- **Discontinuation**: Stop if eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m² or if adverse effects occur [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Empagliflozin is **not recommended** for glycemic control when eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² due to minimal glucose-lowering effect, though cardiorenal benefits persist [^727b3dc4] [^d421f231]. It is also contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to empagliflozin or severe renal impairment requiring dialysis.

---

## Summary of benefits and risks

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Reduced progression to ESRD | Transient eGFR decline |
| Lower cardiovascular events | Volume depletion |
| Antiproteinuric effects | Hyperkalemia |
| Improved cardiovascular risk profile | Genital infections |

---

Empagliflozin is **appropriate for stage 4 CKD with diabetic nephropathy** when eGFR is ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², providing significant renoprotective and cardiovascular benefits. It is not recommended for glycemic control at low eGFR, and use should be accompanied by careful monitoring and adherence to current guidelines.

14.5 Chronic Kidney Disease Trial in Adults

EMPA-KIDNEY (NCT03594110) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in adults with chronic kidney disease (eGFR ≥ 20 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; or eGFR ≥ 45 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2with urine albumin to creatinine ratio [UACR] ≥ 200 mg/g). The trial excluded patients with polycystic kidney disease or patients requiring intravenous immunosuppressive therapy in the preceding three months or > 45 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) at the time of screening. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the effects of empagliflozin as an adjunct to standard of care therapy, including RAS-inhibitor therapy when appropriate, on time to kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death.

A total of 6,609 patients, were equally randomized to JARDIANCE 10 mg or placebo and were followed for a median of 24 months.

The mean age of the study population was 63 years (range: 18 to 94 years) and 67% were male. Approximately 58% of the study population were White, 36% Asian, and 4% Black or African American. Approximately 44% of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus.

At baseline, the mean eGFR was 37 mL/min/1.73 m2, 21% of patients had an eGFR equal to or above 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, 44% had an eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 35% had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. The median UACR was 329 mg/g, 20% of patients had a UACR < 30 mg/g, 28% had a UACR 30 to ≤ 300mg/g, and 52% had a UACR > 300 mg/g. Approximately 1% of patients had type 1 diabetes at baseline. The most common etiologies of CKD were diabetic nephropathy/diabetic kidney disease (31%), glomerular disease (25%), hypertensive/renovascular disease (22%) and other/unknown (22%).

Renal Impairment

A total of 738 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a baseline eGFR less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate the efficacy of JARDIANCE in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal impairment. The trial population comprised of 290 patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), 374 patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 74 with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). A total of 194 patients with moderate renal impairment had a baseline eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2and 180 patients had a baseline eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

At Week 24, JARDIANCE 25 mg provided statistically significant reduction in HbA1c relative to placebo in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see Table 13). A statistically significant reduction relative to placebo was also observed with JARDIANCE 25 mg in patients with either mild [-0.7 (95% CI: -0.9, -0.5)] or moderate [-0.4 (95% CI: -0.6, -0.3)] renal impairment and with JARDIANCE 10 mg in patients with mild [-0.5 (95% CI: -0.7, -0.3)] renal impairment.

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^781ff0ca]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

At baseline, 85% of patients were treated with ACE inhibitor or ARB, 64% with statins, and 34% with antiplatelet agents.

JARDIANCE was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, or CV or renal death. The treatment effect reflected a reduction in a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, and CV death. There were few renal deaths during the trial. JARDIANCE also reduced the risk of first and recurrent hospitalization (see Table 18 and Figure 13); information collected on the reason for hospitalization was insufficient to further characterize the benefit.

Figure 13	Time to First Occurrence of the Primary Composite Endpoint, Sustained ≥ 40% eGFR Decline, Sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m, ESKD or Renal Death, or CV Death

The results of the primary composite endpoint were generally consistent across the pre-specified subgroups examined, including eGFR categories, underlying cause of kidney disease, diabetes status, or background use of RAS inhibitors (see Figure 14). The treatment benefit with JARDIANCE on the primary composite endpoint was not evident in patients with very low levels of albuminuria, however there were few events in these patients.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE for glycemic control were evaluated in a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In this trial, 195 adult patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 91 adult patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 97 patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. The glucose lowering benefit of JARDIANCE 25 mg decreased in adult patients with worsening renal function. The risks of renal impairment, volume depletion adverse reactions and urinary tract infection-related adverse reactions increased with worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Use of JARDIANCE for glycemic control in patients without established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

JARDIANCE was evaluated in 7,020 adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, in a total of 9,718 patients with heart failure (eGFR greater than or equal to 20 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials, and in 6,609 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 20 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPA-KIDNEY study. The safety profile across eGFR subgroups in these trials was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4, 14.5)].

Efficacy and safety trials with JARDIANCE did not enroll adult patients with an eGFR less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2or on dialysis. Once enrolled, adult patients in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY trials were not required to discontinue therapy for worsening of eGFR to less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2or initiation of dialysis [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4, 14.5)].

Clinical Trial in Pediatric Patients Aged 10 to 17 Years with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

JARDIANCE was administered to 52 patients in a trial of 157 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus with a mean exposure to JARDIANCE of 23.8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Background therapies as adjunct to diet and exercise included metformin (51%), a combination of metformin and insulin (40.1%), insulin (3.2%), or none (5.7%). The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.0% and the mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 2.1 years. The mean age was 14.5 years (range: 10–17 years) and 51.6% were aged 15 years and older. Approximately, 50% were White, 6% were Asian, 31% were Black or African American, and 38% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 36.0 kg/m2and mean BMI Z-score was 3.0. Approximately 25% of the trial population had microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria.

The risk of hypoglycemia was higher in pediatric patients treated with JARDIANCE regardless of concomitant insulin use. Hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose < 54 mg/dL, occurred in 10 (19.2%) patients and in 4 (7.5%) patients treated with JARDIANCE and placebo, respectively. No severe hypoglycemic events occurred (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon or take other corrective actions).

Clinical Trials in Adults with Heart Failure

No new adverse reactions were identified in EMPEROR-Reduced or EMPEROR-Preserved heart failure trials.

Clinical Trial in Adults with Chronic Kidney Disease

The safety profile in patients with chronic kidney disease was generally consistent with that observed across the studied indications. In a long-term cardio-renal outcome trial [see Clinical Studies 14.5], in patients with chronic kidney disease, the occurrence of lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 2.9, and 4.3 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, and JARDIANCE 10 mg treatment arms, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 2,721 (32%) patients treated with JARDIANCE were 65 years of age and older, and 491 (6%) were 75 years of age and older. JARDIANCE is expected to have diminished glycemic efficacy in elderly patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. The risk of volume depletion-related adverse reactions increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 2.1%, 2.3%, and 4.4% for placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg. The risk of urinary tract infections increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 10.5%, 15.7%, and 15.1% in patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY trials, no overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. EMPEROR-Reduced included 1,188 (64%) patients treated with JARDIANCE 65 years of age and older, and 503 (27%) patients 75 years of age and older. EMPEROR-Preserved included 2,402 (80%) patients treated with JARDIANCE 65 years of age and older, and 1,281 (43%) patients 75 years of age and older. EMPA-KIDNEY included 2,089 (32%) patients treated with JARDIANCE 65 years of age and older, and 1,518 (23%) patients 75 years of age and older.

### Class effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiorenal outcomes [^3ab1a09e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is significantly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is a risk factor for heart failure (HF); diabetic patients are hospitalized for HF approximately four times more frequently than nondiabetic patients. T2DM is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). T2DM is also associated with non-healing lower extremity wounds, deep tissue osteomyelitis, metabolic bone disease, anemia, pancreatitis, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Further, T2DM medications often have deleterious side effects. Thiazolidinediones are linked to edema, HF hospitalization (HHF) and cardiovascular (CV) death in certain patient subsets. Oral sulfonylureas are associated with hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and CV death, although a recent intervention trial found that sulfonylureas had similar rates of CV events compared to pioglitazone (1.5/100 patient-years for both groups, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74–1.26, p = 0.79).

The 2008 United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) antidiabetic drug guidance required cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) for novel antihyperglycemic medications to demonstrate that new drugs would not increase the risk for MI, stroke, or CV death. The FDA has approved four sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) based on these guidelines: canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), empagliflozin (Jardiance), and ertugliflozin (Steglatro). A fifth SGLT2i, sotagliflozin (Zynquista), is in late clinical development. Multiple expert consensus decisions attest to the potential of SGLT2i as a promising new class for the treatment of patients with T2DM and established CVD.

Three SGLT2i (canagliflozin, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin) have been studied in CVOTs; canagliflozin has also been studied in an additional randomized clinical trial involving patients with diabetic kidney disease. This review will explore the design and results of each of the four key SGLT2i trials and discuss the potential determinants for their CV, renal, and safety outcomes.

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^b2c68cb5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

JARDIANCE significantly reduced the risk of first occurrence of primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.99). The treatment effect was due to a significant reduction in the risk of CV death in subjects randomized to empagliflozin (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.77), with no change in the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (see Table 15 and Figures 5 and 6). Results for the 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin dosages were consistent with results for the combined dosage groups.

The efficacy of JARDIANCE on CV death was generally consistent across major demographic and disease subgroups.

Vital status was obtained for 99.2% of subjects in the trial. A total of 463 deaths were recorded during the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. Most of these deaths were categorized as CV deaths. The non-CV deaths were only a small proportion of deaths and were balanced between the treatment groups (2.1% in patients treated with JARDIANCE, and 2.4% of patients treated with placebo).

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^980ca291]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2, the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.

Empagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, increasing tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing intraglomerular pressure, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulating sympathetic activity.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Urinary Glucose Excretion

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following a dose of empagliflozin and was maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period averaging at approximately 64 grams per day with 10 mg empagliflozin and 78 grams per day with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Data from single oral doses of empagliflozin in healthy subjects indicate that, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg and 25 mg doses.

Urinary Volume

In a 5-day study, mean 24-hour urine volume increase from baseline was 341 mL on Day 1 and 135 mL on Day 5 of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily treatment.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, crossover study, 30 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of empagliflozin 25 mg, empagliflozin 200 mg (8 times the maximum dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either 25 mg or 200 mg empagliflozin.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin has been characterized in healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and no clinically relevant differences were noted between the two populations. The steady-state mean plasma AUC and Cmaxwere 1,870 nmol∙h/L and 259 nmol/L, respectively, with 10 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment, and 4,740 nmol∙h/L and 687 nmol/L, respectively, with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment. Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner in the therapeutic dose range. Empagliflozin does not appear to have time-dependent pharmacokinetic characteristics. Following once-daily dosing, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state.

### The treatment effectiveness evaluation for slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy during stage 4 chronic kidney disease [^5966e5e2]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Our research study had several strengths. First, to our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate DN in stage 4 CKD. Second, the DN patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed by renal biopsy. Lastly, we assessed the time to the development of ESRD based on the follow-up data of stage 4 CKD patients with DN, and this information may be used as a reference for future clinical evaluations.

Despite these strengths, our study also had several limitations. First, the sample size was small because few diabetic patients with kidney disease underwent renal biopsy, especially in stage 4 CKD. The biopsied DN patients in the present study were clinically atypical. Therefore, the results may not be applicable to all DN patients with stage 4 CKD. Hence, our findings will require confirmation in a multicenter study. Second, this study had a retrospective design and failed to retain blood and urine samples for further research and analysis. Third, the renal tissue specimens obtained from the renal biopsy did not have enough volume to extract protein to carry out other more diversified experiments.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

This was a retrospective study. We enrolled patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and kidney disease who underwent a renal biopsy at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2019. The renal biopsy operators were clinicians with many years of relevant experience in our department. The patient inclusion criteria were: (1) biopsy-proven DN; (2) patients undergoing renal biopsy in stage CKD 4 (eGFR between 15 and 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2). The exclusion criteria were DN patients with other nephropathies, such as non-diabetic renal disease, who had a biopsy specimen with < 5 total glomeruli and who were followed up in our hospital for < 4 months (Fig. 1).

### The canagliflozin and renal endpoints in diabetes with established nephropathy clinical evaluation (CREDENCE) study rationale, design, and baseline characteristics [^c063821b]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

People with diabetes and kidney disease have a high risk of cardiovascular events and progression of kidney disease. Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors lower plasma glucose by reducing the uptake of filtered glucose in the kidney tubule, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion. They have been repeatedly shown to induce modest natriuresis and reduce HbA1c, blood pressure, weight, and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the effects of these agents on kidney and cardiovascular events have not been extensively studied in patients with type 2 diabetes and established kidney disease.

Methods

The Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial aims to compare the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin -versus placebo at preventing clinically important kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes and established kidney disease. CREDENCE is a randomized, double-blind, event-driven, placebo-controlled trial set in in 34 countries with a projected duration of ∼5.5 years and enrolling 4,401 adults with type 2 diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, and albuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio > 300 to ≤ 5,000 mg/g). The study has 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the risk of the primary outcome (α = 0.05), the composite of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or cardiovascular death.

Conclusion

CREDENCE will provide definitive evidence about the effects of canagliflozin on renal (and cardiovascular) outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and established kidney disease.

### Canagliflozin for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease and implications for clinical practice: a narrative review [^f077359b]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects millions of people worldwide, elevating their risk of developing a range of complications, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). People with T2DM and CKD (i.e. diabetic kidney disease, DKD) have an increased risk of progressing to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), experiencing cardiovascular complications, and premature death. Despite this, DKD is primarily addressed through management of risk factors, and there are few pharmaceutical treatments capable of reversing or delaying disease progression. Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor that was initially developed as a blood glucose–lowering agent for people with T2DM. Evidence from clinical trials of canagliflozin in people with T2DM, as well as evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials in people with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk, provided preliminary evidence suggesting that it may also have beneficial renal effects. The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial was a dedicated renal outcomes trial of canagliflozin that assessed its renal effects in people with DKD. Overall, the CREDENCE trial demonstrated that canagliflozin improves renal outcomes and slows early disease progression in people with DKD. These data supported the approval of canagliflozin for the treatment DKD, the first new treatment in almost 20 years; therefore, it is important for clinicians to understand how to implement this treatment in their clinical practice.

### Canagliflozin and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes and nephropathy [^de5b49a5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study CREDENCE was published by Perkovic V and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and Chronic kidney disease. In the CREDENCE study, the trial question was: what is the role of canagliflozin in patients with T2DM and kidney disease? In the CREDENCE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CREDENCE study, the population was: 4401 patients (1494 female, 2907 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM and kidney disease. The key exclusion criteria were diabetic ketoacidosis, T1DM mellitus, renal transplant, chronic dialysis, uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization procedure. In the CREDENCE study, the interventions were: n = 2202 canagliflozin (100 mg PO once daily) n = 2199 placebo (matching tablet). In the CREDENCE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the incidence of ESRD, doubling of creatinine, renal death, or CV death (4.3% / y vs. 6.1% / y; HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.82). In the CREDENCE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from any cause (5.8% vs. 9.1%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02) Significant decrease in CV death or hospitalization for HF (5.9% vs. 11.5%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.83) Significant decrease in CV death, MI or CVA (9.9% vs. 12.2%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.95). In the CREDENCE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, including lower-limb amputation and fracture. In the CREDENCE study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM and kidney disease, canagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of ESRD, doubling of creatinine, renal death, or CV death.

Nephropathy Screening and Treatment

General recommendations

To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize glucose control. (A)
To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize blood pressure control. (A)

Screening

Perform an annual test to assess urine albumin excretion (UAE) in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetes duration of ≥ 5 years and in all type 2 diabetic patients, starting at diagnosis. (E)
Measure serum creatinine at least annually in all adults with diabetes regardless of the degree of UAE. The serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and stage the level of chronic kidney disease (CKD), if present. (E)

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, with hypertension and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. (E)
Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (UAE rate, GFR) and is recommended (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of UAE to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

On the other hand, the most recent Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study trial (CANVAS) evaluated patients with T2DM to receive either canagliflozin or placebo. After a follow‐up to 338 weeks, patients treated with canagliflozin demonstrated a regression of albuminuria (89.4 participants per 1000 patient‐years vs 128.7 participants per 1000 patient‐years (P < 0.05) and renal function preservation compared to placebo, suggesting and supporting a renoprotective effect in DKD. 97 Nonetheless, it is important to highlight the amputation rate increase in patients in treatment with canagliflozin compared to placebo as a secondary outcome as well, with 6.3 participants per 1000 patient‐years vs 3.4 participants per 1000 patient‐years (P < 0.05). 97 Nonetheless, this adverse effect still remains to be studied and proven, as it may simply reflect the higher probability of these patients to be accepted for surgery as they present a better preoperatory glycaemic control. Another ongoing trial for canagliflozin, named the Evaluation of the Effects of Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Participants with Diabetic Nephropathy (CREDENCE) is expected to complete in 2019. 97, 98 It aims to analyse the risk of canagliflozin vs placebo in terms of renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with established kidney disease, by enrolling 4401 adults with T2DM with eGFR between 30 and 90 mL/min/1.73 and albuminuria. 98, 99

Dapagliflozin has also been suggested to exert direct renoprotection. A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study that included 252 patients with CKD stage 3A/B showed significant shifting to lower categories for albuminuria despite no significant difference in eGFR and HbA1c, strongly suggesting that renoprotection by SGLT2 inhibitors may strongly depend on eGFR. 100 Ongoing clinical trial evaluating the long‐term effect of dapagliflozin on renal outcomes and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD (DAPA CKD) is expected completion in 2020. This trial is focused on the effect of this SGLT2‐inhibitor compared to placebo on renal outcomes/mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD, with an estimated enrolment of 4000 participants. 101 Aside from cardiovascular and renal protection, this class of agents is also associated with a reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of −4.0 mm Hg and −1.6 mm Hg, respectively. 101, 102

As a result of the results of CREDENCE the FDA have approved canagliflozin as a specific treatment for DKD. It can now be initiated in patients with stage 3 CKD (down to eGFR 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2) and those patients who progress to ESKD can continue canagliflozin if already receiving it, but the dose should be adjusted to 100 mg daily. The European Medicines Agency have now extended the licence of canagliflozin to the treatment of diabetics with stage 2 and 3 CKD and albuminuria.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy and safety of RAYALDEE were evaluated in two identical multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease and serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 10 and 30 ng/mL. Subjects were stratified by chronic kidney disease stage and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive RAYALDEE or a matching placebo at bedtime over 26 weeks. The dose of RAYALDEE was 30 mcg once daily for the first 12 weeks and either 30 or 60 mcg once daily for the last 14 weeks. The dose was increased to 60 mcg at the start of week 13 if the plasma intact PTH level was greater than 70 pg/mL, the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was less than 65 ng/mL and the serum calcium level was less than 9.8 mg/dL.

A total of 213 subjects were randomized in one trial (72 received placebo and 141 received RAYALDEE), and 216 subjects were randomized in the second trial (72 received placebo and 144 received RAYALDEE). The subjects' mean age was 66 years (range 25–85), 50% were male, 65% White, 32% African-American or Black and 3% Other. At baseline, subjects had secondary hyperparathyroidism, and stage 3 (52%) or stage 4 (48%) chronic kidney disease without macroalbuminuria. The most common causes of chronic kidney disease were diabetes and hypertension and the mean estimated GFR was 31 mL/min/1.73m2. Mean baseline intact PTH was 130 pg/mL for subjects with stage 3 disease (n = 222) and 166 pg/mL for subjects with stage 4 disease (n = 207). Mean serum calcium was 9.2 mg/dL, mean serum phosphorus was 3.7 mg/dL and mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 20 ng/mL. Of the 429 subjects randomized, 354 (83%) completed the studies.

Follow-Up and Renal Outcome

The survival curve for the condition of using ARB therapy is shown in Fig. 2 a. In the 'use of ARB' group, median survival duration was 25.3 (95% CI 19.7–30.9) months and in the 'no use of ARB' group was 12.7 (95% CI 7.0–18.7) months. The overall median survival duration was 17.3 (95% CI 7.4–27.3) months. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year renal survival rates were 58.9%, 38.8%, and 17.2%, respectively. Primary endpoint events occurred in 29 individuals (63.0%) during follow-up, including 24 who developed to ESRD and 5 who died before progression to ESRD. Two individuals died of heart failure, one of respiratory failure, and the other two individuals of sepsis. Results of the comparison between the main clinical parameters at baseline and during the follow-up (or at the final assessment) are shown in Table 3.

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Subjects

This 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was conducted at 89 centres in 19 countries and consisted of an AHA adjustment period (if required; consisting of a dose titration period of up to 4 weeks and an 8-week dose stable period); a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period; a 26-week, double-blind, core treatment period; and a 26-week, double-blind, extension period (data to be reported in a separate publication). Eligible subjects were men and women aged ≥ 25 years with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.0 and ≤ 10.5%) and stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 and < 50 ml/min/1.73 m 2), and were either not on AHA therapy or were on a stable AHA regimen (monotherapy or combination therapy with any approved agent including metformin, sulphonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, α-glucosidase inhibitor, GLP-1 analogue, pioglitazone or insulin) for ≥ 8 weeks (≥ 12 weeks with pioglitazone) prior to the week –2 visit. Subjects were required to have generally stable renal function, as determined by a ≤ 25% decrease in eGFR from the screening to the week –2 visits. Subjects on AHA regimens not consistent with local prescribing guidelines (e.g. metformin therapy) underwent an AHA adjustment period of up to 12 weeks before the placebo run-in period. Subjects were to remain on their stable AHA regimens through the completion of the 52-week treatment period (unless glycaemic rescue criteria were met, as discussed below).

Subjects were excluded if they had repeated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 15.0 mmol/l (270 mg/dl) during the pretreatment phase; a history of T1DM; renal disease that required immunosuppressive therapy, dialysis or transplant; nephrotic syndrome or inflammatory renal disease; New York Heart Association Class III-IV cardiovascular disease; myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization procedure or cerebrovascular accident within 3 months prior to screening; or haemoglobin concentration < 100 g/l (10 g/dl) at screening.

The study protocol and amendments were approved by the institutional review boards at participating institutions and the study was conducted under the guidelines of Good Clinical Practices and the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^d27c0da2]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: in patients with CKD having either an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or albuminuria, we recommend adding SGLT2i to standard treatment of diabetic nephropathy. We further recommend using GLP1-RA as a second line following SGLT2i (Grade A, B)

The renal outcomes of the AHAs have been summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1. Patients with T2DM carry two to fourfolds' risk of developing CV mortality, and once they develop proteinuria the risk increases to eightfolds compared to general population. Interestingly, it has been reported that patients with T2DM are 16–60 times more likely to die of premature heart disease than to reach end stage renal disease. Once eGFR declines below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, the risk for death, major CV events, and hospitalisation increases.

Diabetic kidney disease occurs in a continuum that starts with the risk factors of hypertension, T2DM, smoking, and metabolic syndrome progressing to microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, mild/moderate/end stage renal disease, and dialysis followed by renal transplant. Tight glycaemic and blood pressure control are very effective in reducing microvascular complications and diabetic nephropathy. SGLT2i are the novel interventions in management of diabetic nephropathy, data from the EMPA-REG outcomes trial showed that empagliflozin resulted in 39% risk reduction of new onset or worsening nephropathy (HR 0.61; CI 0.53–0.70; p < 0.001) and CV death (HR: 0.61; CI 0.55–0.69; p < 0.001). More significant findings were 44% risk reduction in doubling of serum creatinine (HR: 0.56; CI 0.39–0.79; p < 0.001), 55% reduction in initiation of renal replacement therapy (HR: 0.45; CI 0.21–0.97; p < 0.001) or death from renal disease (HR: 0.61; CI 0.55–0.69; p < 0.001). Dapagliflozin has shown similar beneficial effects in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial — it reduced the composite renal outcomes in high risk patients by 24%. Data from the CANTATA-SU trial (CANagliflozin Treatment And Trial Analysis-Sulfonylurea) showed that the use of canagliflozin was associated with initial decreases in eGFR, which then stabilized from week 12 to 52; whereas in the glimepiride arm, there was a progressive decline observed.

The progression of chronic kidney disease is difficult to stop once established. Metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors show promise, but clinical trials with a head-to-head comparison in patients with more advanced (stage 3b-4) chronic kidney disease are largely lacking, partly for safety reasons. In this issue, Corremans et al. compare the effects of metformin and canagliflozin in rats with adenine-induced moderate (stage 2–4) chronic kidney disease. Metformin halted progression, whereas canagliflozin did not. This commentary puts the results in a wider clinical context.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^bf6be81e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major advance for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial have clearly demonstrated that canagliflozin prevents kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The results from three other large-scale randomized trials, collectively enrolling > 30 000 participants, have provided further evidence that the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on major kidney outcomes in people with T2DM may be present across the class, although this will only be known for certain when Dapagliflozin and Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with CKD (DAPA-CKD) (NCT03036150) and The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) (NCT03594110) are reported over coming years. Importantly, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition have been achieved in addition to the current standard of care. This review summarizes evidence for SGLT2 inhibition in people with T2DM and CKD, evaluates key patient characteristics and concomitant drug use that may influence the use of these drugs in people with CKD, discusses current guideline recommendations and explores how these drugs may be used in people with CKD in the future, including in combination with other treatments.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 3 nephropathy [^91d5e7bc]. American Journal of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Some sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are approved for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73 m(2). The efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, an approved SGLT2 inhibitor, was evaluated in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD; eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)).

Methods

This analysis used integrated data from four randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies that enrolled patients with T2DM and stage 3 CKD. RESULTS are presented for the overall population as well as subgroups with stage 3a CKD (eGFR ≥ 45 and < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and stage 3b CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 and < 45 ml/min/1.73 m(2)).

Results

Among all subjects studied with stage 3 CKD, placebo-subtracted reductions in HbA1c (-0.38 and -0.47%; p < 0.001), body weight (-1.6 and -1.9%; p < 0.001), and systolic blood pressure (-2.8 and -4.4 mm Hg; p < 0.01) were seen with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg, respectively. Decreases in HbA1c, body weight, and systolic blood pressure were examined in the stage 3a and 3b CKD subgroups, with greater decreases in HbA1c, -0.47% (-0.61, -0.32) and body weight in subjects in stage 3a CKD, -1.8% (-2.3, -1.2) with canagliflozin 100 mg. Initial declines in eGFR were seen early following treatment initiation with canagliflozin, but trended towards baseline over time. The most common adverse events with canagliflozin included genital mycotic infections and adverse events related to reduced intravascular volume likely secondary to osmotic diuresis.

Conclusion

In subjects with T2DM and stage 3 CKD, canagliflozin reduced HbA1c, body weight, and blood pressure, and was generally well tolerated.

The link between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease

Chronic kidney disease is a continuum of pathology that manifests as decreased glomerular filtration and increased albuminuria. Albuminuria is an important, but somewhat overlooked, risk factor. Even small increases in albuminuria elevate the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and the presence of albuminuria may be used to refine estimates of the risk of developing ESRD and cardiovascular disease compared with estimated GFR alone. Once abnormal levels of albumin are detected in the urine of patients with diabetes, death from cardiovascular disease is more likely than the development of renal failure, although a substantial proportion of patients will still develop ESRD. A 5-year prospective study of 27,998 patients with renal impairment, of whom 15.8% were identified as having diabetes as the primary cause of renal disease, found that the incidence of death was 19.5% and that of renal replacement therapy was only 1.1% in the patients who started the study with stage 2 chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2). For patients with stage 3 disease (estimated GFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2), the respective incidences were 24.3% and 1.3%. In those with stage 4 disease (estimated GFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m 2), the incidence rose to 45.7% and 19.9%, respectively. The presence of diabetes at baseline resulted in a higher incidence of death for each stage of chronic kidney disease, and the relatively high incidence of death in the stage 2 cohort was attributed to patients with diabetes. Patients with diabetic nephropathy account for 27% of those undergoing dialysis. Once a patient is on dialysis, the risk of dying of cardiovascular disease in an individual under 30 years old is equivalent to adding 50 years to his or her actual age.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has received growing attention as a global public health problem because of the increased incidence of end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD). Sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to have effects beyond glucose lowering that include benefits on DKD. The initial effect of SGLT2 inhibition is manifested by a dip in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), primarily reflecting reduction of glomerular hyperfiltration through normalization of tubuloglomerular feedback, followed by stabilization of eGFR during prolonged treatment. The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial, the first large trial of SGLT2 inhibitors dedicated to evaluate kidney outcomes, has shown that canagliflozin, relative to placebo, slows the progression of eGFR decline and reduces the risk of ESKD in participants with established DKD. The DAPA‐CKD trial showed that dapagliflozin reduced the risk of ESKD and prolonged survival in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). These benefits were consistent in patients with and without type 2 diabetes. In the CREDENCE trial, almost all participants had macroalbuminuria at baseline, and therefore it remains unclear as to whether the benefit on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes shown in the CREDENCE trial can be extended to individuals with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.

The effect of CANagliflozin in type 2 diabetic PatIents with micrOalbuminuria in JapaNEse population (CANPIONE) study is uniquely designed to test the effect of canagliflozin on the first primary outcome, the longitudinal profile of change in urinary albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline to the intervention period (weeks 4‐52), and the second primary outcome, change in eGFR slope (calculated by subtracting the individual preintervention slope from the chronic slope [weeks 4‐52] during the intervention period). The novelty of the study protocol is to evaluate change in eGFR slope by taking into account both the preintervention and chronic slopes at the individual participant level. Because the individual preintervention slope represents a participant‐specific natural course of eGFR decline before intervention, this method allows precise evaluation of the treatment effect on individual DKD progression and might provide a clue for evaluating the individual treatment efficacy in the personalized medicine for DKD.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^37313390]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease with microalbuminuria — In hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and a GFR greater than 70 mL/min/1.73 m2, studies demonstrated equivalent efficacy of the 2 agents in slowing loss of kidney function, and follow-up in most studies of microalbuminuric patients generally was in the range of 2 to 4 years. Because no trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria have demonstrated a reduction in such clinical outcomes as CKD stage 5, doubling of serum creatinine level, or death, the Work Group concluded that evidence for treatment of microalbuminuric patients with these medicines is moderate, representing a change in level of evidence grading from "strong" in the NKF-KDOQI CPGs on Hypertension and Antihypertensive Agents in CKD; in the absence of participation in such a clinical trial, the Work Group recommends this treatment despite moderate evidence.

### The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic kidney disease: what to expect from new oral hypoglycemic agents [^72f197ea]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people have chronic kidney disease (CKD), whose most common causes include hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and diabetes. About 40% of patients with diabetes develop CKD and intensive blood glucose control through pharmacological intervention can delay CKD progression. Standard therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus include metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. While these drugs have an important role in the management of type 2 diabetes, only the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone can be used across the spectrum of CKD (stages 2–5) and without dose adjustment. Newer therapies, particularly dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, are increasingly being used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes; however, a major consideration is whether these newer therapies can also be used safely and effectively across the spectrum of renal impairment.

### Canagliflozin and cardiovascular and renal events in type 2 diabetes [^f659e5ae]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study CANVAS (canagliflozin) was published by Neal B and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the CANVAS (canagliflozin) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of canagliflozin in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk? In the CANVAS (canagliflozin) study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the CANVAS (canagliflozin) study, the population was: 10142 patients (3633 female, 6509 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk. The key exclusion criteria were history of diabetic ketoacidosis, TIDM, pancreas or β-cell transplantation, renal disease requiring treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, history of chronic dialysis or renal transplant. In the CANVAS (canagliflozin) study, the interventions were: n = 5795 canagliflozin (at a dose of 300 mg or 100 mg in CANVAS and initial dose of 100 mg daily with an optional increase to 300 mg starting from week 13 in CANVAS-R) n = 4347 placebo (matching placebo). In the CANVAS (canagliflozin) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (26.9 vs. 31.5; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97). In the CANVAS (canagliflozin) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in progression of albuminuria (89.4 vs. 128.7; HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.79). In the CANVAS (canagliflozin) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events leading to discontinuation (35.5 vs. 32.8 patients per 1,000 patient-years; HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99–1.28). significant differences in risk of amputation of toes, feet, or legs (6.3 vs. 3.4 patients per 1,000 patient-years; HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.41–2.75) and serious adverse events (104.3 vs. 120.0 patients per 1,000 patient-years; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87–1.00). In the CANVAS (canagliflozin) study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk, canagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: extending the indication to non-diabetic kidney disease? [^0ed68cbe]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This year the medical community was pleasantly surprised by the results of the first large outcome trial that primarily examined the renal effects of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin (CANA) in subjects with diabetes and impaired kidney function. The Evaluation of the Effects of Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Participants With Diabetic Nephropathy (CREDENCE) trial showed that CANA, relative to placebo, reduces the risk for end-stage renal disease, doubling of creatinine or renal death by 34% [hazard ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.53–0.81]. These effects were consistent across baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and haemoglobin A1c subgroups. In this review we combine the results of the CREDENCE trial with those of several cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors and show that, unexpectedly, patients with lower eGFR levels may have greater benefit with respect to cardiovascular outcome than patients with normal kidney function. The cardio- and renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors seem to be independent of their glucose-lowering effects, as shown in several post hoc analyses. In this review we discuss the alleged mechanisms of action that explain the beneficial effects of this novel class of drugs. Moreover, we discuss whether these findings indicate that this class of drugs may also be beneficial in non-diabetic chronic kidney diseases.

### Outcomes with finerenone in participants with stage 4 CKD and type 2 diabetes: a FIDELITY subgroup analysis [^118ac842]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

When considering the components of the kidney composite outcome, finerenone consistently reduced the risk of sustained ≥ 57% decrease in eGFR versus placebo in participants with stage 4 CKD. The proportion of participants experiencing a kidney failure event (eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 or ESKD) was higher than those experiencing a sustained ≥ 57% decrease in eGFR in the stage 4 CKD subgroup. The opposite was true for the stage 1–3 CKD subgroup. This observation may be explained by the fact that a ≥ 57% decrease in eGFR from baseline in participants who began the trial with stage 4 CKD would invariably be experienced at an eGFR level below the < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 threshold.

Comparing these results with recent trials of other treatment agents is difficult because of differences in entry criteria and efficacy outcomes. Nonetheless, a post hoc analysis of the CREDENCE trial of canagliflozin in CKD and type 2 diabetes, including 174 participants with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, showed that the kidney-protective effects of canagliflozin in these participants were consistent with those observed in participants with an eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. In agreement with observations reported here, a 33% reduction in UACR was reported in the CREDENCE post hoc analysis with canagliflozin versus placebo, and the rate of eGFR decline was also reduced. Similar to FIDELITY, participants treated with dapagliflozin in the DAPA-CKD trial had an eGFR ≥ 25 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, but type 2 diabetes was not a requirement for study entry. A subsequent analysis of 624 participants with stage 4 CKD (approximately 65% with type 2 diabetes) showed a consistent benefit of dapagliflozin in reducing the risk of major kidney and cardiovascular events, as well as attenuating progressive eGFR decline compared with participants with less-advanced CKD. In addition, in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin was shown to reduce the risk of kidney disease progression over a median of 2 years of follow-up in a population including 2282 (35%) participants with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, with or without type 2 diabetes.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in subjects with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^fbc43559]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The efficacy on glycaemic parameters and body weight reduction observed with canagliflozin in this population of subjects was less than that seen in subjects with T2DM who have normal or only mildly impaired renal function. This is not unexpected because the rate of UGE is related to both plasma glucose concentration and eGFR; with lower eGFR, the ability of canagliflozin to augment UGE is attenuated. With lesser increases in UGE, the glucose-lowering efficacy of canagliflozin is also reduced. Results from the current study are consistent with those from a phase 1 canagliflozin study showing reduced UGE and decreased RT G lowering in subjects with stage 3 CKD compared with subjects with normal renal function. Owing to the limited amount of UGE observed with canagliflozin treatment in patients with more severe renal insufficiency, SGLT2 inhibitors are not expected to be efficacious for patients with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e. stages 4 or 5 CKD) or for dialysis patients.

### Efficacy and safety of sotagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe renal impairment [^9ee0b5ab]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the efficacy and safety of sotagliflozin, a dual inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter-1 and -2, in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD4).

Materials and Methods

This 52-week, phase 3, randomized (1:1:1), placebo-controlled trial evaluated sotagliflozin 200 mg and sotagliflozin 400mg once daily in 277 patients with T2D and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 15 to 30mL/min/1.73m 2. The primary endpoint was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction with sotagliflozin 400mg versus placebo at 26weeks. A hierarchical statistical testing approach was used.

Results

The baseline mean HbA1c was 65 ± 12 mmol/mol (8.1% ± 1.1%), systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 144 ± 15mmHg, and eGFR was 24 ± 4 mL/min/1.73m 2. Placebo-adjusted changes with sotagliflozin 400mg were -3 mmol/mol (-0.3%; 95% confidence interval -7 to 0.6 [-0.6 to 0.05]; P = 0.096) and -8 mmol/mol (-0.7%; -13 to -3 [-1.2 to -0.2]; P = 0.003) in HbA1c at Weeks 26 and 52, respectively, -1.5 kg (-3.0 to -0.1) in body weight at Week 26, -5.4mmHg (-9.4 to -1.3) in SBP at Week 12, and -0.3 mL/min/1.73m 2 (-2.1 to 1.6; P = 0.776) in eGFR at Week 52. Over 52weeks, 11.8%, 5.4% and 3.3% of patients receiving placebo and sotagliflozin 200 and 400mg, respectively, required rescue therapy for hyperglycaemia. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 82.8%, 86.2% and 81.1% of patients and serious cardiovascular AEs occurred in 12.9%, 3.2% and 4.4% of patients in the placebo and sotagliflozin 200 and 400mg groups, respectively.

Conclusions

After 26weeks, HbA1c reductions with sotagliflozin were not statistically significant versus placebo in adults with T2D and CKD4. The 52-week safety profile was consistent with results of the SCORED outcomes trial (NCT03242018).

14.4 Canagliflozin Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Adults with Diabetic Nephropathy and Albuminuria

Canagliflozin is indicated to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), doubling of serum creatinine, cardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria ˃ 300 mg/day.

The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation Trial (CREDENCE) was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing canagliflozin with placebo in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, an eGFR ≥ 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2and albuminuria (urine albumin/creatinine ˃ 300 to ≤ 5,000 mg/g) who were receiving standard of care including a maximum-tolerated, labeled daily dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).

The primary objective of CREDENCE was to assess the efficacy of canagliflozin relative to placebo in reducing the composite endpoint of end stage kidney disease (ESKD), doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death.

Patients were randomized to receive canagliflozin 100 mg (N = 2,202) or placebo (N = 2,199) and treatment was continued until the initiation of dialysis or renal transplantation.

### Rationale and protocol of the study of diabetic nephropathy with atRasentan (SONAR) trial: a clinical trial design novel to diabetic nephropathy [^5790da38]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Individuals with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for renal events. Recent trials of novel treatments have been negative, possibly because of variability in response to treatment of the target risk factor. Atrasentan is a selective endothelin A receptor antagonist that reduces urinary albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio (UACR), with a large variability between patients. We are assessing its effect on renal outcomes in the Study Of diabetic Nephropathy with AtRasentan (SONAR; NCT01858532) with an enrichment design (> 30% lowering of albuminuria) to select patients most likely to benefit.

Materials and Methods

SONAR is a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial with approximately 3500 participants who have stage 2–4 CKD and macroalbuminuria and are receiving a maximum tolerated dose of a renin‐angiotensin system inhibitor.

Results

After 6 weeks of exposure to atrasentan 0.75 mg once daily (enrichment period), participants with ≥ 30% UACR decrease and no tolerability issues (responders) were randomly assigned to placebo or atrasentan 0.75 mg/day. The responder group will be used for primary efficacy and safety analyses. Approximately 1000 participants with < 30% UACR reduction (non‐responders) were also randomized to placebo or atrasentan. The primary endpoint is a composite of a sustained doubling of serum creatinine or end‐stage renal disease. The original power calculation indicated that a total of 425 primary renal events in the responder group provides 90% power to detect a 27% reduction in relative risk (alpha level of.05).

Conclusion

SONAR aims to determine whether atrasentan added to guideline‐recommended therapies safely reduces the risk of CKD progression and delays the onset of end‐stage renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. SONAR also aims to establish whether the enrichment of patients based on their initial "surrogate" response to atrasentan will deliver a trial design in accord with personalized treatment of diabetic kidney disease.

Participants had a mean age of 63 years, HbA1c of 8.3%, body mass index of 31.3 kg/m 2, and had T2DM for an average duration of 16 years. Most CREDENCE trial participants were male (66%) and white (67%). In addition, 60% of people had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline. Overall, participants had a mean eGFR of 56.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2, a median UACR of 927 mg/g, and 99.9% were taking a maximally tolerated dose of a RAAS inhibitor.

Canagliflozin treatment was associated with a 30% relative risk reduction of the primary composite outcome of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, or renal or cardiovascular death compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59–0.82; P = 0.00001; Fig. 3). Consistent effects were seen for the components of the primary composite endpoint, as well as the secondary renal, cardiovascular, and mortality endpoints (Fig. 4).

### Canagliflozin for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease and implications for clinical practice: a narrative review [^0790e9d0]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The CREDENCE trial has demonstrated the effects of canagliflozin that improve renal outcomes and slow early disease progression in people with T2DM and DKD. In addition to the positive effects on kidney function, treatment with canagliflozin also decreased the prevalence of all comorbid complications in CREDENCE trial participants, demonstrating the potential this treatment has to reduce the DKD-related expenditures in the health care industry. Data from other trials investigating the use of SGLT2 inhibitors will be crucial for further establishing the value and efficacy of this class of drugs in people at high renal risk and probing the extension of these benefits to a wider range of people.

Regarding medical management for diabetic nephropathy, more specifically with respect to SGLT-2 inhibitors, CCS 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate an SGLT-2 inhibitor to reduce the composite of significant decline in eGFR, progression to end-stage kidney disease, or kidney death, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for HF in adult patients with CKD (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 20 mg/mmol and eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m²).

### Rationale, design and baseline characteristics of the CANagliflozin cardioVascular assessment study-renal (CANVAS-R): a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^45581001]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

The change in albuminuria class selected as the primary outcome for CANVAS‐R has been used in multiple previous renal outcome trials, 2, 4, 19, 20, 21, 22 and positive effects on albuminuria class change resulted in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) providing a labelled indication for irbesartan as a treatment for patients with microalbuminuria and diabetes. Consistent with the move towards earlier intervention in diabetic nephropathy, there are ongoing discussions regarding the potential for albuminuria class transition to serve as an outcome for which an indication might be provided in other clinical settings. In the meantime, however, it will be necessary to demonstrate that any benefits of canagliflozin on albuminuria will translate into protection against ESRD. This line of investigation has received support in recent months after post hoc analyses of the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial that have identified potential large protective effects of the compound against both albuminuria and ESRD. 9 Accordingly, exploratory analyses of the effects of canagliflozin on a range of clinical renal outcomes have been added to the CANVAS‐R protocol. Analysis of these outcomes within CANVAS‐R, along with analyses of the same exploratory outcomes across the integrated data from the CANVAS‐R and CANVAS trials, will provide additional near‐term information about the effects of canagliflozin and the broader SGLT2 class on hard renal outcomes. Ultimately, the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on the development of ESRD will need to be defined in a dedicated renal trial, and the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) study (NCT02065791) has been initiated for that purpose.

### Outcomes with finerenone in participants with stage 4 CKD and type 2 diabetes: a FIDELITY subgroup analysis [^35882b1f]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Markedly, the cumulative incidence analysis in participants with stage 4 CKD suggested an initial delay in the time to experiencing a first kidney composite event (eGFR of < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 for most participants) in the finerenone versus placebo recipients, supporting possible early kidney protection with finerenone (Figure 2). For participants with stage 4 CKD, there was a slower accumulation of first kidney events in the finerenone versus placebo groups during the first 2 years of follow-up. Indeed, finerenone versus placebo risk differences over time suggested a reduction in the risk of kidney outcomes over the first 2 years. However, this effect was not consistent with the results observed beyond the 2-year time point (Figure 3, Table 2). Notably, risk difference CIs became larger and crossed 0, indicating a loss of precision after 2 years (Figure 3, Table 2).

The lack of observable reduction in the kidney composite beyond the 2-year time point in participants with stage 4 CKD may have been due to the severe state of irreversible kidney damage associated with this advanced disease, which might hinder long-term improvements. However, it could also be related to limited study power to assess such an effect or to limited ability of the predefined kidney composite outcome (which was selected to examine kidney disease progression in the whole study population) to reflect, in a similarly objective manner, kidney disease progression in participants at this advanced disease stage over the specific time frame. This notion is supported by the fact that in a similar manner to the overall FIDELITY population, in participants with stage 4 CKD, finerenone was associated with significant differences versus placebo in both intermediate kidney outcomes tested. A significant difference in the chronic eGFR slope was noted between finerenone and placebo, and the total eGFR slope was numerically lower in participants who received finerenone versus placebo. UACR was significantly reduced with finerenone by 31% at month 4 compared with baseline. Of note, a discrepancy between the effects of the active drug on the predefined composite kidney outcome versus the chronic eGFR slope was also noted in the EMPA-KIDNEY study, where empagliflozin did not seem to significantly affect the composite kidney outcome in participants with UACR < 30 mg/g and UACR ≥ 30 to ≤ 300 mg/g but was associated with better preservation of the chronic eGFR slope versus placebo in both these participant subgroups.

### Effects of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and stages 3b-4 chronic kidney disease [^41ed73b2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The principal finding of this pooled analysis of a large phase 3 program is that in patients with type 2 diabetes and Stages 3b–4 CKD, dapagliflozin decreases albuminuria, BP and body weight. These beneficial effects were apparent after 4 weeks of treatment with dapagliflozin and generally persisted throughout the 102-week follow-up period. Dapagliflozin did not decrease HbA1c compared with placebo treatment, indicating that the observed effects on albuminuria, BP and body weight are dissociated from hypoglycemic effects and possibly mediated by natriuretic/diuretic mechanisms. eGFR was relatively stable over time, both with dapagliflozin and placebo treatment. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated in the study population. The overall proportion of adverse events was similar among dapagliflozin- and placebo-treated patients.

Improving glycemic control has been proven to be important in reducing the risk of microvascular complications of diabetes. In our population of patients with type 2 diabetes and Stages 3b–4 CKD, dapagliflozin did not improve glycemic control. Based on this lack of efficacy, SGLT2 inhibitors are currently not recommended for the treatment of diabetes in patients with impaired renal function. Dapagliflozin, however, favorably influenced other cardiovascular risk markers, including BP and albuminuria, in the present study. Similar findings have been observed with two other SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin. The magnitude of albuminuria reduction was clinically meaningful and, based on large epidemiological studies, might be expected to translate into an ∼40% relative risk reduction for end-stage kidney disease. This finding helps to justify a dedicated clinical outcome trial to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and Stages 3b–4 CKD.

The study FLOW was published by Vlado Perkovic and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease, Diabetes mellitus type 2 and Diabetic nephropathy. In the FLOW study, the trial question was: what is the effect of semaglutide in patients with T2DM and CKD? In the FLOW study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the FLOW study, the population was: 3533 patients (1069 female, 2464 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM and CKD. The key exclusion criteria were congenital or hereditary kidney disease; use of GLP-1 receptor agonists within 30 days before screening; NYHA Class IV HF; planned coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery revascularization; current chronic or intermittent hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. In the FLOW study, the interventions were: n = 1767 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for 4 weeks, then 0.5 mg once weekly for another 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 1.0 mg once weekly) n = 1766 placebo (matching placebo for 8 weeks). In the FLOW study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in major kidney disease events (18.7% vs. 23.2%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88). In the FLOW study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in mean annual rate of decline in eGFR (2.19 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 3.36 mL/min/1.73 m²; MD -1.16, 95% CI -1.47 to -0.86) Significant decrease in major cardiovascular events (12% vs. 14.4%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98) Significant decrease in death from any cause (12.8% vs. 15.8%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.95). In the FLOW study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in allergic reactions, hepatic disorder, or severe hypoglycemia. significant difference in serious adverse events (49.6% vs. 53.8%). In the FLOW study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM and CKD, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to major kidney disease events.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) — cardiorenal effects and prioritization — are summarized, noting that SGLT2is "continue to exert their renal protective benefit for those with low eGFRs (eg, < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2)" and "modestly increase LDL-C levels (4 to 8 mg/dL)." Cardiovascular outcome trials report "Empagliflozin and canagliflozin demonstrated reduction in MACE in CVOTs; empagliflozin also demonstrated decreased CV death and all-cause mortality" and "Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin have shown a decrease in hospitalization for HF in their CVOTs." Regulatory indications include that "the FDA has given canagliflozin an indication to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with T2D and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria" and "Dapagliflozin based on the DAPA-CKD RCT has received an FDA indication to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with CKD at risk of progression." Consequently, "individuals with T2D at significant risk for or with established ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD should be treated with a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i with proven benefit for the individual's specific conditions."

14.4 Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Adults with Diabetic Nephropathy and Albuminuria

The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation Trial (CREDENCE) was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing canagliflozin with placebo in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, an eGFR ≥ 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2and albuminuria (urine albumin/creatinine > 300 to ≤ 5,000 mg/g) who were receiving standard of care including a maximum-tolerated, labeled daily dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).

The primary objective of CREDENCE was to assess the efficacy of canagliflozin relative to placebo in reducing the composite endpoint of end stage kidney disease (ESKD), doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death.

Patients were randomized to receive canagliflozin 100 mg (N = 2,202) or placebo (N = 2,199) and treatment was continued until the initiation of dialysis or renal transplantation.

The median follow-up duration for the 4,401 randomized subjects was 137 weeks. Vital status was obtained for 99.9% of subjects.

The population was 67% White, 20% Asian, and 5% Black or African American; 32% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean age was 63 years and 66% were male.

### Renal and cardiovascular effects of sodium glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: perspectives on the canagliflozin and renal events in diabetes with established nephropathy clinical evaluation trial results [^54ebe4d1]. American Journal of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk is elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Disease management in these patients has been generally focused on glycemic control and controlling other renal and cardiac risk factors as, historically, few protective therapies have been available. The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation -(CREDENCE) trial of canagliflozin was the first study to demonstrate renal protection with a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in patients with T2DM and CKD, and these results could have important implications for clinical practice.

Summary

In CREDENCE, participants with T2DM and estimated glomerular filtration rate 30- < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio > 300–5,000 mg/g who were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker for ≥ 4 weeks prior to randomization at either the maximum labeled or tolerated dose were randomized to receive either canagliflozin 100 mg or placebo. Canagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome of doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage kidney disease, or renal or cardiovascular (CV) death compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.59–0.82; p = 0.00001). Canagliflozin also reduced the risk of secondary renal and CV outcomes. The safety profile of canagliflozin in CREDENCE was generally similar to previous studies of canagliflozin. No imbalances were observed between canagliflozin and placebo in the risk of amputation or fracture in the CREDENCE population. Key Messages: The positive renal and CV effects of canagliflozin observed in the -CREDENCE trial could have a substantial impact on improving outcomes for patients with T2DM and CKD.

1 INTRODUCTION

A large proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is characterized by glomerular hyperfiltration, microalbuminuria, structural changes and eventual decline in renal function. 1, 2 The silent nature of DKD calls for close monitoring of renal function, especially in patients with hypertension and diabetes, who have more rapid decline in renal function than those with one condition alone. 3, 4 Patients with T2D have considerable variations in the trajectories of renal function decline, with the annual rate of eGFR decline ranging from 0.7% to 14.3%. 5 Microalbuminuria and diabetic retinopathy are the strongest predictors of accelerated decline in renal function. DKD is also the most common cause of end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD). 2, 6, 7

Risk Summary

There is no information available on the presence of calcifediol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Infants potentially exposed to calcifediol through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for RAYALDEE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from RAYALDEE or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to calcifediol through breast milk for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, including seizures, vomiting, constipation and weight loss. Consider monitoring of serum calcium in the infant.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of RAYALDEE have not been established in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical studies of RAYALDEE, 63% were ≥ 65 years of age and 22% were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall differences in the safety or efficacy of RAYALDEE were observed between subjects older than 65 years and younger subjects.

8.6 Renal Impairment

No difference in efficacy was observed between patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease or those with stage 4 disease in subgroup analysis. Safety outcomes were similar in these subgroups.

Selected clinical trials of SGLT2i and SGLT1/2i, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, ertugliflozin, and sotagliflozin

The Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy (CREDENCE) trial was a seminal study of SGLT2i in DKD with a dedicated primary composite kidney outcome.CREDENCE enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes, eGFR of 30–90 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300–5000 mg/g. The prespecified enrollment strategy aimed to include at least 60% of patients with eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, a population at higher risk of ESKD than previously studied. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, canagliflozin reduced the primary composite kidney endpoint by 31%, with a noteworthy benefit in a secondary heart failure outcome. The trial was prematurely discontinued after 2.6 years due to overwhelming efficacy. CREDENCE demonstrated kidney benefits independent of baseline HbA1c, extent of HbA1c reduction, and stage of CKD, leading to the first kidney-related indication for SGLT2i by the US FDA in 2019.

There is evolving information about the use of SGLT2i among patients with eGFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and non-DKD. Dapagliflozin in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease included 4304 participants, two-thirds with diabetes, with eGFR of 25–75 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Dapagliflozin reduced the composite risk of ≥ 50% eGFR decline, ESKD, and renal or cardiovascular death by 39%. In subgroup analyses, the benefit of dapagliflozin was consistent regardless of HbA1c, eGFR, or presence of diabetes.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately 30–40% of all patients with diabetes also have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both diabetes and CKD account for an increased risk of premature mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and end-stage kidney failure. Few effective therapies are available for such patients and novel therapeutic options aimed at improving clinical outcomes in this high-risk population are therefore highly desirable.

Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are anti-diabetes drugs that block the reabsorption of glucose and sodium in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule, thereby augmenting urinary glucose and sodium excretion. Inhibition of urinary glucose reabsorption results in a reduction in plasma glucose and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Inhibition of sodium reabsorption, on the other hand, leads to increased delivery of sodium to the macula densa, which stimulates tubuloglomerular feedback and afferent arterial vasoconstriction and reduces glomerular hyperfiltration. This is clinically manifested as an acute reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria. The GFR decline is completely reversible after drug discontinuation.

Only a few clinical studies have explored the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with impaired kidney function. These studies have predominantly included patients with Stage 3 CKD [estimated GFR (eGFR) 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m 2], and have demonstrated that the glucose-lowering efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in these patients is diminished compared with patients with preserved kidney function. This attenuated hypoglycemic action is most likely a result of reduced glucose filtration. Whether SGLT2 inhibitors are effective and safe in patients with more severely impaired kidney function (i.e. Stages 3b and 4 CKD, characterized by an eGFR of 15–45 mL/min/1.73m 2) is not fully known. We therefore performed a pooled analysis of multiple phase 3 clinical trials to characterize the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes with Stages 3b and 4 CKD.

SGLT2 inhibition across different levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

The completed trials included participants with varying levels of baseline eGFR and albuminuria. In the three cardiovascular outcome trials, the proportion of participants with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ranged from 7.4 to 25.9%. In contrast, ∼60% of participants in CREDENCE had a baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Most participants in the cardiovascular outcome trials had levels of albuminuria within the normal range at baseline, whereas those in the CREDENCE trial were required to have a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio of at least 300 mg/g at enrolment. While protection against kidney failure with SGLT2 inhibitors other than canagliflozin remains to be demonstrated in the ongoing kidney outcome trials, the accumulated trial evidence has allowed for a robust assessment of the effects of SGLT2 inhibition in patients with T2DM across varying levels of eGFR and albuminuria.

The glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is directly proportional to glomerular filtration, and thus glycaemic efficacy decreases substantially as kidney function declines. Because regulatory approvals for these drugs have been primarily based on their ability to reduce glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), SGLT2 inhibitors have largely not been approved for use in people with an eGFR < 45 mL/min1.73 m 2. However, in the CREDENCE trial, the effect of canagliflozin on doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD or death due to kidney disease {hazard ratio [HR] 0.66 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–0.81]} was consistent across all levels of kidney function down to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The effect of canagliflozin on cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke [HR 0.80 (95% CI 0.67–0.95)] was also not modified by baseline kidney function. While largely powered by the effects of canagliflozin observed in the CREDENCE trial, a recent meta-analysis of the four major trials showed that SGLT2 inhibition reduces the risk of progression of kidney disease across all levels of kidney function studied to date, including ∼30% proportional risk reduction in people with an eGFR of 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, in whom the glucose-lowering effect is almost completely abrogated.

Practice Point 1.1.1 — kidney biopsy in glomerular diseases states that the kidney biopsy is the "gold standard" for the diagnostic evaluation of glomerular diseases, yet under some circumstances treatment may proceed without a kidney biopsy confirmation of diagnosis. Decision-making should balance benefit and risk, as kidney biopsies should be performed when the value of the information obtained from the biopsy exceeds the risks entailed, and patients (or parents) may place varying values on increased diagnostic and prognostic certainty versus potential biopsy complications.

### Economic evaluations of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in type 2 diabetic nephropathy: a systematic review [^ede42cdb]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately one fourth to one third of patients with diabetes mellitus develop renal manifestations. Clinical stages of diabetic nephropathy are generally categorized into stages based on the values of urinary albumin excretion: microalbuminuria (MiA) and macroalbuminuria (MaA). The prevalence of MiA and MaA in type 2 diabetes is as high as 37–40% in western countries and 57.4–59.8% in Asian countries. 20–40% of type 2 diabetic patients with MiA progress to overt nephropathy, and by 20 years after onset of overt nephropathy, about 20% will have progressed to end-stage renal diseases (ESRD). Because of the large prevalence, diabetes has become the most common single cause of ESRD in the U.S. and Europe. As therapies and interventions for coronary artery disease continue to improve, more patients with type 2 diabetes may be expected to survive long enough to develop renal failure.

In developed countries, ESRD is a major cost driver for health-care systems, with annual growth of dialysis programs ranging between 6% and 12% over the past two decades and continuing to grow, particularly in developing countries. Although there are no definitive cure solutions, there is good evidence that adequate treatment can delay or prevent the progress of diabetic nephropathy including strict control of glycaemia, early treatment of hypertension, dietary protein restriction and lipid-lowering therapy. Targeting renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is the most effective way to delay renal disease progression. Treatment guidelines therefore recommended angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as the first-choice agents for treating nephropathy in diabetic patients.

Both ACEIs and ARBs target the RAAS and have proven their renal protective effects in diabetic patients in various clinical trials. One disadvantage of ACEIs in comparison with ARBs is the higher risk of dry cough while significant differences in effectiveness between these two drug classes have not been shown convincingly although ARBs have been more thoroughly investigated in controlled settings in the recent decade providing relatively high levels of evidence. Often clinical practice guidelines recommend both ACEIs and ARBs in diabetic patients with or even without (micro)albuminuria.

### Renal physiology of glucose handling and therapeutic implications [^d421f231]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The rationale for using sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has evolved over the last decade. Due to the effects on glucosuria and body weight loss, SGLT2 inhibitors were originally approved for glycemic control in T2D. Since glucosuria is attenuated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 3–5, initial regulatory approval for SGLT2 inhibitor use was limited to patients with T2D and preserved estimated glomerular filtration rate. Over time, however, it has become increasingly apparent that these therapies have a variety of important pharmacodynamic and clinical effects beyond glycemic lowering, including antihypertensive and antialbuminuric properties, and the ability to reduce glomerular hypertension. Importantly, these sodium-related effects are preserved across CKD stages, despite attenuated glycemic effects, which are lost at CKD Stage 4. With the completion of cardiovascular (CV) outcome safety trials-EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS Program and DECLARE TIMI-58-in addition to reductions in CV events, SGLT2 inhibition consistently reduces hard renal endpoints. Importantly, these CV and renal effects are independent of glycemic control. Subsequent data from the recent CREDENCE trial-the first dedicated renal protection trial with SGLT-2 inhibition-demonstrated renal and CV benefits in albuminuric T2D patients, pivotal results that have expanded the clinical importance of these therapies. Ongoing trials will ultimately determine whether SGLT2 inhibition will have a role in renal protection in other clinical settings, including nondiabetic CKD and type 1 diabetes.

### Effects of canagliflozin in patients with baseline eGFR [^0fd8ae76]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial demonstrated that the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CKD. Little is known about the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. The participants in the CREDENCE study had type 2 diabetes mellitus, a urinary albumin-creatinine ratio > 300–5000 mg/g, and an eGFR of 30 to < 90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 at screening. This post hoc analysis evaluated participants with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 at randomization.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Effects of eGFR slope through week 130 were analyzed using a piecewise, linear, mixed-effects model. Efficacy was analyzed in the intention-to-treat population, on the basis of Cox proportional hazard models, and safety was analyzed in the on-treatment population. At randomization (an average of 29 days after screening), 174 of 4401 (4%) participants had an eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (mean [SD] eGFR, 26 [3] ml/min per 1.73 m 2).

Results

From weeks 3 to 130, there was a 66% difference in the mean rate of eGFR decline with canagliflozin versus placebo (mean slopes, -1.30 versus -3.83 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year; difference, -2.54 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90 to 4.17). Effects of canagliflozin on kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality outcomes were consistent for those with eGFR < 30 and ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (all P interaction > 0.20). The estimate for kidney failure in participants with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.27) was similar to those with eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; P interaction = 0.80). There was no imbalance in the rate of kidney-related adverse events or AKI associated with canagliflozin between participants with eGFR < 30 and ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (all P interaction > 0.12).

Conclusions

This post hoc analysis suggests canagliflozin slowed progression of kidney disease, without increasing AKI, even in participants with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2.

### Canagliflozin and kidney-related adverse events in type 2 diabetes and CKD: findings from the randomized CREDENCE trial [^a21e7cb2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Canagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney failure and related outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial. This analysis of CREDENCE trial data examines the effect of canagliflozin on the incidence of kidney-related adverse events (AEs).

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international trial.

Setting & Participants

4,401 trial participants with T2DM, CKD, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio > 300–5,000 mg/g.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin 100 mg/d or placebo.

Outcomes

Rates of kidney-related AEs were analyzed using an on-treatment approach, overall and by screening estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) strata (30- < 45, 45- < 60, and 60- < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2).

Results

Canagliflozin was associated with a reduction in the overall incidence rate of kidney-related AEs (60.2 vs 84.0 per 1,000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.61–0.82]; P < 0.001), with consistent results for serious kidney-related AEs (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.51–1.00]; P = 0.05) and acute kidney injury (AKI; HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.64–1.13]; P = 0.3). The rates of kidney-related AEs were lower with canagliflozin relative to placebo across the 3 eGFR strata (HRs of 0.73, 0.60, and 0.81 for eGFR 30- < 45, 45- < 60, and 60- < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2, respectively; P = 0.3 for interaction), with similar results for AKI (P = 0.9 for interaction). Full recovery of kidney function within 30 days after an AKI event occurred more frequently with canagliflozin versus placebo (53.1% vs 35.4%; odds ratio, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.0–4.7]; P = 0.04).

Limitations

Kidney-related AEs including AKI were investigator-reported and collected without central adjudication. Biomarkers of AKI and structural tubular damage were not measured, and creatinine data after an AKI event were not available for all participants.

Conclusions

Compared with placebo, canagliflozin was associated with a reduced incidence of serious and nonserious kidney-related AEs in patients with T2DM and CKD. These results highlight the safety of canagliflozin with regard to adverse kidney-related AEs.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in subjects with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^b1772c54]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in development for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in subjects with T2DM and stage 3 chronic kidney disease [CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 and < 50 ml/min/1.73 m 2].

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, subjects (N = 269) received canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 26. Prespecified secondary endpoints were change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and proportion of subjects reaching HbA1c < 7.0%. Safety was assessed based on adverse event (AE) reports; renal safety parameters (e.g. eGFR, blood urea nitrogen and albumin/creatinine ratio) were also evaluated.

Results

Both canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg reduced HbA1c from baseline compared with placebo at week 26 (–0.33, –0.44 and –0.03%; p < 0.05). Numerical reductions in FPG and higher proportions of subjects reaching HbA1c < 7.0% were observed with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg versus placebo (27.3, 32.6 and 17.2%). Overall AE rates were similar for canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and placebo (78.9, 74.2 and 74.4%). Slightly higher rates of urinary tract infections and AEs related to osmotic diuresis and reduced intravascular volume were observed with canagliflozin 300 mg compared with other groups. Transient changes in renal function parameters that trended towards baseline over 26 weeks were observed with canagliflozin.

Conclusion

Canagliflozin improved glycaemic control and was generally well tolerated in subjects with T2DM and Stage 3 CKD.
