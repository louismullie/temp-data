## Question

What are the approved indications for Wegovy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the approved indications for Wegovy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative source, which is the FDA prescribing information. Then, I should verify the exact wording of each indication and when it was approved. Next, I will check the key trials that support each indication and confirm the dosing and age ranges. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting summaries and ensure I capture limitations of use and any accelerated approvals that require confirmatory outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the primary source. The FDA prescribing information for Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly) is the definitive document for labeled indications, and I should anchor on that to avoid misinterpretation from secondary summaries [^8f185648].

> I will now examine the weight management indications. Wegovy is indicated to reduce excess body weight and maintain long-term weight reduction in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) and in adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²) with at least one weight-related comorbidity, in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity; it is also indicated for pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity, which I should explicitly state to avoid implying adult-only use [^8f185648] [^5a4b6c71].

> Wait, let me verify the cardiovascular risk reduction indication. The FDA label indicates Wegovy to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke) in adults with established cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight, again alongside diet and physical activity; this is supported by the SELECT trial showing a significant reduction in MACE, which I should confirm as the pivotal evidence base [^8f185648] [^ca9b6880] [^b846a861].

> Hold on, I should verify the MASH indication. Wegovy is indicated for the treatment of noncirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly NASH) with moderate to advanced fibrosis (stages F2–F3) in adults; this was granted accelerated approval based on interim histologic endpoints from the ESSENCE trial, with continued approval contingent on confirmatory outcomes, so I need to note that nuance explicitly [^8f185648] [^5624510f] [^a6278623].

> Let me consider the dosing and administration details because they are integral to safe, guideline-concordant use. The recommended maintenance dose for weight management and cardiovascular risk reduction is 2.4 mg once weekly, with an alternative 1.7 mg weekly if 2.4 mg is not tolerated; for MASH, the recommended maintenance dose is 2.4 mg weekly, with 1.7 mg as a reduced dose if needed, and all indications require dose escalation from 0.25 mg weekly to mitigate GI adverse effects, which I should confirm from the label's titration table [^4d6c1955].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought Wegovy might also be approved for type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease, but I should double-check that. Those indications belong to Ozempic (semaglutide 0.5–2.0 mg weekly) and Rybelsus (oral semaglutide), not Wegovy; Wegovy is not indicated for glycemic control in T2DM or for CKD, so I need to correct that assumption and keep the brand-formulation distinctions clear [^8f185648] [^46d08f04] [^f42981ab].

> I should confirm limitations of use and key safety warnings. Wegovy should not be coadministered with other semaglutide products or other GLP-1 receptor agonists, and it carries a boxed warning for thyroid C-cell tumors with contraindications in patients with personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2; additional warnings include acute pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, acute kidney injury, diabetic retinopathy exacerbation, and suicidal ideation, which I need to list succinctly for completeness [^8f185648] [^bb8e1ef5] [^3f2f1e85].

> Let me reconsider the overall indication summary to ensure accuracy. The FDA-approved indications for Wegovy are: 1) chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with comorbidities and in adolescents aged ≥ 12 years with obesity, 2) reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with established CVD and either obesity or overweight, and 3) treatment of noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis in adults, with the MASH indication under accelerated approval pending confirmatory outcomes; I should explicitly state that Wegovy is not approved for T2DM glycemic control or CKD, which are Ozempic indications [^8f185648] [^5624510f] [^46d08f04].

Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly) is FDA-approved for **chronic weight management** in adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² with at least one weight-related comorbidity, and in adolescents aged ≥ 12 years with BMI ≥ 95th percentile [^8f185648] [^5a4b6c71]. It is also approved to **reduce cardiovascular risk** in adults with established CVD and overweight/obesity [^8f185648] [^3f2f1e85], and to treat **noncirrhotic MASH with moderate-to-advanced fibrosis** (F2–F3) under accelerated approval pending confirmatory outcomes [^8f185648] [^5624510f] [^a6278623]. Wegovy is not approved for type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease; use Ozempic for those indications [^8f185648] [^46d08f04].

## Approved indications

### Chronic weight management

- **Adults**: BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² (obesity) or BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² (overweight) with at least one weight-related comorbidity (e.g. hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia) [^8f185648] [^9ae4a27e].
- **Adolescents**: aged ≥ 12 years with BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex [^8f185648] [^5a4b6c71].
- **Efficacy**: average ~15% weight loss in adults; ~16% reduction in BMI in adolescents over 68 weeks [^8f185648] [^8b15d6b4] [^a010c6ef].

---

### Cardiovascular risk reduction

In adults with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and either obesity or overweight, Wegovy is indicated to **reduce major adverse cardiovascular events** (MACE: CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke) [^8f185648] [^3f2f1e85]. The SELECT trial showed a **20% relative risk reduction** in MACE versus placebo [^notfound].

---

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)

Wegovy is indicated for **noncirrhotic MASH with moderate-to-advanced fibrosis** (F2–F3) under accelerated approval based on histologic improvement; confirmatory outcomes are pending [^8f185648] [^5624510f] [^a6278623]. In the ESSENCE trial, 63% achieved MASH resolution without worsening fibrosis and 37% had fibrosis improvement without worsening MASH at 72 weeks [^5624510f] [^a6278623].

---

## Limitations of use

Wegovy is **not approved** for type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease; use Ozempic for those indications [^8f185648] [^46d08f04]. It is also **contraindicated** in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2, and in those with hypersensitivity to semaglutide or excipients [^bb8e1ef5] [^7453baf8].

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

WEGOVY is indicated in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity:

to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) in adults with established CV disease and either obesity or overweight.
to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in:
Adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity
Adults with overweight in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition.
for the treatment of noncirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis) in adults.
The indication for MASH is approved under accelerated approval based on improvement of MASH and fibrosis [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon the verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

Limitations of Use

WEGOVY contains semaglutide. Coadministration with other semaglutide-containing products or with any other GLP-1 receptor agonist is not recommended.

### Semaglutide therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis: November 2025 updates to AASLD practice guidance [^a6278623]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

This practice recommendation serves as an update to the 2023 AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now known as Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) (3) and provides implementable guidance on patient selection for treatment, consideration of comorbidities, and monitoring of treatment safety and efficacy of semaglutide. FDA-indication and Practice Recommendation: The Wegovy® formulation, whose main ingredient is semaglutide, received accelerated FDA approval in August 2025 for treating MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis (consistent with stages F2-F3 fibrosis), based on interim results of the phase 3 ESSENCE trial where 72 weeks of 2.4 mg/week subcutaneous injection resulted in achievement of both primary histologic endpoints: 1) resolution of MASH without worsening of fibrosis (62.9% vs 34.3% placebo, p < 0.001) and 2) ≥ 1 stage reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of MASH (36.8% vs 22.4% placebo, p < 0.001); final approval awaits long-term outcomes. Patient Selection: Candidates should have MASH with stage 2–3 fibrosis, identified using noninvasive tests (NITs) such as VCTE (8–15 kPa), MRE (3.1–4.4 kPa), or ELF (9.2–10.5), rather than liver biopsy, which is impractical and unnecessary for most patients. In those with VCTE (15–20 kPa), MRE (4.4–5 kPa), or ELF (10.5–11.3), an individualized decision to treat should be based on exclusion of cirrhosis with another confirmatory NIT, or cross-sectional imaging excluding nodular-appearing liver contour and signs of portal hypertension, or a platelet count of < 150,000/mm 3. While semaglutide is not approved to treat patients with MASH cirrhosis (VCTE > 20 kPa, MRE > 5.0 kPa, ELF > 11.3 and/or evidence of portal hypertension), those with compensated cirrhosis who are receiving semaglutide for another FDA-approved indication should be monitored carefully. Monitoring and Safety: Semaglutide showed a favorable hepatic safety profile in the ESSENCE trial, with no discontinuations due to liver enzyme elevations. Routine hepatic panels are recommended only as clinically indicated. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting), generally mild and transient; patient education and dose titration help improve tolerance. Clinicians should monitor for rare but serious risks, including acute kidney injury (from dehydration), symptomatic gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, thyroid C-cell tumors, retinopathy progression, and lean mass loss. Treatment Response and Concomitant Therapy: Lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of MASLD/MASH management alongside semaglutide. Combination use with resmetirom at the dose of 2.4 mg/week has not been studied. While no NITs reliably predict histologic response at the individual patient level, reductions from baseline to 72 weeks of treatment suggest significant improvement in MASH resolution (ALT > 17 U/L or ≥ 20%; CAP ≥ 30%) and fibrosis improvement (VCTE LSM ≥ 30%; MRE LSM ≥ 20%; ELF ≥ 0.5). Non-response may be suspected if ALT or NITs worsen. Benefit is uncertain if sub-optimal response and may require an individualized approach and further follow-up.

### Semaglutide (Wegovy) [^c8aaffd0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions were consistent with the other approved WEGOVY indications (see Table 2). There is limited information in patients with MASH and a BMI < 25 kg/m2. Additional information from the MASH trial is included in subsequent sections when notable. Unless indicated, the incidence of the adverse reactions in MASH patients was similar to other approved indications.

Other Adverse Reactions in Adults and/or Pediatric Patients

Acute Pancreatitis

In WEGOVY clinical trials in adults for weight reduction, acute pancreatitis was confirmed by adjudication in 4 WEGOVY-treated patients (0.2 cases per 100 patient years) and 1 in placebo-treated patients (less than 0.1 cases per 100 patient years). One additional case of acute pancreatitis was confirmed in a patient treated with WEGOVY in another clinical trial.

Acute Gallbladder Disease

In WEGOVY clinical trials in adults for weight reduction, cholelithiasis was reported by 1.6% of WEGOVY-treated patients and 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. Cholecystitis was reported by 0.6% of WEGOVY-treated adult patients and 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. In a clinical trial in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older for weight reduction [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], cholelithiasis was reported by 3.8% of WEGOVY-treated patients and 0% placebo-treated patients. Cholecystitis was reported by 0.8% of WEGOVY-treated pediatric patients and 0% placebo-treated patients.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use).

Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors

Inform patients that semaglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents and that the human relevance of this finding has not been determined. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea) to their physician [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Acute Pancreatitis

Inform patients of the potential risk for acute pancreatitis and its symptoms: severe abdominal pain that sometimes radiates to the back, and which may or may not be accompanied by nausea or vomiting. Instruct patients to discontinue WEGOVY promptly and contact their physician if pancreatitis is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Acute Gallbladder Disease

Inform patients of the risk of acute gallbladder disease. Advise patients that substantial or rapid weight loss can increase the risk of gallbladder disease, but that gallbladder disease may also occur in the absence of substantial or rapid weight loss. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider for appropriate clinical follow-up if gallbladder disease is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

2.4 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose

If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is more than 2 days away (48 hours), administer WEGOVY as soon as possible. If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days away (48 hours), do not administer the dose. Resume dosing on the regularly scheduled day of the week.
If 2 or more consecutive doses are missed, resume dosing as scheduled or, if needed, reinitiate WEGOVY and follow the dose escalation schedule, which may reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the WEGOVY clinical trials for weight reduction and long-term maintenance, 233 (9%) WEGOVY-treated patients were aged 65 to 75 years and 23 (1%) WEGOVY-treated patients were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In a CV outcomes trial, 2,656 (30%) WEGOVY-treated patients were aged 65 to 75 years and 703 (8%) WEGOVY-treated patients were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between patients aged 65 years and older and younger adult patients. In the CV outcomes trial, patients aged 75 years and older reported more fractures of the hip and pelvis on WEGOVY than on placebo. Patients aged 75 years and older (WEGOVY-treated and placebo-treated) reported more serious adverse reactions overall compared to younger adult patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the clinical trial in patients with MASH, of the 534 patients randomized to WEGOVY, 138 (26%) were aged 65 years and older and 13 (2%) were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of WEGOVY have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The recommended dosage of WEGOVY in patients with renal impairment is the same as those with normal renal function. In a study in patients with renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The recommended dosage of WEGOVY in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as those with normal hepatic function. In a study in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of WEGOVY in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity have been established. Use of WEGOVY for this indication is supported by a 68-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 201 pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with a BMI corresponding to ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] and from trials in adult patients with obesity [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Use of the 1.7 mg once weekly maintenance dosage of WEGOVY in pediatric patients is also supported by additional exposure-efficacy and safety analyses in pooled adult and pediatric patients.

Adverse reactions with WEGOVY treatment in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older were generally similar to those reported in adults. Pediatric patients aged 12 years and older treated with WEGOVY had greater incidences of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, hypotension, rash, and urticaria compared to adults treated with WEGOVY [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

There are insufficient data in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes treated with WEGOVY for obesity to determine if there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia with WEGOVY treatment similar to that reported in adults. Inform patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with type 2 diabetes, monitor blood glucose prior to starting WEGOVY and during WEGOVY treatment. When initiating WEGOVY in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with type 2 diabetes, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

The safety and effectiveness of WEGOVY have not been established in pediatric patients:

To reduce the risk of major adverse CV events. Clinical trials for this indication are highly impracticable because of the low prevalence of the condition in pediatric patients.
To reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in those less than 12 years of age.
For the treatment of noncirrhotic MASH.

### Semaglutide (Wegovy) [^305c27e8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 5 was a 68-week trial that enrolled 902 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI 27 to 29.9 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Mean body weight at baseline for the 902 patients was 106.8 kg and mean BMI was 38.3 kg/m². All patients received WEGOVY during the run-in period of 20 weeks that included 16 weeks of dose escalation. Trial product was permanently discontinued before randomization in 99 of 902 patients (11%); the most common reason was adverse reactions (n = 48, 5.3%); 803 patients reached WEGOVY 2.4 mg and were then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either continue on WEGOVY or receive placebo. Among the 803 randomized patients, the mean age was 46 years, 79% were female, 84% were White, 13% were Black or African American, and 2% Asian. A total of 8% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Mean body weight at randomization (week 20) was 96.1 kg and mean BMI at randomization (week 20) was 34.4 kg/m2.

2.1 Important Monitoring and Administration Instructions

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, monitor blood glucose prior to starting WEGOVY and during WEGOVY treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Prior to initiation of WEGOVY, train patients on proper injection technique. Refer to the accompanying Instructions for Use for complete administration instructions with illustrations.
Inspect WEGOVY visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles.
Administer WEGOVY in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.
Administer WEGOVY once weekly, on the same day each week, at any time of day, with or without meals.
Inject WEGOVY subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. The time of day and the injection site can be changed without dose adjustment.

2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiation and Escalation Schedule

Initiate WEGOVY with a dosage of 0.25 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly. Follow the recommended dosage initiation and escalation in Table 1 for all indications to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
If patients do not tolerate a dose during dosage escalation, consider delaying dosage escalation for 4 weeks.

Table 1. Recommended Dosage Initiation and Escalation

2.3 Recommended Maintenance Dosage

Cardiovascular Risk Reduction and Weight Reduction

The maintenance dosage of WEGOVY for CV risk reduction and weight reduction is either 2.4 mg (recommended) or 1.7 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly.
Consider treatment response and tolerability when selecting the maintenance dosage [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)].

Noncirrhotic MASH with Moderate to Advanced Liver Fibrosis

The recommended maintenance dosage of WEGOVY for the treatment of noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis is 2.4 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly.
If patients do not tolerate the maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg once weekly, the dosage can be decreased to 1.7 mg once weekly. Consider reescalation to 2.4 mg once weekly [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.4)].

### Prescription fills for semaglutide products by payment method [^bd5decb6]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The number of prescriptions filled for semaglutide has increased substantially, reaching 2.6 million prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies by December 2023. While Ozempic persistently accounted for most semaglutide fills, increases were considerably greater for Wegovy since its approval for weight loss in June 2021. These increases, which primarily occurred following increased awareness of weight-loss benefits in late 2022, are likely contributing to the FDA-reported shortage of Ozempic and Wegovy first issued in March 2022. Despite the disproportionate burden of obesity in Medicaid and Medicare Part D populations, and recent increases in public spending on weight-loss medications, most Wegovy fills were for the commercially insured. Limitations of this study include a lack of data on individual-level variables (age, race, and ethnicity) and indications for use (diabetes or obesity). Future research should examine how changes in Medicare Part D and Medicaid coverage restrictions influence disparities in access to these essential medications.

### Semaglutide in the spotlight: weighing benefits against rising concerns [^e53e1f29]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear editor,

The recent surge in popularity of the antidiabetic drug, Semaglutide, marketed under the names Wegovy (which has the highest concentration of the active drug), Rybelsus, and Ozempic, for its notable efficacy in weight loss has raised pertinent considerations. Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) that is administered once weekly. It is effective in reducing hemoglobin A1C levels and promoting weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Further studies demonstrated significant weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors with evidence showing good toleration, although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common.

While it is commendable to find a drug that offers promising results beyond its primary intended purpose, the skyrocketing demand in developed nations necessitates vigilance.

First and foremost, there is potential for off-label abuse. With societal pressure to attain perceived ideal body weights, it is conceivable that individuals may seek this medication outside of its primary indication, potentially exposing themselves to unforeseen risks. Long-term side effects, especially when taken by non-diabetics, are not yet well documented and require continued monitoring.

Furthermore, the surge in demand can invariably drive up costs. This inflation could inadvertently limit access for diabetic patients who genuinely require Semaglutide for glycemic control. Price escalation also means increased out-of-pocket expenses, further burdening the healthcare systems of many developed countries and by extension, stifling the likelihood of patronage and usage in low- and middle-income countries.

It is imperative that endocrinologists and by extension other medical professionals, policymakers, strategic stakeholders, and regulatory bodies remain vigilant. Best still, it is most convenient to note that Semaglutide is a prescription medication and should be used under the guidance of a physician. It is not intended for recreational or non-medical use. Ongoing research, public awareness campaigns about potential risks, a vetting system for usage, and a structured pricing mechanism are vital to ensuring that Semaglutide remains both accessible and safe.

14.2 Weight Reduction and Long-term Maintenance Studies in Adults with Obesity or Overweight

Overview of Clinical Studies in Adults The safety and efficacy of WEGOVY for weight reduction and long-term maintenance of body weight in conjunction with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity were studied in three 68-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; one 68-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo withdrawal trial; and one 68-week, randomized, double-blind trial that investigated 2 different doses of WEGOVY versus placebo. In Studies 2 (NCT#03548935), 3 (NCT#03552757), and 4 (NCT#03611582), WEGOVY or matching placebo was escalated to 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly during a 16-week period followed by 52 weeks on maintenance dose. In Study 5 (NCT#03548987), WEGOVY was escalated during a 20-week run-in period, and patients who reached a WEGOVY 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly dosage after the run-in period were randomized to either continued treatment with WEGOVY or placebo for 48 weeks. In Study 6 (NCT#03811574), WEGOVY was escalated to 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly dosages or placebo over 12 to 16 weeks followed by 52 weeks on either maintenance dose.

✱ p < 0.0001 (unadjusted 2-sided) for superiority.

For Study 5, the primary efficacy parameter was mean percent change in body weight from randomization (week 20) to week 68.

From randomization (week 20) to week 68, treatment with WEGOVY resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo (Table 7). Because patients who discontinued WEGOVY during titration and those who did not reach the 2.4 mg weekly dose were not eligible for the randomized treatment period, the results may not reflect the experience of patients in the general population who are first starting WEGOVY.

Results

The proportions of patients who discontinued study drug were 10% for the WEGOVY-treated group and 10% for the placebo-treated group.

The primary endpoint was percent change in BMI from baseline to week 68. After 68 weeks, treatment with WEGOVY resulted in a statistically significant reduction in percent BMI compared with placebo. Greater proportions of patients treated with WEGOVY achieved ≥ 5% reduction in baseline BMI than those treated with placebo as shown in Table 12.

14.1 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Adult Patients with Cardiovascular Disease and Either Obesity or Overweight

Overview of Clinical Trial Study 1 (NCT03574597) was a multi-national, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine the effect of WEGOVY relative to placebo on major adverse CV events (MACE) when added to current standard of care, which included management of CV risk factors and individualized healthy lifestyle counseling (including diet and physical activity). The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.

All patients were 45 years or older, with an initial BMI of 27 kg/m2or greater and established CV disease (prior myocardial infarction, prior stroke, or peripheral arterial disease). Patients with a history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes were excluded. Concomitant CV therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of the investigator, to ensure participants were treated according to the current standard of care for patients with established CV disease.

In this trial, 17,604 patients were randomized to WEGOVY or placebo. At baseline, the mean age was 62 years (range 45–93), 72% were male, 84% were White, 4% were Black or African American, and 8% were Asian, and 10% were Hispanic or Latino. Mean baseline body weight was 97 kg and mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. At baseline, prior myocardial infarction was reported in 76% of randomized individuals, prior stroke in 23%, and peripheral arterial disease in 9%. Heart failure was reported in 24% of patients. At baseline, CV disease and risk factors were managed with lipid-lowering therapy (90%), platelet aggregation inhibitors (86%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (74%), and beta blockers (70%). A total of 10% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m2) and 0.4% had severe renal impairment eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of obesity [^2c4f1661]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for chronic weight management. This paper reviews data on the mechanism of action, weight-loss and cardiometabolic efficacy, and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg/week for obesity. Semaglutide has demonstrated the largest weight loss of any obesity medication to date with reductions of approximately 15% of initial weight at 68 weeks, accompanied by improvements in cardiovascular risks factors and physical functioning. The approval of this medication provides patients with greater options for weight management.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^cf3b1811]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outside randomized clinical trial settings, data on weight loss with semaglutide or liraglutide for obesity are generally limited to 6 months of follow-up, based on brand names approved by the FDA for T2D only, or cohorts that exclude patients who did not persist with the treatment. Furthermore, emerging data suggest that persistent coverage with GLP-1 RAs (ie, a cumulative gap of less than 90 days), is difficult to achieve, but little is known about how persistence affects weight loss. Such understanding could inform the need and scope of future research, as well as clinical and policy interventions aimed at addressing the barriers to the use of these medications. We examined weight outcomes at 1 year in patients with obesity who received injectable forms of liraglutide or semaglutide and compared outcomes by GLP-1 RA agent, indication, dosage, and persistent coverage with the medication.

### Semaglutide (Wegovy) [^ebaf7c1a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Studies 2, 3, and 5, all patients received instruction for a reduced calorie diet (approximately 500 kcal/day deficit) and increased physical activity counseling (recommended to a minimum of 150 min/week) that began with the first dose of study medication or placebo and continued throughout the trial. In Study 4, patients received an initial 8-week low-calorie diet (total energy intake 1,000 to 1,200 kcal/day) followed by 60 weeks of a reduced calorie diet (1,200–1,800 kcal/day) and increased physical activity (100 mins/week with gradual increase to 200 mins/week).

Study 2 was a 68-week trial that enrolled 1,961 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI 27 to 29.9 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition, such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either WEGOVY or placebo. At baseline, mean age was 46 years (range 18 to 86), 74% were female, 75% were White, 13% were Asian and 6% were Black or African American. A total of 12% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

### Factors associated with semaglutide initiation among adults with obesity [^e5443d5f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Demand for novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist medications like semaglutide (eg, Wegovy or Ozempic) and tirzepatide (eg, Zepbound or Mounjaro) has quickly escalated. Approximately 6% of the US population reports currently taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist, but the proportion among individuals who report being told by a physician that they have overweight or obesity is closer to 1 in 5. In the US, 73.6% of the population has overweight or obesity. Historically, GLP-1 receptor agonists were exclusively approved to treat type 2 diabetes, but recent clinical trials concluded that they are highly effective at weight management and cardiovascular disease prevention, leading to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for these indications.

Individuals with obesity but without diabetes represent a unique population in the context of metabolic health. This subgroup, while sometimes characterized as metabolically healthy due to the lack of prevalent disease, is at elevated risk of developing diabetes and other cardiometabolic conditions compared with individuals without obesity. They may be undertreated due to clinician and patient perceptions of risk and are often left behind in the metabolic care paradigm that focuses on obesity as a risk factor, not a disease. Individuals with concurrent dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia are more likely to receive lifestyle counseling compared with those with obesity alone. This treatment paradigm appears to persist despite the approval of the novel GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity, with only 25% of patients obtaining payer coverage for new Wegovy prescriptions, which is indicated for weight management, compared with nearly triple the success rate for Ozempic, which is indicated for diabetes.

### Increased vision impairment reports linked to semaglutide: analysis of FDA adverse event data [^b5287e35]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, the analysis for Wegovy showed less pronounced effects compared to other GLP-1 RAs. This discrepancy could potentially be attributed to the limited number of adverse event reports available at the time of this study, as it is a relatively newer medication, approved by the FDA in June 2021. This consistency across analyses strengthens our findings while highlighting areas for future research.

In our primary analysis, we focused on general visual impairment terms rather than specific retinopathy terminology, although we cannot exclude the possibility that some reported visual impairment cases might represent inaccurately coded retinopathy cases. To explore this further, we conducted a supplementary analysis to specifically examine retinopathy cases (defined as all cases with at least one of the following terms mentioned in the reactions list: "Diabetic Retinopathy", "Retinopathy", "Retinopathy Haemorrhagic", "Retinopathy Hypertensive", "Retinopathy Proliferative") (Additional file 1: Table S4). This supplementary analysis yielded similar patterns. Specifically, semaglutide demonstrated a higher risk of retinopathy compared to other included medications, although several drugs were excluded from this analysis due to insufficient report numbers (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). These findings suggest consistency in the safety signal across both general visual impairment and specific retinopathy terms.

As diabetes is frequently associated with diabetic retinopathy, this comorbidity represents a potential confounder in our analysis. While we could not directly assess this relationship due to incomplete comorbidity data in the database, we did compute the reporting odds ratio for visual impairment under semaglutide for reports where type 2 diabetes is listed under indications (388 with visual impairment, 9′055 in the comparator group) vs. reports where type 2 diabetes is not listed (29 with visual impairment, 2′086 in the comparator group). The rOR is 3.08 (95%CI 2.10–4.68), indeed indicating more frequent reporting of visual impairment in patients with T2D. For the "other GLP-1 receptor agonists" group (GLP-1 receptor agonists without semaglutide, Additional file 1: Table S2), the corresponding rOR is 1.88 (95%CI 1.33–2.74), i.e. we observe the same effect, but it is less pronounced, pointing towards an effect of semaglutide itself. Indeed, the rOR for visual impairment in patients with T2D under semaglutide vs. other GLP-1 receptor agonists is 2.20 (95%CI 1.97–2.46).

### The ethics of ozempic and wegovy [^71dec911]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, sold under the brand names of Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy, is one of the most popular drugs on the market. Manufactured by Novo Nordisk, semaglutide is the newest in a family of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists used most commonly to treat type II diabetes. To date, the results of semaglutide for the treatment of type II diabetes have been overwhelmingly positive. It is for the drug's effects on appetite suppression and weight loss, however, that have led its surge in popularity, with many hailing semaglutide as the new 'miracle drug for weight loss'. Despite its popularity, both the governmental and popular reception to the drug has largely been mixed. In this paper, we address a range of ethical concerns and argue that while many are legitimate, they do not provide conclusive reason not to prescribe semaglutide for weight loss.

12.6 Immunogenicity

The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of semaglutide or of other semaglutide products.

During the 68-week treatment periods in Studies 2 and 3 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], 50/1709 (3%) of WEGOVY-treated patients developed anti-semaglutide antibodies. Of these 50 WEGOVY-treated patients, 28 patients (2% of the total WEGOVY-treated study population) developed antibodies that cross-reacted with native GLP-1. In the patients with MASH treated with WEGOVY for 72 weeks in Study 8 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)], 3/763 (0.4%) of patients developed anti-semaglutide antibodies which were also cross-reactive to native GLP-1. No identified clinically significant effect of anti-semaglutide antibodies on pharmacokinetics for WEGOVY was observed. There is insufficient evidence to characterize the effects of anti-semaglutide antibodies on pharmacodynamics, safety, or effectiveness of semaglutide products.

### FDA approves first treatment to reduce risk of serious heart… [^3f2f1e85]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new indication for use for Wegovy injection to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in adults with cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight. Wegovy should be used in addition to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. Cardiovascular disease is a group of diseases of the heart and blood vessels. "Wegovy is now the first weight loss medication to also be approved to help prevent life-threatening cardiovascular events in adults with cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight, " said John Sharretts, M. D., director of the Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "This patient population has a higher risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke.

Providing a treatment option that is proven to lower this cardiovascular risk is a major advance for public health". Obesity or overweight affect approximately 70% of American adults. Obesity and overweight are serious health issues that increase the risk for premature death and a variety of health problems, including heart attack and stroke. Wegovy contains semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. Therefore, Wegovy should not be used in combination with other semaglutide-containing products or other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Wegovy's efficacy and safety for this new indication were studied in a multi-national, multi-center, placebo-controlled double-blind trial that randomly assigned over 17, 600 participants to receive either Wegovy or placebo. Participants in both groups also received standard-of-care medical treatment and healthy lifestyle counseling.

Wegovy significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, which occurred in 6. 5% of participants who received Wegovy compared to 8% of participants who received placebo. The prescribing information for Wegovy contains a boxed warning to inform health care professionals and patients about the risk of thyroid C-cell tumors. Because of this risk, Wegovy should not be used in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or in patients with a rare condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2. Wegovy should not be used in patients with a history of a severe allergic reaction to semaglutide or to any of the other ingredients. Patients should stop Wegovy immediately and seek medical help if a severe allergic reaction is suspected.

Wegovy also contains warnings for inflammation of the pancreas, gallbladder problems, low blood sugar, acute kidney injury, hypersensitivity reactions, diabetic retinopathy, increased heart rate and suicidal behavior or thinking. Patients should discuss with their health care provider if they have symptoms of pancreatitis or gallstones. If Wegovy is used with insulin or with a medication that causes insulin secretion, patients should speak to their health care provider about the risk of low blood sugar. Healthcare professionals should monitor patients for kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy and depression or suicidal behaviors or thoughts.

### Cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in chronic weight management in Portugal [^36dd046f]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide (Wegovy®) 2.4 mg injection is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), that promotes weight loss via slowing down gastric emptying and thereby reducing hunger and increasing satiety. Approximately 5,000 patients enrolled in five phase 3 trials– the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program. In STEP 1 trial, patients who received semaglutide 2.4 mg had clinically significant weight loss (at least a 5% reduction in weight from baseline level) compared with placebo (weight reduction: 14.9% vs. 2.4% at week 68; P < 0.001), and superior weight loss at 68 weeks when compared with placebo in STEP 2 trial for weight management in patients with overweight or obesity and T2D.

This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg in combination with D&E compared to D&E alone for the treatment of adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) with one or more weight-related comorbidities, from the perspective of the Portuguese National Health Service (NHS).

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist that selectively binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for native GLP-1.

GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and caloric intake, and the GLP-1 receptor is present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation. Animal studies show that semaglutide distributed to and activated neurons in brain regions involved in regulation of food intake.

The exact mechanism of CV risk reduction has not been established.

For treatment of MASH in humans, the precise mechanism of action of semaglutide is not fully understood and may involve multiple pathways mediated by weight loss and other factors. In a mouse model of diet-induced MASH, treatment with semaglutide resulted in histological improvements in steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in liver compared to baseline, which was associated with body weight loss, intermittent periods of reduced food intake, and improvements in relevant biomarkers. The relationship between the pathophysiology of MASH in animal models and humans has not been fully established.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Semaglutide lowers body weight with greater fat mass loss than lean mass loss. Semaglutide decreases calorie intake. The effects are likely mediated by affecting appetite.

Semaglutide stimulates insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. These effects can lead to a reduction of blood glucose.

Gastric Emptying

Semaglutide delays gastric emptying.

Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc)

The effect of semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial. Semaglutide did not prolong QTc intervals at doses up to 1.5 mg at steady state.

Noninvasive Liver Disease Markers

Semaglutide decreases liver fat content measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF), liver stiffness assessed by transient elastography (TE), Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score, and the levels of the pro-peptide of type III collagen biomarker (Pro-C3). The clinical relevance of these changes is yet to be confirmed.

In rodents, semaglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether WEGOVY causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].
WEGOVY is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2) [see Contraindications (4)]. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of WEGOVY and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with WEGOVY [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Introduction

Semaglutide was first approved under the brand name Ozempic (Novo Nordisk) as a weekly injection by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 and is a first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. Alongside evidence of semaglutide's cardiovascular and weight loss benefits, the FDA approved Rybelsus (Novo Nordisk), an oral formulation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, in 2019, and Wegovy (Novo Nordisk), another injectable formulation for obesity, in June 2021. Increased awareness of semaglutide's weight loss benefits has fueled demand, including for off-label use, contributing to shortages for Ozempic and Wegovy since March 2022. Semaglutide's limited supply and insurance coverage, including coverage prohibitions for weight loss drugs in Medicare Part D and coverage restrictions (prior authorization, nonpreferred status, or step therapy) in many state Medicaid plans, may contribute to barriers and disparities in accessing semaglutide due to its high out-of-pocket costs. In this cross-sectional study, we analyze trends in prescriptions dispensed at retail pharmacies for semaglutide between January 2021 and December 2023.

✱ p < 0.001 (unadjusted 2-sided) for superiority, controlled for multiplicity.

For Study 6, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight and the percentage of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% weight loss from baseline to week 68.

After 68 weeks, treatment with WEGOVY 1.7 mg and 2.4 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo. Greater proportions of patients treated with WEGOVY achieved 5%, 10%, and 15% weight loss than those treated with placebo as shown in Table 8.

Results

In total, 96.9% of patients completed the trial, and vital status was available for 99.4% of patients. The median follow-up duration was 41.8 months. A total of 31% of WEGOVY-treated patients and 27% of placebo-treated patients permanently discontinued study drug.

For the primary analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for superiority. Type 1 error was controlled across multiple tests.

WEGOVY significantly reduced the risk for first occurrence of MACE. The estimated hazard ratio (95% CI) was 0.8 (0.72, 0.9) (see Figure 4 and Table 4).

### Semaglutide: a new drug for the treatment of obesity [^d8c3003c]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide (▼Ozempic solution for injection, ▼Rybelsus tablets-Novo Nordisk) was initially granted market authorisation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and exercise. In 2021 and 2022, regulatory agencies in the USA and Europe licensed semaglutide (▼Wegovy solution for injection-Novo Nordisk) for the treatment of individuals who are obese, or overweight and who have at least one weight-related comorbidity. Manufacturer-sponsored randomised controlled trials have shown a loss of almost 12% of body weight over a 68-week period, however, once the medication is stopped people regain most of their pretreatment weight. Gastrointestinal adverse events occur commonly with semaglutide, and pancreatitis, diabetic retinopathy and severe allergic reactions have also been reported. Extensive hype in social and general media has resulted in increased demand for semaglutide leading to supply problems across the various licensed products including those used for treatment of diabetes. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has recommended semaglutide as an option for weight management for a maximum treatment duration of 2 years. Further studies are underway to assess the effect of semaglutide on longer-term health benefits.

Introduction

The popularity of branded semaglutide is surging, with widespread media coverage, viral social media exposure, and celebrity endorsements. Although Wegovy (Novo Nordisk) is approved for long-term weight management, Ozempic (Novo Nordisk) (only approved for type 2 diabetes) is often used off-label for this purpose. Global regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency, and World Health Organization (WHO), have warned about fake versions driven by patient demand, high cost, and shortages. Illegal online pharmacies, which operate without valid licenses and sell medicines like semaglutide without prescription, represent a consumer risk for ineffective and dangerous products.

Overdoses have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Effects have included severe nausea, severe vomiting, and severe hypoglycemia. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient's clinical signs and symptoms. In the event of an overdose of WEGOVY, consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations. A prolonged period of observation and treatment for these symptoms may be necessary, taking into account the long half-life of WEGOVY of approximately 1 week.

### Increased vision impairment reports linked to semaglutide: analysis of FDA adverse event data [^391ea79f]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current analysis with the FAERS database provides several important insights into the potential association of semaglutide use with vision impairment. While the recent JAMA Ophthalmology report by Hathaway et al. on NAION and semaglutide was a motivating factor for our study, our analysis focused on broader vision-related adverse events due to limitations in specific NAION reporting in the FAERS database. The findings presented herein support and further extend the observations by Hathaway et al. strengthening the signal of a possible link between semaglutide and ocular complications. This also holds when semaglutide is compared to individual GLP-1 receptor agonists (Fig. 2). However, further research is necessary to establish causality and elucidate underlying mechanisms.

Notably, our findings regarding visual impairment associated with semaglutide contrast with the adverse event profiles reported in the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials for various semaglutide formulations. The SUSTAIN-6 trial reports a higher risk of diabetic retinopathy complications in patients receiving semaglutide, and while this finding was followed up in the review of the SUSTAIN 1–7 trials, the higher rate of diabetic retinopathy complications was attributed to a greater proportion of patients who had diabetic retinopathy at baseline. However, an analysis of cases without T2D as indication also reveals a trend for a higher rOR of vision impairment under semaglutide compared to orlistat and other GLP-1 receptor agonists (Additional file 1: Fig. S4, other medications excluded due to insufficient number of cases). Similarly, the PIONEER study for Rybelsus primarily highlighted nausea and diarrhea as the most frequent adverse events, without any reference to visual system complications. Furthermore, the STEP trials for Wegovy also failed to report any significant ocular adverse events. The observed differences in visual adverse event patterns between Ozempic and Wegovy (both semaglutide) highlight the role of healthcare context in pharmacovigilance signals. T2D patients often undergo more structured ophthalmological monitoring, which may lead to different reporting patterns compared to patients prescribed semaglutide for obesity, despite overlapping metabolic profiles in both populations. However, this discrepancy between our post-marketing findings and the phase 3 trial results underscores the importance of ongoing pharmacovigilance and real-world evidence studies in identifying rare but potentially serious adverse effects that may not be captured in pre-approval clinical trials.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists beyond diabetes management [^95f3c60b]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The first glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA], exenatide, was approved by US Food and Drug Administration in 2005, and was initially indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Exenatide is a synthetic version of exendin-4, a hormone found in the saliva of a lizard native to North America that can survive extended periods without food. Exendin-4 can mimic the action of GLP-1, an incretin regulating glucose homeostasis. GLP-1 acts on pancreatic β cells to enhance insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying, and promotes satiety, ultimately reducing appetite and decreasing energy.

Since 2005, the landscape of available GLP-1 RAs has greatly expanded alongside the number of their therapeutic indications. Beyond exenatide, the class now includes liraglutide, dulaglutide, lixisenatide, tirzepatide, and semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic or Wegovy). Both liraglutide and dulaglutide have shown cardiovascular risk reduction in landmark trials (LEADER and REWIND, respectively), underscoring their dual benefits for glucose homeostasis and cardiovascular health. Semaglutide is highly effective for weight loss and has cardiovascular benefits as evidenced in SUSTAIN. Most recently, tizepatide, a dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist, has shown superior glycaemic control compared with the available single agonist, setting a new standard for diabetes and weight management.

Persons on Once-Weekly GLP1RA

People who switch from once-weekly exenatide, dulaglutide, or semaglutide should start oral semaglutide 7 days after their last injection. Similar principles, as detailed above, apply to the choice of dose of initiation. A prescription of oral semaglutide that is started in response to lack of tolerability should begin with 3 mg daily. However, if oral semaglutide is chosen owing to lack of efficacy of current therapy, one may commence with 7 mg/day.

Once-weekly semaglutide has been compared with oral semaglutide, i.e. 0.5 mg once-weekly semaglutide with 7 mg of oral semaglutide. However, the difference in the impact on weight should be explained to the patient.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^657df84c]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0·05 mg, 0·1 mg, 0·2 mg, 0·3 mg, or 0·4 mg; initiated at 0·05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3·0 mg; initiated at 0·6 mg per day and escalated by 0·6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111·5 kg, and BMI 39·3 kg/m 2. Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2·3% for the placebo group versus -6·0% (0·05 mg), -8·6% (0·1 mg), -11·6% (0·2 mg), -11·2% (0·3 mg), and -13·8% (0·4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0·0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0·0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0·2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13·8% to -11·2% vs -7·8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0·1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0·0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist cases reported to United States poison centers, 2017–2022 [^2bc34ba1]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are a class of medications commonly used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus and, more recently, obesity. Although only three GLP-1RAs — Saxenda (liraglutide), Wegovy (semaglutide), and Zepbound (tirzepatide, which is also a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist) — are approved in the United States (US) for chronic weight management in adults by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the medication class has become a popular off-label option for weight loss. Provider awareness combined with intense public interest has precipitated high levels of prescribing and subsequent drug shortages. Evidence that the use of GLP-1RAs improves outcome for heart failure and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis has been published, which could further increase off-label usage. Globally valued at $22.4 billion in 2022, the market size of GLP-1RA medications is expected to demonstrate an annual growth rate of approximately 9.6% through 2032.

GLP-1RAs demonstrate substantial homology with endogenous GLP-1 but have been structurally modified to resist rapid degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4. These modifications vary slightly among drugs in this class, but generally result in enhanced binding to albumin, which slows renal elimination of the drug. Thus, GLP-1RAs are slowly degraded, have relatively long half-lives, and can exert an array of potent effects, including increased satiety, enhanced insulin secretion, and suppression of glucagon. Although these physiologic effects are leveraged for glucose control, beta-cell rehabilitation, and weight loss, adverse effects can also occur. Gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation, are consistently described in clinical trials, systematic reviews, and case reports. GLP-1RA use has also been associated with cases of pancreatitis, biliary disease, gastroparesis, bowel obstruction, and hypersensitivity reactions.

Most of the adverse effects related to GLP-1RAs are described in clinical trial settings. With the increased prescribing of this medication class for both on- and off-label indications, continued population-level studies on adverse effects related to these medications are critical. US poison center (PC) data provide a unique opportunity to complement post-marketing drug surveillance data to describe potential adverse events related to GLP-1RA use. In this study, we characterize GLP-1RA cases reported to US PCs using data from the National Poison Data System (NPDS).

### Prescriptions for obesity medications among adolescents aged 12–17 years with obesity-United States, 2018–2023 [^8e654ec4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide indicated for persons aged ≥ 12 years with obesity (Wegovy) and phentermine or phentermine-topiramate were the most prescribed obesity medications in 2023. The oral administration, lower out-of-pocket costs, and more consistent availability of phentermine or phentermine-topiramate (compared with semaglutide, which is administered by weekly subcutaneous injections) might be factors in the increased use among adolescents in 2023 compared with previous years.

This study excluded medications that were not FDA approved for obesity treatment in adolescents but are often used off-label for this purpose (e.g. metformin, semaglutide [Ozempic], and liraglutide [Victoza], all indicated for persons with T2DM). A sensitivity analysis including semaglutide and liraglutide regardless of indication resulted in a slightly higher prescription prevalence (0.7% in 2023). Future analyses could focus on medications prescribed off-label for obesity or for other conditions that also help with weight management.

The findings in this report indicate that health care providers tended to prescribe obesity medications to adolescents with severe obesity. Approximately 83% of adolescents who received an obesity medication prescription had severe obesity (class 2 or 3), including 52% with class 3 obesity. Higher obesity class is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk, lower health-related quality of life, and declines in physical function, which might prompt providers to prescribe obesity medications to this population.

Prescribing of obesity medications also differed by sex, race, and U.S. Census Bureau region. Girls were more likely than boys to be prescribed obesity medications. In addition, although the prevalence of severe obesity among Black adolescents was 27% higher than among White adolescents, Black adolescents were 39% less likely than White adolescents to receive an obesity medication prescription. Factors that might explain differences in prescribing or low prescription rates include limited availability of the medications because of production shortages, high out-of-pocket costs, and insurance restrictions, such as lack of coverage or complex prior authorization processes. In addition, concerns among adolescents and health care providers about long-term use and safety, as well as health care provider knowledge and self-efficacy in prescribing obesity medications, could impact prescription rates.

### Population-level impact of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with obesity or overweight and cardiovascular disease: a modelling study based on the SELECT trial [^00849551]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Our analysis estimated that over 6 million US adults would meet the criteria for the SELECT trial (i.e. aged ≥ 45 years with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2, established ASCVD and no diabetes). Among these, four in 10 are expected to experience at least one MACE in the next 10 years. We estimated that nearly half a million CV events (16% relative risk reduction) and over 300 000 premature deaths (any cause, 16% relative risk reduction) could potentially be avoided if this population were treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg. Over 22 million adults are projected to be eligible for treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg based on the broader FDA indication for MACE risk reduction (i.e. overweight or obesity and cardiovascular disease). In this population, treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg could prevent more than 1.9 million CV events (16% relative risk reduction) and 1.2 million deaths (16% relative risk reduction) during the next 10 years. These findings suggest considerable potential for MACE reduction in the US population with semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment in eligible individuals.

- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as semaglutide has been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Discontinue semaglutide if acute pancreatitis is suspected.
- **AKI**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as semaglutide has been associated with an increased risk of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure. Monitor renal function when initiating or up-titrating semaglutide in patients with severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions.
- **Anaphylaxis, angioedema**: use caution in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with other GLP-1 receptor agonists.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Exacerbation of diabetic retinopathy**: use caution in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Monitor patients for disease progression.
- **Gallstone disease**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as semaglutide has been associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.
- **Suicidal ideation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as suicidal behavior and ideation have been reported in clinical trials with other chronic weight management products. Monitor for new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts/behavior, and/or changes in mood or behavior. Avoid using semaglutide in patients with a history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation. Discontinue semaglutide if suicidal thoughts or behaviors occur.
- **Tachycardia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as semaglutide has been associated with increases in resting HR. Monitor HR at regular intervals. Discontinue semaglutide in case of sustained increase in resting HR.

### The emerging role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the management of NAFLD [^db049036]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Because greater weight loss was observed in early head-to-head trials of semaglutide compared with liraglutide, the STEP program involved several RCTs (n = 4988) developed to assess the efficacy and safety for weight management of higher dose semaglutide (2.4 mg/weekly). Results of the 68-week-duration STEP 1 to STEP 4 trials have been recently reported (STEP 1: weight management [WM]; STEP 2: WM in T2D; STEP 3: intensive behavioral therapy; STEP 4: sustained WM; STEP-5 is an ongoing 102-week treatment trial). As anticipated, weight loss was greater than in the SCALE trials. The most impressive is perhaps STEP 4, in which patients with overweight/obesity without T2D, all initially treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly for 20 weeks, were randomized to receive either continued semaglutide or placebo for another 48 weeks. The mean weight loss of volunteers that continued on semaglutide was 7.9% in contrast to a weight regain of 6.9% on placebo. Pooling the STEP 1 to 4 studies together, semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly led to a mean weight loss ranging from -7.9% to -16% (-7.1 to -16.8 kg), whereas with placebo it ranged from +6.9% to -5.7% (+6.1 to -6.2 kg). These results led to the approval on June 4, 2021 of semaglutide 2.4 mg/weekly (as Wegovy) for the treatment of obesity. Such results clearly make semaglutide a strong candidate for the use in patients with NAFLD.

### Population-level impact of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with obesity or overweight and cardiovascular disease: a modelling study based on the SELECT trial [^1e392993]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To estimate the impact of semaglutide 2.4mg treatment on the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with overweight/obesity in the United States based on the SELECT trial of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Materials and Methods

Using 2023 census projections and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, we developed Markov population-based predictive models for US adults meeting SELECT inclusion criteria and, separately, for adults eligible for semaglutide 2.4mg for its MACE risk reduction indication. The 10-year rate of recurrent MACE and deaths was estimated based on the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease 2 risk calculator and estimated semaglutide 2.4mg treatment effect as per the SELECT MACE hazard ratio.

Results

Of 6164019 US adults meeting the SELECT criteria, 2523218 (40.9%) are estimated to have ≥ 1 new MACE in the next 10years with no additional intervention. Semaglutide 2.4mg may prevent 496400 events, a 16% relative reduction. An estimated 2103630 deaths are predicted over the next 10years, of which 332597 deaths (any cause, 16% relative reduction) could be avoided with semaglutide 2.4mg. Among the estimated 22653158 meeting the MACE risk reduction FDA label criteria, 42.7% could experience ≥ 1 new MACE; treatment could prevent 1934493 MACE and 1231295 deaths (16% relative reduction for both).

Conclusion

Four in 10 individuals in the United States meeting the SELECT criteria are estimated to experience a recurrent CV event without additional intervention. Semaglutide 2.4mg can potentially prevent between half a million and up to 2 million MACE over the next 10years in the population meeting SELECT and MACE risk reduction eligibility.

Plain Language Summary

What is the context and purpose of this research study? More than 7 in 10 US adults have overweight or obesity, which increases the risk of heart disease. Semaglutide is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. A clinical study called SELECT found that semaglutide reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death by 20% in adults with overweight or obesity and heart disease. What was done? Our research estimated how many people in the United States would meet the criteria for participation in SELECT, how many heart disease events they might have with regular medical care over the next 10 years, and how many could be avoided with semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment in addition to regular medical care. We also estimated how many people would still be alive if they were treated with semaglutide. We estimated the same information for all people eligible for treatment with semaglutide based on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indication of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with heart disease. These estimations were based on a large survey of US adults. What were the main results? We found that over 6 million people would meet the SELECT study criteria. Of these, 41% are estimated to have at least 1 new heart disease event in the next 10 years. If treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg, nearly 500 000 heart disease events and more than 300 000 deaths could be avoided. More than 22 million adults would qualify for semaglutide 2.4 mg, according to the FDA indication. If all of these people were treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg, nearly 2 million heart disease events and more than 1 million deaths might be prevented. What is the originality and relevance of this study? Treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg can reduce the risk of new heart disease events and death in patients with existing heart disease, showing a substantial impact of semaglutide treatment in a real-world setting in the United States. Our study used different analyses to add to the existing research about reducing the risk of heart disease in people with overweight or obesity.

### Real-world use of semaglutide for weight management: patient characteristics and dose titration – A Danish cohort study [^cf350cb6]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine patient characteristics and dose titration patterns of real-world semaglutide (Wegovy) users.

Research Design and Methods

We used a population-based cohort study including Danish adults who filled semaglutide prescriptions from 12 December 2022 to 31 December 2023. Outcomes were patient characteristics, prescriber type, and dose titration patterns.

Results

We identified 110,748 individuals (median age 49 years; 70% female) filling 773,708 prescriptions for semaglutide. General practitioners initiated treatment in 86%. Common comorbidities included hypertension (30%), dyslipidemia (17%), and arthrosis (17%). Only 13% reached the maximum dose of 2.4 mg by their fifth prescription, while 5.7% stopped after the first prescription. Few users (10%) followed recommended dose increases every 4 weeks. Overall, 25% filled at least one prescription of 2.4 mg, while 33–48% continued with the 1.0-mg dosage from the fourth prescription onward.

Conclusions

Real-world semaglutide users generally resembled trial participants, but few follow the dose titration schemes tested in premarket clinical trials.

### Cutting-edge approaches to obesity management: the latest pharmacological options [^8dc251dd]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Successful treatment of obesity requires a multidisciplinary approach including dietary strategy, physical activity, and behavioral modification. The seven FDA-approved anti-obesity medications are phentermine, orlistat, phentermine/topiramate ER, naltrexone SR/bupropion SR, liraglutide 3.0 mg, semaglutide 2.4 mg, and tirzepatide. Obesity is a chronic disease and these medications should be prescribed with the intention of long-term use.

Methods

Study Design and Setting

Data for this retrospective cohort study were obtained from the Cleveland Clinic electronic health record (EHR) in Ohio and Florida, including linked Surescripts pharmacy dispensation records, from January 1, 2015, to July 28, 2023. The Surescripts prescription data service captures prescriptions paid for via insurance benefits, cash, coupons, or other methods, from nearly all major pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers in the US.

The study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board as minimal risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice, for which the requirement for informed consent was waived. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines were followed.

Study Participants

We identified adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who filled an initial prescription for injectable semaglutide or liraglutide from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2022, and had a body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared) of at least 30.0, recorded on the date of treatment initiation (index date) or during the latest available primary care visit before the index date. To ensure that these were initial fills, we excluded patients prescribed these medications between January 1 and June 30, 2015. Individuals were required to have a follow-up weight measurement at least 12 months after the treatment initiation to be included in the study. Patients who were pregnant, had cancer diagnoses during the study period, or underwent bariatric surgery within 2 years of the initial medication fill were excluded (Figure 1). This study captured fills for injectable forms of semaglutide and liraglutide under the brand names approved by the FDA for obesity (semaglutide, 1.7 or 2.4 mg [Wegovy], and liraglutide, 3.0 mg [Saxenda]), as well as those approved for T2D (semaglutide, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg [Ozempic], and liraglutide, 1.2 or 1.8 mg [Victoza]), including all starting doses.

### FDA approves treatment for serious liver disease known… [^5624510f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Wegovy injection to treat metabolic-associated steatohepatitis in adults with moderate-to-advanced fibrosis. MASH, also known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, is a serious liver disease. Wegovy, which was first approved in 2017, is also approved for obesity or overweight and to reduce cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks, in individuals at high risk of these events. Approximately 6% of U. S. adults have MASH, and its prevalence is expanding. Disease or Condition MASH is a severe form of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease that develops when fat buildup in the liver causes inflammation and scarring. Conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, high triglycerides, and high LDL-cholesterol increase the likelihood of developing MASH.

MASH is a progressive disease that can lead to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, liver cancer, liver transplantation, or death. Symptoms can include fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and muscle weakness, but many people do not have symptoms until they experience severe liver damage. Wegovy promotes weight loss and potentially other mechanisms not fully understood, which may improve liver inflammation and scarring. Wegovy received breakthrough therapy designation for this indication and was approved under the accelerated approval pathway, which allows a therapy treating serious conditions to get to market earlier based on a surrogate endpoint with additional data required after approval to confirm the effect of the therapy on a clinically meaningful endpoint. Data Supporting Wegovy Wegovy's efficacy was demonstrated in one ongoing phase 3 trial.

The planned interim analysis at week 72 included 800 clinical trial participants randomly assigned to either Wegovy or placebo in addition to lifestyle changes. Participants were on stable doses of lipid-lowering, glucose-management, and weight-loss medications. At week 72, the primary efficacy endpoint was based on histology. Interim results showed 63% of participants receiving Wegovy had MASH resolution and no worsening of liver scarring compared to 34% of participants receiving placebo, and 37% of participants on Wegovy had improvement in liver scarring and no worsening of MASH, compared to 22% of participants receiving placebo.

The trial will continue for a total of 240 weeks to determine whether inflammation and scarring improvements seen after 72 weeks translate into decreases in death, liver transplant, and other liver-related events. Safety Information The most common side effects of Wegovy include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, dyspepsia, dizziness, abdominal distension, eructation, hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes, flatulence, gastroenteritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and nasopharyngitis. People with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer; with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2; or with a known sensitivity to semaglutide or Wegovy excipients should not take this drug. The Wegovy approval for the treatment of MASH with moderate-to-advanced scarring was granted to Novo Nordisk.

New patients turning to semaglutide (Ozempic&reg; and Wegovy&reg;), a glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist, for weight loss, have captivated social media platforms.&nbsp; Wegovy&reg; carries a United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for chronic weight management in patients who have a body mass index (BMI) 27 kg/m2 or greater and at least one weight-related condition (eg, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cholesterol) or in patients with a 30 kg/m2 or greater BMI. Although other semaglutide formulations are not FDA approved for weight loss, the term "Ozempic face" has consumed the media with the medication's rising popularity. This term is a new purported side effect, used to describe the rapid facial weight loss leaving a distorted facial appearance. This challenges the healthcare team to discern whether a new adverse effect is a novel or a natural consequence of rapid weight loss. Dermatologists are well positioned to counsel patients receiving or discontinuing GLP-1 agonists and recommend appropriate countermeasures, as appropriate.&nbsp; J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(1):1367–1368. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.7613.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for the evaluation and treatment of adults with obesity / adiposity-based chronic disease-2025 update [^5d26347e]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Online prescriptions for obesity medications and compounded semaglutide/tirzepatide — AACE's position and FDA cautions emphasize that online prescription of obesity medications per se, operating without involvement of health care professionals for initial evaluation and follow-up, represents substandard care and places individuals at risk, and whether follow-up involves in-person visits or telehealth, the involvement of trained health care professionals is required. Compounded alternatives to FDA-approved semaglutide and tirzepatide are often dispensed via online pharmacies, and AACE advises against the use of these agents; compounded drugs, however, are not approved by the FDA; thus, without verification of safety, effectiveness, or quality before they are marketed, these pose a higher risk to individuals than drugs approved by the FDA. An analysis of compounded preparations has demonstrated inaccurately labeled concentrations, impurities, other high molecular weight peptides, trace metals, residual solvents, and neopeptides with potential immunogenicity, and the FDA has recommended caution over the use of compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide because of overdosing and hospitalizations; in addition, the FDA has presented demonstrable difficulties for compounding under sections 503A or 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that would prohibit compounding those medications.

### International lack of equity in modern obesity therapy: the critical need for change in health policy [^8faf8fab]. International Journal of Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, there are several medications with a high level of efficacy for treating obesity. Semaglutide, for example, is a Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist (GLP-1 RA) that works by mimicking a hormone naturally released in the gastrointestinal tract to slow down stomach emptying and target brain regions concerning appetite reduction and food intake. In June 2021 and January 2022, the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), respectively, approved Semaglutide under the name of Wegovy "for weight management in adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m 2 or greater (with at least one weight-related medical condition) and patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or greater".

Unfortunately, most U.S. private health insurers refuse to cover anti-obesity therapies, requiring patients to pay out of pocket. Among 136 marketplace plans in 2018, 11% had some coverage for weight loss drugs in only nine states. Medicare also excludes anti-obesity pharmacotherapy, and Medicaid, while variable, excludes coverage in 6 states with the highest prevalence of obesity. In Europe, insurance coverage for anti-obesity medications similarly varies from country to country, but in Germany, there is no indication for anti-obesity medications for body weight regulation under Social Code Book 5, Section 34. Currently, the German legislature does not differentiate between treating obesity as a chronic disease from the recreational pursuit of weight loss for vanity, thus ignoring that obesity is a complex, multifactorial disease.

### High-dose once-weekly semaglutide: a new option for obesity management [^ce8af4c6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide for chronic weight management.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched (inception to September 8, 2021) using keywords "semaglutide" and "obesity", "weight", "high dose", "high-dose", or "2.4".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with published results were included. Publications studying the oral or < 2.4 mg formulation of semaglutide were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated efficacy of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide compared with placebo for weight loss. Study populations included patients with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4) or patients with diabetes and with overweight or obesity (STEP 2). Lifestyle interventions for diet and exercise were included for all participants. Weight loss from baseline was significant for all studies, and secondary outcomes demonstrated cardiometabolic improvements including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, but the medication was otherwise well tolerated.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

High-dose semaglutide offers significant weight-lowering potential and favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and glycemic indices. Clinicians and patients should consider the route and frequency of administration, adverse effect profile, and cost when choosing an antiobesity medication. The importance of concomitant lifestyle interventions should be emphasized.

Conclusions

High-dose once-weekly semaglutide can significantly reduce weight, and although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, it is generally well tolerated.

### GLP-1 agonists: a review for emergency clinicians [^3b8a466c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) based therapies, including GLP-1 agonists, are currently in use for treatment of diabetes and obesity. However, several complications may occur with their use.

Objective

This narrative review provides a focused evaluation of GLP-1 agonist therapy and associated complications for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

GLP-1 agonists potentiate insulin release and reduce gastric emptying and food intake. These agents have demonstrated significant improvements in glucose control in diabetics and weight loss in obese patients. The two most common agents include subcutaneous semaglutide (Ozempic, approved for type 2 diabetes, and Wegovy, approved for weight loss) and liraglutide (Saxenda, approved for weight loss, and Victoza, approved for type 2 diabetes), though an oral formulation of semaglutide is available (Rybelsus). While these drugs are associated with improved long-term outcomes, there are a variety of associated adverse events. The most common include gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Pancreatitis and biliary disease may also occur. Hypersensitivity including injection site reactions have been associated with use, with reports of anaphylaxis and other rashes. Renal adverse events are most commonly associated with severe GI losses. Hypoglycemia may occur when these agents are used with sulfonylureas or insulin. There is also an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy. Due to the current shortage and expense of these medications, many patients have attempted to obtain these medications from non-licensed and unregulated agents, which may be associated with increased risk of serious complications.

Conclusions

An understanding of the indications for GLP-1 agonist use and associated adverse events can assist emergency clinicians.

GLP-1 therapy utilization and regulatory indications highlight growing use and FDA-approved age ranges and indications. In 2024, 6% of US adults report current GLP-1 use, and 12% report ever use — rising to 22% among individuals told by a clinician that they have overweight or obesity. The medications are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity and weight-related conditions. Semaglutide and liraglutide are indicated for adults or youth ages 12+ years, and tirzepatide for adults ages 18+ years. GLP-1s for obesity also have additional FDA-approved indications for cardiovascular risk reduction and obstructive sleep apnea. GLP-1s are separately approved for type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, which are not the focus of this advisory.

Anti-obesity medication use — Patients have an average of approximately 5–20% weight reduction with variable responses; for many agents, if no clinical improvement of at least 3–5% loss of baseline body weight occurs after 12–16 weeks, labeling may recommend increasing the dose or possibly discontinuing therapy, whereas some agents such as semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly injection do not have explicit stopping instructions; if weight regain indicates loss of effectiveness the medication should be discontinued, while a plateau after clinically meaningful loss should not necessarily be interpreted as tolerance and should not automatically warrant that the medication "be discontinued".

### Use of dulaglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide in diabetes and weight management [^57b61613]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) are effective therapies in lowering glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), providing cardioprotective benefits, and lowering weight. The use of GLP1-RA solely for weight-loss has become commonplace in many practices, which in turn has made it difficult in some areas for those with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to obtain these much-needed medications.

Methods

Using recent published literature, along with clinical experience, it has become apparent that many GLP1-RAs have become difficult to obtain for patients with diabetes.

Findings

Many clinicians started to prescribe the brand Ozempic® (semaglutide*) and dulaglutide for weight loss despite neither of them being Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for this indication. Ozempic, having outperformed dulaglutide in in both HbA 1c reduction and weight loss, along with FDA approval of semaglutide for weight loss, has quickly become widely used off-label for weight loss. This off-label use may have increased, despite the approval of semaglutide, † because many insurances will not cover semaglutide solely for weight management. Most recently, Eli Lilly was able to develop tirzepatide, ‡ which was FDA approved in May of 2022, and they are seeking fast-track FDA approval for weight loss and are projected to gain this approval within 2023.

Implications

Insurance coverage for weight management remains sparse, and obtaining these therapies for diabetes has now become more burdensome, with insurance companies requiring a prior authorization proving FDA-approved diagnosis of T2DM. Hopefully, should more GLP1-Ras receive approval for weight loss, along with an increase in insurance coverage, the burden on patients with diabetes will be lessened as they are able to quickly obtain this highly effective therapy.

NAFLD — Off-label pharmacologic management addresses comorbidities and clarifies what is and is not appropriate for NASH. There are no FDA-approved medications for NAFLD, but drugs for comorbidities with potential benefit may be considered. Semaglutide can be considered for its approved indications in NASH because it confers cardiovascular benefit and improves NASH; pioglitazone improves NASH and can be considered for NASH in T2DM; vitamin E can be considered in select individuals without diabetes as it improves NASH. Available data on semaglutide, pioglitazone, and vitamin E do not show an antifibrotic benefit and these compounds have not been carefully studied in cirrhosis. Metformin, UDCA, DPP-4, statins, and silymarin should not be used to treat NASH due to lack of meaningful histological benefit. Statins are safe and recommended for cardiovascular risk reduction across NAFLD, including compensated cirrhosis; in decompensated cirrhosis, data are limited but use could be considered in high cardiovascular risk with careful monitoring. Hypertriglyceridemia management includes lifestyle changes and omega-3 fatty acids, icosapent ethyl, or fibrates.

### GLP-1-based therapies for diabetes, obesity and beyond [^09999e5e]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, represent highly effective treatment options for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, enabling effective control of glucose and weight loss, while reducing cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The success of these medicines has spurred development of next-generation GLP-1-based drugs, promising greater weight loss, improved tolerability and additional options for the route and frequency of dosing. This Review profiles established and emerging GLP-1-based medicines, discussing optimization of pharmacokinetics and tolerability, engagement of new therapeutically useful pathways and safety aspects. Structurally unique GLP-1-based medicines that achieve substantially greater and rapid weight loss may impact musculoskeletal health, providing a rationale for therapeutics that more selectively target adipose tissue loss while preserving muscle mass and strength. Ongoing clinical trials in peripheral vascular disease, neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders, metabolic liver disease, arthritis, hypertension and neurodegenerative disorders may broaden indications for GLP-1-based therapeutics.

### Prescriptions for obesity medications among adolescents aged 12–17 years with obesity-United States, 2018–2023 [^b6451706]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity affects approximately one in five U.S. adolescents. Although an increasing number of medications are approved for adolescent obesity as an adjunct to health behavior and lifestyle treatment, national data on the prevalence and correlates of obesity medication prescribing for adolescents are sparse. Ambulatory electronic medical record data were analyzed to assess trends in the proportion of U.S. adolescents aged 12–17 years with obesity (body mass index ≥ 95th percentile) who were prescribed Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved obesity medications during 2018–2023. Log-binomial models were used to estimate characteristics of adolescents associated with receiving an obesity medication prescription in 2023. The proportion of U.S. adolescents who were prescribed obesity medications increased substantially in 2023 (by approximately 300% compared with 2020), the year after FDA expanded its approval of two obesity medications to include adolescents and after publication of the 2023 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline. Despite this substantial relative increase, 0.5% of adolescents with obesity were prescribed an obesity medication in 2023, with a majority (83%) of prescriptions received by adolescents with severe obesity. Semaglutide (Wegovy, indicated for persons aged ≥ 12 years with obesity), and phentermine or phentermine-topiramate were most commonly prescribed. Prescribing prevalence was higher among girls than among boys (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 2.05), among adolescents aged 15–17 years than among those aged 12–14 years (aPR = 2.24), and among those with severe (class 2 or class 3) obesity than among those with class 1 obesity (aPR = 4.03 and 12.78, respectively). Prescribing prevalence was lower among Black or African American adolescents than among White adolescents (aPR = 0.61). Continued monitoring of the use of these medications could help guide strategies to ensure that all adolescents with obesity have access to evidence-based obesity treatment, including medications and health behavior and lifestyle interventions.

Fig. 7
SNAC technology for Semaglutide permeation.

This illustration demonstrates how SNAC in the tablet helps oral semaglutide survive stomach acid. SNAC raises local pH, protects the drug from gastric enzymes, and increases its absorption through the stomach lining.

Preclinical pharmacoscintigraphic imaging and studies in canine models have demonstrated that semaglutide is primarily absorbed in the stomach, with higher drug concentrations detected in the splenic vein relative to the portal vein, indicating site-specific uptake. This innovative approach effectively bypasses the traditional barriers associated with oral peptide delivery, offering a clinically viable and patient-preferred alternative to injectable formulations.

Semaglutide is also available as injectable formulations, including Ozempic ® and Wegovy ®, which are widely recognized for their efficacy in the management of T2DM and obesity. Both formulations are administered as once-weekly SC injections due to the long half-life of Semaglutide (approximately one week). Furthermore, Ozempic ® is primarily used for glycemic control in diabetes patients, while Wegovy ® targets weight management by reducing hunger and enhancing satiety through activation of GLP-1 receptors. The pharmacokinetic profiles of these formulations indicate that maximum plasma concentrations are typically attained within 1 to 3 days following SC administration, while steady-state plasma levels are generally achieved after 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly dosing. Dosing regimens for both products involve gradual titration to optimize therapeutic outcomes; Ozempic® progresses from 0.25 mg to a maintenance dose of up to 1 mg, whereas Wegovy® reaches a higher maintenance dose of 2.4 mg to support weight loss goals.

### Anti-obesity medications and investigational agents: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^b015e386]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Table 2 — Semaglutide (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist) at 2.4 mg subcutaneously per week is approved for treatment of obesity, with average weight reduction about 15%, and at oral doses of 7–14 mg per day is indicated to lower blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is contraindicated in patients with personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 or known hypersensitivity to semaglutide. It is associated with hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with concomitant hypoglycemic medications such as insulin or sulfonylureas and may slow gastric emptying, which may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medication.

Semaglutide STEP 3 — subcutaneous semaglutide as an adjunct to intensive behavior therapy in adults with overweight or obesity — enrolled participants without diabetes mellitus, used a low-calorie, meal-replacement diet for the first 8 weeks (1000–1200 kcal/day) followed by 1200–1800 kcal/day with regular physical activity goals of 200 minutes per week and 30 individual sessions; semaglutide 2.4 mg SQ per week plus intensive behavior therapy resulted in a 16.9% reduction in body weight versus 5.7% with placebo, and the authors noted 14.9% vs 2.4% at 68 weeks in STEP 1, concluding that these findings suggest that the inclusion of intensive behavioral therapy plus an 8-week low-calorie diet ultimately may not contribute significant additional weight reduction beyond that achieved by semaglutide and less-intensive lifestyle intervention.
