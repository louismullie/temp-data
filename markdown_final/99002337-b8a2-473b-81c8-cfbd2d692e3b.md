## Question

How does the location of the dissection influence the choice between open surgical repair and hybrid open-endovascular repair?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the anatomic location of aortic dissection influences the choice between open surgical repair and hybrid open–endovascular repair. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core classification by location (Stanford A vs B, arch, descending, thoracoabdominal) and how that dictates urgency and baseline strategy. Then, I should verify how the primary entry tear location modifies the plan, especially for arch and non-A non-B lesions. Next, I will examine malperfusion syndromes and when hybrid strategies are favored. After that, I need to review chronic versus acute phases and how chronicity shifts the balance toward open or endovascular options. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight key controversies and evidence gaps, making sure I double-check guideline nuances and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: location determines urgency and default strategy. Stanford type A (ascending aorta) is a surgical emergency requiring immediate open repair to prevent rupture, tamponade, and coronary or cerebral malperfusion, whereas Stanford type B (descending aorta) is generally managed medically unless complicated, in which case endovascular therapy is preferred when anatomy is suitable [^112AAsjo] [^1175vNsj] [^111zxsHZ]. Hold on, I should verify the arch category: arch involvement with a tear in zones 0–2 is typically grouped with type A physiology and urgency, reinforcing the need for open or hybrid strategies rather than isolated TEVAR in most scenarios [^114beyv1].

> Now, I will examine how the primary entry tear location reshapes the operative plan. If the entry is in the distal arch or proximal descending aorta, a hybrid approach with frozen elephant trunk (FET) or targeted TEVAR to cover the entry can be considered to treat malperfusion and reduce late distal complications; this is particularly relevant when the flap extends into the descending thoracic aorta or when there is anticipated downstream disease requiring staged management [^117PbZTM] [^115oJsEx] [^1129yB1K]. Wait, let me verify the non-A non-B space: for arch-entry tears or non-A non-B dissections, contemporary guidance supports considering stent graft coverage of the entry when anatomically feasible and considering FET in complicated cases, reflecting a hybrid mindset for arch pathology [^115GeRja] [^116d2Jt5].

> Next, I should review malperfusion syndromes, because they pivot the strategy toward hybrid. Mesenteric malperfusion in acute type A carries extremely high mortality; strategies that restore visceral perfusion — sometimes endovascular-first or concurrent hybrid approaches — are favored in specialized centers, with reports suggesting better outcomes than isolated medical or purely open strategies in select cohorts, though data are limited and center-specific [^112Hpx1G] [^114UYGJG] [^112omEVU]. I need to ensure I don't overstate certainty: while some series show improved survival with endovascular-first or hybrid strategies, others report high mortality during the "bridge" period, underscoring the need for rapid decision-making and institutional expertise [^111jtG7x] [^112v6nm2].

> Let me consider the chronic versus acute distinction, because chronicity changes the calculus. In chronic type B dissection with aneurysmal degeneration, open surgical repair remains the reference standard for durable reconstruction when the patient is a suitable candidate, whereas TEVAR is reasonable in high-risk patients with suitable anatomy but may carry higher reintervention rates compared with open repair in observational comparisons [^111y8eyn] [^113JgcCF] [^113tqMQD]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought endovascular might be broadly preferred in chronic disease; hold on, I should verify that — guidelines and comparative data actually support open repair as first-line when feasible due to better freedom from reintervention, reserving TEVAR for those with prohibitive comorbidities or suitable anatomy in whom open risk is excessive [^111y8eyn] [^113tqMQD].

> I will now examine thoracoabdominal extension, because extent matters. For extensive thoracoabdominal disease, open repair remains the most durable option in suitable patients, but hybrid strategies (for example, open visceral debranching followed by endovascular coverage) or fenestrated/branched endovascular repair are increasingly used in patients unfit for open surgery or when open repair is contraindicated; selection hinges on landing zones, branch vessel anatomy, and patient comorbidity [^116w7Gui] [^116p4XfP] [^1168RFYK]. Let me reconsider the durability point: yes, open repair offers the most established long-term outcomes, but modern endovascular options are narrowing the gap in selected anatomies, albeit with higher reintervention needs in some series [^116p4XfP] [^1168RFYK].

> Next, I should review the hybrid-specific indications tied to location. Frozen elephant trunk is favored when the arch and proximal descending aorta are involved, when there is a need to exclude an arch entry tear, or when distal thoracoabdominal disease is anticipated and a staged strategy is planned. This is particularly pertinent in acute type A with distal extension or in complicated non-A non-B dissections [^115oJsEx] [^1129yB1K] [^116d2Jt5]. I should double-check that contemporary European guidance aligns with this — yes, ESC 2024 also supports extended repair with stenting of the proximal descending aorta in appropriate acute type A scenarios with arch or proximal descending tears to mitigate late complications [^113tuLhL].

> But wait, what about connective tissue disorders and young patients — does location still trump etiology? For Marfan and related disorders, open repair is generally preferred across locations due to concerns about stent-graft radial force and long-term aortic behavior; hybrid or purely endovascular approaches are typically avoided or reserved for exceptional circumstances after careful multidisciplinary review [^117JDHup] [^115Ai5HS]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even when the tear is distal — yes, the concern about tissue integrity and durability keeps most experts favoring open strategies in connective tissue disease regardless of entry location [^117JDHup].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against guidelines. Location first: ascending or arch involvement pushes toward open or hybrid; descending alone favors medical therapy unless complicated, in which case TEVAR is preferred with suitable anatomy. Then, tear location: arch or proximal descending entry favors FET or targeted TEVAR to exclude the primary tear. Next, malperfusion: presence of visceral or limb ischemia steers toward endovascular-first or hybrid strategies in specialized centers. Finally, chronicity and extent: chronic type B with aneurysm favors open repair when feasible; extensive thoracoabdominal disease may require open, hybrid debranching, or fenestrated/branched endovascular repair based on anatomy and risk [^116mF18x] [^115oJsEx] [^111y8eyn] [^116w7Gui]. I should confirm that this aligns with ACC/AHA and EACTS/ESVS positions — yes, the emphasis remains on complication-specific, anatomy-driven strategies with hybrid approaches expanding the armamentarium rather than replacing open surgery [^117QXGXz] [^115oJsEx].

> I need to ensure I acknowledge controversies and evidence gaps. There are no large randomized trials comparing open versus hybrid arch strategies, and most recommendations are consensus-based; observational data suggest hybrid repairs are feasible with acceptable outcomes in high-risk cohorts, but selection bias and center effects are substantial, so conclusions should be cautious [^115yMieU] [^115oJsEx]. For mesenteric malperfusion in type A, both open-first and endovascular-first strategies have been advocated; outcomes vary by center and patient selection, and no single approach has proven definitively superior across settings, reinforcing the need for rapid, team-based decision-making and access to hybrid capabilities [^112Hpx1G] [^112omEVU] [^112v6nm2].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: location sets the default, but the primary entry tear, presence of malperfusion, chronicity, and patient-specific factors (including connective tissue disease) modulate the choice toward open, endovascular, or hybrid repair. Hybrid strategies are most compelling when the arch is involved, when there is distal malperfusion, or when extensive downstream disease is anticipated and a staged plan is advantageous, always within the context of institutional expertise and patient risk [^115sEy8v] [^115oJsEx] [^116mF18x].

The location of the dissection is the **primary determinant** of repair strategy: open surgery is mandatory for acute type A (ascending/aortic arch) because of rupture and coronary/valvular risks, whereas endovascular therapy (TEVAR) is preferred for complicated type B (descending) when anatomy permits due to lower morbidity and mortality [^115sEy8v] [^111zxsHZ]. Hybrid approaches (e.g. frozen elephant trunk) are reserved for **complex arch or extensive disease** when open surgery is high risk or anatomy is unfavorable for isolated endovascular repair [^115oJsEx] [^116d2Jt5]. Uncomplicated type B is managed medically, with intervention only for complications or high-risk features [^1175vNsj].

## Type A aortic dissection (ascending aorta and/or aortic arch)

### Indications for open surgical repair

- **Emergency open surgery**: Mandatory for acute type A dissection because of high rupture, tamponade, and coronary/valvular complications [^112AAsjo].

- **Extent of repair**: Hemiarch is preferred unless the tear is in the arch or there is significant arch aneurysm; total arch with frozen elephant trunk is considered for extensive arch/proximal descending disease or to prevent distal degeneration [^112S6Fup] [^113tuLhL].

- **Valve/root management**: Valve-sparing or replacement is individualized based on root pathology and surgeon expertise [^111tqqbr] [^116RkXeL].

---

### Role of hybrid open-endovascular repair

- **Frozen elephant trunk (FET)**: Used for extensive arch/proximal descending disease, malperfusion, or to facilitate staged distal repair; considered when open surgery is high risk or anatomy is unfavorable [^115oJsEx] [^116d2Jt5].

- **Malperfusion management**: Endovascular-first strategies may restore perfusion before open repair in stable patients with visceral malperfusion, though evidence is limited and patient selection is critical [^112Hpx1G] [^112omEVU].

---

## Type B aortic dissection (descending aorta)

### Indications for endovascular repair (TEVAR)

- **Complicated type B**: Rupture, malperfusion, refractory pain, or rapid expansion warrant TEVAR as first-line when anatomy is suitable, given lower morbidity/mortality than open surgery [^111zxsHZ] [^1175vNsj].

- **Uncomplicated type B**: Medical therapy is first-line; TEVAR may be considered for high-risk anatomic features (e.g. large diameter, large false lumen) [^1175vNsj].

---

### Indications for open surgical repair

Open surgery is reserved for **complicated type B with unsuitable anatomy for TEVAR**, failed endovascular therapy, or connective tissue disorders, accepting higher morbidity and mortality [^1122T84B] [^117JDHup].

---

### Role of hybrid open-endovascular repair

Hybrid procedures are rarely used for isolated type B; they may be considered in **complex anatomy** or when extensive thoracoabdominal involvement requires combined approaches [^111daCQt].

---

## Non-A non-B dissections (aortic arch involvement)

Non-A non-B dissections often require **hybrid strategies** (e.g. FET) when the primary tear is in the arch or when extensive disease is present, balancing the risks of open surgery against endovascular limitations [^115oJsEx] [^116d2Jt5].

---

## Influence of dissection location on repair choice

| **Dissection location** | **Preferred repair strategy** | **Indications for hybrid repair** |
|-|-|-|
| Type A (ascending/aortic arch) | Open surgical repair (hemiarch or total arch) | - Extensive arch/proximal descending disease <br/> - Malperfusion <br/> - High surgical risk |
| Type B (descending) | TEVAR for complicated cases; medical therapy for uncomplicated | Rare; complex anatomy or extensive disease |
| Non-A non-B (arch) | Hybrid (FET) or open repair | Primary tear in arch or extensive disease |

---

## Conclusion

The location of the dissection **dictates the repair strategy**: open surgery is mandatory for type A, TEVAR is preferred for complicated type B when feasible, and hybrid approaches are reserved for complex arch or extensive disease. Individualized decisions should integrate anatomy, comorbidities, and center expertise.

Study limitations

There are some limitations of this study primarily related to its retrospective and observational characteristics including our evolving experience with TEVAR with limitations and benefits, and considering that we have used two different techniques during two different periods. In fact one of the indications to include patients in the TEVAR group was the presence of important comorbidities together with technical criteria already explained. Moreover we are conscious that the size of the cohort was small and not randomized, the two groups of patients are not entirely comparable and the time-related enrolment of patients was quite long. Further randomized, controlled studies are needed to address the best therapeutic strategy for complicated type B AAD and factors associated with optimal short- and long-term outcomes.

Chronic type B aortic dissection — TEVAR evidence versus open repair: There are no published randomized trials of open surgery compared with TEVAR for chronic TBAD. In two retrospective institutional comparisons, a propensity score–matched analysis found no difference in rates of spinal cord injury, renal replacement therapy, 30-day mortality, or 5-year survival, whereas treatment efficacy defined as freedom from aortic reintervention was superior with open therapy (96.7% vs 87.5%; hazard ratio, 4.6; p = 0.025); a second study found a higher incidence of spinal cord injury with open repair but otherwise no differences in perioperative morbidity, survival at 1 or 5 years, or a composite outcome of freedom from aortic reintervention, rupture, or aortic-related death at 1 or 5 years. TEVAR for chronic dissection may facilitate subsequent, more limited thoracoabdominal repair as a staged completion with extension from the distal end of a TEVAR.

### Endovascular vs. open repair of complicated acute type B aortic dissections [^1118gMZ2]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose: To assess the comparative effectiveness of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) vs. open surgical repair (OSR) of complicated acute type B aortic dissections (cABAD) using decision analysis. Methods: A decision analysis comparing TEVAR and OSR for cABAD included variables extracted from the best-available evidence. Main outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), presented with the 95% credibility intervals (CI), and number of reinterventions over the remaining lifetime. Different clinical scenarios, including age, gender, and risk profile were analyzed. Parameter uncertainty was analyzed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: In the reference case, a cohort of 55-year-old men, TEVAR was preferred over OSR: 7.07 QALYs (95% CI 6.77 to 7.38) vs. 6.34 QALYs (95% CI 6.04 to 6.66) for OSR. The difference of 0.73 QALYs (95% CI 0.29 to 1.17) is equal to 8.5 months in perfect health. TEVAR was more effective in all analyzed cases and age groups. Perioperative mortality was the most important variable affecting the difference between OSR and TEVAR, followed by the relative risk and percentage of aortic-related complications. Total expected reinterventions were 0.43/patient (TEVAR) and 0.35/patient (OSR). Conclusion: The results of this decision model for the treatment of cABAD suggest that TEVAR is preferred over OSR. Although a higher number of reinterventions is expected, the total effectiveness of TEVAR is higher for all age groups. OSR should be reserved for patients whose aortic anatomy is unsuitable for endovascular repair.

Consensus — Choice of repair in the young: There was near unanimity of opinion that anatomic suitability is important for TEVAR but age should not be a factor in deciding the type of repair. The risks of death and spinal cord ischemia are significantly lower in all age groups after endovascular repair compared with open surgery, and in surgically fit patients with poor anatomy for endovascular repair, conventional open repair should be considered.

Acute type A aortic dissection — mesenteric malperfusion carries high risk and variable strategies. Mesenteric malperfusion is one of the worst complications of acute type A aortic dissection, with an associated mortality rate of 63.2%. In IRAD, nearly one-third of patients with mesenteric ischemia who were treated without intervention had an in-hospital mortality rate of 95%. For patients with acute type A aortic dissection who present with clinical evidence of mesenteric ischemia, some centers have advocated early direct reperfusion strategies before central aortic repair, whereas others advocate central aortic repair first; currently, data are limited to define the best strategy. In IRAD, a surgical and hybrid strategy appears to have superior outcome to medical or endovascular therapy alone. An institution series of endovascular therapy first showed a low aortic repair operative mortality rate of 2.1%; however, only 58% of the cohort underwent open repair, with 24% dying from organ failure and 13% from aortic rupture. Moreover, an endovascular therapy first approach requires expertise in fenestration and branch stenting to treat dynamic and static malperfusion.

### Complicated acute type B dissection: is surgery still the best option? a report from the international registry of acute aortic dissection [^116KqE79]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Impact on survival of different treatment strategies was analyzed in 571 patients with acute type B aortic dissection enrolled from 1996 to 2005 in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection.

Background

The optimal treatment for acute type B dissection is still a matter of debate.

Methods

Information on 290 clinical variables were compared, including demographics; medical history; clinical presentation; physical findings; imaging studies; details of medical, surgical, and endovascular management; in-hospital clinical events; and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Of the 571 patients with acute type B aortic dissection, 390 (68.3%) were treated medically, 59 (10.3%) with standard open surgery and 66 (11.6%) with an endovascular approach. Patients who underwent emergency endovascular or open surgery were younger (mean age 58.8 years, p < 0.001) than their counterparts treated conservatively, and had male preponderance and hypertension in 76.9%. Patients submitted to surgery presented with a wider aortic diameter than patients treated by interventional techniques or by medical therapy (5.36 ± 1.7 cm vs. 4.62 ± 1.4 cm vs. 4.47 ± 1.4 cm, p = 0.003). In-hospital complications occurred in 20% of patients subjected to endovascular technique and in 40% of patients after open surgical repair. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher after open surgery (33.9%) than after endovascular treatment (10.6%, p = 0.002). After propensity and multivariable adjustment, open surgical repair was associated with an independent increased risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio: 3.41, 95% confidence interval: 1.00 to 11.67, p = 0.05).

Conclusions

In the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection, the less invasive nature of endovascular treatment seems to provide better in-hospital survival in patients with acute type B dissection; larger randomized trials or comprehensive registries are needed to access impact on outcomes.

### Management of acute aortic dissection [^115sEy8v]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

A new appraisal of the management of acute aortic dissection is timely because of recent developments in diagnostic strategies (including biomarkers and imaging), endograft design, and surgical treatment, which have led to a better understanding of the epidemiology, risk factors, and molecular nature of aortic dissection. Although open surgery is the main treatment for proximal aortic repair, use of endovascular management is now established for complicated distal dissection and distal arch repair, and has recently been discussed as a pre-emptive measure to avoid late complications by inducing aortic remodelling.

### A hybrid approach that may facilitate the repair of traumatic popliteal artery pseudoaneurysms [^115YVq11]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Traumatic popliteal pseudoaneurysms may occur in accidents or as an iatrogenic complication of a total knee arthroplasty. Complications often arise in open repair because of distorted anatomy. Up to 22% of the patients may suffer above-knee amputation. Endovascular treatment has proven to be an effective solution. However, the long-term performance of stents at the hinge point of the popliteal artery is questionable. We present a hybrid technique that was used successfully in 2 cases.

Technique

Our approach takes advantage of both open and endovascular techniques. At first, we apply a stent graft at the side of the injury to cover the arterial trauma and stop blood leakage to the aneurysm sac. This allows for a safer dissection and open repair. We clamp the artery proximally and distally, open the sac, extract the stent graft, and extend to a longitudinal arteriotomy. We then reconstruct the entire area with a standard in lay end-to-end anastomosis using a vein graft. This hybrid technique may reduce the risk of uncontrollable bleeding and allow for a safer nerve decompression.

Conclusions

Repair of such injuries is technically demanding. A hybrid approach may reduce the risk of complications and offer excellent long-term outcomes.

Clinical Impact

The hybrid approach to the treatment of traumatic popliteal pseudoaneurysms combines the advantages of both open and endovascular approaches. It may be possible to make an acute operation just as safe as an elective operation by implementing the proposed strategy. The procedure can be performed by surgeons of all levels, and patients may benefit from a safer surgical dissection with fewer complications and blood loss. This smart combination of standard techniques may prove invaluable in a hostile surgical environment where limb loss is likely.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines of thoracic endovascular aortic repair for descending thoracic aortic aneurysms [^113CfUPL]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Thoracic aortic diseases, including disease of the descending thoracic aorta (DTA), are significant causes of death in the United States. Open repair of the DTA is a physiologically impactful operation with relatively high rates of mortality, paraplegia, and renal failure. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has revolutionized treatment of the DTA and has largely supplanted open repair because of lower morbidity and mortality. These Society for Vascular Surgery Practice Guidelines are applicable to the use of TEVAR for descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) as well as for other rarer pathologic processes of the DTA. Management of aortic dissections and traumatic injuries will be discussed in separate Society for Vascular Surgery documents. In general, there is a lack of high-quality evidence across all TAA diseases, highlighting the need for better comparative effectiveness research. Yet, large single-center experiences, administrative databases, and meta-analyses have consistently reported beneficial effects of TEVAR over open repair, especially in the setting of rupture. Many of the strongest recommendations from this guideline focus on imaging before, during, or after TEVAR and include the following: In patients considered at high risk for symptomatic TAA or acute aortic syndrome, we recommend urgent imaging, usually computed tomography angiography (CTA) because of its speed and ease of use for preoperative planning. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). If TEVAR is being considered, we recommend fine-cut (≤ 0.25 mm) CTA of the entire aorta as well as of the iliac and femoral arteries. CTA of the head and neck is also needed to determine the anatomy of the vertebral arteries. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High). We recommend routine use of three-dimensional centerline reconstruction software for accurate case planning and execution in TEVAR. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). We recommend contrast-enhanced computed tomography scanning at 1 month and 12 months after TEVAR and then yearly for life, with consideration of more frequent imaging if an endoleak or other abnormality of concern is detected at 1 month. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). Finally, based on our review, in patients who could undergo either technique (within the criteria of the device's instructions for use), we recommend TEVAR as the preferred approach to treat elective DTA aneurysms, given its reduced morbidity and length of stay as well as short-term mortality. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High). Given the benefits of TEVAR, treatment using a minimally invasive approach is largely based on anatomic eligibility rather than on patient-specific factors, as is the case in open TAA repair. Thus, for isolated lesions of the DTA, TEVAR should be the primary method of repair in both the elective and emergent setting based on improved short-term and midterm mortality as well as decreased morbidity.

IMH/PAU treatment considerations — endovascular and open repair: For acute IMH, "the perioperative mortality rate for treatment of acute IMH ranges from 0% to 29%". Technical approach notes include "In general, stent graft oversizing usually does not exceed 10%, and balloon aortoplasty at the landing zones is avoided". In observed practice, "In the IRAD experience for type B IMH, open surgical repair was performed in 5%, endovascular repair in 7%, and a hybrid approach in 1%, with no difference in results". Situations favoring surgery are outlined: "Open surgical repair may be preferable when IMH extends to the proximal landing zone of anticipated endovascular coverage, the aortic diameter at the proximal or distal extent of planned coverage is too large to accommodate existing stent graft sizes, the hematoma or aneurysm extends into the aortic arch and circulatory arrest would facilitate resection of diseased aorta, or endovascular access for stent deployment is anticipated to be inadequate".

### Open surgical repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms [^114hqbAx]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Despite much advancement in preoperative evaluation and perioperative care of patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA), open surgical repair of TAAAs remains a formidable challenge for the vascular surgeon. It requires extensive dissection and mobilization of the aorta and its branches, as well as cross-clamping of the aorta above intercostal and visceral arteries. Over the past decade, the mortality and morbidity associated with open TAAA repair have improved significantly. However, it remains one of the most complex, extensive surgical procedures performed in the field of vascular surgery. Recently, there has been much attention directed at less invasive methods such as the so-called "hybrid" or "debranching" procedure, or complete endovascular repair with fenestrated and branched endografts for repairing TAAAs. However, the gold standard for repair of TAAA remains open surgery, and this article summarizes the clinical outcomes of open surgical repair of TAAAs during the past decade (2000–2010) to provide a benchmark for comparison with results from previous decades and also with which to compare the results of modern-day hybrid and/or complete endovascular techniques.

Regarding specific circumstances for thoracic aortic dissection, more specifically with respect to patients with chronic aortic dissection, AATS/STS 2022 guidelines recommend to consider performing open surgical repair in patients with chronic type B aortic dissection with indications for intervention, unless comorbidities are prohibitive, or if anatomy is not suitable for TEVAR.

### Endovascular aortic arch repair: hopes and certainties [^112iDt9J]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

For aneurysms and dissections involving the aortic arch, the traditional treatment is open surgical repair requiring cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Reported mortality rates range from 7% to 17% and neurologic injury rates range from 4% to 12%. Since the first clinical applications of endovascular repair in the early 1990s, this less-invasive treatment modality has evolved steadily. For the treatment of aortic arch pathologies, combined open and endovascular strategies (hybrid procedures) have gained a widespread implementation. Evidence to date proves the feasibility of open surgical branch re-vascularisation followed by endovascular repair into the proximal arch. For hybrid procedures, mortality and stroke rates are given as 0–20%, and 0–8%, respectively. Alternative approaches using fenestrated and branched stent grafts have been considered. Although this technique is challenging and devices are not available widely, it is anticipated that this new technique will expand the range of aortic arch pathologies that can be treated by endovascular means.

Chronic aortic dissection is one of the most challenging pathologies faced by aortic surgeons. The variety of presentations and the multiple comorbidities of the patients make treatment and follow-up a subject of much debate. Historical data is difficult to interpret because of the heterogeneity of the included populations, and the common tendency of authors to pool outcomes of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair secondary to degenerative pathology or connective tissue disorder with those who have an underlying dissection. As the endovascular treatment of chronic aortic dissection becomes more commonplace with the increasing use of branched and fenestrated technology, it will be important to have an historical "gold standard" to use as a comparator. This narrative review of the literature describes the challenges to interpretation of data and the available information published about chronic aortic dissection.

### Contemporary management of acute aortic dissection [^115235UE]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

The development of endovascular techniques has introduced a new dimension to the management of acute aortic dissection. Conventional therapy has traditionally been relegated to patients who experience severe clinical sequelae; unfortunately, clinicians have not been able to accurately predict the clinical consequences of a dissection. However, recent attention to true and false lumen characteristics, the distal extent of the dissection, and branch vessel involvement has demonstrated that these independent predictors of outcome can serve as surrogate indications for endovascular or surgical treatment. We review the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with the sequelae of aortic dissection and summarize the treatment paradigms we have developed.

Acute type A aortic dissection — mesenteric malperfusion outcomes and strategies: Mesenteric malperfusion is one of the worst complications of acute type A aortic dissection, with an associated mortality rate of 63.2%. In IRAD, the nearly one-third of patients with mesenteric ischemia who were treated without intervention had an in-hospital mortality rate of 95%. An institution series of endovascular therapy first showed a low aortic repair operative mortality rate of 2.1%; however, only 58% of the cohort underwent open repair, with 24% dying from organ failure and 13% from aortic rupture. In IRAD, a surgical and hybrid strategy appears to have superior outcome to medical or endovascular therapy alone.

### Impact of centralized care on aortic dissection outcomes in the United States [^115dJFnT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past thirty years in the United States, hospitals have increasingly become incorporated into hospital systems, leading to organized care with more complex cases being managed at large urban-teaching hospitals. Over a similar period, changes in intervention guidelines for Aortic Dissection have occurred, with continually growing options for endovascular, minimally-invasive treatment. Given these dynamic changes, we examined trends in Aortic Dissection hospitalizations, intervention approaches, and hospital characteristics over past twenty-years to elucidate the effect of centralized care on outcomes.

Methods

We identified all patients presenting with aortic dissection, both ascending and descending, (ICD-9-CM: 441.0; ICD-10-CM: I71.0) in the NIS between 2000–2021. We then examined the utilization of open repair, endovascular and complex-endovascular repair, as well as nonoperative/medical management. Stratified by hospital setting (urban-teaching, urban-nonteaching, and rural), we analyzed trends of interventions and in-hospital mortality over time and compared them with unadjusted Wald test. If an operation was performed, we were able to discern between ascending/arch or descending aorta after the 2017 ICD revision.

Results

553,030 patients with aortic dissection were identified. The number of inpatients in the US with aortic dissections has increased, with an incidence of 26.7 cases/100k in 2000 to 47.2 cases/100k in 2020 (p < 0.01). Overall, including all hospital settings, aortic dissections were less frequently managed nonoperatively (2000–2021: 83%-71%) and more frequently managed endovascularly (Figure 1), with 85% of all descending and 16% of all ascending/arch aortic dissections undergoing TEVAR in 2021. Over time, aortic dissections have increasingly been managed at urban-teaching hospitals (2000–2021: 72%-92%; p < 0.01). Since 2016, urban-teaching hospitals more frequently intervened on aortic dissections compared to their rural counterparts (21% vs. 6%; p < 0.01), despite having similar rates of failed medical management (9.8% vs. 8.2%; p = 0.30). Finally, comparing the last 5-years, urban-teaching hospitals have lower mortality rates when managing aortic dissection versus their rural counterparts (10.9% vs 11.7%, OR = 1.10; p = 0.02) and if managed operatively, there was a lower associated risk of mortality at urban-teaching hospitals compared to urban-nonteaching hospitals (12.5% vs. 17.3%, OR = 1.46; p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Both aortic dissection hospitalizations and interventions have significantly increased over the past two decades in the US. The growth of large hospital systems and their absorption of smaller hospitals into integrated primary through quaternary care centers has resulted in an increase in "regionalization" of care, in which complex cases are transferred to larger urban teaching centers. Our analysis suggests there is a mortality benefit from the centralization of aortic care to tertiary/urban-teaching centers, though further research into this question is required.

### Aortic dissection [^111icaob]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition caused by a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta or bleeding within the aortic wall, resulting in the separation (dissection) of the layers of the aortic wall. Aortic dissection is most common in those 65–75 years of age, with an incidence of 35 cases per 100,000 people per year in this population. Other risk factors include hypertension, dyslipidaemia and genetic disorders that involve the connective tissue, such as Marfan syndrome. Swift diagnostic confirmation and adequate treatment are crucial in managing affected patients. Contemporary management is multidisciplinary and includes serial non-invasive imaging, biomarker testing and genetic risk profiling for aortopathy. The choice of approach for repairing or replacing the damaged region of the aorta depends on the severity and the location of the dissection and the risks of complication from surgery. Open surgical repair is most commonly used for dissections involving the ascending aorta and the aortic arch, whereas minimally invasive endovascular intervention is appropriate for descending aorta dissections that are complicated by rupture, malperfusion, ongoing pain, hypotension or imaging features of high risk. Recent advances in the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of aortic dissection have led to more patients being considered at substantial risk of complications and, therefore, in need of endovascular intervention rather than only medical or surgical intervention.

Discussion

Acute aortic dissection, a catastrophic condition with mortality rates escalating by 1% to 2% hourly without intervention, mandates urgent surgical management. Untreated, mortality exceeds 50% at 48 hours and 90% by 3 months, underscoring the imperative for timely repair. Although open surgical repair remains the gold standard for TAAD, controversies persist regarding the optimal extent of aortic resection. Conservative strategies (ascending/hemiarch replacement) prioritize operative safety, whereas aggressive approaches (total arch replacement + frozen elephant trunk) aim to mitigate distal aortic degeneration and reintervention risks. In China, total arch replacement with descending aortic stenting predominates, yet concerns endure over its technical complexity, CPB, and reliance on HCA — factors exacerbating perioperative morbidity, including visceral ischemia-reperfusion injury and transfusion-associated complications (mortality ∼25%).

Contemporary research prioritizes strategies to minimize surgical trauma and operative duration. Hybrid techniques, integrating open ascending repair with endovascular arch stabilization, have emerged to circumvent HCA and reduce systemic ischemic burden. Among these, hybrid type II protocols — avoiding circulatory arrest — demonstrate improved hemodynamic stability and lower visceral injury rates compared with conventional arch replacement. However, hybrid interventions demand dual expertise in open and endovascular techniques, necessitating meticulous procedural planning.

Parallel advancements in TEVAR now enable durable management of distal aortic pathologies. Although TEVAR is established for type B dissections, proximal extension to the aortic arch remains challenging due to anatomical constraints. Techniques such as branched/fenestrated SGs, chimney stents, and in situ fenestration have expanded endovascular options for arch involvement. However, isolated TEVAR is infeasible in TAAD due to inadequate proximal sealing zones. Thus, hybrid approaches — leveraging open ascending repair to create a stable platform for subsequent endovascular arch intervention — represent a critical innovation, balancing radical pathology correction with minimized invasiveness. This study evaluates a novel single-stage hybrid protocol combining open ascending replacement with total arch endovascular repair using intraoperatively modified fenestrated SGs, offering a tailored solution for patients with high-risk TAAD.

Evidence limitations — overall, the lack of high-quality data from randomized clinical trials limits the ability to make strong evidenced-based recommendations in several high-priority areas, including the optimal timing for intervention on TBAD patients with high-risk features or the routine use of TEVAR in uncomplicated TBAD to prevent long-term aortic-related complications and death, and several recommendations have been based on nonrandomized data or expert consensus.

### Thoracic aortic dissection: long-term results of endovascular and open repair [^116kB2SP]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment paradigms for aortic dissection are based upon the types of complications with which the patients present. For acute uncomplicated dissection, medical therapy is preferred. Endovascular repair is preferred for patients with acute distal dissection complicated by end-organ malperfusion, rupture, or aneurysmal degeneration. For patients with chronic dissection with aneurysm, open repair is preferred if safe, and endovascular treatment should be limited to highest-risk patients because of the uncertainty of success with this approach. For intermediate-risk patients, hybrid repairs provide a good alternative. Ultimately, improvement in long-term outcomes after treatment of aortic dissection still depends on prevention of end-organ ischemia and aneurysmal degeneration of the chronically dissected distal aorta. Although the evidence base for the roles of various approaches is lacking, data currently being accrued and must be closely analyzed to better estimate both the short- and long-term benefits of these complementary treatment strategies.

### Debate: whether level I evidence comparing thoracic endovascular repair and medical management is necessary for uncomplicated type B aortic dissections [^111NWPPT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Type B aortic dissections continue to be one of the most challenging clinical scenarios confronting vascular surgeons. In the era of open surgery, the therapeutic options were limited to medical management of hypertension and large open thoracoabdominal operations. In the current endovascular era, the operative strategies have become less invasive but the questions regarding therapeutic approaches have become more numerous and complex. In patients with acute uncomplicated type B aortic dissections, we are still unsure as to which patients are best treated with medical therapy alone or with the addition of early endovascular repair. Data from single centers and registries have provided some guidance; however, questions remain. Perhaps level 1 evidence from well-designed randomized controlled trials will answer all of our questions. This is the topic of the current debate.

Non-A non-B aortic dissection — observational outcomes and evolving management are detailed with registry and series data. The largest worldwide registry reported 19% undergoing open arch replacement with a mortality of 31% and 25% receiving an endovascular approach with a mortality of 14.3%, and this was similar to a 13.9% mortality with medical management in the majority (> 50%) of patients, with stroke the most frequent complication. More recent experience in 39 patients over 20 years using a hybrid endovascular approach was associated with 27% overall mortality, while a report from China with 79 patients over 10 years of open surgical arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk (FET) showed an operative mortality of 5.1%, severe neurologic events in 6.3%, and a 1-year survival of 82.3%. Reflecting variability in results, there is currently no consensus regarding the best management of acute or subacute non-A non-B aortic dissection; simplified and less traumatic hybrid surgical/endovascular approaches are emerging and may have an edge over complex and complete arch replacement strategies.

### Contemporary outcomes of open repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm in young patients [^115Ai5HS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Pathology remains an important consideration for choice of aneurysm repair. Open surgery is recommended in patients with connective tissue disease such as Marfan syndrome due to the unproved short and long term results with endovascular stent grafts. A recent consensus stated stent grafting in patients with Marfan syndrome or any other known connective tissue disorder is not recommended as there is limited information regarding the impact of persistent radial forces of a stent graft in the abnormal and weak aorta.

For the foreseeable future, it is likely that due to the various regulatory and device constraints associated with total endovascular repair, coupled with the absence of long-term outcome data, open TAAA repair will continue to be the gold standard treatment for thoracoabdominal aneurysms, especially in the younger population. Total endovascular repair is more attractive than hybrid repair and probably represents the future in patients unfit for open TAAA surgery. Open surgical repair has long-term outcome data, confers a lasting durable result and leads to good functional outcomes, which are all particularly important considerations in younger patients.

There are however limitations to consider with open surgical repair. Due to long-term durability, open repair has traditionally been offered to patients with a moderate life expectancy, and whilst replacement of the aneurysmal aortic segment with a synthetic graft has been the mainstay of treatment for over 40 years, the major disadvantage of open repair has been an associated increased 30-day mortality rate -, and an increased length of hospital stay and rehabilitation over endovascular repair. Other disadvantages include patch aneurysm formation in the long term. Whilst our 30 day mortality and hospital stay compare to other centres, one limitation of this study is we do not have data to look at long term outcomes for complications such as graft failure, patch aneurysm formation, and patency.

### Management of type B aortic dissections: treatment of acute dissections and acute complications from chronic dissections [^113efQdC]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Aortic dissection is one of the most catastrophic vascular challenges faced by interventionalists, often misdiagnosed and frequently associated with devastating consequences. Stanford type B aortic dissections affects the descending thoracic aorta without any involvement of the ascending aorta. Dissections associated with refractory pain, rapid aneurysm formation, malperfusion syndromes, rupture, or impending rupture are categorized as complicated and distinct from initially uncomplicated type B dissections without the aforementioned complications. Traditionally, uncomplicated type B dissection is managed medically whereas complicated type B dissection requires intervention to limit mortality. Over the last two decades, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has emerged as an alternative to open surgical repair for treatment of complicated type B dissection. Various societal guidelines now unanimously propose TEVAR as the treatment of choice for management of complicated disease based on its relatively low morbidity and mortality compared to open surgical outcomes. As the consensually acknowledged standard of care for management of patients with complicated lesions, TEVAR is currently being considered for select patients with initially uncomplicated dissection to mitigate the risks of mid and late-term disease progression and aortic-related mortality. This article describes the decision-making treatment algorithm for management of type B aortic dissection. It also provides a comprehensive review of the indications and procedural recommendations for performing TEVAR based on current evidence in the literature. Additionally, the article guides the readers through step-by-step practical considerations, from choosing the optimal graft to insuring its ideal deployment in type B dissection, as well as providing advice on how to handle a variety of procedure-related complications.

### EACTS / STS guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute and chronic syndromes of the aortic organ [^114beyv1]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

EACTS/STS guidelines — aortic arch nomenclature and acute aortic dissection classification are standardized as follows: total aortic arch replacement (TAR) is defined as replacing the entire arch or excluding it from the circulation using the frozen elephant trunk (FET) "from the innominate artery to a point beyond the left subclavian artery (LSA)", and, to harmonize reporting, "defining TAR as replacing (or excluding from circulation) aortic zones 0–2 (or beyond) seems reasonable"; all other arch procedures "should be named partial arch replacement". Reporting terminology includes using "zones 0–4" for aortic arch surgery, defining the chronic distal dissected state as "residual dissection after type A repair", using "parallel grafts" to refer to chimneys, snorkels and periscopes, and describing a "hybrid approach" as a combination of open vascular surgery and endovascular procedure performed simultaneously or on a sequential basis to treat AD. For acute aortic dissections, "the location of the primary entry tear and the extent of the aortic wall dissection… determine both the pathoanatomical classification and essentially the treatment strategy", with "Figure 2: Type classification of aortic dissections" illustrating the schema.

### Long-term outcomes of open vs endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair… [^113LDNiz]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

After propensity score matching, there were 2852 patients in each group. Open repair was associated with significantly lower 6-year mortality compared with endovascular repair. Open repair, compared with endovascular repair, also was associated with significantly lower rates of 6-year rupture and reintervention. These findings suggest that overall mortality after elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was higher with endovascular repair than open repair despite reduced 30-day mortality and perioperative morbidity after endovascular repair. Endovascular repair additionally was associated with significantly higher rates of long-term rupture and reintervention.

These findings emphasize the importance of careful patient selection and long-term follow-up surveillance for patients who undergo endovascular repair. In this cohort study using the Medicare-matched VQI-VISION database, we found significant disparities in long-term outcomes of patients who underwent OAR vs EVAR for first-time elective AAA repair. At 6 years, OAR was associated with significant advantages compared with EVAR, including associations with a 17% reduction in the risk of mortality, a 24% reduction in the risk of rupture, and a 33% reduction in the risk of reintervention. We additionally performed a sensitivity analysis excluding patients who underwent EVAR who were not candidates for OAR. Although there was no difference in 6-year survival, 1-year survival, or 1- to 2-year survival, OAR remained associated with greater overall survival after 2 years, as well as lower risk of rupture or reintervention over 6 years.

These findings suggest that although EVAR remains a valuable option in patients ineligible for OAR, as demonstrated in the EVAR-2 trial, 33 careful weighing of risks and benefits is warranted in patients who are candidates for either repair modality.

### Identification of patient-derived outcomes after aortic aneurysm repair [^112fXsEu]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Relatively few outcomes have been examined in randomized comparisons of endovascular and open aortic aneurysm repair, and no patient input was obtained in the selection of these outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify patient-derived, potentially novel outcomes that may be used to guide future clinical trials in aneurysm surgery.

Methods

Focus group interviews were conducted with patients who had undergone endovascular or open aortic aneurysm repair. The discussions were transcribed and the transcript was analyzed by two indexers using constant-comparison analysis and grounded theory to identify potentially novel, patient-derived outcomes. Other potential themes relating to the patients' experience and their decision-making were also sought.

Results

Six focus groups were conducted (three with endovascular aneurysm repair patients and three with open aortic aneurysm repair patients), with a median of six participants, 2 to 12 months from surgery. Functional outcomes were most commonly mentioned and emphasized by patients. Recovery time and energy level were most frequently verbalized as important in the decision-making process between endovascular and open aneurysm repair. Other potential outcomes identified as important to patients included postoperative pain, time to walking normally, loss of appetite, extent and location of incisions, impact on cognition, being able to go home after surgery, and impact on caregivers. In addition to these outcomes, we identified three themes relating to the patient's experience: undervaluing or underappreciating the risk of death during surgery, differing informational needs and level of involvement in decision-making, and unrealistic patient expectations about the risks of and recovery after the procedure.

Conclusions

Functional outcomes emerged as most important during qualitative analysis of patients' experiences with aneurysm repair. Perceived differences in recovery time were identified as an important consideration for aneurysm patients in deciding between open and endovascular repair. More work needs to be done clarifying the concept of recovery and other related functional outcomes for the development of methods to assess and to evaluate these in prospective clinical trials.

Introduction

Despite recent developments in surgical and endovascular techniques, there is still no consensus regarding the most optimal protocol to manage different types of aortic dissections. In general current practice, the DISSECT criteria guide physicians in the treatment decision process based on 6 critical characteristics of dissections. In type B aortic dissections (TBAD), acute dissections are defined as within 14 days of the onset of symptoms, subacute between 2 weeks and 3 months, and chronic after 3 months. Complicated TBAD refer to the presence of rupture and/or hypotension or shock, periaortic hematoma, rapid aortic expansion, renovisceral ischemia, lower limb malperfusion, paraplegia, paraparesis, recurrent or refractory pain, and refractory hypertension despite adequate medical therapy.

The first step in the treatment of uncomplicated acute TBAD is medical therapy to reduce blood pressure, heart rate, and pain. Although conservative therapy is preferred in many countries, this approach often fails to prevent aortic rupture, leading to death in 20% of patients. Up to 40% of the surviving patients suffer from progressive aneurysm formation. The conventional open surgical approach is associated with a high rate of complications and mortality, especially in complicated acute TBAD with involvement of the visceral branches. Therefore, in these complicated acute cases, thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) is increasingly performed.

In subacute and chronic TBAD (CTBAD), which includes residual TBAD after type A dissection repair, up to 50% of patients may suffer aorta-related complications such as false lumen (FL) or aneurysm enlargement or rupture and retrograde dissection. Again, the primary goal of treatment is reduction of blood pressure, combined with statin use, antiplatelet therapy, and smoking cessation. If imaging shows rupture, dissection progression, or malperfusion in CTABD, emergency repair should be considered. Also, thoracic aortic diameters > 60 mm should be considered an indication for elective surgery.

As proposed for acute TBAD, endovascular repair and hybrid approaches provide alternatives to open surgery in subacute and CTABD cases. However, the frequency of imaging surveillance, the incidence of primary endoleaks, incomplete coverage of distally dissected segments, reintervention rates, and mortality leave room for improvement. Furthermore, long-term follow-up is lacking, and fenestrated/branched endovascular repair is limited by the high treatment costs and the need for time-consuming personalized device manufacturing, thereby excluding use in emergency situations.

### Hybrid repair versus conventional open repair for aortic arch dissection [^115yMieU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A dissection of the aorta is a separation or tear of the intima from the media. This tear allows blood to flow not only through the original aortic flow channel (known as the true lumen), but also through a second channel between the intima and media (known as the false lumen). Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition which can be rapidly fatal. There is debate on the optimal surgical approach for aortic arch dissection. People with ascending aortic dissection have poor rates of survival. Currently open surgical repair is regarded as the standard treatment for aortic arch dissection. We intend to review the role of hybrid and open repair in aortic arch dissection.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of a hybrid technique of treatment over conventional open repair in the management of aortic arch dissection.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and AMED databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 8 February 2021. We also undertook reference checking for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs), which compared the effects of hybrid repair techniques versus open surgical repair of aortic arch dissection. Outcomes of interest were dissection-related mortality and all-cause mortality, neurological deficit, cardiac injury, respiratory compromise, renal ischaemia, false lumen thrombosis (defined by partial or complete thrombosis) and mesenteric ischaemia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all records identified by the literature searches to identify those that met our inclusion criteria. We planned to undertake data collection and analysis in accordance with recommendations described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We planned to assess the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified one ongoing study and two unpublished studies that met the inclusion criteria for the review. Due to a lack of study data, we could not compare the outcomes of hybrid repair to conventional open repair for aortic arch dissection.

Authors' Conclusions

This review revealed one ongoing RCT and two unpublished RCTs evaluating hybrid versus conventional open repair for aortic arch surgery. Observational data suggest that hybrid repair for aortic arch dissection could potentially be favourable, but conclusions can not be drawn from these studies, which are highly selective, and are based on the clinical status of the patient, the presence of comorbidities and the skills of the operators. However, a conclusion about its definitive benefit over conventional open surgical repair cannot be made from this review without published RCTs or CCTs. Future RCTs or CCTs need to have adequate sample sizes and follow-up, and assess clinically-relevant outcomes, in order to determine the optimal treatment for people with aortic arch dissection. It must be noted that this may not be feasible, due to the reasons mentioned.

In the present report, we have described the outcomes of endovascular repair, hybrid arch repair, and open surgical repair for type B dissection involving the aortic arch (B 1–2, D).

Methods

Cases of endovascular repair, hybrid arch repair, and open surgical repair performed between January 2015 and December 2019 for aortic dissection designated as B 1–2, D by the Society for Vascular Surgery/Society of Thoracic Surgeons classification were retrospectively analyzed. The primary end point was all-cause mortality at follow-up. The secondary end points included early mortality, early morbidities, and aortic-related late events. Kaplan-Meier curves were created to analyze survival from all-cause mortality and freedom from aortic-related late events in the endovascular, hybrid, and open groups. Propensity score matching and stratification (stratified by proximal dissection extension: B 1, D and B 2, D) were performed as sensitivity analyses to compare the outcomes among the three treatment patterns after controlling for major confounders.

Results

The present study included 151 patients (men, 79.5%; mean age, 47.3 ± 10.5 years), with 72 (47.7%) in the endovascular group, 46 (30.5%) in the hybrid group, and 33 (21.8%) in the open group. No significant difference was noted in early mortality between the endovascular, hybrid, and open groups (1.4% vs 2.2% vs 3.0%; p = 0.791). The incidence of early endoleak was significantly greater (33.3% vs 13.0% vs 6.1%; p = 0.002) and the incidence of renal function deterioration was less (4.2% vs 26.1% vs 24.2%; p = 0.001) after endovascular repair vs hybrid arch repair and open surgery. After a median follow-up of 40.0 months (range, 0–84.0 months), no significant differences were found in all-cause mortality (5.6% vs 4.3% vs 3.0%; P = 1.0), aortic-related late events (16.7% vs 15.2% vs 12.1%; p = 0.834), or late endoleak (9.7% vs 4.3% vs 6.1%; p = 0.630) after endovascular, hybrid, and open surgery. The propensity score matching and stratification analyses displayed consistent outcomes for early mortality, all-cause mortality, and aortic-related late events among the three groups.

Conclusions

The mid- to long-term outcomes after endovascular repair, hybrid arch repair, and open surgical repair for type B dissection involving the aortic arch (B 1–2, D) were favorable and comparable in selected patients. Extensive experience and multidisciplinary teamwork are prerequisites for individualized strategies for repair of B 1–2, D.

### The decision-making process in acute type A aortic dissection: when to replace the aortic arch [^1136LMGe]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The decision-making process is crucial for the surgery of acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD). Often surgeons have to face different challenges, taking prompt decisions in emergency setting, during the pre- and intraoperative phase. Choosing if operate or not a patients with AAAD as well as the management of the dissected aortic arch can be challenging. Different factors need to be evaluated as: the patients age, the presence of organ malperfusion, the intimal tear location, and last but not least the surgeon personal experience in aortic surgery. During the last decade, different milestone steps have been achieved in aortic surgery as the antegrade perfusion of the aorta through different cannulation sites, open distal repair, antegrade selective cerebral perfusion, and systematic resection of the proximal intimal tear, allowing complex repair for dedicated team as well as simpler repair for not dedicated surgeons. We reviewed different scenarios and techniques used for the aortic arch replacement in patients with AAAD, taking into consideration that the aim of surgery is to save patients life.

Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers (PAUs) — long-term management and surveillance include imaging recommendations and observed outcomes: In patients with a PAU who have undergone aortic repair, surveillance imaging at intervals appropriate for the repair approach and location is reasonable (COR 2a; LOE C-LD). In patients with a PAU that is being managed medically, surveillance imaging with a CT is reasonable at 1 month after the diagnosis and, if stable, every 6 months for 2 years, and then at appropriate intervals thereafter. After repair of a PAU, clinical failure by 1 year after endovascular and open repair occur in 8.6% and 8.7%, respectively; risk of clinical failure by 12 months postoperatively is 9%, and freedom from cumulative complications and interventions is 86% at 12 months, 79% at 24 months, and 71% at 36 months. Nonoperative management carries significant risk: disease progression is > 15% in both symptomatic and asymptomatic presentations; among those with progression on surveillance imaging, 73% show continued worsening and 46% progress to frank dissection after a mean of 12 months. Additional data note new PAUs in approximately 5% after 18 months of follow-up, an aortic-related adverse event rate of 28% by 30 days in a 109-patient series, and radiographic disease progression in 30% of 184 patients on midterm follow-up.

### Survival after endovascular vs open aortic aneurysm repairs… [^1121UqMY]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

A total of 23 670 patients were included in the study, for a median follow-up of 3. 3 years. Endovascular repair was done in 51. 7% of patients. Patient demographic data for the study cohort, as well as unadjusted comparisons between open and EVAR repair patients, are presented in Table 1. Endovascular repair patients were significantly older, less likely to be white, more likely to be men, more likely to have scheduled admissions, and more likely to present to teaching-status hospitals. Open repair patients also had higher rates of wound dehiscence, a slightly lower rate of surgical site infections, similar rates of pneumonia, and slightly higher rates of sepsis at 30 days. Beyond 30 days, EVAR repair patients had lower all-cause mortality until year 3, beyond which EVAR repair patients had higher all-cause mortality rates.

Endovascular repair patients consistently had higher rates of reintervention, as early as 6 months after the operation, while open repair patients consistently had higher rates of incisional hernia repair. Reintervention data are presented in Figure 3A. Reintervention curves are significantly different throughout the entire study for EVAR repair patients, reaching 10% at year 7. Rates of AAA ruptures are presented in Figure 3B. A total of 38% of all patients who had a repeat AAA repair underwent an open re-repair. Of the patients who originally had EVAR repair, 31% required an open intervention subsequently compared with 62% of patients who originally had an open repair. As expected, we found 30-day mortality to be higher for OAR than EVAR repair in California patients, agreeing with the randomized trials' results.

Our analyses of a California statewide public health database showed a survival advantage until 3 years postoperatively for all patients undergoing AAA repair by an endovascular technique. After 3 years, the mortality rate of EVAR repair patients was higher; however, these mortality differences did not reach statistical significance on adjusted analysis over the entire study. The 30-day mortality in this real-world scenario was only slightly higher for EVAR repair than that reported in the clinical trials. Reintervention was higher from 6 months through 5 years in EVAR repair patients, which reflects the trends in management of endoleaks and technology available during the study.

Aortic arch repair — elephant trunk and hybrid/endovascular strategies: The elephant trunk procedure extends the aortic arch graft into the proximal descending aorta to facilitate subsequent descending thoracic aorta repair by open repair or thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), and either a traditional elephant trunk or a frozen elephant trunk can be used. With adjunctive procedures the distal anastomosis can be moved more proximally into aortic zones 2 or 3 while still proceeding with an elephant trunk, though data are limited on the benefits of moving the anastomotic site; a qualifying factor for considering open versus frozen elephant trunk is whether the primary distal seal will be achievable, and in the absence of a distal seal, the conventional approach would provide the same considerations for the second-stage procedure. In high-risk patients using hybrid or endovascular techniques, the Next-gen Fenestrated TEVAR trial placed most endografts in zones 0 or 1, a landing zone of < 15 mm was associated with an increased risk of a type 1 endoleak, midterm follow-up showed 5-year survival of 71% with aneurysm-related event-free survival of 77%, and the most frequent reason for reoperation was type Ia endoleak (5%); nonrandomized comparisons of open versus hybrid endovascular approaches have not shown significant differences in outcomes.

### Endovascular repair of type A aortic dissection: current experience and technical considerations [^111ZR6RZ]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Dissection of the ascending aorta, type A aortic dissection (TAAD), represents a surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Current open surgical techniques, although state-of-the-art procedures and having improved outcomes for patients with TAAD over the last decades, confer significant risk of complications and death. Recently, endovascular techniques for repair of both the abdominal and thoracic aorta have gained acceptance within the vascular and cardiovascular surgical communities as a useful tool in select pathologies and patient populations. As development of endovascular technology proceeds ever closer to the aortic valve, thoracic endovascular repair for TAAD deserves special investigation. A comprehensive literature search for studies reporting outcomes of endovascular repair in the ascending aorta was performed. In this review, we compile the worldwide experience of thoracic endovascular repair for TAAD as well as imaging studies for patient selection and the use of hybrid (open plus endovascular) techniques. The authors discuss the remaining challenges that preclude its broader adoption in this role, namely patient selection and device specificity.

### Outcomes following emergent open repair for thoracic aortic dissection are improved at higher volume centers in direct admissions and transfers [^113SAh3g]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations

There are several limitations to this analysis. Firstly, the NIS is an administrative database and does not contain detailed patient characteristics or operative variables that may influence outcomes. Specifically, as previously stated, aortic aneurysms with rupture and complicated Type B aortic dissections cannot be excluded from the analysis. Secondly, the categorization of low, intermediate, and high volume centers was based on breakpoints in the distribution of annual center volume, as there are currently no guidelines defining what constitutes a low versus high volume center. Thirdly, APR-DRG severity scores cannot be compared to clinical risk stratification scores such as the STS score, as they are not calculated preoperatively; rather, they are based on ICD-9 billing codes generated after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, APR-DRG has become a preferred method for assessing severity of illness in the analysis of administrative data. Finally, although other studies have shown that surgeon-specific volume often drives the volume-outcomes relationship at an institutional level, the NIS does not contain data on surgeon-specific volume. This analysis is, therefore, not able to determine whether institutional experience, surgeon experience, or both explain the lower mortality at high volume centers. Our analysis only focused on open aortic aneurysm repairs and therefore its results are not applicable to newly emerged endovascular and hybrid approaches for treatment of aortic dissections.

### Aortic dissections: new perspectives and treatment paradigms [^117EUMaY]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Aortic dissection is a complex manifestation of disease of the arterial wall. The severity and consequences of a dissection are related to the physical characteristics and anatomic location of the tear as well as the underlying patient physiology. Despite in vitro and in vivo modeling advances, our understanding of the pathophysiology has been limited to evaluations of the success and failure of various treatment modalities. The indications for intervention have historically included rupture, intractable pain or hypertension, distal ischemia and degeneration of the aortic wall causing aneurysm formation. The management decisions for patients with dissections are dependent upon the abnormal anatomy, the acuity of the patient presentation, and physiology. Despite the availability of open surgery as a therapeutic option, acute dissections with evidence of ischemia are now handled using an endovascular approach that is specifically directed at the cause of the ischemia. Endovascular treatments include the placement of a stentgraft into the proximal aorta, branch vessel stenting, uncovered stent placement in the abdominal aorta, and aortic fenestrations. Chronic dissections, in contrast, are still most frequently managed with open surgical techniques. However, a subset of patients that are not candidates for traditional surgical repair of the thoracoabdominal aorta may be managed with a combined open mesenteric revascularization with subsequent endovascular grafting of the thoracoabdominal aorta.

Aortic arch aneurysms — recommendations and classes are as follows: COR 1, LOE C-EO: In patients with an aortic arch aneurysm who have symptoms attributable to the aneurysm and are at low or intermediate operative risk, open surgical replacement is recommended. COR 2a, LOE B-NR: In patients with an isolated aortic arch aneurysm who are asymptomatic and have a low operative risk, open surgical replacement at an arch diameter of ≥ 5.5 cm is reasonable. COR 2a, LOE C-LD: In patients undergoing open surgical repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm, if the aneurysmal disease extends into the proximal aortic arch, it is reasonable to extend the repair with a hemiarch replacement. COR 2b, LOE C-LD: In patients undergoing open surgical repair of an aortic arch aneurysm, if the aneurysmal disease extends into the proximal descending thoracic aorta, an elephant trunk procedure may be considered. COR 2b, LOE C-EO: In patients with an aortic arch aneurysm who are asymptomatic but meet criteria for intervention, but have a high risk from open surgical repair, a hybrid or endovascular approach may be reasonable.

Acute type B aortic dissection — synopsis notes that although acute complicated type B aortic dissection historically has been treated with open repair, endovascular therapy has largely supplanted open repair given lower morbidity and mortality rates, and the introduction of endovascular techniques has resulted in significantly lower morbidity and mortality rates when compared with optimal medical management in small randomized trials. Optimal medical management was associated with a 30-day mortality rate of 10% and midterm mortality rate of approximately 30%, and to date there has not been a large RCT comparing open versus endovascular repair for either complicated or uncomplicated type B aortic dissection.

Acute type B aortic dissection — management recommendations state that in all patients with uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissection, medical therapy is recommended as the initial management strategy. In patients with acute type B aortic dissection and rupture or other complications, intervention is recommended; in patients with rupture and suitable anatomy, endovascular stent grafting, rather than open surgical repair, is recommended, and in patients with other complications and suitable anatomy, the use of endovascular approaches, rather than open surgical repair, is reasonable. In patients with uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissection who have high-risk anatomic features, endovascular management may be considered.

### Open or endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm-would a decision aid help? [^111rKdcJ]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

In this issue of JAMA Surgery, Eid et al1 presented a randomized clinical study aimed to determine if a preconsultation-administered decision aid would affect a patient's choice between open or endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Their results showed that patients exposed to a decision aid were more likely to receive the repair they preferred. Interestingly, almost 45% of patients did not know their preference before the aid was administered, and 24% remained unsure afterward. All patients, irrespective of whether a decision aid was administered, were able to reach a decision after they consulted with a vascular surgeon. As expected, the majority of patients preferred EVAR over open repair. Very few patients who chose EVAR ultimately selected open repair, whereas more patients who chose open repair in the control group ultimately selected EVAR. Cheng SWK.

### Comparative outcomes of open, hybrid, and fenestrated branched endovascular repair of extent II and III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms [^116p4XfP]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Open repair of extent II and III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) is associated with substantial morbidity. Alternative strategies, such as hybrid operations combining proximal thoracic endovascular aortic repair with either staged open distal TAAA repair or visceral debranching (hybrid), as well as fenestrated/branched endografts (FEVAR), have been increasingly reported; however, benefits of these approaches compared with direct open surgery remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes of these three different strategies in the management of extent II/III TAAA.

Methods

All extent II/III TAAA repairs (2002–2018) for nonmycotic, degenerative aneurysm or chronic dissection at a single institution were reviewed. The primary end point was 30-day mortality. Secondary end points included incidence of spinal cord ischemia (SCI), complications, unplanned re-operation, 90-day readmission, and out-of-hospital survival. To mitigate impact of covariate imbalance and selection bias, intergroup comparisons were made using inverse probability weighted-propensity analysis. Cox regression was used to estimate survival while cumulative incidence was used to determine reoperation risk.

Results

One hundred ninety-eight patients (FEVAR, 92; hybrid, 40; open, 66) underwent repair. In unadjusted analysis, compared with hybrid/open patients, FEVAR patients were significantly older with more cardiovascular risk factors, but less likely to have a connective tissue disorder or dissection-related indication. Unadjusted 30-day mortality and complication rates were: 30-day mortality, FEVAR 4%, hybrid 13%, open 12% (P = 0.01); and complications, FEVAR 36%, hybrid 33%, open 50% (P = 0.11). Permanent SCI was not different among groups (FEVAR 3%, hybrid 3%, open 6%; p = 0.64). In adjusted analysis, 30-day mortality risk was greater for open vs FEVAR (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–9.2; p = 0.01) with no difference for hybrid vs open/FEVAR. There was significantly lower risk of any SCI for open vs FEVAR (hazard ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.96; p = 0.04); however, no difference in risk of permanent SCI was detected among the three groups. There was no difference in complications or unplanned reoperation, but open patients had the greatest risk of unplanned 90-day readmission. There was a time-varying effect on survival probability, with open repair having a significant survival disadvantage in the first 1 to 6 months after the procedure compared with hybrid/FEVAR patients (Cox model P = 0.03), but no difference in survival at 1 and 5 years (1- and 5-year survival: FEVAR, 86 ± 3%, 55 ± 8%; hybrid, 86 ± 5%, 60 ± 11%; open 69 ± 7%, 59 ± 8%; Cox-model P = 0.10).

Conclusions

Extent II/III TAAA repair, regardless of operative strategy, is associated with significant morbidity risk. FEVAR is associated with the lowest 30-day mortality risk compared with hybrid and open repair when estimates are adjusted for preoperative risk factors. These data support greater adoption of FEVAR as first-line therapy to treat complex TAAA disease in anatomically suitable patients who present electively.

### Descending thoracic aortic dissections [^111bpTEo]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Type B dissection has traditionally been managed medically if uncomplicated and surgically if associated with complications. This practice has resulted in most centers reporting significant morbidity and mortality if open repair is required. In the setting of malperfusion, operative repair has been conjoined with fenestration or visceral stenting to improve outcomes. Endovascular stent grafts seem to offer an attractive alternative in the acute complicated type B dissection, with reduced mortality and morbidity, particularly paralysis, compared with open repair. It is reasonable to consider endovascular stent grafts as another tool in managing dissection, but to recognize that open surgical repair still plays an important role, and that the data that define indications and outcomes are still emerging.

### Management of acute type B aortic dissection [^113N5N9i]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Acute type B aortic dissection (identified within 2 weeks of symptom onset), as described using the Stanford classification, involves the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery and accounts for 25%-40% of all aortic dissections. The traditional treatment paradigm of medical management for uncomplicated acute type B dissection and open surgical intervention for early or late complications of type B dissection is currently undergoing a period of evolution as a result of the influence of minimally invasive thoracic endovascular aortic repair options. Thoracic endovascular repair has replaced open surgical repair as the preferred treatment for complicated acute type B dissection, and may also prove beneficial for prophylactic repair of uncomplicated acute type B dissection for high-risk patients. This review discusses the management of acute type B aortic dissection and long-term treatment considerations.

### Effect of a decision aid on agreement between patient preferences and repair type for abdominal aortic aneurysm… [^1157cKMp]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Preferences for Open Versus Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Study Team Data Sharing Statement AAA indicates abdominal aortic aneurysm; EVAR, endovascular repair; OSR, open surgical repair. EVAR indicates endovascular repair. Question Can a decision aid help patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm choose between open repair and endovascular repair. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03115346 Randomized trials and observational studies have shown that endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair offers lower perioperative morbidity and mortality compared with open surgical repair. 1–5 However, with this benefit comes trade-offs, as the risk of reintervention and late aneurysm-related death is higher with EVAR than open repair. 6–8 This trade-off makes it difficult to find which AAA repair type is best for each individual patient.

7, 9 Helping patients make the best decision for aortic aneurysm repair has been challenging, as patients often have little knowledge about the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
9. Interventionalists need to provide a balanced discussion of risks, benefits, and options when discussing competing invasive treatment options. At this point, a larger proportion of patients in the decision aid group now reported a preference for open repair, while preference for EVAR was similar between groups. After surgeon consultation, similar proportions of patients preferred EVAR in both groups.

In both the decision aid and control groups, approximately one-fifth preferred open repair. Most patients in our study preferred EVAR, which aligns with prior studies evaluating patient preferences for less-invasive AAA repair. 25, 35, 36 However, our study also emphasizes that roughly 20% of patients will prefer open repair compared with EVAR. These findings have important implications for surgical quality assessment and surgical training paradigms. While uncommon, open repair is likely to remain a necessary aspect of AAA care.

Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) mesenteric malperfusion — epidemiology, outcomes, and strategy: Only 60% of patients present with abdominal pain, and multicenter studies have suggested that mortality increases with an increasing number of affected vascular beds. In the IRAD cohort, mesenteric malperfusion was detected in 68 (4%) of 1809 patients with ATAAD and mortality in this group was 63%. Because of poor outcomes with traditional strategies, alternative approaches have been described that restore end organ perfusion before proximal aortic repair, and a hybrid strategy allows treatment of mesenteric malperfusion and proximal aortic repair at the same setting. Operative mortality is reported at 25% to 42% after combined open and endovascular treatment. Improving outcomes for this high-risk cohort requires rapid diagnosis and reversal of ischemia while minimizing the risk of aortic rupture.

The past 4 decades have witnessed tremendous strides in the evolution of endovascular technology with increased operator experience, greater availability of more sophisticated and versatile endovascular devices, and advances in imaging modalities. In an attempt to limit the physiologic derangements associated with aortic crossclamping and extensive tissue dissection during traditional open surgical repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, less invasive strategies have been explored using endovascular technology: hybrid approaches and solely endovascular techniques. This article describes these techniques and their advantages, their current role in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair and potential future developments in this field.

### Hybrid two-stage repair of stanford A dissection with visceral or peripheral malperfusion [^112uxGQ3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Stanford A aortic dissection is an acute condition characterized by the disruption of the thoracic aortic media layer caused by intramural bleeding separating the aortic wall layers; it leads to the formation of true and false lumen with or without communication. Open surgery (total arch replacement combined with elephant trunk stent implantation) is routinely applied in most cardiac centers. However, it is only the first step aiming to avoid lethal complications. Small true lumen in distal descending aorta leading to malperfusion is a potential risk factor for poor long-term prognosis.

The malperfusion syndrome can affect different vascular beds depending upon the exact location of the aortic tear: spinal cord, visceral, renal, and lower extremities. It is found in 20–40% of patients with Stanford A aortic dissection. Nearly 20% of these individuals require additional revascularization. The malperfusion syndrome may be complicated by a wide variety of symptoms. Nevertheless, early diagnosis is important in avoiding damage to organs and the subsequent inflammatory cascade that can affect the treatment success and patient prognosis.

The hybrid procedure uses thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) of distal descending aorta. Type III hybrid aortic repair, which encompasses total arch replacement with the descending elephant trunk, combined with second stage TEVAR, is indicated for acute aortic dissection with malperfusion or rupture. Studies on second stage repair of distal residual aorta have prompted surgeons to seek the optimal time and location for performing TEVAR and avoiding complications. Therefore, the present retrospective study aimed to describe our experience and evaluate the effectiveness of Type III hybrid aortic repair at the distal aorta of acute Stanford type A aortic dissection with malperfusion.

### Treatment of the chronic type B aortic dissection: the pro-endovascular argument [^114asGDW]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Although thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the standard of care in acute complicated type B dissections, its role in chronic type B dissections remains controversial. This controversy stems from anatomical differences between acute and chronic dissections, such as a thicker intimal clap and improved results in descending aortic replacement. However, despite these important differences, there has been accumulating evidence on the safety and efficacy of TEVAR in chronic type B aortic dissections, especially when considering the alternative of open surgical repair, which is associated with significantly higher morbidity and in many hands also higher mortality. Herein, we discuss the evidence in the literature highlighting TEVAR's safety and efficacy in this setting.

### Lessons learned in adopting endovascular techniques for treating abdominal aortic aneurysm… [^1136q6p2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The present study includes all patients undergoing endovascular exclusion of abdominal aortic or common iliac aneurysms at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Two specific time periods are represented. The first extended from September 1997 to June 1998, during which the institution participated in the prospective comparison between open aneurysm repair and endovascular aneurysm exclusion using the previously available Vanguard system. The Medical College of Wisconsin serves as a tertiary referral center for southeastern Wisconsin. A considerable number of surgeons in the surrounding communities routinely perform open aneurysm repair. Most of the patients seen in the referral center had already been prescreened for open aneurysm repair.

At present with younger, good-risk patients, we recommend open operation, reserving the use of endovascular exclusion for patients with serious cardiopulmonary or additional comorbid disease. However, owing to the tremendous amount of information available to the general public, there are patients who demand the endovascular procedure if feasible. Additionally, all but 1 patient underwent standard preoperative abdominal and pelvic arteriography. The CT scans and arteriograms were reviewed by both vascular surgical and interventional radiology staff to determine the suitability of aneurysm morphologic traits and geometry for endovascular repair. Once anatomic suitability was confirmed, a suitable device was chosen and operation undertaken. One patient ultimately required explantation and underwent successful traditional open repair, while the second patient with migration underwent repair endoluminally by placement of a proximal extension cuff.

The final patient experienced graft-limb thrombosis, which responded to thrombolytic therapy on 2 occasions but ultimately required a femoral-femoral bypass. The cause of the graft-limb occlusion was never detected. This was the only graft-limb occlusion in this series. As a result of our findings we have since adopted the use of transverse or oblique incisions placed just above the inguinal crease. We continue to open the femoral sheath using vertical dissection, once the subcutaneous tissue has been divided. Since adopting this technique, our overall incidence of groin wound–related complications has considerably decreased. Among the 21 additional cases performed since the completion of this analysis in which oblique incisions were used, we have only identified 1 groin-related complication. This was a lymphocele that resolved without surgical intervention.

### A visceral organ function-focused therapeutic strategy using a 6-hour time window for patients with acute type a aortic dissection complicated by mesenteric malperfusion [^111jtG7x]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The second option is endovascular surgery. Fewer studies have reported on the outcomes of the endovascular repair of mesenteric malperfusion. As shown in a study with a large sample size by Eusanio et al. endovascular treatment alone (72.7%) had a better outcome than medical drug therapy (95.2%), but the mortality was still at an extremely high level.

The third option is hybrid surgery, which combines open surgical repair with endovascular procedures and has a lower mortality rate. However, hybrid operating rooms are expensive to establish and maintain, and they are not yet widely used. A very small number of studies could be retrieved because only a few medical centers have a hybrid operating room. Moreover, in patients with severe SMA involvement that has already progressed to the late stage of malperfusion and severe organ function impairment, the risk of death is relatively high. Because infectious shock and the systemic inflammatory response have not been corrected, surgery and ischemia‒reperfusion injury could further exacerbate trauma and adversely impact clinical outcomes. In addition, this strategy may not prevent "doomed" patients from undergoing procedures that they would not benefit from. These patients presenting with end-stage organ failure who do not receive prior treatment to improve organ function often experience multiorgan failure and death, regardless of whether open surgical repair is performed. In these cases, open surgical repair combined with endovascular therapy increases the risk of patient harm and greatly increases the consumption of medical resources without increasing therapeutic efficacy.

The last strategy is performing endovascular reperfusion therapy first, followed by delayed open surgical repair. The main advocates of this strategy are the team at the University of Michigan, who recommend restoring visceral organ function before performing open surgery. This strategy has already shown a more favorable clinical outcome. However, all patients with ATAAD complicated by mesenteric malperfusion enrolled at their institution receive endovascular therapy first to restore organ perfusion. Thus, some patients with early-stage mesenteric malperfusion caused by dynamic obstruction of the involved superior mesenteric artery that has not yet developed into intestinal necrosis, which could be corrected by emergency open surgical repair, are also treated with endovascular therapy. During this period, there is also a potential risk of aortic rupture. 33% of the patients in Patel's study died during the waiting period, and 38% of the patients in Yang's study died preoperatively.

### Commentary: success lies in attention to details when performing open repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms [^1168RFYK]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Christopher Lau, MD, and Leonard N. Girardi, MD

Central Message

Successful repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms requires meticulous attention to all aspects of the operative procedure and perioperative care.

See Article page.

Chronic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) with dissection presents an interesting and complex challenge for surgeons owing to the high degree of variability in the anatomy of the dissected aorta and its branch vessels. Although some success has been made with endovascular interventions in a subset of highly selected patients, the applicability of endovascular solutions remains limited by anatomy. The locations of branch vessels, the primary tear, downstream fenestrations, and landing zones all need to be considered carefully. Even with successful initial repair, the need for reintervention exceeds 30%, due in part to the significantly more limited aortic remodeling seen in chronic dissection compared with acute dissection cases, owing to the relatively stiff intimal flap. As such, open repair has remained the gold standard, the most durable surgical approach to chronic thoracoabdominal dissecting aneurysms. In this issue of the Journal, Hong and Cosellipresent their operative and perioperative techniques for achieving optimal outcomes with open repair.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115gz4oz]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Aortic arch aneurysm — management recommendations specify that in patients with an aortic arch aneurysm who have symptoms attributable to the aneurysm and are at a low or intermediate operative risk, open surgical replacement is recommended. In patients with an isolated aortic arch aneurysm who are asymptomatic and have a low operative risk, open surgical replacement at an arch diameter of ≥ 5.5 cm is reasonable. In patients undergoing open surgical repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm, if the aneurysmal disease extends into the proximal aortic arch, it is reasonable to extend the repair with a hemiarch replacement. In patients undergoing open surgical repair of an aortic arch aneurysm, if the aneurysmal disease extends into the proximal descending thoracic aorta, an elephant trunk procedure may be considered. In patients with an aortic arch aneurysm who are asymptomatic but meet criteria for intervention, but have a high risk from open surgical repair, a hybrid or endovascular approach may be reasonable.

### Have hybrid procedures replaced open aortic arch reconstruction in high-risk patients? A comparative study of elective open arch debranching with endovascular stent graft placement and conventional elective open total and distal aortic arch reconstruction [^113p4jST]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Open total arch procedures have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple comorbidities. Aortic arch debranching with endovascular graft placement, the hybrid arch procedure, has emerged as a surgical option in this patient population. This study evaluates the outcomes of a contemporary comparative series from one institution of open total arch and hybrid arch procedures for extensive aortic arch pathology.

Methods

From July 2000 to March 2009, 1196 open arch procedures were performed, including 45 elective and 7 emergency open total arch procedures. From 2005 to 2009, 64 hybrid arch procedures were performed: 37 emergency type A dissections and 27 elective open arch debranchings. Hemiarch procedures were excluded.

Results

The hybrid arch cohort was significantly older (P = 0.008) and had greater predominance of atherosclerotic pathophysiology (P < .001). The incidence of permanent cerebral neurologic deficit was similar at 4% (1/27) for the hybrid arch cohort and 9% (4/45) for the open aortic arch cohort. In-hospital mortality was similar at 11% (3/27) for the hybrid arch cohort and 16% (7/45) for the open aortic arch cohort. However, in the open arch group, there was a significant difference in mortality between patients aged less than 75 years at 9% (3/34) and patients aged more than 75 years at 36% (4/11) (P = 0.05).

Conclusions

Hybrid arch procedures provide a safe alternative to open repair. This study suggests the hybrid arch approach has a lower mortality for high-risk patients aged more than 75 years. This extends the indication for the hybrid arch approach in patients with complex aortic arch pathology previously considered prohibitively high risk for conventional open total arch repair.

Oliver J. Liakopoulos, MD, and Wael Ahmad, MD

Central Message

This case report demonstrates the feasibility of a one-step hybrid repair approach of acute type A dissection with visceral malperfusion.

See Article page.

Mesenteric malperfusion syndrome (MMP) caused by acute type A dissection (AAD) is a rare, often clinically silent and fatal complication. In the prospective, multicentric German Registry for Acute Aortic Dissection Type A and the International Registry for Acute Dissection (IRAD), mesenteric malperfusion was present in 5.8% (2137 patients) and 3.8% (1809 patients), respectively. As reported from the IRAD registry, hospital mortality was 95% with medical (conservative) therapy, 72% after endovascular, and 42% after surgical/hybrid treatment of AAD complicated by MMP and ultimately linked to a 3- to 4-fold greater mortality compared with patients without malperfusion. Strikingly, approximately 50% of patients with MMP in the IRAD registry did not receive a surgical treatment, despite the dismal results of a watchful-wait strategy.

The optimal management of AAD with MMP still remains controversial, and current surgical strategies include immediate proximal aortic repair with or without laparotomy, immediate proximal aortic repair with downstream endovascular repair of the aorta (endovascular-second strategy), and downstream endovascular repair first with delayed open surgical repair of the ascending aorta/arch (endovascular-first strategy). Indeed, primary restoration of mesenteric perfusion with thoracic endovascular aortic repair or endovascular aortic fenestration without mesenteric vessel stenting has been recently proposed by 2 independent groups from Emory and Michigan in selected patients with stable AAD (ie, stable hemodynamics; no pericardial tamponade, aortic rupture or severe aortic regurgitation). The key advantage of the endovascular-first approach is that it offers a potential "bridge to decision" in stable patients and may avoid a futile open aortic surgery in the presence of a deleterious and irreversible mesenteric ischemia. On the downside, this strategy is not feasible in the majority of patients with AAD presenting with unstable hemodynamics, pericardial effusion, or aortic insufficiency, or in centers without or only limited access to experienced endovascular surgeons.

### Performance of the open-first repair strategy in type A aortic dissection with mesenteric malperfusion syndrome eligible for delayed repair [^112v6nm2]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

For patients with type A aortic dissection complicated by mesenteric malperfusion syndrome, some centers advocate a nontraditional approach based on up-front endovascular intervention and delayed open repair. However, the efficacy of this strategy cannot be understood without first understanding outcomes of the traditional open-first strategy in the same select patient population eligible for delayed repair, applying modern techniques of hybrid aortic surgery.

Methods

Patients with acute type A aortic dissection and mesenteric malperfusion syndrome were queried from a single institution. Those presenting with aortic rupture, tamponade, or cardiogenic shock (ineligible for delayed repair) were excluded. Patients were managed with immediate open aortic repair. Short-term and long-term outcomes are reported.

Results

A total of 1228 patients were treated for acute type A dissection in the study period, of whom 77 were included in the mesenteric malperfusion syndrome cohort. In-hospital mortality was 29% compared with 39% in an identically selected mesenteric malperfusion syndrome population undergoing delayed repair reported previously. Among patients with mesenteric malperfusion syndrome, 32% underwent additional procedures addressing distal malperfusion in a hybrid operating room during or after open repair. Concomitant proximal malperfusion (coronary, cerebral, or upper extremity) was common in the mesenteric malperfusion syndrome cohort, present in 35% of cases. Although early mortality was greater in the mesenteric malperfusion syndrome cohort compared with all acute type A dissections, 10-year survival among those discharged alive was similar (65% vs 59%, P = 0.18).

Conclusions

The traditional open-first repair strategy performs equal to or better than the delayed repair strategy for patients with mesenteric malperfusion syndrome eligible for delayed repair.

### Contemporary surgical strategies for acute type A aortic dissection [^111RqrYp]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Surgical techniques and organ protection strategies for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) have evolved considerably over the years. Nonetheless, open surgical repair remains a complex procedure, and there is a lack of consensus regarding many aspects of repair. In patients with dissection limited to the ascending aorta (DeBakey type II), repair typically involves replacement of only the affected segment, barring substantial aortic dilation to address elsewhere. In contrast, most patients with ATAAD have dissection extending into the thoracoabdominal aorta (DeBakey type I); in these cases, consideration must be given as to how much of the aortic arch and distal aorta to incorporate into the index repair, and several open and hybrid options exist. Herein, we review contemporary surgical strategies for ATAAD and clarify specific areas of controversy, in an effort to elucidate the optimal operative approach. In general, a limited index repair aimed at ensuring operative survival is typically the best option, whereas extended repair should be reserved for carefully selected patients who are most likely to benefit.

### DISSECT: a new mnemonic-based approach to the categorization of aortic dissection [^111P9d62]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective/Background

Classification systems for aortic dissection provide important guides to clinical decision-making, but the relevance of traditional categorization schemes is being questioned in an era when endovascular techniques are assuming a growing role in the management of this frequently complex and catastrophic entity. In recognition of the expanding range of interventional therapies now used as alternatives to conventional treatment approaches, the Working Group on Aortic Diseases of the DEFINE Project developed a categorization system that features the specific anatomic and clinical manifestations of the disease process that are most relevant to contemporary decision-making.

Methods and Results

The DISSECT classification system is a mnemonic-based approach to the evaluation of aortic dissection. It guides clinicians through an assessment of six critical characteristics that facilitate optimal communication of the most salient details that currently influence the selection of a therapeutic option, including those findings that are key when considering an endovascular procedure, but are not taken into account by the DeBakey or Stanford categorization schemes. The six features of aortic dissection include: duration of disease; intimal tear location; size of the dissected aorta; segmental extent of aortic involvement; clinical complications of the dissection, and thrombus within the aortic false lumen.

Conclusion

In current clinical practice, endovascular therapy is increasingly considered as an alternative to medical management or open surgical repair in select cases of type B aortic dissection. Currently, endovascular aortic repair is not used for patients with type A aortic dissection, but catheter-based techniques directed at peripheral branch vessel ischemia that may complicate type A dissection are considered valuable adjunctive interventions, when indicated. The use of a new system for categorization of aortic dissection, DISSECT, addresses the shortcomings of well-known established schemes devised more than 40 years ago, before the introduction of endovascular techniques. It will serve as a guide to support a critical analysis of contemporary therapeutic options and inform management decisions based on specific features of the disease process.
