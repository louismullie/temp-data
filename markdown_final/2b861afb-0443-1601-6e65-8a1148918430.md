## Question

A 29-year-old woman presents in preterm labor at 30 weeks' gestation. She delivers a male infant vaginally. The neonatal team is present for resuscitation. As the baby is born, the team discusses umbilical cord management. One member suggests umbilical cord milking to expedite placental transfusion, while another recommends delayed cord clamping. The team looks to you for guidance.

Based on current SOGC guidelines, what is the most appropriate approach to umbilical cord management in this infant, and why?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which umbilical cord management strategy is most appropriate for a 30-week preterm infant and why, with explicit alignment to SOGC guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the infant is vigorous or requires resuscitation. Then, I should verify SOGC's hierarchy of cord management strategies for preterm infants. Next, I will check the specific duration and positioning recommendations for delayed cord clamping. After that, I need to examine the stance on umbilical cord milking and any gestational-age caveats. Finally, I should consider absolute and relative contraindications, special scenarios like cesarean delivery, and how to operationalize this at the bedside with thermoregulation and team communication.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. At 30 weeks' gestation, this infant is preterm and likely to benefit from placental transfusion, but I need to ensure we do not delay necessary resuscitation. SOGC and AAP/AHA emphasize that deferred cord clamping is appropriate when the infant does not require immediate resuscitation, whereas immediate clamping is indicated if the infant or mother needs urgent stabilization, so I should verify the infant's condition before committing to a delay [^e018cc76] [^b7229e02].

> Next, I should review SOGC's hierarchy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — SOGC explicitly recommends delayed cord clamping as the preferred strategy for preterm infants, and advises against routine umbilical cord milking because of potential harms, particularly in very preterm infants. This aligns with their directive to perform delayed cord clamping instead of umbilical cord milking in preterm infants [^e454d209] [^64937519] [^342a5cd0].

> I will now examine the timing and positioning for delayed cord clamping. SOGC recommends delaying cord clamping for 60–120 seconds for preterm infants, with a minimum of 30 seconds if a full delay is not feasible, and to position the infant at or below the level of the introitus or at the level of the cesarean incision to optimize placental transfusion. Wait, let me verify the minimum — yes, at least 30 seconds is advised when the full 60–120 seconds cannot be achieved [^9ac88566] [^76b8a079] [^4fd17cae].

> Now, I need to check the stance on umbilical cord milking. SOGC advises not to perform umbilical cord milking in very preterm infants under 32 weeks due to increased risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage, and more broadly recommends DCC instead of milking in preterm infants. Initially, I thought milking might be reasonable at 30 weeks, but wait, I should correct that — SOGC's caution extends to infants under 32 weeks, so at 30 weeks milking is not recommended. This is consistent with early termination of a trial in infants under 32 weeks showing higher severe IVH with milking, reinforcing the risk signal in this gestational range [^78c3595d] [^987ee82f] [^e454d209] [^40d7d942].

> But wait, what if delayed cord clamping is not feasible due to staffing or equipment constraints? I should confirm alternatives. SOGC acknowledges that when DCC cannot be performed, some centers may consider milking, yet they still prioritize DCC and caution against milking in very preterm infants. In contrast, AAP/AHA allows consideration of intact cord milking in 28–34 week infants only when DCC is not feasible, and explicitly recommends against milking under 28 weeks; given this infant is 30 weeks, even under AAP/AHA framing, milking would only be a conditional alternative if DCC truly cannot be done, not the first choice [^e454d209] [^1dbe0668] [^0c8abea0].

> I should confirm absolute and relative contraindications so I don't overgeneralize. Absolute contraindications to delayed cord clamping include the need for immediate neonatal or maternal resuscitation, disrupted utero-placental circulation such as vasa previa with bleeding, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, and fetal hydrops. Relative considerations include risk factors for significant hyperbilirubinemia such as severe IUGR, maternal diabetes, or high maternal antibody titers, in which case a shorter delay or individualized decision may be warranted. I need to ensure none of these are present before proceeding with DCC [^e018cc76] [^16e7d77a] [^ba5a9904] [^a0b54bba].

> Let me consider special circumstances. If the delivery were cesarean, SOGC still supports DCC for 60–120 seconds with the infant positioned at the level of the incision or on the mother's abdomen, and to administer uterotonics after cord clamping to avoid a bolus of blood to the preterm infant. I should double-check that sequence — yes, uterotonics come after clamping in preterm deliveries per SOGC [^41866e10] [^d11d20de] [^fe261072].

> Next, I should review operational details to make this actionable. During the delay, the infant should be kept warm using warm towels, plastic bags, or wrap to mitigate hypothermia, and the team should be prepared to provide stabilization with an intact cord if feasible in experienced centers. I need to ensure the timing is documented and communicated clearly with the neonatal team and parents [^a4cffb4e] [^15871abd] [^1fc448e3].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is to perform delayed cord clamping for 60–120 seconds, positioning the infant at or below the level of the introitus, while ensuring thermoregulation and readiness to initiate resuscitation if needed. Umbilical cord milking should not be performed in this 30-week infant because of the increased risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage and because SOGC prioritizes DCC over milking in preterm infants. If unexpected resuscitation is required, I should clamp immediately and proceed with standard neonatal resuscitation, documenting the rationale and timing [^9ac88566] [^78c3595d] [^e454d209] [^e018cc76].

The most appropriate approach is **delayed cord clamping (DCC) for 60–120 seconds** [^9ac88566] for a 30-week preterm infant, as recommended by SOGC [^76b8a079]. This strategy reduces mortality, intraventricular hemorrhage, and the need for transfusions [^278cfdf6] without increasing hyperbilirubinemia or polycythemia [^9588a9ec]. Umbilical cord milking is **not recommended** in infants under 32 weeks [^78c3595d] due to increased risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage [^40d7d942]. If DCC is not feasible, consider intact cord milking only in infants 28–34 weeks [^1dbe0668], and avoid milking in infants under 28 weeks [^0c8abea0].

## SOGC recommendations for umbilical cord management in preterm infants

SOGC Guideline No. 424 provides clear recommendations for umbilical cord management in preterm infants, emphasizing **DCC as the preferred strategy** [^e454d209]:

- **Delayed cord clamping (DCC)**: Recommended for 60–120 seconds [^9ac88566] in preterm infants, including those born at 30 weeks' gestation. This approach is associated with reduced mortality, improved hematological outcomes, and decreased incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [^7aacb6dd].

- **Umbilical cord milking (UCM)**: Not recommended in very preterm infants (< 32 weeks) [^78c3595d] due to increased risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) [^40d7d942]. UCM may be considered only when DCC is not feasible, and even then, caution is advised.

- **Positioning during DCC**: The infant should be positioned at or below the level of the introitus or at the level of the cesarean incision to optimize placental transfusion [^9ac88566].

---

## Evidence supporting delayed cord clamping

Multiple studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated the benefits of **DCC in preterm infants**:

- **Reduced mortality**: DCC significantly reduces neonatal mortality in preterm infants [^7aacb6dd] [^8b889a67].

- **Decreased IVH**: DCC is associated with a significant reduction in IVH, a critical complication in preterm infants [^7aacb6dd] [^e5ee4fad].

- **Improved hematological outcomes**: DCC increases hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, reducing the need for blood transfusions [^7aacb6dd] [^e5ee4fad].

- **No significant increase in adverse effects**: DCC does not significantly increase the risk of hyperbilirubinemia or polycythemia [^9588a9ec] [^7aacb6dd].

---

## Risks associated with umbilical cord milking

While UCM has been considered an alternative to DCC, recent evidence highlights significant risks, particularly in very preterm infants:

- **Increased risk of severe IVH**: UCM in infants under 32 weeks is associated with a higher incidence of severe IVH [^40d7d942], prompting SOGC to advise against its routine use in this population [^78c3595d].

- **Lack of superiority**: UCM does not demonstrate clear superiority over DCC in terms of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes or mortality reduction [^aecc829a].

---

## Clinical scenario: 30-week preterm infant

In the case of a 30-week preterm infant, **DCC for 60–120 seconds** [^9ac88566] is the recommended approach. This gestational age falls within the range where DCC provides maximal benefit without the increased risks associated with UCM. If DCC is not feasible due to maternal or neonatal instability, UCM may be considered only with caution and after weighing the potential risks and benefits [^1dbe0668].

---

## Practical considerations during delayed cord clamping

To implement DCC effectively, the following practical considerations are recommended:

- **Thermoregulation**: Maintain the infant's temperature using warm towels, plastic bags, or medical-grade plastic wrap during DCC [^a4cffb4e].

- **Communication**: Coordinate with the neonatal team to ensure readiness for resuscitation if needed [^notfound].

- **Documentation**: Record the timing of cord clamping and the rationale for any deviations from standard practice [^dd9cf651].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Delayed cord clamping (DCC) | Strongly recommended for 60–120 seconds | - Reduces mortality <br/> - Decreases IVH <br/> - Improves hematological outcomes [^7aacb6dd] [^8b889a67] |
| Umbilical cord milking (UCM) | Not recommended for infants < 32 weeks | Increased risk of severe IVH [^78c3595d] [^40d7d942] |

---

The most appropriate approach for a 30-week preterm infant is **delayed cord clamping for 60–120 seconds** [^9ac88566], as it provides significant benefits without increasing adverse effects. Umbilical cord milking is not recommended due to the increased risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage in very preterm infants [^78c3595d] [^40d7d942].

Objectives To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of UCM in full-term and preterm neonates. Data Sources A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials, the clinicaltrails. gov database, and the reference list of retrieved articles from 1940 to 2014.

Conclusions and Relevance Umbilical cord milking was associated with some benefits and no adverse effects in the immediate postnatal period in preterm infants; however, further studies are warranted to assess the effect of UCM on neonatal and long-term outcomes. In 1949, McCausland et al1 surveyed members of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and reported no uniformity of practice in their management of umbilical cord and placental blood. The benefits of delayed cord clamping and other strategies to influence placental transfusion at birth have been under investigation for decades. 2, 3 Recently, interest in the evidently old procedures of transferring residual blood from the placenta to the infant by means of DCC or umbilical cord milking has shown a resurgence. However, practice among obstetricians varies 7 decades later.

A recent Cochrane review reported that DCC in preterm infants was associated with fewer transfusions of packed red blood cells and a lower risk for intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis compared with immediate cord clamping. 4 Concerns about polycythemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and delay in transition were not sustained in the review. In DCC, a passive transfer of additional blood volume occurs at a slow rate, mostly by uterine contractions, whereas in UCM an active transfer of additional blood volume occurs at a rapid rate and within a short time, which may or may not be beneficial to neonates, especially preterm neonates. Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of UCM in full-term and preterm infants. We included studies that investigated UCM vs a control intervention and reported any outcomes of interest.

The investigators must have reported the UCM procedure in detail so that it is replicable. Studies were included if they reported a primary outcome of neonatal mortality before discharge from the hospital or any 1 of the following secondary outcomes: Upadhyay et al13 cut the cord at 25 cm of length from the umbilical stump and then milked the cord. None of the other included trials milked the cord this way, which might have affected the volume of blood transfused. Milking of the umbilical cord was compared with ICC in 5 trials11, 12, 15–17 and with DCC in 2 trials. 13, 14 Delayed cord clamping in the control group was defined as DCC at 30 seconds14 or within 30 seconds. 13 The GA groups of the samples were heterogeneous across trials. Five studies11, 12, 14–16 of 277 infants reported outcomes of UCM vs a control condition in preterm infants. We found no statistically significant difference in the risk for death between infants assigned to UCM and the control group (RR, 0.

### Resuscitation with placental circulation intact compared with cord milking: a randomized clinical trial… [^500b620a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

PCI Trial Collaborators Data Sharing Statement PCI indicates placental circulation intact. Question Can resuscitation of preterm newborns with the placental circulation intact improve their clinical outcomes compared with umbilical cord milking. Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 209 newborns, the composite risk of death, grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks of postconception age was not statistically significantly different between newborns resuscitated with placental circulation intact and those resuscitated with umbilical cord milking. Objective To determine whether resuscitating preterm newborns while keeping the placental circulation intact and clamping the cord after a long delay would improve outcomes compared with umbilical cord milking.

Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 8 Italian neonatal intensive care units from April 2016 through February 2023 and enrolled preterm newborns born between 23 weeks 0 days and 29 weeks 6 days of gestation from singleton pregnancies. Interventions Enrolled newborns were randomly allocated to receive at-birth resuscitation with intact placental circulation for 180 seconds or umbilical cord milking followed by an early cord clamping. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the composite end point of death, grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks of postconception age. Prespecified secondary end points were the single components of the composite primary outcome. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted.

Conclusions and Relevance In a randomized clinical trial of preterm newborns at 23 to 29 weeks' gestational age, intact placental resuscitation for 3 minutes did not lower the composite outcome of death, grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared with umbilical cord milking. Trial Registration Clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT02671305 Delayed cord clamping improves outcomes in preterm newborns not requiring immediate resuscitation at birth compared with immediate cord clamping. 1–3 The American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics and European international guidelines for neonatal resuscitation suggest that for preterm newborns who do. not require resuscitation at birth, it is reasonable to delay cord clamping for longer than 30 seconds.

4–6 The majority of preterm newborns worldwide continue to receive an immediate cord clamping after birth, in particular, if delivered by cesarean delivery, to ensure a rapid start of resuscitation. 7–10. Umbilical cord milking is considered an alternative procedure to be performed at birth when delayed cord clamping is not feasible, because it better benefits preterm newborns compared with immediate cord clamping. 3, 6, 15–18 Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there are no studies comparing the effect of resuscitation with placental circulation intact and delayed cord clamping with resuscitation with UCM in preterm newborns.

### 2023 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics focused update on neonatal resuscitation: an update to the American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care… [^fe10df63]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

This 2023 focused update to the neonatal resuscitation guidelines is based on 4 systematic reviews recently completed under the direction of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation Neonatal Life Support Task Force. Systematic reviewers and content experts from this task force performed comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature on umbilical cord management in preterm, late preterm, and term newborn infants, and the optimal devices and interfaces used for administering positive-pressure ventilation during resuscitation of newborn infants. These recommendations provide new guidance on the use of intact umbilical cord milking, device selection for administering positive-pressure ventilation, and an additional primary interface for administering positive-pressure ventilation.

TOP 10 TAKE-HOME MESSAGES FOR NEONATAL RESUSCITATION For term and late preterm newborn infants ≥ 34 weeks' gestation who do not require resuscitation, delayed cord clamping can be beneficial compared with early cord clamping. For term and late preterm newborn infants ≥ 34 weeks' gestation who do not require resuscitation, intact cord milking is not known to be beneficial compared with delayed cord clamping. For nonvigorous term and late preterm newborn infants, intact cord milking may be reasonable compared with early cord clamping. For preterm newborn infants < 34 weeks' gestation who do not require resuscitation, delaying cord clamping can be beneficial compared with early cord clamping. For preterm newborn infants between 28 and 34 weeks' gestation who do not require resuscitation and in whom delayed cord clamping cannot be performed, intact cord milking may be reasonable.

For preterm newborn infants < 28 weeks' gestation, intact cord milking is not recommended. Effective positive-pressure ventilation is the priority in newborn infants who need support after birth. Using a T-piece resuscitator to deliver positive-pressure ventilation is preferred to the use of a self-inflating bag. Because both T-piece resuscitators and flow-inflating bags require a compressed gas source to function, a self-inflating bag should be available as a backup in the event of compressed gas failure when using either of these devices. Use of a supraglottic airway may be considered as the primary interface to administer positive-pressure ventilation instead of a face mask for newborn infants delivered at ≥ 34 0/7 weeks' gestation.

Introduction Scope of the Guidelines These guidelines are designed for North American health care practitioners caring for newborn infants who are looking for an up-to-date summary for clinical care, and for those who are seeking more in-depth information on these topics in resuscitation science and the gaps in current knowledge. This focused update is based on the systematic reviews of umbilical cord management in term and late preterm infants. 9 This 2023 focused update is based on 4 systematic reviews completed by the ILCOR Neonatal Life Support Task Force, which reviewed the science on umbilical cord management in preterm, late preterm, and term newborn infants 1, 2 and on devices and interfaces for administering PPV for newborn infants. 3.

### Umbilical cord management strategies in preterm infants… [^aecc829a]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

DCC indicates delayed umbilical cord clamping; ICC, immediate umbilical cord clamping; UCM, umbilical cord milking; UCM+DCC, combination of umbilical cord milking followed by delayed cord clamping. CrI indicates credible interval; DCC, delayed umbilical cord clamping; ICC, immediate umbilical cord clamping; NA, not available; OR, odds ratio; UCM, umbilical cord milking. © 2025 Question Which umbilical cord management strategy is associated with reducing mortality and morbidities in preterm infants. Findings In this network meta-analysis of 56 trials including 6852 preterm infants, compared with immediate umbilical cord clamping, delayed umbilical cord clamping was associated with lower odds of mortality and intraventricular hemorrhage, and umbilical cord milking was associated with lower odds of intraventricular hemorrhage. There was no significant difference between delayed umbilical cord clamping and umbilical cord milking for any outcome.

Meaning Delayed umbilical cord clamping should be the preferred strategy for preterm infants; however, larger trials directly comparing delayed umbilical cord clamping and umbilical cord milking are needed. Importance It is unclear which umbilical cord management strategy is the best for preventing mortality and morbidities in preterm infants. Objective To systematically review and conduct a network meta-analysis comparing 4 umbilical cord management strategies for preterm infants: immediate umbilical cord clamping, delayed umbilical cord clamping, umbilical cord milking, and UCM and DCC. Data Sources. Umbilical cord/placental transfusion refers to the transfer of blood to a baby from the time of birth to the time of umbilical cord clamping. The additional blood volume may be relevant for preterm infants because a larger amount of blood is sequestered in the placenta compared with term infants.

1 Delayed umbilical cord clamping is endorsed for practice by several bodies for term and preterm infants. 2, 3 The exceptions for DCC in preterm infants include those who need immediate resuscitation after birth. For such circumstances, an alternative technique has been in practice, umbilical cord milking, which consists of gently grasping the umbilical cord and squeezing the cord from the placenta toward the infant 2 to 4 times. Three or 4 repetitions of milking the intact cord deliver approximately 14 mL/kg of blood, 4 a volume similar to that delivered in a 2-minute DCC in term infants. 5 However, data from preterm lambs identified fluctuations in carotid artery pressure and flow with UCM, which may place extremely preterm infants at risk of intraventricular hemorrhage. 6 Conversely, none of the preterm lambs received antenatal steroids, and all were anesthetized and instrumented prior to delivery, which makes extrapolation to preterm human infants challenging.

A few trials7-9 have evaluated the combination of UCM and DCC in comparison with DCC or immediate umbilical cord clamping and reported varying results. Therefore, the objective of our systematic review and network meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of various umbilical cord management strategies in preterm infants: DCC, UCM, UCM+DCC, and ICC. Immediate CC was defined as clamping the umbilical cord immediately after birth of the infant. Delayed CC was defined as clamping the umbilical cord at least 30 seconds after birth. Umbilical cord milking consisted of grasping the intact or cut umbilical cord and squeezing the cord from the placenta 2 to 4 times toward the infant. Finally, UCM+DCC was defined as squeezing the intact cord from the placenta toward the infant immediately after birth and then clamping the cord at least 30 seconds after birth.

### Timing of cord clamping in very preterm infants: more evidence is needed [^3c6d4f3f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

In December 2012, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published a Committee Opinion entitled "Timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth". It stated that "evidence exists to support delayed cord clamping in preterm infants, when feasible. The single most important benefit for preterm infants is the possibility for a nearly 50% reduction in IVH". However, the Committee Opinion added that the ideal timing of umbilical cord clamping has yet to be determined and recommended that large clinical trials be conducted in the most preterm infants. Published randomized controlled trials include < 200 infants of < 30 weeks' gestation, with assessments of neurodevelopmental outcome in less than one-half of the children. This is a major gap in the evidence. Without reliable data from randomized controlled trials that optimally include childhood follow-up evaluations, we will not know whether delayed cord clamping may do more overall harm than good. Ongoing trials of delayed cord clamping plan to report childhood outcomes in > 2000 additional very preterm infants. Current recommendations may need to change when these results become available. Greater international collaboration could accelerate resolution of whether this promising intervention will improve disability-free survival in about 1 million infants who will be born very preterm globally each year.

Delayed cord clamping in the first minute in preterm infants born before 34 weeks of gestation improves neonatal hematologic measures and may reduce mortality without increasing any other morbidity. In term-born babies, it also seems to improve both the short- and long-term outcomes and shows favorable scores in fine motor and social domains. However, there is insufficient evidence to show what duration of delay is best. The current evidence supports not clamping the cord before 30 seconds for preterm births. Future trials could compare different lengths of delay. Until then, a period of 30 seconds to 3 minutes seems justified for term-born babies.

### Umbilical cord management at term and late preterm birth: a meta-analysis [^9b9642db]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation prioritized scientific review of umbilical cord management at term and late preterm birth.

Objective

To assess effects of umbilical cord management strategies (clamping timing and cord milking) in infants ≥ 34 weeks' gestational age.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and trial registries searched July 2019.

Study Selection

Two authors independently assessed eligibility of randomized controlled trials.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed evidence certainty (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations).

Results

We identified 46 studies (9159 women and their infants) investigating 7 comparisons. Compared with early cord clamping (ECC) < 30 seconds, delayed cord clamping (DCC) ≥ 30 seconds (33 studies), intact-cord milking (1 study), and cut-cord milking (2 studies) probably improve hematologic measures but may not affect survival without neurodisability, anemia in early infancy, or maternal postpartum hemorrhage. No differences in major neonatal morbidities are seen in studies comparing methods of optimizing placental transfusion (DCC versus cut-cord milking [3 studies], longer delays in clamping [7 studies], or physiologic parameters [3 studies]). Strategies that promote increased placental transfusion may be associated with greater phototherapy use. Evidence for all outcomes was low or very low certainty.

Limitations

Incompleteness and low certainty of findings limit applicability.

Conclusions

Compared with ECC, DCC or cord milking increases hemoglobin and hematocrit immediately after birth in infants ≥ 34 weeks' gestational age. The uncertain effects of DCC and cord milking compared with ECC on major morbidities limit usefulness of available evidence for policy and practice.

### Umbilical cord management for newborns [^06cd5dc5]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation prioritized scientific review of umbilical cord management strategies at preterm birth.

Objective

To determine the effects of umbilical cord management strategies (including timing of cord clamping and cord milking) in preterm infants < 34 weeks' gestation.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and trial registries were searched through July 2019 for randomized controlled trials assessing timing of cord clamping and/or cord milking.

Study Selection

Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, appraised risk of bias, and assessed evidence certainty (GRADE).

Data Extraction

We identified 42 randomized controlled trials (including 5772 infants) investigating 4 different comparisons of cord management interventions.

Results

Compared to early cord clamping, delayed cord clamping (DCC) and intact-cord milking (ICM) may slightly improve survival; however, both are compatible with no effect (DCC: risk ratio: 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 1.00 to 1.04, n = 2988 infants, moderate certainty evidence; ICM: risk ratio: 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.98 to 1.06, n = 945 infants, moderate certainty evidence). DCC and ICM both probably improve hematologic measures but may not affect major neonatal morbidities.

Limitations

For many of the included comparisons and outcomes, certainty of evidence was low. Our subgroup analyses were limited by few researchers reporting subgroup data.

Conclusions

DCC appears to be associated with some benefit for infants born < 34 weeks. Cord milking needs further evidence to determine potential benefits or harms. The ideal cord management strategy for preterm infants is still unknown, but early clamping may be harmful.

3 RECOMMENDATIONS

Delayed cord clamping in the first minute in preterm infants born before 34 weeks of gestation improves neonatal hematologic measures and may reduce mortality without increasing any other morbidity. In term‐born babies, it also seems to improve the short‐ and long‐term outcomes and showed favorable scores in the fine motor and social domains at 4 years of age.

However, there is insufficient evidence to show what duration of delay is best. The current evidence supports not clamping the cord before 30 seconds for preterm births. Future trials could compare different lengths of delay. Until then, at term a period of 30 seconds to 3 minutes seems justified or until the cord is collapsed and white.

For both preterm and term‐born babies, during the cord clamping delay, attempts should be made to get them to breathe spontaneously. Additional research is needed to examine the long‐term child outcome related to the timing of umbilical cord clamping and the developing brain.

Delivery Room Stabilisation

Birth is defined as when the foetus is completely expelled from the mother, and this is when timings should start. Personnel attending birth should know how to identify infants who require urgent airway management and lung inflation in the first minutes after birth in order to establish gas exchange and restore cardiac output. European Resuscitation Guidelines cover protocols for when and how to intervene in infants who are born in poor condition secondary to hypoxia, with emphasis on airway opening and aeration of the lungs using positive pressure. A separate approach is needed for most preterm babies at risk of RDS as they are not asphyxiated and with time will try to breathe on their own, and supporting normal transition with more gentle interventions is preferable.

The timing of umbilical cord clamping is an important first step. Deferring cord clamping (DCC), allowing time for a placental transfusion, and establishing lung aeration before clamping will lead to a better haemodynamic transition. Avoiding immediate cord clamping in preterm infants has been recommended since 2010, and recently, it is clear that DCC of 30–60 s will reduce both in-hospital mortality and the combined outcome of death or major disability at 2 years. Umbilical cord milking was recommended as an alternative where DCC is not possible. Recent systematic reviews suggest equivalence in terms of haemodynamic benefits and overall outcomes; however, one randomised trial was stopped early because of an excess of severe intraventricular haemorrhage in the subgroup of infants below 28 weeks of gestation. Stabilising preterm babies on specially adapted resuscitation tables that allow optimal thermal care and airway management with the umbilical cord intact is also feasible, resulting in more rapid establishment of airway support and longer duration of DCC without needing to move to a separate overhead warmer. However, it is still not clear if this confers any overall benefits to most infants who will begin spontaneous breathing before the cord is clamped.

### Umbilical cord management in newborn resuscitation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^de2d265f]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The first minutes of life and delivery room management of newborns have a fundamental impact on neonatal mortality and morbidity. Establishing interventions and protocols for resuscitation in the delivery room poses a challenge due to the heterogeneous population as term infants differ from preterm infants who were born at the limit of viability. Recommendations and guidelines on stabilization procedures in the delivery room are constantly changing and evolving by integrating new procedures based on recent evidence (e.g. application of sustained inflations and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)). –

Over the past decades, a number of research studies have examined the physiology and outcomes of delayed cord clamping (DCC); thereby, its numerous beneficial effects on infants have been proven, e.g. improved transitional circulation and iron stores, increased hemoglobin level at birth, decreased need for blood transfusion and lower incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). –

Therefore, on the basis of the guidelines influenced by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) recommendations, it is suggested to delay cord clamping (CC) by at least 60 s, ideally after ensuring adequate lung aeration. However, the timing of CC and the steps of resuscitation are still not synchronized. Unfortunately, non-vigorous and non-breathing infants needing immediate interventions for stabilization are usually clamped immediately and excluded from most studies on different umbilical cord management. In consequence, for preterm and term infants who require resuscitation after birth, we still have insufficient evidence on the optimal time of CC. The purpose of our study was to collect all available data on this most vulnerable newborn population in order to discover the effect of intact cords when initiating resuscitation.

### Committee opinion no.543: timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth [^a76dcd45]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

The optimal timing for clamping the umbilical cord after birth has been a subject of controversy and debate. Although many randomized controlled trials in term and preterm infants have evaluated the benefits of delayed umbilical cord clamping versus immediate umbilical cord clamping, the ideal timing for cord clamping has yet to be established. Several systematic reviews have suggested that clamping the umbilical cord in all births should be delayed for at least 30–60 seconds, with the infant maintained at or below the level of the placenta because of the associated neonatal benefits, including increased blood volume, reduced need for blood transfusion, decreased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in preterm infants, and lower frequency of iron deficiency anemia in term infants. Evidence exists to support delayed umbilical cord clamping in preterm infants, when feasible. The single most important clinical benefit for preterm infants is the possibility for a nearly 50% reduction in intraventricular hemorrhage. However, currently, evidence is insufficient to confirm or refute the potential for benefits from delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants, especially in settings with rich resources.

### Umbilical cord management in newborn resuscitation [^8b889a67]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

At birth, blood continues to flow from the mother to baby through the intact umbilical cord. This continuum of fetal-placental circulation, now taking place between the placenta and the newborn infant has been termed 'placental transfusion', and it enables redistribution of blood between the placenta and the baby. There is usually net flow into the baby, which appears to play a role in expanding pulmonary blood. Ample clinical evidence has shown that uninterrupted placental transfusion, as supported by the practice of deferred umbilical cord clamping (DCC) reduces death, especially in preterm babies who do not require resuscitation at birth, i.e. those born in "good condition". In an individual patient data meta-analysis (48 trials, 6367 babies < 37 weeks' GA), DCC compared to immediate clamping reduced death before discharge by almost a third (odds ratio [OR] 0.68 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–0.91). Accepted clinical practice is, therefore, to defer cord clamping in stable term and preterm infants whenever possible. Current international newborn resuscitation guidelines recommend at least 60 seconds of DCC. Moreover, in a sub-set of the recent individual patient data meta-analysis (47 trials, 6094 babies), deferring cord clamping beyond 120 seconds further reduced the odds of death (OR 0.31 Cl 0.11–0.80). We speculate these recent new insights will be considered in the next edition of resuscitation guidelines.

### Umbilical cord milking versus delayed cord clamping: which to choose in preterm infants? [^2916d1e1]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Our understanding of the best approach to umbilical cord management has evolved, with current recommendations for delayed cord clamping for full-term infants and preterm infants to improve transitional circulation, hematologic status, and improve longer-term health outcomes. DCC is challenging for preterm infants that require ventilatory assistance or full resuscitation. An alternative to DCC in this circumstance is umbilical cord milking, which can be done in 20 seconds compared with 30–180 seconds for DCC. However, prior studies suggest that UCM is associated with increased risk of intraventricular hemorrhage. Other studies have not found this risk. Katheria et al. report a study early released in. Pediatrics to assess if UCM is at least as good to DCC.

The authors share an analysis of data from a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing UCM to DCC in more than a thousand preterm infants from 28–32 weeks' gestation from 19 birthing centers in 4 countries. The primary outcome was a grade 3–4 IVH or death. While there is a lot of interesting data to review in this article, the bottom line is that the rates of IVH in both arms was the same, leading to the conclusion that UCM is a safe alternative to DCC in this population. Should we start doing UCM rather than DCC for all preterm infants born needing resuscitation. Not so fast — at least according to an accompanying commentary by neonatologist Dr. Roger Soll from the University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine. Dr. Soll compliments the authors on their methods and findings but also speaks to some important limitations of this study. Dr.

Soll raises concerns about the size of the study and the ability to find a difference based on the population that was enrolled. Dr. Soll suggests we also consider a more physiologic transition at birth without aggressive ventilatory intervention that would also enable DCC to continue to be used without difficulty and calls for trials to support his hypothesis. Read both the study and commentary and see if you too are in accord with realizing either method will likely improve a baby's physiologic transitions to breathing satisfactorily after birth.

### Optimizing cord management for each preterm baby-challenges of collating individual participant data and recommendations for future collaborative research [^266566f7]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The optimal cord management strategy at birth for each preterm baby is still unknown, despite more than 100 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) undertaken on this question. To address this, we brought together all RCTs examining cord management strategies at preterm birth in the iCOMP (individual participant data on COrd Management at Preterm birth) Collaboration, to perform an individual participant data network meta-analysis. In this paper, we describe the trials and tribulations around obtaining individual participant data to resolve controversies around cord clamping, and we derive key recommendations for future collaborative research in perinatology. To reliably answer outstanding questions, future cord management research needs to be collaborative and coordinated, by aligning core protocol elements, ensuring quality and reporting standards are met, and carefully considering and reporting on vulnerable sub-populations. The iCOMP Collaboration is an example of the power of collaboration to address priority research questions, and ultimately improve neonatal outcomes worldwide.

### Evaluating the evidence behind umbilical cord clamping practices in at-risk neonatal populations [^2302dcbe]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Umbilical cord clamping practices impact nearly 140 million births each year. Current evidence has led professional organizations to recommend delayed cord clamping (DCC), as opposed to early cord clamping (ECC), as the standard of care in uncomplicated term and preterm deliveries. However, variability remains in cord management practices for maternal-infant dyads at higher risk of complications. This review examines the current state of evidence on the outcomes of at-risk infant populations receiving differing umbilical cord management strategies. Review of contemporary literature demonstrates members of high-risk neonatal groups, including those affected by small for gestational age (SGA) classification, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), maternal diabetes, and Rh-isoimmunization, are frequently excluded from participation in clinical trials of cord clamping strategies. Furthermore, when these populations are included, outcomes are often underreported. Consequently, evidence regarding optimal umbilical cord management in at-risk groups is limited, and further research is needed to guide best clinical practice.

Term infant cord management at birth — guideline and evidence scope: It is reasonable to delay clamping of the cord for 60 or more seconds for term and late preterm infants born at 34+0 week's or more gestation and who are vigorous or considered to not require immediate resuscitation at birth. Red Cross guidelines are informed by a 2021 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) systematic review and Consensus on Science with Treatment Recommendations, which evaluated delayed cord clamping for 30 or more seconds and intact or cut cord milking in term and late preterm infants (34+0 week's or more gestation) compared with early clamping of the cord (less than 30 seconds after birth), as well as delayed cord clamping at less than 60 seconds compared with 60 seconds or greater and physiologic approaches based on cessation of pulsation or vital signs monitoring/initiation of breathing.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cesarean delivery, more specifically with respect to immediate care of the newborn at delivery, cord clamping, SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to delay cord clamping for 60 seconds in term singletons because it improves hematological outcomes at birth and past the neonatal period. Consider delaying cord clamping with the infant at the level of the Cesarean incision
or on the mother's abdomen.

### When to transfuse preterm babies [^9a0df9f6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2008). Low credibility.

The physiological anaemia experienced by preterm babies is exacerbated by common care practices such as early clamping of the umbilical cord at birth and gradual exsanguination by phlebotomy for laboratory monitoring. The need for subsequent transfusion with red blood cells can be reduced by delaying cord clamping for 30–60 s in infants who do not require immediate resuscitation. The need for transfusions can be further reduced by limiting phlebotomy losses, providing good nutrition, and using standard guidelines for transfusion based on haemoglobin or haematocrit. What those guidelines should be is not clear. Analysis of two recent large clinical trials comparing restrictive and liberal transfusion guidelines leads to several conclusions. Restrictive transfusion guidelines may reduce the number of transfusions given, but there is no reduction in donor exposures if a single-donor transfusion programme is used. There is some evidence that more liberal transfusion guidelines may help to prevent brain injury, but information on the impact of transfusion practice on long-term outcome is lacking. Until further guidance emerges, transfusion thresholds lower than those used in the two trials should not be used, as there is no evidence that lower thresholds are safe.

### Delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth: ACOG committee opinion, number 814 [^598aef50]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Umbilical cord milking — comparative evidence and guidance — achieves placental transfusion in a rapid time frame, usually less than 10–15 seconds, and appeals when a 30–60-second delay in clamping may be too long. A recent meta-analysis of seven studies that involved 501 preterm infants compared milking with immediate or delayed clamping and found higher hemoglobin and decreased intraventricular hemorrhage with no increase in adverse effects, although methods varied and subgroup comparison directly against delayed clamping was not possible because of small numbers. Subsequent trials reported similar effects on hemoglobin and ferritin in term infants, higher hemoglobin and improved blood pressure among cesarean-delivered infants before 32 weeks (not among those born vaginally), and a 2019 study halted early with 474 infants in which extremely preterm infants (23–27 weeks of gestation) in the milking arm more often developed intraventricular hemorrhage compared with delayed clamping. Given this most recent data, cord milking should not be used for extremely preterm infants (less than 28 weeks of gestation), and there is insufficient evidence to either support or refute umbilical cord milking in infants born at 32 weeks of gestation or more, including term infants.

### Clinical guidelines for management of infants born before 25 Weeks of gestation: how representative is the current evidence? [^0c14ae12]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether management guidelines for infants born extremely preterm are representative for those infants < 25 weeks of gestation.

Study Design

Three guidelines were reviewed: the 2022 European Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Respiratory Distress Syndrome, the 2017 American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines for Perinatal Care, and the 2020/2021 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation guidelines. All referenced studies for overlapping recommendations were reviewed. Data extracted included the total number and proportion of infants < 25 weeks of gestation in the original articles referred in the guidelines. Where the exact number of infants < 25 weeks of gestation was unobtainable, this was conservatively estimated by statistical deduction.

Results

Eight recommendations were included in 2 or more guidelines: (1) antenatal corticosteroids, (2) antenatal magnesium sulfate, (3) delayed cord clamping, (4) thermoregulation at birth, (5) initial oxygen concentration at birth, (6) continuous positive airway pressure, (7) surfactant, and (8) parenteral nutrition. In total, 519 studies (n = 409986) informed these 8 recommendations, of which 335 (64.5%) were randomized controlled trials (n = 78325). Across all studies, an estimated 59360 (14.5%) infants were < 25 weeks of gestation. Within randomized controlled trials alone, an estimated 5873 (7.5%) infants were < 25 weeks of gestation. A total of 196 (37.8%) studies did not include any infants < 25 weeks of gestation.

Conclusions

Infants born < 25 weeks of gestation are not well-represented in the evidence used to develop major clinical guidelines for infants born extremely preterm. Future studies should provide evidence for this population as a distinct cohort.

Preterm delivery occurs in approximately 12% of all births in the United States and is a major factor that contributes to perinatal morbidity and mortality (1, 2). Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) complicates approximately 3% of all pregnancies in the United States (3). The optimal approach to clinical assessment and treatment of women with term and preterm PROM remains controversial. Management hinges on knowledge of gestational age and evaluation of the relative risks of delivery versus the risks of expectant management (eg, infection, abruptio placentae, and umbilical cord accident). The purpose of this document is to review the current understanding of this condition and to provide management guidelines that have been validated by appropriately conducted outcome-based research when available. Additional guidelines on the basis of consensus and expert opinion also are presented.

### Delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth: ACOG committee opinion, number 814 [^5b3c8320]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Delayed umbilical cord clamping in term and preterm infants — delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds is recommended in term and preterm infants except when immediate umbilical cord clamping is necessary because of neonatal or maternal indications, and evidence also supports delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds in preterm infants. In term infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping increases hemoglobin levels at birth and improves iron stores in the first several months of life, with a small increase in jaundice requiring phototherapy, and obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers adopting delayed cord clamping in term infants should ensure that mechanisms are in place to monitor and treat neonatal jaundice. In preterm infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping is associated with improved transitional circulation, better establishment of red blood cell volume, decreased need for blood transfusion, and lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage, and in terms of maternal outcomes it does not increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage or the need for blood transfusion, and postpartum maternal hemoglobin levels are not affected by delayed compared with immediate umbilical cord clamping.

### Umbilical cord milking vs delayed clamping and death or intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants… [^40d7d942]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Findings In a randomized clinical trial that was terminated early, precluding the planned noninferiority analysis and requiring post hoc comparison, 474 of a planned 1500 infants born at less than 32 weeks' gestation were enrolled. There was no significant difference in the composite primary outcome of death or severe intraventricular hemorrhage for the umbilical cord milking group vs the delayed umbilical cord clamping group, but umbilical cord milking was significantly associated with a higher rate of severe intraventricular hemorrhage.

Meaning Among preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks' gestation, there was no significant difference in the rates of the composite primary outcome of death or severe intraventricular hemorrhage with umbilical cord milking vs delayed umbilical cord clamping, but a significantly higher rate of severe intraventricular hemorrhage in the umbilical cord milking group led to early termination of the study. The early study termination and post hoc nature of the analyses preclude definitive conclusions. Importance Umbilical cord milking as an alternative to delayed umbilical cord clamping may provide equivalent benefits to preterm infants, but without delaying resuscitation. Objective To determine whether the rates of death or severe intraventricular hemorrhage differ among preterm infants receiving placental transfusion with umbilical cord milking vs delayed umbilical cord clamping. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.

gov Identifier: NCT03019367 Placental transfusion has become the accepted standard in newborn care with benefits to the neonate including decreased mortality in preterm infants1 and improved developmental outcomes in term infants. 2 Umbilical cord milking has been endorsed as an alternative to delayed umbilical cord clamping, which is the current standard of care. Umbilical cord milking provides a placental transfusion by pushing blood toward the newborn before the umbilical cord is clamped with a duration similar to immediate umbilical cord clamping, allowing the neonatal team to begin resuscitation promptly. A phase 1 pilot trial compared umbilical cord milking vs delayed umbilical cord clamping in premature newborns delivered by cesarean delivery and demonstrated umbilical cord milking improved neonatal blood flow and organ perfusion and improved cognitive and.

That trial1 and a recent meta-analysis6 have demonstrated reduced in-hospital mortality with delayed umbilical cord clamping compared with immediate umbilical cord clamping. The objective of the current randomized clinical trial was to determine whether umbilical cord milking was noninferior to delayed umbilical cord clamping among preterm infants. Participants were stratified by gestational age to ensure enrollment of an approximately equal number of infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestational age in each group. Multiple births were given the same treatment assignment for ease of consent and family considerations. There was no crossover allowed between the umbilical cord milking group and the delayed umbilical cord clamping group. If the physician abandoned the assigned procedure due to safety concerns, the infant received immediate umbilical cord clamping.

### Delayed vs early umbilical cord clamping for preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7aacb6dd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The effects of delayed cord clamping of the umbilical cord in preterm infants are unclear.

Objective

We sought to compare the effects of delayed vs early cord clamping on hospital mortality (primary outcome) and morbidity in preterm infants using Cochrane Collaboration neonatal review group methodology.

Study Design

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Chinese articles, cross-referencing citations, expert informants, and trial registries to July 31, 2017, for randomized controlled trials of delayed (≥ 30 seconds) vs early (< 30 seconds) clamping in infants born < 37 weeks' gestation. Before searching the literature, we specified that trials estimated to have cord milking in > 20% of infants in any arm would be ineligible. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed bias, and extracted data. Relative risk (ie, risk ratio), risk difference, and mean difference with 95% confidence intervals were assessed by fixed effects models, heterogeneity by I 2 statistics, and the quality of evidence by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations.

Results

Eighteen randomized controlled trials compared delayed vs early clamping in 2834 infants. Most infants allocated to have delayed clamping were assigned a delay of ≥ 60 seconds. Delayed clamping reduced hospital mortality (risk ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–0.90; risk difference, -0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.05 to -0.01; P = 0.005; number needed to benefit, 33; 95% confidence interval, 20–100; Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations = high, with I² = 0 indicating no heterogeneity). In 3 trials in 996 infants ≤ 28 weeks' gestation, delayed clamping reduced hospital mortality (risk ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.95; risk difference, -0.05; 95% confidence interval, -0.09 to -0.01; P = 0.02, number needed to benefit, 20; 95% confidence interval, 11–100; I² = 0). In subgroup analyses, delayed clamping reduced the incidence of low Apgar score at 1 minute, but not at 5 minutes, and did not reduce the incidence of intubation for resuscitation, admission temperature, mechanical ventilation, intraventricular hemorrhage, brain injury, chronic lung disease, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, late onset sepsis or retinopathy of prematurity. Delayed clamping increased peak hematocrit by 2.73 percentage points (95% confidence interval, 1.94–3.52; P < .00001) and reduced the proportion of infants having blood transfusion by 10% (95% confidence interval, 6–13%; P < .00001). Potential harms of delayed clamping included polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia.

Conclusion

This systematic review provides high-quality evidence that delayed clamping reduced hospital mortality, which supports current guidelines recommending delayed clamping in preterm infants. This review does not evaluate cord milking, which may also be of benefit. Analyses of individual patient data in these and other randomized controlled trials will be critically important in reliably evaluating important secondary outcomes.

2 RESPIRATORY SUPPORT IN THE DELIVERY ROOM

2.1 Timing of respiratory support in relation to umbilical cord management

Extremely preterm birth is associated with immaturity of multiple organ systems, resulting in frequent need of resuscitation at birth and substantially increased morbidity and mortality compared to more mature preterm and term infants. Traditionally, rapid initiation of respiratory support was the dominant task at delivery of extremely preterm neonates with neonatal care teams counting the time from birth to having the baby on the resuscitation table and providing positive pressure support as soon as possible. Although timely provision of positive pressure support is still a priority, several strategies of timing of respiratory support in relation to umbilical cord management are under investigation. These include deferring cord clamping for 30–120 s or delaying cord clamping until the infant is breathing regularly (so‐called "physiology‐based cord clamping") and cord milking with or without intact cord. If cord clamping is delayed, placental transfusion improves blood transfer toward the infant. Based on a recent meta‐analysis, delayed cord clamping and intact cord milking probably improve hematological measures but do not seem to affect major neonatal morbidities although earlier studies suggested an increased risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage attributable to intact cord milking in extremely preterm neonates. Delayed cord clamping may offer a small survival benefit but the certainty of this evidence is only moderate. The risk‐benefit ratio of both physiology‐based cord clamping and cord milking is still unclear and under current investigation.

2 CLINICAL SCENARIOS

2.1 Delayed cord clamping at preterm birth

Systematic reviews provide moderate‐quality evidence that delayed cord clamping in the first minute in preterm infants born before 34 weeks of gestation improves neonatal hematologic measures and may reduce mortality without increasing any other morbidity.

Delayed clamping reduced hospital mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.68; 95% CI 0.52–0.90; risk difference –0.03; 95% CI –0.05 to –0.01; P = 0.005; number needed to benefit 33; 95% CI 20–100). In three trials including 996 infants at or before 28 weeks of gestation, delayed cord clamping reduced hospital mortality (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.51–0.95; risk difference –0.05; 95% CI –0.09 to –0.01; P = 0.02; number needed to benefit 20; 95% CI 11–100). Delayed clamping reduced the incidence of a low Apgar score at 1 minute, but not at 5 minutes, and did not reduce the incidence of intubation for resuscitation, admission temperature, mechanical ventilation, intraventricular hemorrhage, brain injury, chronic lung disease, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, late‐onset sepsis, or retinopathy of prematurity.

2.2 Delayed cord clamping at term birth

Although not the focus of these recommendations, there is also evidence that expectant management in full‐term babies is beneficial in the third stage of labor in the short and long term. In the short term, delayed cord clamping increases early hemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants. In the long term, delayed cord clamping is likely to be beneficial as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is available.

A randomized trial of full‐term infants from low‐risk pregnancies in a high‐income country assessed neurodevelopment at 4 years and compared delayed versus early cord clamping. Favorable scores for delayed cord clamping were found in the fine motor and social domains at 4 years of age, especially in boys. Prevention of iron deficiency in infancy may promote neurodevelopment. Delayed umbilical cord clamping prevents iron deficiency at 4–6 months of age, and long‐term effects have yet to be reported. Some trials have also followed the impact of cord clamping on the early developing brain at 12 months in a healthy population, concluding that infants who received delayed cord clamping had greater myelin content in brain regions involving motor, function, visual, spatial, and sensory processing.

A 2012 systematic review on timing of umbilical cord clamping in preterm infants analyzed the results from 15 eligible studies that involved 738 infants born between 24 weeks and 36 weeks of gestation, defined delayed umbilical cord clamping as a delay of more than 30 seconds with a maximum of 180 seconds, and included some studies that also used umbilical cord milking in addition to delayed cord clamping. Delayed umbilical cord clamping was associated with fewer infants requiring transfusion for anemia.

### Deferred cord clamping and cord milking: certainty and quality of the evidence in meta-analyses, and systematic reviews of randomized control trials, guidelines, and implementation studies [^278cfdf6]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Deferred 1 cord clamping (DCC) saves lives, so why is it not implemented more routinely? Despite neonatal benefits, DCC is under-utilized, particularly in preterm births. Umbilical cord milking (UCM) also improves some outcomes for preterm infants such as decreasing the need for transfusions. At term, DCC and UCM improve hematological indices.

Objective

The objective of this chapter is to examine the quality of evidence for both preterm and term DCC (and UCM), clinical practice guidelines and implementation issues.

Methods

Key evidence, primarily from network meta-analyses, meta-analyses and systematic reviews on both preterm and term DCC (and UCM) from randomized clinical trials, clinical practice guidelines and implementation studies, are summarized through a lens of the certainty and quality of the evidence. Regarding the certainty of evidence, for network meta-analysis the Confidence in Network Meta-analysis tool was used, and for meta-analyses the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) were used. Guideline quality was appraised with two tools: Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch & Evaluation II (AGREE II) and AGREE-Recommendation EXcellence (AGREE-REX). Implementation study quality was evaluated using The Mixed Method Appraisal tool.

Results

In a network meta-analysis of 56 RCTs of cord management strategies, DCC reduced the odds of mortality in preterm infants by 30% compared to immediate cord clamping (ICC), including in the subgroup of infants born before 33 weeks', both with a moderate confidence assessment using the Confidence in Network Meta-analysis tool. DCC reduced the odds of any intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) by 30%, and the odds of red blood cell transfusion by more than 50%, both with high ratings on the Confidence in Network Meta-analysis. Umbilical Cord Milking (UCM) did not reduce mortality compared to ICC. In contrast to the benefits shown in preterm birth with DCC, a systematic review showed that at term, there were no mortality benefits and few benefits at all except for improved hematological indices. A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines demonstrated that all of them endorsed DCC for uncompromised preterm infants, and 11 more cautiously noted that cord milking might be considered when DCC was not feasible. However, only half (49%) of the recommendations in the guidelines on the optimal duration of DCC were supported by high-quality evidence per AGREE-II and AGREE-REX. Fewer than one in 10 statements (8%) cited a mortality benefit with DCC for preterm infants. Regarding the uptake of DCC, a systematic review of 18 studies on facilitators and barriers to implementation found that almost all (12 of the 14 studies) focused on strategies such as protocols, policy, or toolkits; additionally, 8 of 14 studies used didactic teaching sessions. Only 8 of 18 studies scored high on all four domains of the Mixed Method Appraisal tool.

Conclusions

Compared to ICC, DCC in preterm infants conferred significant benefits for mortality, IVH and red blood cell transfusion, with confidence ratings of moderate (mortality) or high. Although guidelines worldwide encouraged preterm (and term) DCC, the quality of the clinical practice guidelines had room for improvement; only half of the recommendations on the optimal duration of preterm DCC were supported by high-quality evidence. Most guidelines did not mention a mortality benefit with preterm DCC and lacked details on practical aspects of implementation. Among implementation studies, which have focused mainly on protocols, policies, toolkits or didactic teaching, quality also demonstrated an opportunity for improvement.

### Part 5: neonatal resuscitation: 2025 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^2494bef9]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Preterm umbilical cord management — synopsis of effects and safety: Based on available evidence for preterm infants who do not require resuscitation, deferred cord clamping for at least 60 seconds may result in improved outcomes. While deferred cord clamping is the preferred approach, an alternative approach is intact cord milking for infants born at 28+0 to 36+6 weeks' gestational age in whom deferred cord clamping cannot be performed. For infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestational age, intact cord milking is associated with increased risk of intraventricular hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased incidence of hypothermia on admission to the neonatal intensive care unit for preterm infants who received deferred cord clamping when compared to those who received immediate cord clamping. Attention to maintaining normothermia is an important aspect of care during resuscitation regardless of cord management strategy.

### Early versus delayed umbilical cord clamping in preterm infants [^e5ee4fad]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal timing for clamping of the umbilical cord at birth is unclear. Early clamping allows for immediate resuscitation of the newborn. Delaying clamping may facilitate transfusion of blood between the placenta and the baby.

Objectives

To delineate the short- and long-term effects for infants born at less than 37 completed weeks' gestation, and their mothers, of early compared to delayed clamping of the umbilical cord at birth.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (2 February 2004), the Cochrane Neonatal Group trials register (2 February 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004), PubMed (1966 to 2 February 2004) and EMBASE (1974 to 2 February 2004).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing early with delayed (30 seconds or more) clamping of the umbilical cord for infants born before 37 completed weeks' gestation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

Seven studies (297 infants) were eligible for inclusion. The maximum delay in cord clamping was 120 seconds. Delayed cord clamping was associated with a higher hematocrit four hours after birth (four trials, 134 infants; weighted mean difference 5.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.42 to 7.19), fewer transfusions for anaemia (three trials, 111 infants; relative risk (RR) 2.01, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.27) or low blood pressure (two trials, 58 infants; RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.17 to 5.67) and less intraventricular haemorrhage (five trials, 225 infants; RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.81) than early clamping.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Delaying cord clamping by 30 to 120 seconds, rather than early clamping, seems to be associated with less need for transfusion and less intraventricular haemorrhage. There are no clear differences in other outcomes.

Delayed umbilical cord clamping (DCC) in term and preterm infants — professional guidance and maternal risk are summarized as follows. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends a delay in umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds after birth in vigorous term and preterm infants, and delayed umbilical cord clamping is usually defined as cord clamping at least 30–60 seconds after birth. Additional guidance notes that the World Health Organization recommends that the umbilical cord not be clamped earlier than 1 minute after birth in term or preterm infants who do not require positive pressure ventilation, the Neonatal Resuscitation Program recommends delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds for most vigorous term and preterm infants, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends deferring umbilical cord clamping for healthy term and preterm infants for at least 2 minutes after birth, and the American College of Nurse-Midwives recommends delayed umbilical cord clamping for term and preterm infants for 2–5 minutes after birth. Delayed umbilical cord clamping does not increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.

### Part 5: neonatal resuscitation: 2025 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^643af8aa]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Umbilical cord management — term newborn umbilical cord management recommendations specify that, for term newborn infants who do not require immediate resuscitation, deferred cord clamping for at least 60 seconds can be beneficial compared to immediate cord clamping (2a B-R). For nonvigorous term newborn infants and late preterm infants 35 weeks or more gestational age, intact cord milking may be reasonable when compared to immediate cord clamping (2b B-R). For term newborn infants who do not require immediate resuscitation, the usefulness of intact umbilical cord milking compared to deferred cord clamping is uncertain (2b C-LD).

### 2023 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics focused update on neonatal resuscitation: an update to the American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^f8132262]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Neonatal resuscitation — umbilical cord management for term and late preterm infants: For newborns ≥ 34 weeks' gestation who do not require resuscitation, delayed cord clamping (≥ 30 seconds) can be beneficial compared with early cord clamping (< 30 seconds). For the same population, intact cord milking is not known to be beneficial compared with delayed cord clamping (≥ 30 seconds). For nonvigorous term and late preterm newborn infants (35–42 weeks' gestation), intact cord milking may be reasonable compared with early cord clamping (< 30 seconds).

### Delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth: ACOG committee opinion, number 814 [^089fd287]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Delayed umbilical cord clamping — implementation and physiologic effects — includes initiating early newborn care while awaiting clamping and facilitating an interval of at least 30–60 seconds between birth and cord clamp. It should not interfere with active management of the third stage of labor, and immediate cord clamping is appropriate if the placental circulation is not intact or if maternal hemodynamic instability or the need for immediate resuscitation of the newborn on the warmer exists. Institutional ability may vary and timing decisions should be individualized, including in fetal growth restriction with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies where neonatal and obstetric teams can weigh risks and benefits. Regarding cord blood gases, two studies suggest a decrease of approximately 0.03 in umbilical artery pH with delayed clamping, whereas a larger study of 116 infants found no difference in umbilical cord pH and an increase in umbilical artery pO2; these studies included infants who did not require resuscitation at birth.

### Clinical aspects of incorporating cord clamping into stabilisation of preterm infants [^6d9fb24c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Fetal to neonatal transition is characterised by major pulmonary and haemodynamic changes occurring in a short period of time. In the international neonatal resuscitation guidelines, comprehensive recommendations are available on supporting pulmonary transition and delaying clamping of the cord in preterm infants. Recent experimental studies demonstrated that the pulmonary and haemodynamic transition are intimately linked, could influence each other and that the timing of umbilical cord clamping should be incorporated into the respiratory stabilisation. We reviewed the current knowledge on how to incorporate cord clamping into stabilisation of preterm infants and the physiological-based cord clamping (PBCC) approach, with the infant's transitional status as key determinant of timing of cord clamping. This approach could result in optimal timing of cord clamping and has the potential to reduce major morbidities and mortality in preterm infants.

### Perinatal care at the threshold of viability: an international comparison of practical guidelines for the treatment of extremely preterm births [^090d3455]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Over the last 2 decades, the survival rate of infants born at ≤ 25 weeks of gestation has increased; however, significant morbidity and disability persist. The commitment for their care gives rise to a variety of complex medical, social, and ethical aspects. Decision-making is a crucial issue that involves the infant, the family, health care providers, and society. In a review of the existing guidelines, we investigated the different approaches in the care of extremely preterm births in various countries. We found that many scientific societies and professional organizations have issued guidelines that address the recommendations for the care of these fetuses/neonates although to varying degrees. In this article we compare different approaches and assess the scientific grounds of the specific recommendations. With current standards, intensive care is generally considered justifiable at ≥ 25 weeks, compassionate care at ≤ 22 weeks, and an individual approach at 23 to 24 weeks, consistent with the parents' wishes and the infant's clinical conditions at birth.
