## Question

Diagnosis of syphilis in a patient with a past history of treated syphilis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose syphilis in a patient with a history of previously treated syphilis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and what documentation is required to confirm prior treatment. Then, I should verify the appropriate testing algorithm and how to interpret discordant serologies. Next, I will consider how to distinguish reinfection or treatment failure from a serofast state. After that, I need to check when to pursue neurosyphilis evaluation. Finally, I will outline management, follow-up, and special populations, ensuring I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the necessity of verifying prior treatment details, because management hinges on whether prior therapy was adequate and documented. I need to check the exact date and regimen of prior therapy, the stage treated, and whether there is a documented fourfold decline in nontreponemal titers from baseline, as this is the best evidence of successful treatment and helps avoid unnecessary retreatment; if documentation is incomplete, I should treat as unknown or late latent disease rather than assume cure [^112G6WcU] [^1174SiHU].

> Next, I should review the current serologic testing strategy, and I need to ensure I am using paired treponemal and nontreponemal tests interpreted in sequence. Wait, let me verify the algorithm: CDC recommends either a traditional sequence (nontreponemal screen with treponemal confirmation) or a reverse sequence (treponemal screen with reflex quantitative nontreponemal test, and if discordant, a second treponemal test using a different assay), and I must use the same nontreponemal method longitudinally for comparability [^1174SiHU] [^116e1xhx].

> I will now examine the likely serologic patterns in a previously treated patient. Treponemal assays typically remain positive for life, whereas nontreponemal titers usually decline and may serorevert over time, especially after early treatment; however, some patients remain serofast with low, stable titers, so I should not overcall disease activity based on a single low titer in isolation [^1174SiHU] [^112G6WcU] [^114XDoqo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should interpret results within a clinical framework. If both treponemal and nontreponemal tests are reactive, I need to compare the current nontreponemal titer with the post-treatment nadir to look for a fourfold rise, which suggests reinfection or treatment failure, whereas a stable low titer in a patient with documented prior adequate therapy and no new risk supports a serofast state and no retreatment [^1129Q1kn] [^112G6WcU].

> But wait, what if the treponemal test is positive and the nontreponemal test is nonreactive? I should confirm with a second, different treponemal assay. If the second treponemal is positive and there is documented prior adequate treatment with no new exposure, no further treatment is needed, though if there was recent exposure, I should repeat the nontreponemal test in 2–4 weeks to exclude early infection [^1174SiHU] [^116ZzwY4].

> I need to ensure I consider discordant patterns carefully. A positive nontreponemal with negative treponemal testing is unusual after prior treated syphilis and suggests a biologic false positive or very early infection; if early infection is possible, I should repeat serology in 2–4 weeks and correlate with risk and symptoms before deciding on treatment [^1146BUgA].

> Let me think about how to distinguish reinfection or treatment failure from a serofast state. A sustained fourfold or greater increase in nontreponemal titer from the post-treatment baseline, in the absence of new exposure, raises concern for treatment failure or relapse; conversely, a stable low titer, typically ≤ 1:8, with documented prior adequate therapy and no new risk, supports a serofast state and no retreatment, though I should double-check for neurologic, ocular, or otic symptoms before closing the case [^1129Q1kn] [^112G6WcU] [^114XDoqo].

> I should confirm when to evaluate for neurosyphilis. Indications include neurologic, ocular, or otic symptoms, signs of tertiary disease, or an inadequate serologic response after appropriate therapy. In people with HIV, some guidelines suggest CSF examination for late latent disease with high nontreponemal titers, but I need to reconcile this with evolving recommendations and individualize based on risk and symptoms, recognizing that CSF is not routinely indicated for isolated ocular or otic disease without other CNS features [^1125zahY] [^1176Zib3] [^113fFK3Q].

> Next, I should review management if reinfection or treatment failure is suspected. I will treat according to the current stage using benzathine penicillin G, typically 2.4 million units IM weekly for 3 doses for late latent or unknown duration, and ensure partner notification and presumptive treatment of recent contacts per guidelines. If neurosyphilis is suspected, I should use neurosyphilis regimens and coordinate care with infectious diseases [^113phPUj] [^1134JSHn].

> I will now examine follow-up and monitoring. For early syphilis, I should monitor with the same nontreponemal assay at 6 and 12 months expecting at least a fourfold decline by 12–24 months. For late latent disease, extend follow-up to 24 months and interpret responses cautiously, as serologic responses are often blunted and low-level persistent titers may be acceptable if stable and the patient is asymptomatic [^112dRLSz] [^112G6WcU] [^114XDoqo].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations. In pregnancy, I must treat any inadequately treated or unknown-status infection promptly with penicillin and desensitize if allergic, because maternal nontreponemal titers guide fetal risk and management. In people with HIV, use the same stage-based regimens but anticipate potentially slower serologic responses and consider more frequent monitoring in high-risk settings [^115F7FBZ] [^115koTKH] [^113novUh] [^1169Yu13] [^116DUNx8].

> Let me reconsider the key principle to ensure internal consistency. The cornerstone is integrating meticulous documentation of prior therapy and serial nontreponemal titers with paired serologic testing and clinical assessment; without this, misclassification of past treated infection as active disease is common, particularly in reverse-screening contexts, so I should always anchor decisions to documented treatment response and current risk rather than a single reactive test [^112G6WcU] [^1174SiHU] [^1121kiu2].

Diagnose syphilis in a previously treated patient by **comparing current nontreponemal titers to the post-treatment baseline** [^112G6WcU] and assessing for a **fourfold rise** [^1129Q1kn], which indicates reinfection or treatment failure. Treponemal tests remain positive for life and **cannot distinguish active from past infection** [^1174SiHU]; therefore, use quantitative nontreponemal tests (RPR or VDRL) to assess activity [^116e1xhx]. If the nontreponemal titer is stable or has declined fourfold since treatment, no retreatment is needed unless there is clinical suspicion or new exposure [^114XDoqo]. If the titer rises fourfold or new symptoms appear, treat as reinfection or treatment failure, and consider CSF analysis for neurosyphilis if indicated [^112e5XA2]. Always interpret results in the context of documented prior treatment and clinical findings [^117Kc1Hx].

---

## Serological tests and their interpretation

Serological tests are the cornerstone of syphilis diagnosis and follow-up [^117Kc1Hx]. They are broadly categorized as **treponemal and nontreponemal** tests [^114KDEjc].

---

### Treponemal tests

Treponemal tests detect antibodies specific to Treponema pallidum and typically remain positive for life after infection, regardless of treatment status [^1174SiHU]. Common treponemal tests include:

- **Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS)**: Highly sensitive and specific but not quantitative [^notfound].

- **Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA)**: Used as a confirmatory test in reverse algorithms [^1174SiHU].

- **Enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIA)**: Automated tests used in reverse screening algorithms [^1174SiHU].

Treponemal tests are not suitable for monitoring treatment response because they remain positive indefinitely [^1174SiHU].

---

### Nontreponemal tests

Nontreponemal tests detect antibodies against cardiolipin-lecithin antigens and are **quantitative**, allowing monitoring of treatment response [^117Kc1Hx]. Common nontreponemal tests include:

- **Rapid plasma reagin (RPR)**: Widely used for screening and monitoring treatment response [^116e1xhx].

- **Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL)**: Similar to RPR, used for screening and monitoring [^116e1xhx].

Nontreponemal test titers typically decline after successful treatment and may become nonreactive over time, although some patients may remain serofast (persistent low-level reactivity) [^112G6WcU].

---

## Diagnostic approach in previously treated patients

In patients with a history of treated syphilis, the diagnostic approach focuses on **differentiating reinfection or treatment failure from persistent serological reactivity** [^112e5XA2]. The following steps are recommended:

---

### Step 1: confirm prior treatment history

Review medical records to confirm **adequate prior treatment** — defined as benzathine penicillin G administered according to the stage of infection — and document the **post-treatment nontreponemal titer** (RPR or VDRL) to establish a baseline for comparison [^117Kc1Hx].

---

### Step 2: perform current serological testing

Obtain a **quantitative nontreponemal test (RPR or VDRL)** to assess current activity and a **treponemal test (TPPA or FTA-ABS)** only if prior treponemal status is unknown or to confirm persistent treponemal positivity [^1174SiHU].

---

### Step 3: interpret serological results

Compare the current nontreponemal titer with the **post-treatment baseline**:

- **Fourfold decline**: Indicates successful treatment; no retreatment needed unless clinical suspicion or new exposure [^112e5XA2].

- **Stable titer**: Suggests persistent serological reactivity (serofast state); no retreatment unless clinical suspicion or new exposure [^114XDoqo].

- **Fourfold rise**: Indicates reinfection or treatment failure; retreatment required [^1129Q1kn].

---

### Step 4: clinical correlation and additional evaluation

Perform a thorough clinical examination to identify new signs or symptoms of active syphilis [^1127w5YA]. If neurosyphilis is suspected — based on neurological symptoms, ocular or otic involvement, or a sustained fourfold rise in nontreponemal titers — perform **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis** [^116GLA6k].

---

## Special considerations

---

### HIV coinfection

Patients with HIV may have **atypical serological responses**, including delayed or blunted serological responses [^112e5XA2]. Serological monitoring should be more frequent (every 3–6 months) in HIV-positive patients, and CSF analysis should be considered if there is clinical suspicion of neurosyphilis or an inadequate serological response [^112e5XA2].

---

### Pregnancy

Pregnant patients with a history of treated syphilis should have their nontreponemal titers monitored closely. A fourfold rise in titer indicates reinfection or treatment failure and **requires immediate retreatment** to prevent congenital syphilis [^115F7FBZ].

---

## Summary of diagnostic approach

| **Step** | **Action** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm prior treatment history and post-treatment baseline titer | Establish baseline for comparison |
| 2 | Perform current quantitative nontreponemal test (RPR or VDRL) | Assess current activity |
| 3 | Compare current titer with post-treatment baseline | - Fourfold decline: successful treatment <br/> - Stable: serofast <br/> - Fourfold rise: reinfection or failure |
| 4 | Clinical correlation and additional evaluation (including CSF analysis if indicated) | Confirm active infection and guide management |

---

Diagnosing syphilis in a previously treated patient relies on **comparing current nontreponemal titers with the post-treatment baseline** [^116e1xhx]. A fourfold rise indicates reinfection or treatment failure, whereas a stable or declining titer suggests persistent serological reactivity or successful treatment. Treponemal tests remain positive for life and are not used to monitor treatment response [^1174SiHU]. Clinical correlation and, when indicated, CSF analysis are essential to confirm active infection and guide management.

### The mydriatic red eye as the initial presentation of syphilis [^114d2c44]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that has been increasing in prevalence since the early 2000s. Ocular involvement occurs in a minority of patients and must be in the differential diagnosis for patients who present with red eye and uveitis.

Case Report

A 29-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a painful, mydriatic red eye. Review of systems revealed a rash as well as a recent genital lesion and, on further questioning, she admitted to a history of intravenous drug use and high-risk sexual activity. Ophthalmology was consulted and the patient was diagnosed with bilateral uveitis. Serologic testing was positive for syphilis, and she was admitted and treated with intravenous penicillin, with resolution of her uveitis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Red eye is a common ocular symptom in patients presenting to the emergency department. The differential diagnosis of the red eye is broad and can range from benign etiologies, such as conjunctivitis, to life- and sight-threatening conditions, such as endogenous endophthalmitis. Systemic diseases such as syphilis may present with primarily ocular symptoms, and ocular syphilis must be identified and managed appropriately to prevent devastating sequelae.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^114KDEjc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

This report provides new CDC recommendations for tests that can support a diagnosis of syphilis, including serologic testing and methods for the identification of the causative agent Treponema pallidum. These comprehensive recommendations are the first published by CDC on laboratory testing for syphilis, which has traditionally been based on serologic algorithms to detect a humoral immune response to T. pallidum. These tests can be divided into nontreponemal and treponemal tests depending on whether they detect antibodies that are broadly reactive to lipoidal antigens shared by both host and T. pallidum or antibodies specific to T. pallidum, respectively. Both types of tests must be used in conjunction to help distinguish between an untreated infection or a past infection that has been successfully treated. Newer serologic tests allow for laboratory automation but must be used in an algorithm, which also can involve older manual serologic tests. Direct detection of T. pallidum continues to evolve from microscopic examination of material from lesions for visualization of T. pallidum to molecular detection of the organism. Limited point-of-care tests for syphilis are available in the United States; increased availability of point-of-care tests that are sensitive and specific could facilitate expansion of screening programs and reduce the time from test result to treatment. These recommendations are intended for use by clinical laboratory directors, laboratory staff, clinicians, and disease control personnel who must choose among the multiple available testing methods, establish standard operating procedures for collecting and processing specimens, interpret test results for laboratory reporting, and counsel and treat patients. Future revisions to these recommendations will be based on new research or technologic advancements for syphilis clinical laboratory science.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: a retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^117URNVa]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

To ensure adequate performance of the assay in a wide range of clinically relevant stages of infection, the samples were obtained from the serological categories listed in Table S1. Associated data were collected, including gender, age, HIV status, antiretroviral status, HIV viral load, pregnancy status, gender of sexual partners in the past 12 months, T. pallidum PCR result performed in the 7 days prior to or following the day of serology sample collection, prior syphilis treatment and clinical stage of syphilis using criteria listed in Table S2. In brief, primary syphilis was defined as primary chancre plus one of (i) reactive syphilis serology on the day of specimen collection, (ii) reactive syphilis serology within 3 months after the day of specimen collection, or (iii) T. pallidum detected by PCR. Secondary syphilis was defined as systemic symptoms typical of syphilis with mucocutaneous lesions and reactive syphilis serology. Early latent syphilis was defined as asymptomatic with reactive syphilis serology and non-reactive syphilis serology results within the last 2 years. Late latent or unknown duration latent syphilis was defined as asymptomatic with reactive syphilis serology and no prior testing or prior testing 2 years or more since the last test. Past treated syphilis was defined as documented adequate treatment for syphilis in the patient chart, no signs of syphilis on the day of specimen collection and no subsequent diagnosis of syphilis in the 3 months after the day of specimen collection. No syphilis was defined as no diagnosis of syphilis on the day of testing (non-reactive syphilis serology and, if performed, T. pallidum not detected by PCR), no syphilis in the past medical history and no prior reactive syphilis serology. Based on the clinical stage of syphilis data, cases were classified into active untreated (primary, secondary, early latent and late latent or unknown duration latent syphilis clinical stages), prior treated syphilis (past treated syphilis clinical stage), and no syphilis (no syphilis clinical stage).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure or reinfection, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a negative non-treponemal test can be obtained in a substantial number of (but not in all) patients treated for early syphilis after 1–2 years. Regard a negative non-treponemal test after treatment as the best confirmation of cure. Obtain a strict follow-up in patients with persistent low titers (≤ 4) in a non-treponemal test (serofast state), but regard these patients as successfully treated in the absence of ongoing risk. Consider performing CSF assessment to detect asymptomatic neurosyphilis in patients with persistent high titers of non-treponemal test (≥ 8).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Syphilis serologic testing algorithm — treponemal screening with EIA/CIA: Some laboratories use an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA) as a screening test followed by a reflex-quantitative, non-treponemal test; if the treponemal screen is positive and the reflex non-treponemal test is negative, the laboratory should perform a second treponemal test to confirm the initial positive. If the second treponemal test is positive, persons with a history of previous treatment appropriate for the stage of syphilis will require no further treatment unless sexual risk history suggests likelihood of re-exposure, in which case a repeat non-treponemal test 2 to 4 weeks after the most recent possible exposure is recommended to evaluate for early infection. Those without a history of treatment for syphilis should be offered treatment; unless history or physical examination suggests a recent infection, previously untreated persons should be treated for late latent syphilis. If the second treponemal test is negative and the risk of syphilis is low, no treatment is indicated; if risk is high, a repeat non-treponemal test in 2 to 4 weeks is recommended to evaluate for early infection. In the absence of neurologic signs or symptoms, risk of neurosyphilis is low in persons with a reactive treponemal test and a non-reactive, non-treponemal test; examination of CSF is not recommended.

### Which algorithm should be used to screen for syphilis? [^116KA5EF]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A growing number of laboratories have implemented a reverse screening algorithm for syphilis testing, which has created confusion among many healthcare providers. This review focuses on recent data addressing the clinical and economical impact of reverse screening and discusses the advantages and limitations of the traditional and contemporary algorithms.

Recent Findings

Screening for syphilis using a treponemal assay detects a higher number of patients with reactive results compared to traditional screening by rapid plasma reagin (RPR). Furthermore, a significant percentage of patients who are reactive by a treponemal screening assay are nonreactive by RPR. These discordant results may occur in patients with past, treated or untreated syphilis; early syphilis; or no syphilis. Recent reports suggest that the reverse screening algorithm may result in increased patient follow-ups, overtreatment, and potentially higher cost. However, other data suggest that reverse screening facilitates the detection of latent and early syphilis, while offering an objective and automated screening approach.

Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends syphilis screening with a nontreponemal test. However, as laboratories continue to implement the reverse screening algorithm, it is important that samples with discordant screen-reactive, RPR-nonreactive results be tested by a second treponemal assay to assist in the interpretation of results.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115F7FBZ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Considerations

Pregnant women seropositive for syphilis should be considered infected unless an adequate treatment history is clearly documented in the medical records and sequential serologic antibody titers have decreased as recommended for the syphilis stage. The risk for antepartum fetal infection or congenital syphilis at delivery is related to the syphilis stage during pregnancy, with the highest risk occurring during the primary and secondary stages. Quantitative maternal nontreponemal titer, especially if > 1:8, might be a marker of early infection and bacteremia. However, risk for fetal infection is still substantial among pregnant women with late latent syphilis and low titers. Pregnant women with stable, serofast low nontreponemal titers who have previously been treated for syphilis might not require additional treatment; however, increasing or high antibody titers in a pregnant woman previously treated might indicate reinfection or treatment failure, and treatment should be offered.

If an automated treponemal test (e.g. EIA or CIA) is used for antepartum syphilis screening, all positive tests should be reflexed to a quantitative nontreponemal test (e.g. RPR or VDRL). If the nontreponemal test is negative, the results are considered discrepant and a second treponemal test (TP-PA is preferred) should be performed, preferably on the same specimen.

If the second treponemal test is positive (e.g. EIA positive, RPR negative, or TP-PA positive), current or previous syphilis infection can be confirmed. For women with a history of adequately treated syphilis who do not have ongoing risk, no further treatment is necessary. Women without a history of treatment should have the syphilis stage determined and should be treated accordingly with a recommended penicillin regimen.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116e1xhx]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Traditional algorithm — syphilis serologic testing in people with HIV emphasizes paired testing and consistent methods: Rapid treponemal assays are available to screen for syphilis; however, these tests can not differentiate recent or past infection, so testing with a nontreponemal test is indicated to inform further patient management, and use of only one type of serologic test (nontreponemal or treponemal) is insufficient for diagnosis and can yield false-negative or false-positive results. Individuals with a reactive nontreponemal test should always receive a treponemal test to confirm the syphilis diagnosis, and nontreponemal test antibody titers can correlate with disease activity and are used for monitoring treatment response. Sequential serologic tests should be performed using the same testing method (VDRL or RPR), preferably by the same laboratory; VDRL and RPR are equally valid assays, quantitative results from the two tests cannot be compared directly, and RPR titers frequently are slightly higher than VDRL titers. Nontreponemal test titers usually decrease after treatment and can become nonreactive with time, but antibodies might decrease less than fourfold after treatment or might decline appropriately but fail to serorevert and persist; atypical nontreponemal serologic test results might occur regardless of HIV status. When serologic tests do not correspond with clinical findings indicative of primary, secondary, or latent syphilis, presumptive treatment is recommended for people with risk factors for syphilis, and use of other tests (e.g., biopsy for histology and immunostaining and PCR of lesion) should be considered; for most people with HIV, serologic tests are accurate and reliable for diagnosing syphilis and evaluating response to treatment.

### Syphilis infection prevalence in the middle east and north Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1121kiu2]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, limited recent data were available for specific population groups, namely STI clinic attendees and special clinical populations (Table S14 and Figure S15), suggesting that the pooled syphilis prevalence estimates for these groups may not accurately reflect current prevalence. Nevertheless, most data for the primary population groups, such as general populations and populations at high risk, were recent and collected after 2010 (Tables S13 and S14 and Figure S15). Heterogeneity in syphilis prevalence was noted among the included studies; however, the meta-regression analyses explained over 60% of this heterogeneity by considering various epidemiological factors and study methods.

While our categorization of syphilis is strictly based on serological test results rather than infection type, we assigned each category a general interpretation for infection, for epidemiological relevance. However, accurately inferring a history of syphilis diagnosis from serological test results alone is challenging and comes with several caveats (Table S2). For example, in individuals with a history of adequately treated syphilis infection, non-treponemal tests may remain reactive for many years. Therefore, without using antibody titers cutoffs, it is possible that some individuals who tested positive on both treponemal and non-treponemal tests, and were thus classified as having a probable current syphilis infection, may actually have a past, adequately treated infection rather than an current infection. This potential misclassification may result in an overestimation of the prevalence of probable current syphilis infection.

Regarding medical management for syphilis, more specifically with respect to management of sexual contacts, HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to offer presumptive treatment for early syphilis in individuals exposed sexually > 90 days before syphilis diagnosis in a sex partner, if syphilis serologic test results are not available immediately and the opportunity for follow-up is uncertain.

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: pros and cons [^111vKTgg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Summary of the Relevant Data

Laboratories also should consider their patient population and syphilis risk when performing the traditional and reverse algorithm. Missing a syphilis diagnosis can have devastating effects particularly in a prenatal population where congenital syphilis is a concern. In high-risk patient populations (eg, sexually transmitted disease [STD] clinic patients, people with human immunodeficiency virus, men who have sex with men), routine screening at 3-month intervals, regardless of the algorithm used, is the most effective approach to identifying cases of early syphilis. Screening with a nontreponemal test in the traditional algorithm detects cases of active syphilis, but reports have shown decreased sensitivity of the RPR and VDRL at detecting cases of primary and possibly latent syphilis, although many studies fail to differentiate latent from past treated syphilis based on treponemal confirmatory testing. Screening with a treponemal test will identify more cases of syphilis, presumably past treated, but additional confirmatory testing drives costs up. However, the signal strength (a semiquantitative value) of automated treponemal screening assays can predict when a confirmatory treponemal test will be reactive. Numerous studies have used a high signal strength (signal strength to cutoff ratio) in lieu of confirmatory treponemal testing to reduce unnecessary procedures or laboratory costs. While each algorithm has a role depending on the patient population, these data suggest that a treponemal assay should be used to confirm a negative nontreponemal result if primary or latent syphilis is clinically suspected.

### Syphilis [^1127w5YA]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Staging of syphilis

Staging of syphilis cannot be done based on laboratory results alone, and requires history and examination. Primary and secondary syphilis are symptomatic; early and late latent syphilis are generally asymptomatic. Careful examination to identify any symptoms not noticed by the patient is important and should include thorough anogenital and dermatologic inspection.

The staging criteria for early latent syphilis are given in box 2. Asymptomatic patients with positive serology who do not fulfil the criteria of early latent syphilis could be staged as latent syphilis or as having syphilis of unknown duration.

Box 2
Staging criteria for early latent syphilis

Patients with early latent syphilis are asymptomatic, with one of the following:

New positive serology with a documented negative test within previous 12* or 24† months
 ≥ 4-fold increase in the RPR titre relative to a previous test done within 12* or 24† months
Unequivocal symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis within the previous 12* or 24† months
Only one possible exposure, which occurred within previous 12* or 24† months

If contact occurred more than 90 days before diagnosis, presumptive treatment for early syphilis is advised if tests are not immediately available and follow-up is uncertain; if serologic tests are negative, no treatment is needed, and if positive, treatment should be based on clinical and serologic evaluation and stage. Sexual partners at risk should be notified and evaluated, including those with sexual contact within 3 months plus duration of symptoms for primary syphilis, within 6 months plus duration of symptoms for secondary syphilis, and within 1 year for early latent syphilis; long-term sex partners of persons with late latent syphilis should be evaluated clinically and serologically and treated based on findings.

Despite the complexities and limitations in interpreting these serological test results, each category was assigned a general interpretation, for epidemiological relevance. As such, the following categories, based on different serological test results combinations, were used for infection type: 1) probable current (active) syphilis infection (positive both treponemal and non-treponemal tests), 2) possible current infection, unspecified (positive non-treponemal test, irrespective of treponemal test result if done), 3) lifetime syphilis infection (positive treponemal test, irrespective of non-treponemal test result if done), and 4) unclear if the diagnostic test used was not reported or not adequately described. These categories, their description, interpretation in terms of syphilis diagnosis, and limitations in this interpretation are further described in Table S2.

Whenever available in a report, we extracted all prevalence measures corresponding to these infection/serological test categories. Consequently, one report could contribute prevalence measures for more than one syphilis infection type. This approach enabled us to utilize the maximum information possible from the testing done in each study.

Ideally, probable current syphilis infection diagnosis (category 1) would entail non-treponemal antibody titers to disentangle individuals with a past, adequately treated infection. However, this information was rarely reported in the studies we identified. Most countries of the MENA region are low- or middle-income countries with limited resources and inadequate laboratory capacity where qualitative non-treponemal tests are most commonly used. It was therefore not possible to include antibodies titers as part of the classification of diagnostics in our study. A positive result on both non-treponemal and treponemal tests without titers is considered, as per WHO screening guidelines, the indicator of choice for probable current syphilis infection, and is the definition used in previous global systematic reviews.

1 Introduction

Syphilis is a curable sexually transmitted infection (STI), caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum (TP). Globally, an estimated six million new cases of syphilis are diagnosed annually, most of the infections occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) and congenital syphilis is not uncommon. An analysis on trend over time of syphilis in 132 countries showed that between 2012 and 2016, the prevalence of active syphilis in women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) had increased in 78 countries, of which 10 (13%) were substantive (≥ 10% proportionally, ≥ 0.10% percentage-point absolute difference and non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals in 2012 and 2016) whilst among 54 countries with observed decreased prevalence only five (9%) countries experienced a substantive decrease.

Treatment of syphilis is relatively simple, effective and inexpensive with one dose of Benzathine penicillin. However, diagnosis of active syphilis, particularly in LMICs, is often challenging due to the persistence of IgG antibodies to TP after prior treated syphilis infections, which necessitates a combination of treponemal (e.g. TPHA, TPPA) and non-treponemal (e.g. RPR) tests to distinguish active from past treated infections. Availability and introduction of point-of-care tests (POCTs) has increased access to testing for syphilis; however, current POCTs for serological diagnosis of syphilis only detect IgG or both IgG and IgM antibodies specific to TP. It is known that serological tests based on IgG cannot distinguish between active and treated infections, and IgM tests can be highly sensitive in symptomatic patients but have suboptimal sensitivity in asymptomatic cases.

4 SYPHILIS TESTING

4.1 Serology

Serologic screening is the most efficacious strategy to identify and treat syphilis because clinical diagnosis can be difficult, as symptoms and signs might mimic other diseases, be undervalued, or not perceived. A guide for syphilis serological interpretation is provided in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Interpretation chart for the serodiagnosis of syphilis.

The choice of algorithm should be based on available laboratory resources, test volume, and patient populations served. In the laboratory‐based reverse sequence algorithm, a treponemal test (automated treponemal enzyme immunoassay or chemiluminescence assay) is used first, followed by a quantitative non‐treponemal test (Figure 5). Because treponemal tests remain positive after previous syphilis, even if adequately treated, the ideal strategy recommends performing a treponemal test followed, if positive, by a non‐treponemal serological test to confirm syphilis. This strategy should be preferred only if quick results and, if positive, rapid follow‐up visits of pregnant women are guaranteed. A patient with reactive results on both treponemal and non‐treponemal tests should be considered infected unless prior treatment results in a decrease by a factor of 4 from the pretreatment non‐treponemal titer is appropriately documented, maintaining a stable low titer for non‐treponemal test, and no concern about reinfection. In cases where there are delays in obtaining non‐treponemal test results, treatment based solely on the positive treponemal test is recommended, provided there is no prior history of treated syphilis.

FIGURE 5
WHO's Syphilis reverse testing strategy with Laboratory Support to inform treatment. This algorithm begins with a treponemal test (TT), like the rapid syphilis treponemal (RST) test; if this initial test is positive, it advises proceeding to a non‐treponemal test (NTT), like the rapid plasma reagin (RPR). *In certain regions, the NTT can be conducted rapidly and automatically if the TT is positive, allowing us to wait for the results of both tests before treatment. If delays are expected in obtaining NTT results, it is recommended to treat based solely on the positive TT — provided there is no prior history of treated syphilis.

### Syphilis testing, typing, and treatment follow-up: a new era for an old disease [^1139mB3Z]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The past 15 years have seen a dramatic increase in syphilis diagnoses in several regions including China, North America, Western Europe and Australia. Worldwide, the disease remains prevalent, contributing to substantial adult morbidity and neonatal mortality. Testing and treatment strategies are largely informed by data from the early antibiotic era, but increasing use of molecular diagnostics and new screening strategies could improve the management of syphilis substantially.

Recent Findings

The review explores new testing strategies for syphilis, including the importance of screening test selection and advances in point-of-care diagnostics. It then examines molecular studies of Treponema pallidum, covering typing; macrolide resistance; association between genotype and phenotype and the use of PCR in testing and monitoring strategies.

Summary

Clinicians should be aware of testing strategies employed by their laboratories to ensure optimal sensitivity and specificity. Locally available T. pallidum PCR assays may improve the diagnosis of early disease and inform antibiotic choice. Robust serologic follow-up is still required, but predictors of potential treatment failure, including PCR-measured bacterial load, have been identified. Re-treatment should be considered for patients in the serofast state. The publication of T. pallidum genomes would allow further and more detailed study of strains and disease pathogenesis.

The methods used for the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis include direct detection of Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum and serologic testing. Serologic testing relies on both nontreponemal and treponemal tests. In newly developed reverse-sequence screening algorithms, treponemal tests are performed before nontreponemal tests. The management of syphilis requires appropriate staging, treatment, and follow-up of patients along with the prompt reporting of infections to public health authorities to assist with prevention and control efforts. Benzathine penicillin G remains the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis. Screening of populations at higher risk for syphilis is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Preventive Services Task Force, and the World Health Organization. The second article in this continuing medical education series reviews the testing for and the management of sexually acquired syphilis.

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: the development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^111VKXi1]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Findings from our studies have some clinical implications for potential use of the TP-IgA POCT in field settings.

First, for the diagnosis of active syphilis with high RPR titre (≥ 8), the use of TP-IgA POCT as a confirmatory test in combination with a syphilis total antibody POCT could potentially deliver 96% to 100% sensitivity. This level of sensitivity meets the WHO TPP and is similar to that of other rapid POCTs for syphilis available on the market that cannot discriminate past/treated from active syphilis. Diagnosis of active syphilis, however, could be challenging due to variation in patient's clinical manifestations and immune responses at different stages of syphilis. Subjects with a positive treponemal total antibody test but negative non-treponemal (or in this case TP-IgA) test for syphilis could have past/treated syphilis, or in a small proportion could have very early syphilis, long-standing latent syphilis or active syphilis with negative non-treponemal test. Those latter cases could potentially be detected using a second but different treponemal test, and those with two positive treponemal test results and no history of treated syphilis are candidates for treatment. Although clinics in resource-constrained settings may find this challenging, it could still be worth doing given the risk and potential associated cost of missing cases of untreated infection. Results from our study in China indicated that six out of 153 active syphilis cases would have been missed and three out of 151 "no syphilis" cases would have been unnecessarily treated if only the TP-IgA POCT had been used. However, if used together with other rapid tests the first six cases would be deemed as requiring treatment and the later three cases would be deemed biological false positives. We therefore suggest that the TP-IgA POCT would be most suitable for use in combination with a standard rapid treponemal total antibody test for diagnosis of active syphilis infections in clinic settings. This would be an effective and efficient testing algorithm in settings with limited laboratory capacity. (Fig. 2)

INTRODUCTION

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI), caused by the spirochete bacterium, Treponema pallidum. It is transmitted by direct sexual contact or through vertical transmission from the mother to child during pregnancy and can cause substantial morbidity and mortality. The number of syphilis cases in the USA is currently on the rise. According to the recent WHO report, infection cases have escalated globally by over 1 million in 2022, reaching a total of 8 million, which included 700,000 cases of congenital syphilis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the cases increased by nearly 80% between 2018 and 2022 (from 115,000 to more than 207,000). The rise in syphilis can be attributed to multiple factors including social and behavioral changes in this pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) era; health disparities, particularly among sexual and gender minority populations; lack of timely testing and adequate treatment; intersections with the HIV and substance use epidemics; and increased maternal transmission leading to congenital syphilis infections. Syphilis is a chronic, multi-stage disease. The natural course of syphilis progresses through four stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages, with the primary and secondary stages being the most infectious. It is optimal to treat syphilis in its early stages for favorable patient outcomes; however, cure in later stages may require additional or differing penicillin regimens. If left untreated, syphilis can lead to serious complications and permanent damage in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, which can be life-threatening. Syphilis during pregnancy, if untreated or treated late, can result in serious adverse birth outcomes including stillbirths, neonatal deaths, prematurity, low birth weight, and congenitally infected infants. As many people are often asymptomatic or may not notice symptoms, screening is a crucial step in the diagnosis. There is no natural immunity to syphilis, and the antibodies generated from past infection are insufficient to confer protection against re-infection.

### Syphilis and HIV: a dangerous combination [^113xG4Y9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

HIV and syphilis affect similar patient groups and co-infection is common. All patients presenting with syphilis should be offered HIV testing and all HIV-positive patients should be regularly screened for syphilis. Syphilis agent may enhance the transmission of the other, probably through increased incidence of genital ulcers. Detection and treatment of syphilis can, therefore, help to reduce HIV transmission. Syphilis may present with non-typical features in the HIV-positive patient: there is a higher rate of symptomless primary syphilis and proportionately more HIV-positive patients present with secondary disease. Secondary infection may be more aggressive and there is an increased rate of early neurological and ophthalmic involvement. Diagnosis is generally made with serology but the clinician should be aware of the potential for false-negative serology in both primary and, less commonly, in secondary syphilis. All HIV-positive patients should be treated with a penicillin-based regimen that is adequate for the treatment of neurosyphilis. Relapse of infection is more likely in the HIV-positive patient and careful follow-up is required.

Syphilis partner management in adults and adolescents with HIV — Individuals with recent sexual contact with a person with syphilis in any stage should be evaluated clinically and serologically and treated presumptively. People who have had sexual contact with an individual diagnosed with primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis during the 90 days preceding the diagnosis should be treated presumptively for early syphilis, even if serologic test results are negative (AII). People who have had sexual contact with a person who receives a diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis > 90 days before the diagnosis should be treated presumptively for early syphilis if serologic test results are not immediately available and the opportunity for follow-up is uncertain (AIII). Long-term sexual partners of people who have late latent syphilis should be evaluated clinically and serologically and should receive treatment based on the results of the evaluation's findings. The following sex partners of people with syphilis are considered at risk for infection and should be confidentially notified of the exposure and need for evaluation: partners who have had sexual contact within (1) 3 months plus the duration of symptoms for people who receive a diagnosis of primary syphilis, (2) 6 months plus the duration of symptoms for those diagnosed with secondary syphilis, and (3) 1 year for people diagnosed with early latent syphilis.

Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy

Penicillin and other ß-lactam antibiotics have a crucial role in treating STIs. Penicillin is recommended for all clinical stages of syphilis, and no proven alternatives exist for treating neurosyphilis, congenital syphilis, or syphilis during pregnancy. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is recommended for gonorrhea treatment. For extragenital site infections, especially pharyngeal, failure rates of nonceftriaxone regimens can be substantial. In most clinical settings, patients who report a penicillin allergy are not treated with ß-lactam antimicrobials. For patients with a diagnosis of gonorrhea and a concomitant reported allergy to penicillin, ceftriaxone is often avoided, even though the cross-reactivity between penicillin allergy and third-generation cephalosporins is low.

Prevalence of reported allergy to penicillin is approximately 10% among the U.S. population and higher among hospital inpatients and residents in health care–related facilities. One large study in an STI clinic revealed that 8.3% of patients reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy. Penicillin allergy is often overreported, with the majority of patients who report penicillin allergy able to tolerate the medication. The prevalence of reported penicillin allergy in low-income countries is unknown; however, limited data indicate that penicillin is one of the most frequently reported antibiotic allergies.

Patients often are incorrectly labeled as allergic to penicillin and are therefore denied the benefit of a ß-lactam therapy. The presence of a penicillin allergy label considerably reduces prescribing options for affected patients. Moreover, penicillin allergy labels lead to the use of more expensive and less effective drugs and can result in adverse consequences, including longer length of hospital stay and increased risk for infection. Multiple studies have described that persons with reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy have higher rates of surgical-site infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, and higher medical care usage (,–).

The overreported prevalence of penicillin allergy is secondary to imprecise use of the term "allergy" by families and clinicians and lack of clarity to differentiate between immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, drug intolerances, and other idiosyncratic reactions that can occur days after exposure. Approximately 80% of patients with a true IgE-mediated allergic reaction to penicillin have lost the sensitivity after 10 years. Thus, patients with recent reactions are more likely to be allergic than patients with remote reactions, and patients who had allergic reactions in the distant past might no longer be reactive.

### Management of adult syphilis: key questions to inform the 2015 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^1125zahY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

A panel of experts generated 8 "key questions" in the management of adult syphilis. A systematic literature review was conducted and tables of evidence were constructed to answer these important questions. Penicillin is the drug of choice to treat syphilis. Doxycycline to treat early and late latent syphilis is an acceptable alternate option if penicillin cannot be used. There is no added benefit to enhanced antimicrobial therapy when treating human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons with syphilis. If a patient misses a dose of penicillin in a course of weekly therapy for late syphilis, clinical experience suggests that an interval of 10–14 days between doses might be acceptable before restarting the sequence of injections. Pharmacologic considerations suggest that an interval of 7–9 days between doses, if feasible, may be more optimal. Missed doses are not acceptable for pregnant women. A cerebrospinal fluid examination to diagnose neurosyphilis is recommended in persons diagnosed with tertiary syphilis (eg, cardiovascular syphilis or late benign syphilis), persons with neurological signs or symptoms consistent with neurosyphilis, and asymptomatic persons whose serological titers do not decline appropriately following recommended therapy and in whom reinfection is ruled out. Infection and reinfection rates, particularly among men who have sex with men, are high. Frequent serological screening of this population appears to be the most cost-efficient intervention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend the use of the traditional rapid plasma reagin-based screening algorithm. The positive predictive value for syphilis associated with an isolated unconfirmed reactive treponemal chemiluminescence assay or enzyme immunoassay is low if the epidemiological risk and clinical probability for syphilis are low. Among pregnant women with serodiscordant serologies (positive treponemal tests and a negative nontreponemal test), the risk of vertical transmission from mother to infant is low. Several important questions regarding the management of syphilis remain unanswered and should be a priority for future research.

Late latent syphilis monitoring — response to therapy should be monitored using nontreponemal serologic tests at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months to ensure at least a fourfold decline in titer, if initially high (≥ 1:32), within 24 months of therapy. Data to define precise time intervals are limited and many people with low titers and late latent syphilis do not have a fourfold decline in the initial titer; if clinical symptoms develop or a fourfold increase in nontreponemal titers is sustained over 2 weeks, then treatment failure or reinfection should be considered and managed per recommendations, and the potential for reinfection should be based on sexual history and risk assessment.

Serologic Response After Treatment

Nontreponemal antibody titers usually decrease at least fourfold during the 12 months after syphilis treatment (Figure 1), particularly among persons treated during the early stages of infection, and might become nonreactive over time, especially among patients treated before the secondary stage of syphilis. However, in certain persons, the decrease in nontreponemal antibody titers is less than fourfold despite recommended treatment. A prospective randomized, double-blind, multisite study of therapy for early syphilis (n = 541) found that 14% of patients had a less than fourfold serologic titer decline 12 months posttreatment; patients living with HIV infection who had primary or secondary syphilis were more likely to have an inadequate response than those without HIV infection. In addition, titers might not serorevert to a nonreactive result after treatment and remain persistently reactive, often referred to as the serofast state. This state is most common in persons treated ≥ 1 year after acquiring syphilis or in persons with multiple episodes of syphilis. Titers are typically ≤ 1:8, but higher titers also have been observed. Additional recommendations regarding clinical interpretation of nontreponemal titers are available in CDC's Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021.

Principles for Syphilis Diagnosis

Indications for syphilis testing include identification of individual, population, or community risk factors for exposure to T. pallidum; signs and symptoms suggestive of syphilis; or a known sexual contact of someone who has syphilis. The selection of laboratory tests and interpretation of results vary by stage of syphilis and previous treatment history. After diagnosis and staging has occurred, benzathine penicillin G is the recommended therapy for clinical resolution of infection and avoidance of sequelae. Patients with a history of penicillin allergy should be managed according to CDC's Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021.

Testing for syphilis is based on the detection of reactive antibodies (typically in serum or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]), suggestive of exposure to T. pallidum; direct observation of the organism by darkfield or fluorescent microscopy of lesion fluids or exudate; or histologic assessment of infected tissues or amplification of T. pallidum- specific nucleic acid sequences in fluids, exudate, or tissue biopsy material. Conventional microscopy used to examine Gram-stained smears is insufficient to visualize T. pallidum because of the bacterium's slender morphology and poor uptake of aniline dyes. No available nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are cleared by FDA for marketing in the United States, and culture for T. pallidum is cumbersome and is available only in selected research laboratories. Nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests are most suitable for screening or diagnosis in conjunction with a medical history and physical examination when antibody titers are important to determine recent exposure to infection, a presumptive diagnosis in persons with signs or symptoms suggestive of syphilis, or to determine response to treatment.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1129Ggue]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Syphilis in people with HIV — definitions of latent, early latent, and late latent syphilis explains that latent syphilis is serological evidence of syphilis (nontreponemal and treponemal testing) without clinical manifestations. Early latent syphilis may occur between primary and secondary stages or after resolution of secondary manifestations and is defined by evidence of infection during the preceding year by a documented seroconversion or fourfold or greater increase in nontreponemal titer, symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis, or a sex partner with documented primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis. Late latent syphilis is defined as syphilis in a person without evidence of acquiring infection in the preceding year.

Syphilis prevention in people with HIV — partner management, counseling, and screening include the following: treat "Individuals exposed sexually within 90 days preceding the diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis in a sex partner regardless of syphilis serologic status (AII)" and treat "Individuals exposed > 90 days before syphilis diagnosis in a sex partner, if syphilis serologic test results are not available immediately and the opportunity for follow-up is uncertain (AIII)". Primary prevention "should begin with a behavioral risk assessment and routine discussion of sexual behaviors", and "Health care providers should discuss patient-centered risk reduction messages and advise specific actions that can reduce the risk of acquiring STIs and of transmitting HIV". "Routine serologic screening for syphilis is recommended at least annually for all people with HIV who are sexually active, with more frequent screening (every 3–6 months) for those who have multiple or anonymous partners", and "The occurrence of syphilis or any other STI in a person with HIV is an indication of risk behaviors that should prompt intensified risk assessment".

Perform a neurologic examination and administer retreatment with benzathine penicillin G 2, 400,000 units at 1-week intervals for 3 weeks in these patients.
Do not perform a repeat CSF assessment if titers do not respond appropriately after retreatment. Consider administering benzathine penicillin G 2, 400,000 units IM without a CSF assessment, unless signs or symptoms of neurosyphilis are present, and obtaining close clinical follow-up in patients at high risk of syphilis reinfection having recurrent signs and symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis or a 4× increase in non-treponemal titers within the past year.

What about follow-up?

Because syphilis has no test-of-cure, conversion to a non-reactive RPR is the best evidence of successful treatment. Patients should be tested at the start of treatment and monitored at six and 12 months. No clinical data guide interpretation of RPR titres after treatment, and guidelines are based on expert opinion. See table 3 for recommendations from European, UK, US, Canadian, and WHO guidelines.

### Syphilis: a review [^117MGcMm]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Syphilis is an infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum, a gram-negative, spirochete bacterium. Worldwide, an estimated 8 million adults aged 18 to 49 years acquired syphilis in 2022. From 2019 to 2023, US syphilis cases increased by 61% overall, with diagnoses among females increasing by 112% and congenital syphilis cases increasing by 106%.

Observations

Syphilis is transmitted via contact with infectious lesions during vaginal, anal, or oral sex or via the placenta during pregnancy. Individuals at increased risk for syphilis include people with HIV, those engaging in condomless sex with multiple partners, and men who have sex with men (MSM)-who comprised one-third (32.7%) of all males with primary and secondary syphilis in 2023. Early syphilis is defined as syphilis in the first year after infection and includes symptomatic (primary and secondary) and asymptomatic (early latent) stages. Primary syphilis is characterized by painless anogenital lesions. Secondary syphilis is associated with a diffuse rash, mucocutaneous lesions, and lymphadenopathy. Syphilis diagnosed more than a year after infection is referred to as late syphilis and includes asymptomatic (late latent) and symptomatic (tertiary) stages. Neurosyphilis, which can occur at any stage, can lead to meningitis, uveitis, hearing loss, or stroke. In pregnancy, up to 40% of fetuses with in-utero exposure to syphilis are stillborn or die from their infection during infancy. The diagnosis of syphilis relies on serologic reactivity along with a clinical history and presentation consistent with active or latent syphilis infection. The recommended treatment for syphilis is benzathine penicillin G administered as intramuscular doses of 2.4 million units: a single injection for early stage and 3 weekly injections for late latent stage syphilis. Strategies to identify and prevent syphilis infections include (1) screening of sexually active people aged 15 to 44 years at least once and at least annually for those at increased risk, (2) screening 3 times in pregnant individuals (at the first prenatal visit, during the third trimester, and at delivery), (3) counseling about condom use, and (4) offering doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (200-mg doxycycline taken within 72 hours after sex as postexposure prophylaxis) to MSM and transgender women with a history of a sexually transmitted infection in the past year.

Conclusions and Relevance

Syphilis infections, including congenital syphilis, have increased in the US and worldwide over the past decade. First-line treatment for syphilis is benzathine penicillin G. Routine syphilis screening of all pregnant patients and all sexually active people aged 15 to 44 years and use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis in individuals at risk for syphilis infection are recommended strategies to decrease syphilis transmission.

### Syphilis and HIV infection: an update [^114fJkpp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The striking increase in the prevalence of concordant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and syphilis observed by clinicians and public health officers over the past decade has renewed interest in the subject. Although the effect of HIV infection on the natural history of syphilis has been known for a long time, it was not until recently that several studies documented that syphilis may also impact the course of HIV infection. Despite an improved understanding of the interaction of these 2 conditions, many controversies still exist. In this article, we focus on the most recent literature describing the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of syphilis in the context of HIV infection.

### Management of adult syphilis: key questions to inform the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^113fFK3Q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

A panel of experts generated 5 "key questions" in the management of adult syphilis. A systematic literature review was conducted and tables of evidence were constructed to answer these questions. Available data suggest no clinical benefit to > 1 dose of benzathine penicillin G for early syphilis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. While penicillin remains the drug of choice to treat syphilis, doxycycline to treat early and late latent syphilis is an acceptable alternate option if penicillin cannot be used. There are very limited data regarding the impact of additional antibiotic doses on serologic responses in serofast patients and no data on the impact of additional antibiotic courses on long-term clinical outcomes. In patients with isolated ocular or otic signs and symptoms, reactive syphilis serologic results, and confirmed ocular/otic abnormalities at examination, a diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is not necessary, because up to 40% and 90% of patients, respectively, would have no CSF abnormalities. Based on the results of 2 studies, repeated CSF examinations are not necessary for HIV-uninfected patients or HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy who exhibit appropriate serologic and clinical responses after treatment for neurosyphilis. Finally, several important gaps were identified and should be a priority for future research.

DPP HIV-Syphilis Assay

In two studies with 150 and 450 participants that used the FDA-cleared version of the DPP HIV-Syphilis Assay with the DPP Micro Reader, sensitivity and specificity of the DPP HIV-Syphilis Assay for syphilis were 95.3% and 100% and 98.7% and 100%, respectively, when compared with TPPA. Although accurate, low-cost rapid tests have the potential to expand testing to populations who otherwise would not be tested in a timely manner, data are insufficient to recommend when and where to use these tests. Further data on the costs and predictive value of POC serologic tests are needed to assess the implementation of tests in settings that serve populations without regular medical care and those with and without a history of treated syphilis. Costs of testing and timely treatment of persons with untreated syphilis in established syphilis screening programs need to be compared with the costs of reaching, testing, and treating populations in outreach settings, emergency departments, or delivery rooms.

The incidence of syphilis is increasing, and it typically presents in patients with known risk factors, often to genitourinary physicians. Patients presenting to a dermatologist or ophthalmologist will more likely have secondary syphilis, with the potential for having the associated complications.

### An evaluation of a novel dual treponemal / nontreponemal point-of-care test for syphilis as a tool to distinguish active from past treated infection [^112kwTiW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Most syphilis point-of-care (POC) tests detect treponemal antibodies, which persist after successful treatment. Subsequent POC tests are positive, despite no active infection, and can lead to unnecessary treatment. We evaluated a new POC test, incorporating a nontreponemal component, to distinguish active from past infection.

Methods

Sera stored at 2 Australian laboratories were tested with DPP Screen and Confirm Assay. Treponemal and nontreponemal test lines were compared to corresponding conventional treponemal and nontreponemal reference test results: immunoassays and rapid plasma reagin (RPR), respectively, with RPR quantification by endpoint titration. POC test outcome concordance with conventional test results was assessed according to serological and clinical categories.

Results

Among 1005 serum samples tested, DPP treponemal line sensitivity was 89.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 87.3%-91.9%) and specificity was 99.3% (95% CI, 97.0%-99.9%). DPP nontreponemal line sensitivity was 94.2% (95% CI, 91.8%-96.0%) and specificity was 62.2% (95% CI, 57.5%-66.6%). DPP test outcome (pair of test lines) was concordant with both reference test results for 94.3% of 404 high-titer infections, 90.1% of 121 low-titer infections, 27.5% of 211 past/treated infections, and 78.1% of 242 infections classified as not syphilis. Among 211 past/treated infections, 49.8% were incorrectly identified as active infection and a further 22.8% as not syphilis.

Conclusions

DPP test use would result in identification of > 93% of active syphilis infections, whereas just over half of past infections would be diagnosed as past or not syphilis, avoiding unnecessary treatment compared with other POC tests. This may be at the expense of missing some active infections; thus, its potential benefits will depend on the prevalence of past vs active infection in a population.

### Syphilis infection prevalence in the middle east and north Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116eHAVp]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

PubMed and Embase search results were combined in EndNote (Thomson Reuters, USA) where duplicates were identified and excluded. Titles and abstracts were then screened independently by two authors (MEJ, BA, AAT, MH, IF, and SA). The full-texts of potentially relevant citations were retrieved and screened for eligibility. Any report with primary data on the prevalence of syphilis in any of the 24 MENA countries was considered eligible for inclusion in the review. Qualitative studies, editorials, letters to editors, commentaries, and reviews were excluded. Although excluded, relevant reviews were screened to make sure no studies were missed. Bibliographies of all included reports were also hand searched for additional reports. Prevalence measures extracted from UNAIDS IBBSS database, the WHO Global Health Observatory, and from international conferences were compared with records identified through PubMed and Embase to avoid duplication. Discrepancies between independent reviewers were resolved by GRM.

Data extraction

The data was double extracted independently by MEJ, BA, AAT, MH, FD, IF, and ES using a pre-designed computerized data extraction sheet. Discrepancies were settled either by consensus, including also GRM and LJA, or by contacting the authors. Full-texts of articles in French were extracted by French-speaking authors (GRM and MH) (n = 9). Data from one article in Farsi was extracted from the English abstract. All other articles were in English. Both overall and stratified syphilis prevalence rates were extracted, when applicable.

Syphilis diagnostics and categorization

Syphilis is a complex and challenging infection to diagnose with currently available diagnostics. Since it is not possible to culture T. pallidum on artificial media, serological tests remain the mainstay of syphilis diagnosis. Typically, the serologic diagnosis of syphilis requires the detection of both treponemal and non-treponemal antibodies. Yet, in most circumstances, it is challenging to distinguish current from previously treated infections based on a set of serologic test results alone, without review of past serologic test results, patient history, or physical examination results. This comprehensive assessment is, however, not typically available in most studies of syphilis prevalence, where only treponemal and/or non-treponemal test results are reported and used to diagnose syphilis. Therefore, in this review, syphilis prevalence measures have been categorized based on the results of the serological test(s) reported in eligible studies.

RESULTS

Clinical and Serological Baseline Characteristics

From January 1999 to December 2008, 456 patients were diagnosed with syphilis. A total of 192 patients were excluded (93 did not attend follow-up serological testing; 42 had incomplete data about therapy or did not receive antibiotic treatment; 20 received nonstandard therapy; 24 started therapy > 2 weeks after diagnosis; and 13 had incomplete clinical data). Characteristics of the remaining 264 patients are shown in Table 1 (see also). Of the included patients, 92% were men, 42% were known to be HIV positive, and 13% had a history of previous syphilis (ie, they were considered reinfected). HIV coinfection was significantly associated with male sex (P = 0.001), hepatitis B infection (P = 0.031), history of previous syphilis (P = 0.002), higher number of follow-up visits (P < .001), and longer (P < .001) mean duration of follow-up (Table 1). HIV coinfection was also significantly associated with clinical stage of syphilis (P = 0.009); patients with primary syphilis presented less frequently with HIV infection than did patients with secondary or latent syphilis. Concerning therapy, only 7 of 27 HIV patients with primary syphilis received 1 dose of benzathine penicillin G, whereas 20 received 3 doses.

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: the development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^112cYzFg]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The Dual Path Platform (DPP) Syphilis Screen & Confirm test (Chembio Diagnositcs, Medford, NY, USA) is the first commercially available rapid POCT that gives both treponemal and non-treponemal results that assist in distinguishing between current and past infection. However, marked variation in diagnostic performance of the test has been reported particularly in the sensitivity and specificity of the non-treponemal component. A laboratory evaluation in Australiareported that 49·8% (105/211) presumptive past treated serum samples were misclassified as active syphilis by the DPP test, whereas a field evaluation among pregnant women in Burkina Fasoshowed 48·4% (44/91) women with active syphilis would be undiagnosed had the DPP test been used. The difference in test performance can be partly explained by the lot-to-lot variation as a laboratory study in the United Statesshowed a significant difference in the sensitivity for the non-treponemal component of the DPP in two different lots studied - 65·3% (95%CI: 60·5–69·8) and 80·9% (95%CI: 72·6–87·2) respectively.

Given that the re-emergence of a syphilis epidemic among pregnant women and key populations is a global health concern, innovative assays using a biomarker that can accurately distinguish between past, treated and active infection at the point-of-care (POC) are need. Access to such an assay will improve diagnosis and facilitate appropriate treatment in a timely manner. To promote research and development of reliable, low-cost POCTs for syphilis, the WHO developed a Target Product Profile (TPP) identifying minimum and preferred assay performance for screening and confirmation of active syphilis (and other STIs). The TPP specifies a minimum clinical sensitivity of > 80% for patients with high-titre RPR (≥ 8) and specificity of > 80%, with optimal performance of > 90% and > 95%, respectively, for screening and confirmation of syphilis infection. The WHO TPP also highlighted the need for identification of new markers for acute syphilis infection. With these needs in mind, researchers at the Burnet Institute developed a novel POCT for diagnosis of active syphilis infection based on detection of TP-specific IgA antibodies.

### Current controversies in the management of adult syphilis [^1126ef59]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical management of patients with syphilis is controversial. This article summarizes recent research on syphilis treatment efficacy and outcomes and is based on a comprehensive systematic review of published literature, relevant abstracts, conference proceedings, technical reports, and guidelines. Penicillin remains the drug of choice for the treatment of syphilis. Although several studies have suggested that azithromycin may have clinical efficacy, macrolide resistance has been widely documented among strains of Treponema pallidum, and treatment failures have been reported. Ceftriaxone is effective for the treatment of syphilis when used in multiple-dose regimens. Lumbar puncture should be performed for human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with syphilis of > 1 year's duration and a serum nontreponemal test titer ≥ 1: 32, as well for other patients for whom the clinical suspicion of neurosyphilis is high. Newer laboratory tests for syphilis are undergoing extensive evaluation and may prove to be useful for future clinical care. American and European approaches to syphilis treatment are similar, but they vary across several parameters.

Objective

To review the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of syphilis.

Data Sources

Studies and reviews were abstracted from MEDLINE (1950-April 2007) using the search term syphilis. All papers were cross-referenced to identify additional studies and reviews for inclusion.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Pertinent original research articles, review articles, and book chapters were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Syphilis is a spirochetal disease that has plagued mankind for centuries. Following a low incidence of syphilis in the US for the last 2 decades, rates are now increasing both in the US and other parts of the world. Once acquired, syphilis can pass through 4 distinct stages of disease: primary syphilis, secondary syphilis, latent syphilis, and tertiary syphilis, with each stage being characterized by different symptoms and levels of infectivity. Diagnosis is made primarily by serologic assays with nontreponemal tests such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory and the Rapid Plasma Reagin assay used for screening. Treponemal tests including the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination and the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test are then used for confirmation. Recommended treatment regimens are based largely on uncontrolled trials and clinical experience. Penicillin is the treatment of choice, with the preparation and treatment duration varying for different stages. Benzathine penicillin is the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis except neurosyphilis, for which aqueous crystalline penicillin or procaine penicillin is used due to the central nervous system penetration of these formulations. Coinfection with both syphilis and HIV occurs frequently due to common risk factors. These 2 diseases interact with each other, making both diagnosis and treatment more complicated.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of syphilis as well as current guidelines for the management and treatment of this disease.

### Syphilis: far from ancient history [^115koTKH]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Rates of primary, secondary, and congenital syphilis are increasing in the United States, and reversing this trend requires renewed vigilance on the part of family physicians to assist public health agencies in the early detection of outbreaks. Prompt diagnosis of syphilis can be challenging, and not all infected patients have common manifestations, such as a genital chancre or exanthem. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for syphilis in all patients at increased risk, particularly those who reside in high-prevalence areas, sexually active people with HIV infection, and men who have sex with men. Other groups at increased risk include males 29 years or younger and people with a history of incarceration or sex work. All pregnant women should be screened for syphilis at the first prenatal visit, and those at increased risk should be screened throughout the pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the traditional screening algorithm for most U.S. populations. Penicillin is the preferred treatment across all stages of syphilis, although limited research suggests a possible role for other antibiotics in penicillin-allergic patients with primary or secondary syphilis. Pregnant women with syphilis who are allergic to penicillin should undergo penicillin desensitization before treatment.

### Effectiveness and safety of algorithm for treating pregnant women with syphilis and history of immediate allergy to penicillin [^112D2wPe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Syphilis is a systemic bacterial infection, exclusively human, curable, and caused by Treponema pallidum, a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the spirochete group, with high infectivity through sexual transmission. A significant proportion of individuals infected with syphilis may remain asymptomatic, and this lack of awareness can contribute to its continued transmission within communities. In the case of pregnant women, it is estimated that 60% to 80% of cases are diagnosed during the latent, asymptomatic phase of the disease, primarily through routine prenatal screening. Additionally, with the advent of more effective treatment for human immunodeficiency virus, there has been a decline in preventive measures against other sexually transmitted infections, including syphilis, leading to a subsequent increase in these infections.,

Syphilis can be transmitted vertically from mother to baby during pregnancy, through the placenta, or during childbirth, leading to congenital syphilis in newborns. The likelihood of fetal infection depends on the mother's stage of syphilis and the duration of fetal exposure, with the highest transmission risk occurring when the mother has primary or secondary syphilis during pregnancy. Syphilis in pregnancy is the second leading cause of stillbirth worldwide. Intrauterine exposure to Treponema pallidum can result in severe consequences, with adverse pregnancy outcomes in more than 50% of cases, including miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death, and both early and late complications in live-born infants.

### CDC laboratory recommendations for syphilis testing, United States, 2024 [^1126Hos8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

The interval between primary to secondary and secondary to tertiary syphilis is known as latency when no symptoms or signs of syphilis are present. The interval from secondary to tertiary syphilis can last for years or decades before symptoms appear. In up to two thirds of patients, the disease can remain latent for life and never progress to tertiary syphilis. Latent asymptomatic syphilis is divided into three categories: early latent infections thought to have been acquired within the past year; late latent infections thought to be longer than 1 year duration; and latent syphilis of unknown duration where the timing of acquisition cannot be determined based on available clinical, historical, or laboratory data. Clinical signs of tertiary syphilis, a rare condition, include cardiovascular syphilis, with aneurysms or stenosis resulting from multiplication of treponemal spirochetes in the thoracic aorta or coronary arteries; syphilitic gummas, with soft granulomatous growths that can cause tissue destruction in any organ system including bones and cartilage; and neurosyphilis, with late neurologic manifestations including tabes dorsalis and general paresis. Neurosyphilis can occur during any stage of syphilis and can be asymptomatic or symptomatic during any stage of infection.

Rationale for New CDC Recommendations

Syphilis, a nationally notifiable disease with approximately 176,000 cases in the United States reported to the CDC in 2021 and approximately 6 million new cases occurring worldwide, is caused by T. pallidum. A syphilis epidemic is occurring in the United States, with sustained increases in primary and secondary syphilis from 5,979 cases reported in 2000 to 133,945 cases reported in 2020, a 2,140% increase. The epidemic is characterized by health disparities, particularly among sexual and gender minority populations, intersections with the HIV and substance use epidemics, and increased morbidity and mortality attributable to congenital syphilis infections.

Laboratories have a critical role in the public health response to the syphilis epidemic. The responsibility of the laboratory is to test specimens and report results in a timely manner, allowing clinicians to efficiently make clinical diagnoses for patient management. Public health reporting by laboratories also allows local health departments and CDC to conduct surveillance and monitor disease trends. This report details CDC's new recommendations for syphilis testing, including laboratory-based tests, point-of-care (POC) tests, processing of samples, and reporting of test results to aid laboratorians and clinicians in the diagnosis of syphilis. Future revisions to these recommendations will be based on new research or technologic advancements for syphilis clinical laboratory science.

What should I do with inconclusive results?

Generally, inconclusive results arise in early infection or from waning antibody levels in late infection. The most common combinations are:

A positive RPR with negative treponemal screening (EIA/CLIA) and confirmatory tests (TPPA) suggests the RPR result is a false positive
A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with negative confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR is likely a false positive but could indicate early infection
A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with indeterminant confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR could represent waning antibody levels after a previous, treated infection or a new infection.

When results are inconclusive, clinicians should inquire about previous syphilis infection and treatment, and, if early syphilis is possible, retest in two to four weeks. If results are unchanged, interpretation is based on history — consider the possibility of late untreated infection, treated infection, or non-venereal treponemal disease in adults from endemic countries in South and Central America, South-East Asia, and Africa.

### Syphilis [^113freNP]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on syphilis:

- **Definition**: Syphilis is a STI caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of syphilis involves the entry of Treponema pallidum through mucous membranes or broken skin during sexual contact. Within days to weeks, Treponema pallidum disseminates via blood and lymphatic vessels and accumulates in perivascular spaces of different organs, leading to various clinical manifestations.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis in the US is estimated at 17.7 per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of late syphilis or syphilis of unknown duration in the US is estimated at 26.3 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for syphilis include unprotected sex, having multiple sexual partners, homelessness, history of HIV, history of other STIs, tobacco use, and illicit drug use.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of syphilis is divided into stages. Primary syphilis is characterized by a chancre, typically a single, painless, indurated ulcer with a clean base discharging clear serum. Secondary syphilis involves multisystem manifestations such as a non-itching skin rash, fever, and generalized lymphadenopathy. The latent stage is asymptomatic, and tertiary syphilis can involve neurological, cardiovascular, or gummatous complications.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of syphilis is generally good if detected and treated early, with penicillin being the mainstay of treatment.

Treponemal Tests and Reverse Sequence Algorithm

The majority of patients who have reactive treponemal tests will have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives, regardless of adequate treatment or disease activity. However, 15%–25% of patients treated during the primary stage revert to being serologically nonreactive after 2–3 years. Treponemal antibody titers do not predict treatment response and therefore should not be used for this purpose.

Clinical laboratories sometimes screen syphilis serologic samples by using automated treponemal immunoassays, typically by EIA or CIA. This reverse sequence algorithm for syphilis testing can identify persons previously treated for syphilis, those with untreated or incompletely treated syphilis, and those with false-positive results that can occur with a low likelihood of infection. Persons with a positive treponemal screening test should have a standard quantitative nontreponemal test with titer performed reflexively by the laboratory to guide patient management decisions. If the nontreponemal test is negative, the laboratory should perform a treponemal test different from the one used for initial testing, preferably TP-PA or treponemal assay based on different antigens than the original test, to adjudicate the results of the initial test.

If a second treponemal test is positive (e.g. EIA reactive, RPR nonreactive, or TP-PA reactive), persons with a history of previous treatment will require no further management unless sexual history indicates a reexposure. In this instance, a repeat nontreponemal test 2–4 weeks after a confirmed medical history and physical examination is recommended to evaluate for early infection. Those without a history of treatment for syphilis should be offered treatment. Unless a medical history or results of a physical examination indicate a recent infection, previously untreated persons should be treated for syphilis of unknown duration or late latent syphilis.

If the second treponemal test is negative (e.g. EIA reactive, RPR nonreactive, TP-PA nonreactive) and the epidemiologic risk and clinical probability for syphilis are low, further evaluation or treatment is not indicated.

Multiple studies demonstrate that high quantitative index values or high signal-to-cutoff ratio from treponemal EIA or CIA tests correlate with TP-PA positivity, which might eliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing; however, the range of index values varies among different treponemal immunoassays, and the values that correspond to high levels of reactivity with confirmatory testing might differ by immunoassay (,–).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing exposure and disease in persons with HIV infection — primary prevention should begin with a behavioral risk assessment and routine discussion of sexual behaviors, and health care providers should discuss client-centered risk reduction messages and provide specific actions that reduce sexually transmitted disease acquisition and HIV transmission. Routine serologic screening for syphilis is recommended at least annually for all sexually active persons with HIV infection, with more frequent screening (i.e., every 3–6 months) for those with multiple or anonymous partners; the occurrence of syphilis or any other sexually transmitted infection should prompt intensified risk assessment, counseling, and strong consideration of referral for behavioral intervention. Patients undergoing screening or treatment for syphilis also should be evaluated for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea at anatomic sites of exposure in men and for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas in women. Frequent serologic screening can identify persons recently infected, sometimes before infectious lesions, and treatment can prevent disease progression and transmission; historically, approximately one-third of sex partners of persons with primary syphilis will develop syphilis within 30 days of exposure.

### Testing for syphilis [^1176pLis]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Syphilis is no longer a disease headed for the history books but a disease on the resurgence. Its rising prevalence in populations of all sexualities has moved it from an unlikely differential diagnosis to an important one not to miss. With a latency to symptoms of sometimes many years, syphilis is a key disease to consider and does not need the clinician to attempt to risk assess the patient. This article seeks to equip the jobbing neurologist to recognise the manifestations of syphilis, and to understand the tests available, the interpretation of results and the limitations of testing. We provide an overview approach to assessing and managing these cases, what to expect and where to seek expert opinion and advice.

### Neurosyphilis in psychiatric practice: a case-based discussion of clinical evaluation and diagnosis [^114pqY76]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Neurosyphilis can present with a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Hence, psychiatrists need to be familiar with tests for syphilis screening and how to interpret syphilis serologic tests.

Methods

We present four cases of patients with positive syphilis tests encountered in a psychiatric hospital.

Results

Two cases were treated for neurosyphilis, while the other two cases did not have active syphilis infection despite positive results.

Conclusion

We thus highlight the challenges encountered by psychiatrists in screening for and diagnosing cases of neurosyphilis.

### Syphilis [^112dmXW2]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Syphilis is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum that is endemic in low-income countries and occurs at lower rates in middle-income and high-income countries. The disease is of both individual and public health importance and, in addition to its direct morbidity, increases risk of HIV infection and can cause lifelong morbidity in children born to infected mothers. Without treatment the disease can progress over years through a series of clinical stages and lead to irreversible neurological or cardiovascular complications. Although syphilis is an ancient disease and the principles of recommended management have been established for decades, diagnosis and management are often challenging because of its varied manifestations and difficulty in interpretation of serological tests used to confirm diagnosis and evaluate response to therapy. In North America and western Europe, incidence of syphilis has increased dramatically in the past decade among men who have sex with men, particularly those with coexistent HIV infection. Only one drug, penicillin, is recommended for syphilis treatment and response to therapy is assessed based on changes over months in serological test titres. Treatment for patients who cannot receive penicillin and management of patients who do not serologically respond to treatment are common clinical problems.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure or reinfection, HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to perform a CSF assessment in patients treated for late latent syphilis and administer retreatment in case of clinical signs or symptoms of syphilis or a sustained 4× increase in serum non-treponemal test titer and being at low risk for reinfection. Consider offering the same strategy in parents having an inadequate serologic response, i.e. < 4× decline in an initially high, ≥ 1:32, non-treponemal test titer, within 12 months for early syphilis and 24 months for late latent syphilis. Administer retreatment according to recommendations for neurosyphilis if CSF assessment is consistent with CNS involvement. Administer benzathine penicillin G 2, 400,000 units IM weekly for 3 doses in patients with a normal CSF examination or without ocular or otic symptoms.
Consider administering benzathine penicillin G 2, 400,000 units IM without a CSF examination, unless signs or symptoms of neurosyphilis are present, and obtaining close clinical follow-up in patients at high risk of reinfection having signs or symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis or a 4× increase in non-treponemal titers within the past year.

Early-stage syphilis monitoring — clinical and serologic responses (fourfold decrease from the nontreponemal titer at the time of treatment) should be performed at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after therapy to ensure resolution of signs and symptoms within 3 to 6 months and seroreversion or a fourfold decline in nontreponemal titers within 24 months. Clinical and serologic responses to treatment are similar in people with HIV, although a slower temporal pattern can occur; if clinical signs and symptoms persist, treatment failure should be considered, and if symptoms recur or there is a sustained fourfold increase in nontreponemal titers of greater than 2 weeks, treatment failure or reinfection should be considered and managed per recommendations. Clinical trial data indicate that 15% to 20% of people treated with recommended therapy for early-stage syphilis will not achieve the fourfold decline at 1 year, and serum nontreponemal test titers may remain reactive, usually ≤ 1:8, for prolonged periods; the potential for reinfection should be based on the sexual history and risk assessment.
