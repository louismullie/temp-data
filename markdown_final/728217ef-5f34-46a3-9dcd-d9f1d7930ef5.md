## Question

use of vaginal estrogen in survivors of er/ pr positive breast cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vaginal estrogen therapy is appropriate for survivors of ER- and/or PR-positive breast cancer, and if so, under what conditions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline stance and when to try nonhormonal options versus local estrogen. Then, I should evaluate systemic absorption data for modern low- and ultra–low-dose vaginal preparations. Next, I will examine breast cancer outcomes overall and in key subgroups, especially women on aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen. After that, I need to verify endometrial safety with low-dose local therapy. Finally, I will outline a practical, risk-stratified approach to product selection, monitoring, shared decision-making, and scenarios where I would avoid or pause therapy, with explicit documentation and oncologist coordination.

> Let me first confirm the baseline approach to GSM in breast cancer survivors. Guidelines consistently recommend starting with nonhormonal measures such as regular vaginal moisturizers and lubricants, pelvic floor therapy, and addressing contributory factors, reserving vaginal estrogen for refractory symptoms and only after discussion with the treating oncologist and informed consent, which I need to ensure is documented clearly [^112cbgqv] [^1156dK5a] [^115uKnuE] [^112nkLqJ] [^112DF5rR].

> Next, I should verify systemic exposure with modern low- and ultra–low-dose vaginal estrogens. RCTs of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal survivors receiving nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors found no meaningful changes in circulating estriol, estradiol, estrone, FSH, or LH over 12 weeks, supporting minimal systemic absorption and improved GSM outcomes; I should confirm these were measured with sensitive assays, and indeed the trials used centralized labs and serial sampling [^113ybKhy] [^112PpAWd] [^112SbLrJ] [^111aAAgH]. Pharmacokinetic reviews further emphasize that ultra–low-dose estradiol inserts (e.g., 4 µg) achieve mean estradiol concentrations under approximately 4–5 pg/mL using LC-MS/MS, with higher early absorption attenuating as the atrophic mucosa "estrogenizes", though the clinical significance of initial small rises appears low; I should double-check that no accumulation was observed over typical use, which is consistent with available data [^116FzXiz] [^114GigQu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oncologic safety; I will now examine recurrence and mortality outcomes. Large real-world datasets show no increased recurrence with vaginal estrogen overall among breast cancer survivors with GSM, and population-based cohorts from Scotland and Wales indicate no excess breast cancer–specific mortality among vaginal estrogen users after diagnosis, which reassures me about overall safety signals at the population level, though confounding and selection must always be considered [^112qVKod] [^112JRWxB].

> But wait, what if concurrent endocrine therapy matters? I should review subgroup data carefully. The Danish national cohort found no significant increase in recurrence overall with vaginal estrogen after early-stage ER-positive cancer, but in the subgroup on aromatase inhibitors there was a modest increase in recurrence risk (adjusted RR about 1.39), without an increase in overall mortality; at first I thought this study showed no increased risk across all subgroups, but hold on, I should verify the AI-specific signal, which indeed was present, prompting caution when complete estrogen suppression is the therapeutic goal in AI-treated women [^116EqLmJ] [^112Psteu].

> Let me consider the mechanistic contrast between AI therapy and tamoxifen. With aromatase inhibitors, the intent is near-zero estrogen exposure, so even small systemic rises from local therapy could be more consequential biologically, whereas tamoxifen's ER antagonism provides receptor-level blockade that may mitigate modest estrogen fluctuations; I should confirm that editorials and guideline commentaries underscore this differential, which they do, advising more caution with AIs than with tamoxifen in this context [^112Psteu] [^1156dK5a] [^112cbgqv].

> I need to ensure endometrial safety is addressed before prescribing. Systematic reviews indicate low-dose vaginal estrogen does not meaningfully increase endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, with historical signals tied to older, higher-dose regimens; I should double-check that contemporary low-dose products were the focus of these reviews and that the hyperplasia rates align with background risk, which they do, supporting no need for routine progestogen opposition with truly low-dose local therapy in women with a uterus [^1124PAnx] [^112B7dgD].

> Now, I should translate this into product selection and dosing that minimize systemic exposure. Preferred options include ultra–low-dose estradiol vaginal inserts (e.g., 4 µg) given their LC-MS/MS–verified very low systemic levels, and ultra–low-dose estriol 0.005% gel supported by RCTs in AI-treated survivors; a silicone estradiol ring may also be considered, noting prospective data without persistent estradiol elevation, although sample sizes are small; I need to favor the lowest effective dose and avoid compounded high-dose products [^116FzXiz] [^113ybKhy] [^112PpAWd] [^11721pRL].

> Let me outline a risk-stratified approach with built-in safeguards. For survivors not on AIs (e.g., on tamoxifen or completed endocrine therapy) with refractory GSM, low-dose VET can be considered after nonhormonal failure via shared decision-making with the oncologist, using the lowest effective dose and interval reassessment; for AI-treated patients, I should confirm there is a cautious pathway: only after maximal nonhormonal measures fail, prefer ultra–low-dose regimens, consider shorter courses with symptom-driven pauses, and discuss the AI subgroup signal explicitly, documenting informed consent [^112cbgqv] [^1156dK5a] [^115uKnuE] [^116EqLmJ] [^112qVKod].

> I should double-check monitoring recommendations to mitigate risk. Although formal mandates are limited, reasonable steps include baseline symptom scoring, periodic reassessment, and in AI-treated women, consideration of ultrasensitive estradiol monitoring by LC-MS/MS during initiation if clinical concern for systemic absorption arises, especially early in therapy when mucosa is most atrophic; I must also counsel regarding red flags such as postmenopausal bleeding and promptly evaluate if they occur [^116FzXiz] [^115XdSXn] [^114GigQu].

> Let me consider alternatives when estrogen is not acceptable or is ineffective. Nonhormonal therapies remain first-line, and vaginal DHEA is a potential option discussed in survivorship literature, though I should confirm the evidence base and note that data in breast cancer survivors are more limited than for VET; targeted pelvic therapies and sexual health interventions can also help, and any consideration of alternatives should still involve oncology input when hormonal activity is plausible [^115daAqV] [^112cbgqv] [^1155QhvK].

> I need to ensure documentation and communication are explicit. For any VET use, I will document symptom severity, prior nonhormonal trials, the shared decision-making discussion including AI-specific risk nuances, the product and dose chosen, monitoring plans, and coordination with the oncology team; I should also include a plan for duration minimization and step-down when feasible, consistent with guideline principles of using the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary time [^112cbgqv] [^1156dK5a] [^115uKnuE].

> In summary, after nonhormonal options fail, low- or ultra–low-dose vaginal estrogen can be appropriate for many ER/PR-positive breast cancer survivors through shared decision-making with oncology, with reassuring PK and clinical safety overall, but I should be cautious in AI-treated patients given the observed recurrence signal in one large cohort and consider additional safeguards or alternatives in that subgroup, always tailoring therapy to symptom burden and patient values while minimizing systemic exposure and duration [^113ybKhy] [^112PpAWd] [^112qVKod] [^112JRWxB] [^116EqLmJ] [^112Psteu] [^116FzXiz] [^1124PAnx].

Vaginal estrogen is not first-line for ER/PR-positive breast cancer survivors due to recurrence concerns, especially with aromatase inhibitors [^116EqLmJ] [^112Psteu]. Use only if nonhormonal options fail, after oncologist consultation and shared decision-making [^115uKnuE]. If used, prefer ultra-low-dose estriol [^113ybKhy] or 4–10 µg estradiol inserts [^116FzXiz], monitor for early transient absorption [^114GigQu], and limit duration [^112mT1cT]. Avoid in active disease or high-risk patients, and monitor for recurrence and endometrial effects.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Nonhormonal options (moisturizers, lubricants, pelvic floor therapy) are recommended initially [^114Go1z6] for GSM in breast cancer survivors [^112cbgqv].

- **Second-line therapy**: Consider low-dose vaginal estrogen only if nonhormonal therapies fail [^114Go1z6], with oncologist involvement and shared decision-making [^115uKnuE].

- **Patient selection**: Use cautiously in ER/PR-positive survivors, especially on aromatase inhibitors [^116EqLmJ], due to potential recurrence risk [^112Psteu].

---

## Evidence on safety and recurrence risk

- **Systemic absorption**: Low-dose vaginal estrogen has minimal systemic absorption [^116FzXiz], but transient early increases can occur [^114GigQu], particularly with atrophic mucosa.

- **Recurrence risk**: Most observational data show no significant recurrence increase overall [^112JRWxB] [^116yvwd9], but a Danish cohort found higher recurrence with vaginal estrogen in AI-treated women (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.04–1.85) [^116EqLmJ].

- **Tamoxifen vs AIs**: Tamoxifen may offset modest estrogen rises [^112Psteu]; AI-treated patients may be more vulnerable to recurrence with vaginal estrogen [^116EqLmJ].

---

## Efficacy in symptom relief

Vaginal estrogen effectively improves **GSM symptoms** [^112PpAWd] and quality of life in breast cancer survivors [^113ybKhy]. Symptom improvement may enhance **adherence**, indirectly supporting outcomes [^112PpAWd] [^1155QhvK].

---

## Alternative non-hormonal therapies

Non-hormonal options such as **moisturizers, lubricants, pelvic floor therapy, and vaginal laser therapy** are effective alternatives [^1155QhvK] [^111jKuzJ]. Emerging evidence supports the **efficacy of vaginal laser therapy** for GSM in breast cancer survivors [^1155QhvK].

---

## Patient selection criteria and contraindications

Reserve use for severe, refractory **GSM** after nonhormonal failure [^112DF5rR], with oncologist input and shared decision-making [^115uKnuE]. Contraindications include **active disease**, **high recurrence risk**, or strong patient preference against hormones.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly assess for **recurrence**, **endometrial hyperplasia** [^1124PAnx], and adverse effects during therapy [^112DF5rR]. Schedule consistent visits [^112DF5rR] to reassess **risks, benefits, and patient preferences** [^115uKnuE].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical guidance** |
|-|-|-|
| Nonhormonal therapies | High | First-line for GSM in breast cancer survivors [^112DF5rR] [^112cbgqv] |
| Vaginal estrogen | Moderate | - Second-line after nonhormonal failure [^114Go1z6] <br/> - Oncologist involvement required [^112DF5rR] [^115uKnuE] |
| Aromatase inhibitor patients | Moderate | - Use cautiously <br/> - Potential recurrence risk [^116EqLmJ] |
| Tamoxifen patients | Moderate | May be safer due to receptor blockade [^116EqLmJ] |
| Monitoring | High | Regular assessment for recurrence and adverse effects [^112DF5rR] [^114Go1z6] [^1124PAnx] |

### Systemic or vaginal hormone therapy after early breast cancer: A Danish observational cohort study [^112Psteu]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Low credibility.

In a recent systematic review concerning the safety of vaginal estrogen therapy (VET), Crandall et al. suggested that slightly elevated serum estrogen levels may be observed within the first 12 weeks following VET. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) lower or nearly eliminate estrogen. As such, even a modest increase in circulating estrogens may have contributed to our observed increased risk of recurrence in the AI-treated subgroup of breast cancer (BC) survivors who received VET. In contrast, tamoxifen competes with estrogen for binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). A modest elevation of the very low serum estrogen levels in AI-treated women is not assumed to counteract the receptor blockade.

The increased risk of recurrence in patients receiving AIs and VET in our study was not accompanied by increased mortality. Therefore, we urge researchers to assess in future studies whether there is an increased mortality associated with VET use in BC survivors, particularly in patients treated with AIs.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^114GigQu]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

We also found that absorption of estradiol was higher with initial administration (when the vaginal lining was atrophic) than at later treatment periods (when the vaginal lining was thickened) in some studies. The reason for this higher early absorption has been hypothesized to be due to the thin, atrophied vaginal lining that undergoes "estrogenization" and thickening with continued use of vaginal estrogens over time. The physiological changes and symptoms associated with VVA, or the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, are well known to be associated with the diminishing levels of circulating estrogens at the time of menopause. For example, the ratio of superficial and parabasal cells in the tissue lining the vagina dramatically changes with the loss of superficial cells at menopause. Several clinical studies show that vaginal estrogen therapies effectively increase the percentage of vaginal superficial cells — essentially "estrogenizing" and thickening the vaginal wall that had atrophied with lower levels of systemic estrogens. Thinner vaginal walls through atrophy are believed to more readily absorb estradiol than thicker, well-rugated vaginal walls resulting from estrogen therapy; however, because not all studies measuring estradiol over time show the difference early versus later in the study, this hypothesis needs further testing. Any biological significance of this acute absorption of estradiol early in treatment is unknown, but not very likely. Additionally, estradiol levels with use for up to 84 days indicated no accumulation of estradiol with the lower-dose product.

### Efficacy and safety of ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer treated with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors: a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113ybKhy]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

Our results provide clinical evidence on the efficacy of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors treated with NSAIs. Despite the ultra-low dose of estriol, the application of the gel is safe and improves vaginal symptoms and signs, including vaginal pH and maturation, associated with the depletion of estrogens that occurs in these patients, resulting in improved sexual function. The negligible impact of the product on the levels of estrogens, FSH, and LH supports the safe use of this ultra-low dose estriol vaginal gel as a treatment option for vulvovaginal atrophy in breast cancer survivors receiving NSAIs.

### Prempro [^115ff5dP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy after several years of use. The risk increased with the duration of use and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater and became apparent earlier with estrogen plus progestin therapy compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

Use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

### Vaginal health during breast cancer treatment [^111jKuzJ]. Current Oncology Reports (2016). Low credibility.

There is an increasing number of breast cancer survivors. Chemotherapy or endocrine therapy results in effects on vaginal health that may affect the quality of life, impacting sexual function, daily comfort, or the ability to perform a pelvic examination. Vulvovaginal atrophy, or genitourinary syndrome of menopause, may be treated with non-hormonal or hormonal measures. Breast cancer survivors who are menopausal and/or on endocrine therapy should be screened for issues with vaginal health and counseled about treatment options.

### What is the optimal endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer [^113Ab8AT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old postmenopausal woman with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer was referred to discuss adjuvant therapy. An annual screening mammogram demonstrated a suspicious mass in the left breast. An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy revealed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma that was estrogen receptor (ER) positive, progesterone receptor (PR) negative, and lacked amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; i.e. HER2 negative).

She underwent excision and sentinel node evaluation, and the pathology demonstrated a 1.9-cm grade 2 invasive cancer without lymphatic vascular invasion. Clean margins were obtained, and both sentinel nodes were free of cancer. The 21-gene recurrence score was 16. She has a body mass index (BMI) of 28.5 but is otherwise healthy; levothyroxine is the only prescription medication she takes.

- **Medical history**: She experienced vaginal spotting 2 years earlier because of an endometrial polyp, which was resected. She exercises regularly and takes a calcium supplement with vitamin D. A bone density study performed 6 months earlier was normal other than mild osteopenia in the femoral neck (T score, -1.3). Radiation therapy is planned.

### A phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer in treatment with aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting [^112SbLrJ]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

In addition to the high physiological variability observed in the serum levels of gonadotropins, which was overcome by analyzing the pretreatment and during‐treatment variability, our study was limited by the unbalanced country representativeness, with all centers being Spanish except one. Of note, this did not affect the laboratory tests, which were performed by two central laboratories in Spain and Austria. Given that our results indicate that the 0.005% estriol gel preparation is safe, the replication of the study using a larger sample size is warranted.

In summary, our results provide confidence in the safe use of ultralow‐dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors treated with NSAIs. The application of the ultralow‐dose estriol vaginal gel has a negligible impact on estrogens, FSH, and LH systemic levels in these patients, whereas the proven efficacy of estriol in symptom relief may improve compliance to adjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer.

### Estrogel [^112mT1cT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribe estrogens, with or without progestogens, at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

- **Warning: Endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disorders, probable dementia, and breast cancer**: See full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning.

- **Estrogen-alone therapy**: There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in women with a uterus who use unopposed estrogens. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen-alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS), an estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, reported an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older. Do not use estrogen-alone therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia.

- **Estrogen plus progestin therapy**: The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of pulmonary embolism (PE), DVT, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). Additionally, it reported increased risks of invasive breast cancer. The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older. Do not use estrogen plus progestogen therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia.

### Systemic or vaginal hormone therapy after early breast cancer: A Danish observational cohort study [^116EqLmJ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Low credibility.

Women treated for breast cancer (BC) often suffer from genitourinary syndrome of menopause. These symptoms may be alleviated by vaginal estrogen therapy (VET) or menopausal hormone therapy (MHT); however, there are concerns about the risks of BC recurrence and subsequent death following treatment.

Our study included longitudinal data from a national cohort of postmenopausal women diagnosed from 1997 to 2004 with early-stage invasive estrogen receptor–positive nonmetastatic BC. These patients either received no treatment or underwent 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. We obtained prescription data on hormone therapy — VET or MHT — from a national prescription registry. We evaluated the mortality and risk of recurrence associated with the use of VET and MHT versus non-use using multivariable models adjusted for potential confounders.

Among 8,461 women who had not received VET or MHT before their BC diagnosis, 1,957 and 133 used VET and MHT, respectively, after diagnosis. The median follow-up period was 9.8 years for recurrence and 15.2 years for mortality. The adjusted relative risk of recurrence was 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89 to 1.32) for patients using VET (1.39 [95% CI = 1.04 to 1.85 in the subgroup receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitors]) and 1.05 (95% CI = 0.62 to 1.78) for those using MHT. The adjusted hazard ratios for overall mortality were 0.78 (95% CI = 0.71 to 0.87) for VET and 0.94 (95% CI = 0.70 to 1.26) for MHT.

In conclusion, for postmenopausal women treated for early-stage estrogen receptor–positive BC, neither VET nor MHT was associated with an increased risk of recurrence or mortality.

### Changes in serum estradiol levels with Estring in postmenopausal women with breast cancer treated with aromatase inhibitors [^11721pRL]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Anti-estrogen therapy is an effective intervention for preventing recurrence of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in women. However, the side effects of anti-estrogen therapy, including urogenital symptoms, have been reported to cause significant morbidity. There is controversial data, mainly due to small sample sizes, regarding the safety and efficacy of using vaginal estrogen to treat urogenital symptoms in patients on aromatase inhibitor therapy.

- **Methods**: We proposed a prospective trial to measure the change in blood estradiol levels in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer undergoing treatment with aromatase inhibitors when treated with the vaginal estrogen preparation, Estring, for their urogenital symptoms. Only eight prospective patients were enrolled, and the study was amended to include six retrospective patients who were treated similarly. Blood estradiol levels were measured at baseline and at week 16 for all patients.

- **Results**: The median age for all patients was 55 years, and the majority were treated with anastrozole. There was no significant difference between baseline and week 16 estradiol levels (p = 0.81). In addition, patients in the prospective group reported subjective improvement in their vaginal dryness symptoms questionnaires.

- **Conclusions**: The vaginal estrogen preparation, Estring, did not cause persistent elevations in serum estradiol levels and might be a safer option for women with significant urogenital symptoms requiring estrogen therapy.

- **Implications for cancer survivors**: Vaginal estrogen preparations may be considered for managing urogenital symptoms in this patient population.

### Safety of vaginal estrogen therapy for genitourinary syndrome of menopause in women with a history of breast cancer [^112qVKod]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

To assess the risk of recurrence of breast cancer associated with vaginal estrogen therapy in women diagnosed with genitourinary syndrome of menopause, a query was conducted using a large U.S. claims database. The investigation utilized the TriNetX Diamond Network, covering the period from January 2009 to June 2022.

The study cohort consisted of women diagnosed with breast cancer within 5 years prior to their initial genitourinary syndrome of menopause diagnosis. Patients with active disease, classified as those undergoing mastectomy, radiation treatment, or chemotherapy within 3 months before diagnosis, were excluded. Recurrence was defined as mastectomy, radiation, chemotherapy, or secondary malignancy occurring within 3 months to 5 years following the initiation of vaginal estrogen therapy. The study specifically included those with three or more vaginal estrogen prescriptions. Meanwhile, the control group comprised women with breast cancer who had no vaginal estrogen prescriptions post-genitourinary syndrome of menopause diagnosis. Propensity matching was performed, and a subanalysis by positive estrogen receptor status, when available, was conducted.

The study identified 42,113 women with genitourinary syndrome of menopause following a breast cancer diagnosis for any estrogen receptor status, with 5.0% having received vaginal estrogen. Among the initial cohort, 10,584 patients had a history of positive estrogen receptor breast cancer, with 3.9% of this subgroup receiving vaginal estrogen.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^114ykGim]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Cases continue to accrue in the prospective studies, but there is no good reason to expect further follow-up would materially alter the main findings for users. To limit biases, the main analyses were restricted to prospective studies, allowed for early menopause decreasing breast cancer risk and bringing forward the age when menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is started, and adjusted for various other potential confounding factors, as other correlates of breast cancer risk might also affect the type or timing of MHT use. Users were included up to no more than 5 years after their last reported MHT use; among them, there were, on average, only 1.4 years between the last report about their MHT use and their index date. Some additional use must have occurred during that period, as must some discontinuation, but both have been allowed for, although relative risks (RRs) in users must still have been slightly weakened by discontinuation before the index date. With all these safeguards, the findings are trustworthy for the main patterns of use in the prospective studies.

The clinical relevance of the main findings lies in the magnitude of the absolute risks during and after MHT use for women who start MHT at ages 40–59 years (see figure 7; appendix pp 24–27); however, the public health relevance depends additionally on the numbers of women previously and currently exposed. Although use of either type of MHT for less than 1 year was associated with little subsequent risk, for women of average weight in developed countries, 5 years of use, starting at age 50 years, would cause an appreciable increase in the probability of developing breast cancer.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 659 summary: The use of vaginal estrogen in women with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer [^112cbgqv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Cancer treatment should address female-specific survivorship issues, including the hypoestrogenic-related adverse effects of cancer therapies or natural menopause in survivors. Systemic and vaginal estrogen are widely used for symptomatic relief of vasomotor symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and lower urinary tract infections in the general population. However, given that some types of cancer are hormone sensitive, there are safety concerns about the use of local hormone therapy in women who currently have breast cancer or have a history of breast cancer.

Nonhormonal approaches are the first-line choices for managing urogenital symptoms or atrophy-related urinary symptoms experienced by women during or after treatment for breast cancer. Among women with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer who are experiencing urogenital symptoms, vaginal estrogen should be reserved for those patients who are unresponsive to nonhormonal remedies. The decision to use vaginal estrogen may be made in coordination with a woman's oncologist. Additionally, it should be preceded by an informed decision-making and consent process in which the woman has the information and resources to consider the benefits and potential risks of low-dose vaginal estrogen. Data do not show an increased risk of cancer recurrence among women currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer or those with a personal history of breast cancer who use vaginal estrogen to relieve urogenital symptoms.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^1122kGKb]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Estrogens have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. However, emerging clinical and experimental evidence points to progestogens — endogenous progesterone or synthetic progesterone (progestin) — as the primary hormonal driver underlying seemingly estrogen-associated breast cancer risk. Estrogens may contribute indirectly to breast cancer risk by inducing the progesterone receptor and thus amplifying progesterone signaling.

Large studies of hormonal contraceptives suggest that the small increase in breast cancer risk from hormonal contraceptives is mainly attributable to progestins, not estrogens. Estrogen-plus-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has consistently shown an increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, whereas estrogen-alone HRT has little impact on breast cancer risk in naturally or surgically menopausal women. In particular, the long-term follow-up of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials suggests a benefit of estrogen alone.

Recent data further indicate that endogenously elevated estrogen during assisted reproductive technology (ART) exhibits little adverse effect on or potentially a reduction in breast cancer risk and recurrence. Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that inhibition of progesterone signaling is a critical mechanism underlying the risk-reducing and therapeutic effects of antiestrogens. Estrogen HRT has shown an array of proven benefits, including ameliorating menopausal symptoms and improving bone health. Collective evidence thus suggests that estrogen HRT is likely to offer health benefits.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: A systematic evidence review [^115zBnqr]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

More than two million women in the United States are estimated to use vaginal estrogen products to treat symptomatic vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Because most women do not use vaginal estrogens with concomitant progestogen, examination of the impact of unopposed vaginal estrogens on the endometrium is an important safety parameter. Although it may be well accepted that local unopposed vaginal estrogens do not have the same stimulatory effects on the endometrium as unopposed oral estrogens, a lesser association between vaginal estrogen use and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer has not been systematically reviewed in published studies. A systematic review of the published clinical evidence to examine the endometrial safety of vaginal estrogens would enhance future development of novel, safe, and effective low-dose vaginal estrogen products. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women in the published medical literature.

### Estrogen replacement therapy in breast cancer survivors: a matched-controlled series [^115udskZ]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

We prospectively administered estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) to control estrogen deficiency symptoms in breast cancer survivors as part of our clinical practice and report the consequences of ERT compared with a historical matched-control group.

- **Design**: Two hundred seventy-seven disease-free survivors received ERT. Controls were matched for exact stage, a recurrence-free period similar to the period to ERT initiation in the ERT group, approximate age, and duration of follow-up. The mean time from breast cancer diagnosis to initiation of ERT was 3.61 (± 0.25) years, with a median of 1.88 years. The mean duration of ERT was 3.7 (± 3.01) years, with a median of 3.05 years.

- **Results**: Hot flashes were relieved in 206 of 223 women (92%), dyspareunia/vaginal dryness in 149 of 167 women (89%), and reactive depression/anxiety/mood change in 111 of 126 women (88%). Univariate analysis demonstrated no statistical differences between the groups for age, stage, pathology at diagnosis, progesterone receptor status, local therapy, breast at risk, prior chemotherapy, and duration of follow-up. The ERT group was more likely to be estrogen receptor negative (P = 0.01), to have received prior ERT (P < 0.001), and to have received no adjuvant tamoxifen (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the ERT and control groups in ipsilateral primary/recurrence (5/155 v 5/143; P = 0.85), contralateral breast cancers (10/258 v 9/260; P = 0.99), or systemic metastasis (8/277 v 15/277; P = 0.13). Noncause-specific deaths in the control group numbered 15 (of 277).

### A phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer in treatment with aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting [^112PpAWd]. The Oncologist (2020). High credibility.

The levels of circulating follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estriol, estradiol, and estrone remained unchanged following a 12-week treatment with 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal women receiving nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. These results support the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of bothersome symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy in breast cancer survivors. The results provide clinicians with confidence in the use of this product in women who do not experience symptom relief with nonhormonal remedies.

- **Background**: Symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy associated with treatment with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) negatively impact patients' quality of life and may affect adherence to NSAIs. Vaginal estrogens effectively improve these symptoms, although their safe use in breast cancer survivors remains unclear.

- **Methods**: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving NSAI and moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness were randomized to 0.005% estriol vaginal gel or placebo for 12 weeks. Circulating estrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were analyzed at baseline and at weeks 1, 3, 8, and 12. The primary safety outcome was the variation in serum FSH from baseline to week 12.

- **Results**: Sixty-one women (mean age, 59 years) enrolled in the study. Small oscillations were observed in FSH and LH, although they were always maintained within the postmenopausal range.

### Estrace [^113vZrLa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80].

Consistent with the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy and a smaller, but still increased risk, for estrogen-alone therapy after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon the duration of use and could last up to more than 10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater and became apparent earlier with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to the risk with estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

### Efficacy and safety of ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer treated with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors: a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112AUkUE]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

Even though low-dose estrogen-based vaginal preparations are widely used, scientific evidence regarding their safety and efficacy in women with breast cancer receiving NSAI treatment is still scarce, and the need for placebo-controlled randomized trials in this setting has been highlighted. Given that NSAIs are a mainstay of endocrine adjuvant treatment for breast cancer survivors, further clinical research is needed to establish guidelines to treat its associated side effects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we investigated the efficacy and safety of an ultra-low dose of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal women treated with NSAIs under the hypothesis that its application is effective in the management of vulvovaginal symptoms without a significant impact on serum gonadotropins and plasma estrogens.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: A systematic evidence review [^112B7dgD]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical evidence from this systematic review does not support an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer with low-dose unopposed vaginal estrogen use. Sporadic reports of endometrial hyperplasia were not associated with a specific dose or duration, except for the highest CEE dose of 1.25 mg used 21 days on/7 days off, which appears to be associated with an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia (2 cases in 28 women).

The well-established dose effect of endometrial hyperplasia seen with higher doses of oral estrogen products was not observed with lower doses of vaginal estradiol. Although older studies, which typically evaluated higher vaginal estrogen doses, were not powered to detect endometrial cancer due to small sample size and short duration, they were powered to detect endometrial hyperplasia — a signal that was not detected with low-dose vaginal estrogen products. Overall, the sporadic reports of endometrial hyperplasia observed (approximately 0.4% in RCTs) appear to be consistent with background rates of endometrial hyperplasia in the general population.

Of the 38 studies reviewed, only two retrospective observational studies showed an increased risk of endometrial cancer with vaginal estrogen use compared with non-use. The first was a study reporting data from 1977 to 1979 from a single center in the United States, which observed an increase in endometrial cancer (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.1–4.6). This increase may be due to higher-dose vaginal products used in the 1970s compared with lower-dose products currently available.

### Phytoestrogens: Potential benefits and implications for breast cancer survivors [^115KUUY4]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Phytoestrogens are a group of plant-derived substances that are structurally or functionally similar to estradiol. There has been much interest in the potential role of phytoestrogens in cancer prevention and treatment of estrogen-deficient states. This review summarizes the evidence for phytoestrogen risks and benefits relevant to the breast cancer survivor, including prevention of a second primary breast cancer or metastatic disease, reduction in menopausal symptoms, and interactions with tamoxifen.

Epidemiological data suggest a breast cancer protective role for phytoestrogens, and there is some supporting clinical data, but they are far from conclusive. In addition, there is some evidence that genistein, the most prevalent isoflavone in soy, can stimulate estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer growth and interfere with the antitumor activity of tamoxifen at low levels. Given this knowledge, women who have ER+ tumors should not increase their phytoestrogen intake.

Several studies suggest an inhibitory effect on ER- breast cancer cell growth, and it may be reasonable for women with ER- tumors to safely consume soy and possibly other phytoestrogens. However, the optimal amount and source are not clear. More research is needed to clarify the role of phytoestrogens in breast cancer prevention and in treating estrogen-deficient diseases in women who have had breast cancer.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^116FzXiz]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

Despite several pharmacokinetic studies demonstrating low to negligible systemic absorption of estradiol with low-dose and ultralow-dose vaginal estrogen use, the boxed warning included in the class labeling of systemically administered estrogens is required for low-dose vaginal estrogens. Experts affiliated with several medical societies have been advocating for its removal. While low-dose vaginal estrogens are contraindicated in breast cancer survivors, The North American Menopause Society, Endocrine Society, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended a shared decision-making process, which includes an oncologist, to determine low-dose vaginal estrogen use in women with GSM and breast cancer or a history of breast cancer, when they do not respond to nonhormonal therapies.

Further support of minimal absorption is shown by the mean estradiol levels with 4-μg and 10-μg estradiol softgel inserts being similar to those at baseline or with placebo in a phase 3 pharmacokinetic substudy. This 4-μg estradiol vaginal insert was approved in May 2018 by the US FDA as Imvexxy, is now the lowest vaginal estradiol dose available, and results in mean circulating levels of estradiol < 4 pg/mL utilizing LC MS/MS.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^116desHn]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

The corresponding risks associated with 10 years of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use starting at age 50 would be about twice as great. In Western countries, approximately 20 million breast cancer cases have been diagnosed since 1990, of which about 1 million cases would have been caused by MHT use.

### Guideline no. 422d: Menopause and sexuality [^112DF5rR]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, specifically in the management of vulvovaginal atrophy, the SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend considering the offer of local vaginal estrogen. This should be done after consultation with the patient's oncologist if local lubricants and moisturizers prove ineffective in patients with breast cancer experiencing symptomatic genitourinary syndrome of menopause.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^117FRGfX]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Estrogens have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. Yet, emerging clinical and experimental evidence points to progestogens [endogenous progesterone or synthetic progesterone (progestin)] as the primary hormonal driver underlying seemingly estrogen-associated breast cancer risk. Estrogens may contribute to breast cancer risk indirectly by induction of the progesterone receptor, thus amplifying progesterone signaling.

Large studies of hormonal contraceptives suggest that the small increase in breast cancer risk from hormonal contraceptives is mainly attributable to progestins, not estrogens. Estrogen-plus-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has consistently shown an increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, whereas estrogen-alone HRT has little impact on breast cancer risk in naturally or surgically menopausal women. In particular, the long-term follow-up of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials suggests a benefit of estrogen alone. Recent data further indicate that endogenously elevated estrogen during assisted reproductive technology (ART) exhibits little adverse effect on or potentially a reduction in breast cancer risk and recurrence.

Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that inhibition of progesterone signaling is a critical mechanism underlying the risk-reducing and therapeutic effects of antiestrogens. Estrogen HRT has shown an array of proven benefits, including ameliorating menopausal symptoms and improving bone health. Collective evidence thus suggests that estrogen HRT is likely to offer health benefits.

### When is it appropriate to prescribe postmenopausal hormone therapy [^1164dZpo]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

To develop evidence and consensus-based recommendations for the use of hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women, a multidisciplinary group of women's health experts utilized evidence from clinical trials and other publications. They developed consensus-based recommendations for HT use in more than 300 clinical scenarios. These panelists employed the RAND Appropriateness Method and a quantitative scale to rate the appropriateness of treatment options for women with various risk factors and clinical scenarios.

The panel judged it appropriate to prescribe all forms of HT to women with intolerable menopause symptoms and usual (age-expected) risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), venous thromboembolism (VTE), or stroke. The use of HT was deemed inappropriate for clinical scenarios concerning bone preservation, cosmetic appearance, memory loss, loss of libido, or CVD protection. For a woman still using HT after five or more years, it was considered appropriate to recommend stopping or lowering the dose even if stopping was previously attempted. In treating intolerable symptoms in the presence of some elevated risk for diseases related to HT, the route of administration may affect appropriateness, but prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a contraindication.

Standard HT is appropriate for women with intolerable menopause symptoms in the absence of HT-related risk factors (e.g. CVD, stroke, VTE, breast cancer). Panelists judged it appropriate to repeatedly present the option of stopping or reducing the dose. In most cases, the presence of risk factors should be carefully considered.

### Endocrine therapy use and cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors [^114BiBBu]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

Among postmenopausal women diagnosed with ER/PR+ breast cancer, there is convincing evidence of a higher risk of several cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in aromatase inhibitor (AI) users compared with tamoxifen users. However, results indicated no excess cardiotoxicities for either drug class, apart from the known raised risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with tamoxifen use. There was no evidence of an increased risk of specific CVDs with AI use, even when analyses were restricted to those with prior CVDs. This suggests that a history of CVD is unlikely to be a significant contraindication for prescribing AIs. These findings contribute to the evidence base regarding the risk-benefit balance of endocrine therapies concerning cancer survival and cardiovascular outcomes. Ultimately, they can assist in identifying subgroups of postmenopausal women more likely to benefit from tamoxifen over AIs.

### Efficacy and safety of ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer treated with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors: a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111aAAgH]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

This study was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicenter investigation assessing the safety and efficacy of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for treating symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy. Participants were postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (and any HER2 status) early breast cancer (stage I-IIIA) who had been treated with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs), such as anastrozole or letrozole, for at least six months. Recruitment took place at five Spanish and one Swedish sites during routine follow-up visits from April 2015 to October 2016.

Postmenopausal status was defined by any of the following: 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels greater than 40 mIU/mL, or 6 weeks post-surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy). All participants exhibited moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness, in line with FDA guidelines for drug development in postmenopausal women [Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, CDER, January 2003]. Moderate symptoms were defined as present, bothersome, and annoying, while severe symptoms interfered with normal activity. Additional inclusion criteria included a score of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and adequate bone marrow and organ function.

Exclusions included patients treated with other antitumoral therapies (excluding pamidronate or alendronate) and those who had undergone vulvovaginal treatment in the 15 days preceding the study.

### Hormone replacement therapy in gynecologic cancer survivors: Why not [^114xLkdg]. Gynecologic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

As a result of treatment, many women with gynecologic malignancies will experience menopause and display climacteric symptoms at an earlier age than occurs naturally. Iatrogenic menopause may adversely affect the quality of life and health outcomes in young female cancer survivors. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has often been withheld from women with gynecologic cancer due to concerns that it might increase the risk of relapse or the development of new primary cancers. This review examines the published literature on menopause management in gynecologic cancer survivors, highlighting the risks and benefits of conventional and alternative HRT in this population.

A comprehensive literature search of English-language studies on menopause management in gynecologic cancer survivors and women with a hereditary predisposition to gynecologic malignancy was performed in MEDLINE databases through December 2010.

Both our review and a 2008 Cochrane review of randomized trials on the effects of long-term HRT demonstrate that for menopausal women in their 40s or 50s, with and without gynecologic cancer, the absolute risks of estrogen-only HRT are low. Several prospective observational studies and randomized trials on HRT use in women with a genetic predisposition for, or development of gynecologic malignancy suggest benefits in quality of life with no proven adverse oncologic effects as a result of short-term HRT use.

In select women, it is reasonable to discuss and offer conventional HRT for the amelioration of menopausal symptoms.

### Estrogen replacement therapy after breast cancer: A 12-year follow-up [^117E6t8q]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

In the United States, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is discouraged in breast cancer survivors because of concerns that hormones may reactivate the disease. However, because ERT can improve quality of life and decrease morbidity from osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, this policy is increasingly being challenged.

- **Methods**: From February to August 1995, 607 breast cancer survivors were interviewed concerning ERT usage. Sixty-four patients indicated they received some form of ERT after their breast cancer diagnosis. Medical records for these patients were analyzed for disease stage, surgical treatment, adjuvant treatment, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, date of initiation of ERT, type of ERT, recurrence, and final outcome. Patients receiving ERT were followed prospectively.

- **Results**: Eight patients were excluded because they had used only vaginal cream ERT. The remaining 56 received ERT as conjugated estrogens, an estradiol patch, estropipate, or birth control pills. The median follow-up from diagnosis was 12.8 years (range, 4.7–38.9 years). The median time on ERT since diagnosis was 6.4 years (range, 1.0–20.9 years); 38% of the patients initiated ERT within 2 years of diagnosis. Estrogen receptors were positive in 28 (74%) of the 38 cases with available information. Pathological disease stage at the time of diagnosis and treatment was 0 in 15 cases (27%), I in 27 (48%), and II in 14 (25%). Twenty-six patients (47%) received adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. One local recurrence and one contralateral breast cancer occurred during the follow-up.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1156dK5a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for menopause, particularly in patients with breast cancer, the ES 2015 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend vaginal estrogens in patients with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitors, where the goal of adjuvant therapy is a complete absence of estrogen at the tissue level. The use of vaginal estrogens in this context should be guided by quality-of-life concerns after discussing possible risks.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^112SVfT5]. Annals of Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Further corroborating evidence on the oncogenic role of progestogens in breast cancer may be gleaned from two independent RCTs that assessed the breast cancer risk of HRT among breast cancer survivors in Sweden: the HABITS and the Stockholm trials. The participants of these trials were postmenopausal women without evidence of recurrence after the diagnosis and treatment of non-metastatic breast cancer. After HRT versus no treatment for 2–5 years and median follow-ups of 2–10 years, the HABITS trial showed a significant increase in recurrence (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3–4.2), whereas the Stockholm trial reported no significant impact of HRT on breast cancer recurrence (relative hazard 0.82, 95% CI 0.35–1.9). No mortality difference was observed in both trials.

- **Progestin exposure**: There were two major differences between these trials: progestin exposure and tamoxifen use. In the HABITS trial, nearly half (46%) of the participants were treated with continuous estrogen–progestin HRT, with 47% for estrogen alone or combined with low exposure of a progestin. In contrast, as the Stockholm trial was specifically designed to minimize progestin exposure from HRT, 95% of the participants were treated with estrogen alone or combined with low exposure of a progestin. Thus, investigators attributed the increased risk of recurrence in the HABITS trial to higher exposure to progestins.

- **Tamoxifen use**: More women were treated with tamoxifen as an adjuvant therapy in the Stockholm trial (52%) than in the HABITS trial (21%). The risk-reducing effect of breast cancer by tamoxifen was evident.

### Systemic or vaginal hormone therapy after early breast cancer: A Danish observational cohort study [^116zGQ3G]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Low credibility.

Breast cancer (BC) survivors often experience symptoms of declining estrogen levels. Adjuvant endocrine therapy, particularly aromatase inhibitors (AIs), may aggravate these symptoms. The urogenital system is notably sensitive to estrogen deprivation, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) often develops, including vaginal dryness, itchiness, burning, overactive bladder, and urinary incontinence. The American Endocrine Society concluded that level A evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of systemic or local hormone therapy in GSM. Vaginal estrogen therapy (VET) is well-tolerated and indicated for isolated GSM among healthy women.

Use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has been cautioned in BC survivors following demonstrations of an increased risk of recurrence in the HABITS (Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer – is it Safe?) trial and in the Livial Intervention following Breast cancer: Efficacy, Recurrence, And Tolerability Endpoints trial, although this association was not reproduced in the results published from the Stockholm trial. A small cohort study and a nested case-control study, including a total of 340 women with early BC, investigated the risk of BC recurrence associated with the use of VET. Neither study showed an increased risk. However, these studies had several limitations, including small sample size and short follow-up. Therefore, it remains unclear whether VET or MHT is safe in women treated for BC.

Among women without a history of BC, a meta-analysis from the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer reported increased risk.

### A phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer in treatment with aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting [^1144Ub1H]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

In this phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we investigated the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women receiving nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, focusing on the impact of vaginal treatment on serum gonadotropin levels. The analysis included 61 women, all with menopausal status achieved either by spontaneous amenorrhea or through oophorectomy. Patients were randomized 4:1, with 50 in the treatment group and 11 in the placebo group.

One of the major barriers to analyzing the primary objective — i.e. the influence of estriol treatment on serum gonadotropin levels — was the high physiological variability of the serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In our study, these levels ranged from 18.6 to 132 mIU/mL and from 4.3 to 93 mIU/mL, respectively. This variability was consistent with previously reported data and slightly higher than the postmenopausal ranges typically considered for FSH and LH (21.7–153 mIU/mL and 11.3–39.8 mIU/mL, respectively). Based on the physiological variability observed in our cohort, we determined that comparing the variation between pretreatment and during-treatment ranges was the most accurate strategy to capture this variability and minimize its confounding effects. During therapy with 50 μg vaginal estriol, small differences between physiological levels were noted.

### Endogenous estradiol is not associated with poor physical health in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors [^111QN8ik]. Journal of Women's Health (2013). Low credibility.

Among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, poor physical health has been associated with higher risks of breast cancer events. Obesity and physical inactivity are known risk factors for poor physical health, while circulating estrogen is an additional potential risk factor. We tested the hypothesis that the relationship between poor physical health and worse breast cancer outcomes is mediated by higher estrogen concentrations associated with body size and physical inactivity.

- **Methods**: We used data from 1030 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors to examine the association between serum estradiol levels, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and RAND-36-item Health Survey (SF-36) physical health.

- **Results**: In univariate analysis, poor physical health was associated with higher estradiol levels, in addition to obesity and low physical activity. Higher estradiol levels were significantly associated with higher odds of poor physical health (odds ratio, OR, 1.20 [95% confidence interval 1.03–1.39]) in a multivariable model adjusting for age, cancer stage and treatment, alcohol use, and physical activity. However, the relationship between estradiol levels and poor physical health was no longer significant (OR 1.06 [0.91–1.24]) after adding BMI to the model. In multivariate analysis, only poor physical health resulted in higher risks of recurrence (hazard ratio 1.33 [95% CI 1.08–1.64]).

- **Conclusions**: These findings indicate that estradiol is related to poor physical health but is not an independent risk factor from body size or inactivity.

### Aromatase inhibitors affect vaginal proliferation and steroid hormone receptors [^116MsDTE]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Women with breast cancer who are treated with aromatase inhibitors often experience vaginal atrophy symptoms and sexual dysfunction. This study aims to investigate the proliferation and presence and distribution of steroid hormone receptors in vaginal biopsies, concerning vaginal atrophy and vaginal pH, in women with breast cancer on adjuvant endocrine treatment and healthy postmenopausal women.

This cross-sectional study compares postmenopausal aromatase inhibitor-treated women with breast cancer (n = 15) to tamoxifen-treated women with breast cancer (n = 16), age-matched postmenopausal women without treatment (n = 19), and those with vaginal estrogen therapy (n = 16). Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze proliferation and steroid hormone receptor staining intensity, with data correlated to estrogen as well as androgen levels, vaginal atrophy scores, and vaginal pH.

Aromatase inhibitor-treated women demonstrated reduced proliferation, weaker progesterone receptor staining, and stronger androgen receptor staining, correlating with plasma estrone levels, vaginal atrophy scores, and vaginal pH.

In conclusion, women with aromatase inhibitor-treated breast cancer exhibit reduced proliferation and altered steroid hormone receptor staining intensity in the vagina, which relates to clinical signs of vaginal atrophy. Although these effects are likely due to estrogen suppression, possible local inhibition of aromatase cannot be ruled out.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^114hMuyc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

The purpose of this guideline update is to address pharmacologic interventions for breast cancer risk reduction, providing guidance on clinical issues that arise when deciding to use endocrine therapy for this purpose.

An Expert Panel conducted targeted systematic literature reviews to identify new studies. A randomized clinical trial evaluating the use of anastrozole to reduce estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers in postmenopausal women at increased risk forms the primary basis for this update.

In postmenopausal women at increased risk, the choice of endocrine therapy now includes anastrozole (1 mg/day) in addition to exemestane (25 mg/day), raloxifene (60 mg/day), or tamoxifen (20 mg/day). The decision regarding the choice of endocrine therapy should consider age, baseline comorbidities, and adverse effect profiles. Clinicians should not prescribe anastrozole, exemestane, or raloxifene for breast cancer risk reduction to premenopausal women. Tamoxifen 20 mg/day for 5 years remains the standard of care for risk reduction in premenopausal women who are at least 35 years old and have completed childbearing. Data on low-dose tamoxifen as an alternative to the standard dose for both pre- and postmenopausal women with intraepithelial neoplasia are discussed in the Clinical Considerations section of this article. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^116vr7k5]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Among women who developed breast cancer in the prospective studies, the mean age at menopause was 50 years (SD 5), the mean age at first MHT use was 50 years (SD 6), and the mean duration of MHT use was 10 years (SD 6) in current users and 7 years (SD 6) in past users. Hysterectomy largely determined MHT type; the proportions of women reported to have had the procedure were 2710 (7%) of 37,951 for oestrogen-progestagen users and 31,187 (84%) of 37,213 for oestrogen-only users.

Relative risks (RRs) were consistently greater for oestrogen-progestagen than for oestrogen-only preparations. RRs were greater in current than in past users and, in both current and past users, increased steadily with the duration of use. For each MHT type, there was a significant excess risk even during years 1–4 (mean: year 3) of use: the RRs were 1.60 (95% CI 1.52–1.69) for oestrogen-progestagen and 1.17 (1.10–1.26) for oestrogen-only MHT. During years 5–14 (mean: year 9) of use, the RRs were 2.08 (2.02–2.15) for oestrogen-progestagen and 1.33 (1.28–1.37) for oestrogen-only MHT. In past users, excess duration-dependent risks persisted for more than a decade after stopping MHT use. There is little information about breast cancer risk associated with past use that had ceased more than 15 years previously.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: A systematic evidence review [^1124PAnx]. Menopause (2019). High credibility.

The concept of this review was based on a request from the US Food and Drug Administration to research and review the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer with the use of vaginal estrogens. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted from inception to August 2017 for journal articles, conference abstracts, and study data reporting any use of vaginal estrogens in menopausal women published in the English language.

- **Literature search methodology**: Keywords used for PubMed were vaginal and (estrogen or oestrogen or estradiol or oestradiol). Keywords for EMBASE were (uterine or endometri∗) and (cancer or carcinoma or hyperplasia or proliferation) and vagin∗ and (estrogen(s) or estradiol) and (menopaus∗ or postmenopaus∗), excluding reviews and articles with rats, mouse, mice, and dogs in the title. A separate literature search of these databases was conducted for studies of vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; prasterone) in postmenopausal women using the keywords vaginal and prasterone.

Bibliographies of review articles were inspected for studies of vaginal estrogen use in menopausal women that may not have appeared in the literature search results. Review articles examined included those published in the last 10 years that focused on vaginal atrophy, vaginal estrogen use, or menopausal hormone therapy. Bibliographies of the most recent Cochrane reviews for vaginal estrogen use outcomes were also reviewed. Relevant articles were included if mentioned in the results and discussion of relevant full-text articles.

### A phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer in treatment with aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting [^114hQ3gk]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

The levels of circulating follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estriol, estradiol, and estrone remained unchanged following a 12-week treatment with 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal women receiving nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. These results support the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of bothersome symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy in breast cancer survivors. The results provide clinicians with confidence in the use of this product in women who do not experience symptom relief with nonhormonal remedies.

- **Background**: Symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy associated with treatment with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) negatively impact patients' quality of life and may affect adherence to NSAIs. Vaginal estrogens effectively improve these symptoms, although their safe use in breast cancer survivors remains unclear.

- **Methods**: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving NSAI and moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness were randomized to 0.005% estriol vaginal gel or placebo for 12 weeks. Circulating estrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were analyzed at baseline and at weeks 1, 3, 8, and 12. The primary safety outcome was the variation in serum FSH from baseline to week 12.

- **Results**: Sixty-one women (mean age, 59 years) enrolled in the study. Small oscillations were observed in FSH and LH, although they were always maintained within the postmenopausal range. No significant difference was observed in the primary safety outcome.

### Addressing the needs of breast cancer survivors [^115daAqV]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

In advanced cases, symptoms may be attributable to vaginal stenosis or shortening, and the patient may not be able to engage in sexual activity. For such cases, low-dose vaginal hormones, such as estradiol or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), have been studied. These are postulated to enhance collagen remodeling and augment elasticity and mucosal thickness. In conjunction with this, vaginal dilators may be used, with recommended usage being three times each week for 10 minutes in each session.

In situations where symptoms are refractory to non-hormonal pharmacological and non-pharmacological options, vaginal estradiol can be considered an effective management option for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). However, there is a concern for potential systemic absorption and elevation of serum estradiol levels, which raises concerns for its utilization in patients with a breast cancer history. Utilizing lower doses of commercially available vaginal estrogens and application following non-hormonal moisturizer use to allow for mucosal atrophy recovery may help mitigate the risk of absorption. A large case-controlled study showed no increased risk of breast cancer recurrence with vaginal estrogen use. Similarly, a large observational Danish cohort study of postmenopausal women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who received systemic or local estrogen for endocrine-related genitourinary syndrome did not show an elevated recurrence risk or death. However, among patients using vaginal estrogen therapy while receiving aromatase inhibitors, there was a higher observed risk of cancer recurrence.

### Vaginal estrogen use in breast cancer survivors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of recurrence and mortality risks [^116yvwd9]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

The study aims to assess the risk of breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer-specific mortality, and overall mortality for breast cancer survivors receiving vaginal estrogen therapy for genitourinary syndrome of menopause.

- **Data sources**: A systematic literature search was conducted from the inception of each database to April 6th, 2024, in Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, NCBI, and Science Direct. A secondary search was performed on September 26th, 2024, utilizing Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Science Direct.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Studies reporting on breast cancer recurrence, defined per individual review criteria, were identified. Both local and distant recurrences were considered.

- **Study appraisal and synthesis methods**: Three reviewers evaluated the studies with defined eligibility criteria, focusing on breast cancer recurrence as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included breast cancer mortality and overall mortality. Pooled unadjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random-effects model. The study assessed the 95% prediction intervals to determine the range within which future individual values are expected, based on a model or dataset. The fragility index was calculated to evaluate the robustness of the pooled estimates.

- **Results**: Of 5522 articles identified, 8 observational studies were included in this meta-analysis. The use of vaginal estrogen in patients with a history of breast cancer was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence (6 articles, 24,060 patients, odds ratio).

### Systemic or vaginal hormone therapy after early breast cancer: A Danish observational cohort study [^113Vm4Rs]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Low credibility.

We examined the frequency and proportion of breast cancer (BC) patients according to the use of vaginal estrogen therapy (VET) and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) after the BC diagnosis. Follow-up time was quantified using a Kaplan-Meier estimate of potential follow-up. For recurrence and competing risk analyses, the Fine and Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model and cumulative incidences were applied.

The cumulative incidence of recurrence was determined as the interval from surgery to any first event of local or regional invasive recurrence or distant recurrence, whereas other first events were considered competing risk events. The Cox regression model was used to assess overall survival (OS).

Additionally, Poisson regression was utilized to compute the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), based on the assumption that the observed number of deaths followed a Poisson distribution. SMRs were computed as the ratio of the observed to the expected number of deaths and served as an estimate of the relative risk of death. The expected number of deaths was determined by applying age- and calendar year–specific female mortality figures of the general Danish population and the corresponding person-years of follow-up for the respective cohort members.

Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and relative risk estimates, along with associated 95% confidence intervals according to exposure to VET and MHT, were estimated. Use of VET and MHT was included simultaneously in the models, with the reference group being patients without prescriptions. The multivariable analyses included covariates such as age at surgery.

### Vaginal estrogen use and chronic disease risk in the Nurses' Health Study [^113XzoyR]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the associations between vaginal estrogen use and multiple health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (total myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis), cancer (total invasive, breast, endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer), and hip fracture.

The methods involved the inclusion of postmenopausal women from the Nurses' Health Study (1982–2012) who were not users of systemic hormone therapy at the start of the study or during follow-up. Vaginal estrogen use was self-reported on biennial questionnaires. Information on incident health outcomes was also self-reported and confirmed by medical records. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios and the 95% confidence intervals for vaginal estrogen use and multiple health outcomes.

Over 18 years of follow-up, after adjusting for covariates, no significant difference in risks for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and hip fracture was found between users and nonusers of vaginal estrogen. There was no statistically significant increase in the risk of any health outcome observed with vaginal estrogen use. In sensitivity analyses, when associations were examined by hysterectomy status, the stratified results were generally similar to those for the total cohort.

In conclusion, vaginal estrogen use was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease or cancer. These findings support the safety of vaginal estrogen use, a highly effective treatment for genitourinary syndrome of menopause.

### Estradiol [^1154jv11]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer with estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increase in the risk for breast cancer with estrogen-alone therapy after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon the duration of use and could last over ten years after discontinuation of estrogen-alone therapy and estrogen plus progestin therapy. The extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater and became apparent earlier with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. These studies have generally not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

Use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

- **Ovarian cancer**: The CE plus MPA substudy of the WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo.

### Association of vaginal oestradiol and the rate of breast cancer in Denmark: Registry based, case-control study, nested in a nationwide cohort [^114w67qE]. BMJ Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

This study, alongside recent research suggesting that vaginal oestrogen treatment may safely be used by many women who have had breast cancer, adds reassurance to the breast cancer safety of vaginal oestrogen treatment. However, considering the globally prevalent, often life-long indication and increasing use of vaginal oestrogen by postmenopausal women, further studies, especially in other populations, are warranted to confirm drug safety for all potential patients.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115uKnuE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

The 2015 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend using a shared decision-making approach, especially concerning menopause in patients with breast cancer. It is advised to involve the treating oncologist in discussions regarding the use of low-dose vaginal estrogen. This approach is suggested for patients with a history of breast cancer who present with symptomatic genitourinary syndrome of menopause, including vulvovaginal atrophy, and who do not respond to non-hormonal therapies.

### Missing documentation in breast cancer survivors: Genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^112Kus1V]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer survivors often take hormonal treatments to prevent the recurrence of breast cancer, particularly aromatase inhibitors that can worsen the symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) such as dyspareunia, dysuria, and urinary incontinence, all of which may adversely affect survivors' quality of life. Few breast cancer survivors experiencing GSM receive adequate assessment or treatment.

- **Methods**: In this descriptive study, we reviewed medical records for documented GSM and any treatments administered or referrals for treatment in 800 female patients who visited the Breast Cancer Survivorship Clinic at a comprehensive cancer center between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2011, either at least 5 years after completion of treatment for invasive breast cancer or at least 6 months after completion of treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ.

- **Results**: Of the 279 patients with documented symptoms of vaginal atrophy, only 111 (39.8%) had documentation of having received any form of treatment or referral. Of the 71 patients with documented symptoms of urinary tract atrophy, only 33.8% had documentation of having received treatment or referral for treatment.

- **Conclusion**: Breast cancer survivors often experience GSM due to lack of estrogen. The worrisome lack of documentation of assessment or treatment for GSM in a large breast cancer survivorship practice reveals missed opportunities to improve quality of life. Dissemination of recent progress in the development of GSM assessment tools, patient handouts, and new treatments to providers who care for breast cancer survivors is imperative.

### Eluryng [^111Y2B3L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Malignant neoplasms**:
	- **Breast cancer**: Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between the use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (or past) use of COCs and the risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among recent users (< 6 months since last use) and users with a longer duration of COC use [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)].
	- **Cervical cancer**: Some studies suggest that combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.

- **Effect on binding globulins**: The estrogen component of CHCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormones or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.

- **Monitoring**: A woman who is using the etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare assessments.

- **Hereditary angioedema**: In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.

### Vaginal estrogen therapy use and survival in females with breast cancer [^112JRWxB]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause can be treated with vaginal estrogen therapy; however, there are concerns about its safety in patients with breast cancer.

- **Objective**: To determine whether the risk of breast cancer-specific mortality was higher in females with breast cancer who used vaginal estrogen therapy compared to those who did not use hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This cohort study analyzed two large cohorts of females aged 40 to 79 years with newly diagnosed breast cancer, one each in Scotland and Wales. These population-based cohorts were identified from national cancer registry records from 2010 to 2017 in Scotland and from 2000 to 2016 in Wales, and were followed up for breast cancer-specific mortality until 2020. Females were excluded if they had a previous cancer diagnosis (except nonmelanoma skin cancer). Data analysis was performed between August 2022 and August 2023.

- **Exposure**: Use of vaginal estrogen therapy, including vaginal tablets and creams, was ascertained from pharmacy dispensing records of the Prescribing Information System for the Scotland cohort and from general practice prescription records for the Wales cohort.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was time to breast cancer-specific mortality, which was obtained from national mortality records. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for breast cancer-specific mortality, comparing vaginal estrogen therapy users with HRT users.

### Managing menopause [^1156WjV4]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for menopause, particularly with respect to patients with breast cancer, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend discussing quality-of-life considerations when evaluating the use of intravaginal estrogen therapy for severe vulvovaginal atrophy in these patients. There is also an emphasis on the uncertainty regarding its effects on breast cancer recurrence.

### Endocrine therapy for surgeons: Practical pearls for managing menopausal, bone loss and sexual adverse effects [^1155QhvK]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Breast cancer patients are living longer than ever before, and as such, the population of breast cancer survivors continues to grow. Approximately 80% of breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive (HR+), and most patients will receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant estrogen blockade, referred to as endocrine therapy. Although endocrine therapy reduces HR+ breast cancer recurrence by 30–50%, significant adverse effects pose a threat to treatment adherence. These adverse effects include vasomotor symptoms, colloquially referred to as hot flashes, bone loss, joint arthralgias, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), previously referred to as vaginal atrophy, and low libido.

This review presents the evidence-based treatments available for each of these adverse effects, including clear treatment algorithms for GSM, which is often experienced by patients but overlooked by providers. The most important takeaway is to ask open-ended questions, encourage reporting of these symptoms, and refer patients to specialty providers as needed. Surgeons may be the first to encounter these symptoms; therefore, it is critical to remain informed of the treatment options.

### A phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer in treatment with aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting [^1131ZBAe]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

Breast cancer survivors who are receiving adjuvant therapy with NSAIs have to deal with a constellation of genitourinary symptoms, including, but not limited to, dryness, burning, and dyspareunia associated with vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) [1, 2]. Although these symptoms are not severe, their long-lasting nature negatively affects patients' quality of life and may even jeopardize adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy [3, 4].

Although moisturizers and lubricants may provide temporary relief of VVA symptoms, most women require local hormonal treatments [1, 2, 3]. These treatments have proven efficacy in reversing VVA associated with estrogen depletion. However, their use in breast cancer survivors has raised safety concerns because of the need for keeping serum estrogens depressed.

### Guideline no. 422d: Menopause and sexuality [^114Go1z6]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of vulvovaginal atrophy, particularly in the context of local estrogen therapy, the SOGC 2021 guidelines suggest offering local vaginal estrogen. This consideration should take place after consulting with the patient's oncologist, especially if local lubricants and moisturizers prove ineffective for patients with breast cancer experiencing symptomatic genitourinary syndrome of menopause.
