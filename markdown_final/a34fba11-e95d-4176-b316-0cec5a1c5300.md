## Question

caropedal spasm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about carpopedal spasm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining carpopedal spasm and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the major etiologies, especially hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, and how to distinguish them. Next, I will review bedside diagnostic signs and laboratory thresholds. After that, I need to outline acute and chronic management, including special scenarios like post-thyroidectomy and Gitelman syndrome. Finally, I should consider complications, prognosis, and a practical bedside algorithm, making sure I double-check dosing and monitoring details along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical appearance. Carpopedal spasm is a painful, involuntary contraction of the hands and feet, classically with wrist and metacarpophalangeal joint flexion, interphalangeal extension, and thumb adduction, often reproducible with ischemic provocation such as a blood pressure cuff inflated above systolic for 3 minutes, which is the Trousseau maneuver, and it signals increased neuromuscular irritability from low ionized calcium or low magnesium states [^112fJ1Au] [^113Vbd5C].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the core pathophysiology. The fundamental mechanism is a lowered excitation threshold of peripheral nerves and muscles due to reduced ionized calcium, with magnesium deficiency impairing parathyroid hormone secretion and downstream calcium homeostasis, thereby amplifying neuromuscular irritability and tetany, including carpopedal spasm, paresthesias, and laryngospasm in severe cases [^112fJ1Au] [^115op6oZ] [^115wbZiE].

> I will now examine the major etiologies, starting with hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia is the most common cause, and within that, hypoparathyroidism is a leading driver, particularly after thyroid or parathyroid surgery, where transient or chronic hypocalcemia is common and carpopedal spasm is a hallmark symptom; vitamin D deficiency and rickets also present with hypocalcemia and tetany, and bisphosphonates can precipitate hypocalcemia with tetany even after treatment for hypercalcemia, so I need to check medication history carefully [^114cFMEX] [^112RmLRQ] [^114Pn7q9].

> Wait, let me verify the role of hypomagnesemia because it is often overlooked. Hypomagnesemia impairs PTH secretion and action, producing refractory hypocalcemia and directly increasing neuromuscular excitability; spontaneous carpopedal spasm and tremor are described with magnesium deficiency, and magnesium repletion can correct otherwise unresponsive hypocalcemia, so I should double-check serum magnesium whenever carpopedal spasm is present [^115op6oZ] [^1163JcMg].

> Next, I should review other contributors so I don't miss them. Hyperventilation lowers ionized calcium via alkalosis and can provoke carpopedal spasm, and metabolic alkalosis from sodium bicarbonate can worsen hypocalcemia and precipitate spasm; Gitelman syndrome causes hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic alkalosis with recurrent tetany; and in acute pancreatitis, hypocalcemia with tetany correlates with severity and poor outcomes, so I need to ensure I contextualize the spasm within the underlying disease [^112GUS69] [^1121jdVP] [^117Pa5vB] [^111buyiX].

> Let me think about bedside diagnostic maneuvers and their limitations. Trousseau's sign is elicited by inflating a cuff above systolic for 3 minutes and observing carpal spasm, while Chvostek's sign is facial twitching with tapping over the facial nerve; however, Chvostek can be positive in up to 10–25% of normal individuals, so a positive Trousseau is more specific for hypocalcemic tetany, and I should confirm that I'm interpreting these in the right clinical context [^112fJ1Au] [^113Vbd5C].

> I should confirm laboratory thresholds that correlate with symptoms. Symptoms of hypocalcemia typically begin when ionized calcium falls to about 0.63–0.65 mmol/L, and in pancreatitis cohorts, ionized calcium below 0.652 mmol/L predicted tetany with high sensitivity and specificity, so checking ionized calcium is preferable to total calcium when available, and I need to ensure I also measure magnesium, potassium, phosphate, and PTH to define the etiology [^115wbZiE] [^111buyiX].

> Now, I need to outline acute management and double-check dosing. For symptomatic hypocalcemia with carpopedal spasm, administer 10% calcium gluconate, 20 mg/kg elemental calcium IV over 10–20 minutes, which equals about 2 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate, followed by a continuous infusion of 200 mg/kg of 10% calcium gluconate over 24 hours, with serum calcium checked every 4–6 hours to target total calcium 1.75–2.25 mmol/L. If there is no response, I should verify and correct hypomagnesemia because it can render hypocalcemia refractory [^115wbZiE].

> But wait, what if the spasm is driven primarily by hypomagnesemia. I should give magnesium sulfate 2 g IV over 10–20 minutes, then reassess neuromuscular irritability and calcium responsiveness; magnesium repletion can also improve lactate clearance and organ dysfunction in critical illness, so I need to ensure I do not delay magnesium therapy when clinically indicated, while monitoring for accumulation in renal impairment [^1163JcMg].

> Next, I should review chronic management for hypoparathyroidism and related states. Long-term therapy relies on activated vitamin D with calcitriol or alfacalcidol plus oral calcium, with careful monitoring to avoid hypercalcemia and nephrocalcinosis. Recombinant PTH is an option in selected patients, and I should confirm that calcium and vitamin D are optimized perioperatively in patients undergoing thyroidectomy to mitigate postoperative hypocalcemia [^114cFMEX] [^113Vbd5C].

> I will now examine special scenarios so I don't miss nuances. After thyroidectomy, early ionized calcium predicts prolonged hypocalcemia and carpopedal spasm risk, so I should monitor closely and treat proactively. In Gitelman syndrome, lifelong potassium and magnesium supplementation, sometimes with potassium-sparing diuretics, is required, and carpopedal spasm often improves with electrolyte correction. In pancreatitis, the presence of tetany signals severe disease and high mortality, so I should escalate care accordingly [^116ooUZ5] [^112ZYtQ1] [^111buyiX].

> Hold on, I should verify complications and prognosis so counseling is accurate. Severe hypocalcemia can cause laryngospasm, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias including torsades, and prolonged muscle spasms can lead to rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury; in pancreatitis, tetany is a marker of poor prognosis, and in chronic hypoparathyroidism, undertreatment risks symptomatic hypocalcemia while overtreatment risks nephrocalcinosis, so I need to balance risks with frequent monitoring [^112fJ1Au] [^113Vbd5C] [^111buyiX] [^114cFMEX].

> Let me reconsider the practical bedside approach to ensure nothing is missed. If a patient presents with carpopedal spasm, I should immediately check ionized calcium and magnesium, obtain a focused history for recent neck surgery, vitamin D deficiency, gastrointestinal losses, hyperventilation, and medications including bisphosphonates, and perform Trousseau and Chvostek signs; if ionized calcium is low, treat hypocalcemia promptly and correct hypomagnesemia if present, and if ionized calcium is normal but magnesium is low, prioritize magnesium repletion and reassess for symptom resolution [^112fJ1Au] [^115wbZiE] [^115op6oZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought Chvostek's sign was present in up to 25% of normal children, but I should double-check that estimate. Pediatric guidance notes it may be seen in up to 10% of normal children, whereas endocrine sources cite up to 25% in the general population, so I should qualify the specificity accordingly and not overinterpret a positive Chvostek in isolation [^112fJ1Au] [^113Vbd5C].

> Finally, I need to ensure prevention and follow-up are addressed. For patients at risk of postoperative hypocalcemia, preoperative optimization of vitamin D and perioperative calcium strategies reduce hypocalcemia and shorten hospital stay, and for chronic hypoparathyroidism or Gitelman syndrome, structured follow-up with periodic calcium, magnesium, phosphate, renal function, and vitamin D assessment helps prevent both symptomatic hypocalcemia and treatment-related complications [^117E48AT] [^114cFMEX] [^112ZYtQ1].

Carpopedal spasm is a **painful, involuntary contraction** of the hands and feet, most often due to **hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia** [^115wbZiE] [^115op6oZ]. It is a hallmark of tetany and is classically triggered by hyperventilation or ischemia (Trousseau's sign) [^112GUS69] [^113Vbd5C]. Management centers on **correcting calcium and magnesium**, with acute IV calcium gluconate for severe cases and ongoing therapy for underlying causes such as hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, or renal tubular disorders [^115wbZiE] [^114cFMEX] [^112RmLRQ] [^112ZYtQ1]. Prompt recognition and electrolyte correction prevent complications like seizures, arrhythmias, and respiratory compromise [^113Vbd5C] [^115wbZiE].

---

## Clinical features and presentation

- **Muscle contractions**: Involuntary, painful contractions of the hands and feet, with wrist and metacarpophalangeal joint flexion, interphalangeal joint extension, and thumb adduction [^113Vbd5C].

- **Trousseau's sign**: Carpal spasm induced by inflating a blood pressure cuff above systolic pressure for 3 minutes, indicating latent tetany [^112fJ1Au].

- **Chvostek's sign**: Facial muscle twitching with tapping over the facial nerve, though less specific and present in some normal individuals [^112fJ1Au].

- **Associated symptoms**: Paresthesias, perioral numbness, muscle cramps, laryngospasm, seizures, and hyperreflexia [^115wbZiE].

---

## Pathophysiology

Carpopedal spasm reflects **increased neuromuscular excitability** from low ionized calcium or magnesium, which lowers the threshold for action potentials and causes spontaneous discharges and sustained contractions [^115wbZiE] [^115op6oZ].

---

## Common causes and underlying conditions

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Hypocalcemia | - Hypoparathyroidism (post-surgical, autoimmune, genetic) [^114cFMEX] <br/> - Vitamin D deficiency (rickets, osteomalacia) [^112RmLRQ] <br/> - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Acute pancreatitis [^111buyiX] <br/> - Bisphosphonate-induced hypocalcemia [^114Pn7q9] |
| Hypomagnesemia | - Gitelman syndrome [^112ZYtQ1] <br/> - Bartter syndrome [^notfound] <br/> - Diuretic use <br/> - Malabsorption <br/> - Alcoholism [^notfound] |
| Metabolic alkalosis | - Hyperventilation [^notfound] <br/> - Sodium bicarbonate administration [^1121jdVP] |
| Genetic disorders | - Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (CaSR, Gα11 mutations) [^117H6s4s] <br/> - Pseudohypoparathyroidism [^1156dzRC] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical signs**: Positive Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs, hyperreflexia, and characteristic hand/foot posture [^112fJ1Au].

- **Laboratory tests**: Serum calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphate, PTH, vitamin D, and renal function tests [^115wbZiE].

- **ECG**: QT interval prolongation and arrhythmias in severe hypocalcemia [^113Vbd5C].

---

## Management and treatment

### Acute management

Acute management includes **IV calcium gluconate** (10% solution, 10–20 mL infused over 10–20 minutes) for severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, with continuous infusion to maintain serum calcium [^115wbZiE]. Correct **hypomagnesemia** with IV magnesium sulfate (2–4 g over 10–20 minutes) because low magnesium can cause refractory hypocalcemia [^115op6oZ] [^1163JcMg]. Secure the airway and provide ventilatory support for laryngospasm or seizures [^notfound].

---

### Chronic management

Chronic management focuses on **oral calcium and active vitamin D** (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) for hypoparathyroidism and related disorders [^114cFMEX]. Treat underlying causes — such as vitamin D deficiency, renal tubular disorders, or medication-induced hypocalcemia — and adjust chronic therapies with regular monitoring of calcium, magnesium, and renal function [^114cFMEX].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **seizures and laryngospasm** from severe hypocalcemia, cardiac arrhythmias due to prolonged QT and torsades de pointes, and rhabdomyolysis from prolonged muscle spasms. Chronic hypocalcemia can cause cataracts, basal ganglia calcifications, and nephrolithiasis [^113Vbd5C] [^116tuAyA].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the cause and response to therapy. Transient causes (e.g. post-surgical hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency) often resolve with treatment, whereas **chronic conditions** (e.g. genetic hypoparathyroidism, Gitelman syndrome) require lifelong management and have a guarded prognosis without adherence [^114cFMEX] [^112ZYtQ1].

---

Carpopedal spasm is a **distinctive manifestation of tetany** due to hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia; prompt recognition, electrolyte correction, and targeted therapy for the cause are essential to prevent serious complications and improve outcomes [^115wbZiE].

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Papaverine is recommended in various conditions accompanied by spasm of smooth muscle, such as vascular spasm associated with acute myocardial infarction (coronary occlusion), angina pectoris, peripheral and pulmonary embolism, peripheral vascular disease in which there is a vasospastic element, or certain cerebral angiospastic states, and visceral spasm, as in ureteral, biliary, or gastrointestinal colic.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — coronary artery spasm — states that vasospasm episodes can lead to ventricular arrhythmias (VA), syncope, and sudden cardiac death (SCD), and treatment includes risk factor elimination and vasodilators including dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with or without nitrates; patients with coronary artery spasm who survive sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) are a high-risk population, recurrent VA may be prevented with risk factor modification, smoking cessation, and ongoing nitrates/dihydropyridine therapy, but SCA or VA can recur despite medical therapy or poor compliance; whether a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator provides protection while therapy is being evaluated has not been assessed but is of interest; and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) can terminate VT/VF initiated by spasm, potentially preventing SCD.

### Health-related quality of life in patients with conditions affecting the hand: meta-analysis [^1124DfbR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a pre-designed data collection pro forma. Data extracted from eligible studies included author, publication year, country, primary pathology (if applicable), health state described, HSUV mean and/or median, HSUV standard deviation and/or range/interquartile range (i.q.r.), study type, valuation method, associated value set (applicable only for indirect valuation techniques, such as the EQ-5D), respondents (that is the specific population valuing described health states), and number and age of respondents. Utility values for distinct cohorts within a single study population were extracted as separate entities provided the health states of the study populations described were distinct. For example, Atroshi et al.conducted a prospective cohort study that investigated outcomes after endoscopic carpal tunnel release. Utility values were reported at baseline and 3 months after the intervention and therefore utility values were extracted for each health state (that is baseline CTS and 3 months after endoscopic decompression). Risk-of-bias assessments were not performed for included studies, as the present study did not seek to determine intervention effect. At the time of publication, no guidelines for utility derivation studies have been published.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics are used to present study characteristics and demographics. Utility values for defined health states are summarized narratively and are stratified by primary pathology, valuation technique, and respondent characteristics. Where multiple utility estimates were identified for a defined health state, pooled utility estimates were obtained using random-effects meta-analysis. Pooled utility estimates were only obtained from sufficiently homogeneous health states with adequate availability of primary data, as determined through consensus discussion between three reviewers. Where not reported, mean utility values and associated standard deviations were calculated using reported median utility values and associated range/i.q.r.

Random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain pooled mean utility estimates with associated 95% confidence intervals. Random-effects meta-analysis relaxes the assumption that variation between utility estimates between cohorts and studies is solely due to random error. The restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method was used to estimate the heterogeneity of variance due to the small sample sizes in eligible studies. Meta-regression has been used to explore potential sources of heterogeneity; this was not conducted due to the small number of studies included in the pooled analyses and the relatively large number of covariates. All analyses were conducted in the R statistical computing environment (version 4.3.1)using the Metafor package (version 4.2–0).

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) supportive care — Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; however, in patients with TLS at risk for end-organ injury with unknown G6PD status, the benefit of rasburicase may outweigh the risk. Rasburicase is given as a single dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg; the maximum dose is 6 mg and it should be repeated only if necessary based on laboratory values, and if used, blood samples for uric acid must be placed on ice to avoid spuriously low levels. Hyperkalemia management per Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) removes exogenous potassium sources, with frequent potassium checks (every 4–6 hours), continuous cardiac monitoring, and oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate recommended; glucose plus insulin or beta agonists can be temporizing measures, and calcium gluconate may be used to reduce dysrhythmia risk while awaiting hemodialysis and/or hemofiltration, which most effectively remove potassium. Hyperphosphatemia is managed with a phosphorus-restricted diet and consideration of phosphate binder such as sevelamer; do not use calcium carbonate in patients at risk for TLS, especially if the calcium phosphate product is > 60 mg²/dL². For hypocalcemia, correct hyperphosphatemia and avoid calcium supplementation unless symptomatic with tetany, muscle spasm, or Trousseau/Chvostek signs. Consider hemodialysis/continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for worsening renal function when electrolyte abnormalities do not correct with medical management. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tizanidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Certain events, such as somnolence, dry mouth, hypotension, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, dizziness, weakness or asthenia, muscle spasms, hallucinations, fatigue, liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity, have been observed in post marketing and clinical trials and are discussed in previous sections of this document.

The following adverse reactions have been identified as occurring in the post marketing experience of tizanidine. Based on the information provided regarding these reactions, a causal relationship with tizanidine cannot be entirely excluded. The events are listed in order of decreasing clinical significance; severity in the post marketing setting is not reported.

### Salt-losing nephropathy in hypothyroidism [^112oJQDL]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 35-year-old man presented with recurrent lower extremity weakness associated with polyuria later progressing to generalised weakness with difficulty in breathing. The patient was hypotensive and dry, with normal thyroid and chest examination, weak lower extremity and carpopedal spasm. Workup revealed hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypochloraemia and hypophosphataemia. Arterial blood gas showed respiratory alkalosis with good oxygenation. Twenty-four-hour urine collection showed normal volume with electrolyte wasting. Thyroid function test revealed overt hypothyroidism with negative antithyroid peroxidase. The patient was well after treatment with levothyroxine, volume and electrolyte replacement and was discharged. Thyroid hormones are related to the expression of the Na-K-ATPase, Na-Pi cotransporter, Mg-ATPase and Na-Ca exchanger pumps in the renal tubules. Sodium, potassium, phosphate, calcium, magnesium and water losses result from decreased expression of these pumps.

### A patient with speechlessness and rhabdomyolysis: a rare presentation of severe hypocalcaemia [^116tuAyA]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

We present a patient with a plethora of peculiar findings caused by hypocalcaemia. The most striking symptoms were his hoarse voice and episodes of complete speechlessness, indicating an atypical presentation of laryngospasm or spasm of vocalising muscles due to severe hypocalcaemia.

Hypocalcaemia causes neuromuscular irritability, which can manifest as muscle cramps and paraesthesia of the hand and feet and in severe cases as carpopedal spasms, laryngospasms and seizures. Laryngospasm, usually presenting with dyspnoea and stridor, is a rare but known and life-threatening sequela of hypocalcaemia traditionally seen in infants. Stridor and dyspnoea have been described in adults as well. However, both cases presented patients with stridor and non-specific problems of the throat, like hoarseness, were not described.

Another striking symptom our patient presented with were oesophageal spasms, leading to direct vomiting after drinking cold water. To the best of our knowledge, oesophageal spasms have not been described before in patients with severe hypocalcaemia. Those spasms are probably the result of neuromuscular irritability of the oesophagus triggered by the ingestion of cold water.

Our patient presented with more peculiar findings that require some additional attention.

First, our patient presented a concomitant rhabdomyolysis which resolved after treatment of his hypocalcaemia, suggesting the hypocalcaemia caused his rhabdomyolysis whereas his (moderate) physical exercise may have aggravated muscle cell loss. Our hypothesis was supported by repeated episodes of hypocalcaemia during follow-up, all accompanied by rhabdomyolysis, disappearing after normalisation of plasma calcium.

One might speculate that increased levels of muscle enzymes are associated with muscle cell damage through the ischaemia that occurs in tetanic spasms as a result of hypocalcaemia. This phenomenon has indeed been described in patients suffering from tetanus. However, the mechanisms of raised CK concentrations due to hypocalcaemia are not well understood, since not all patients with hypocalcaemia develop clinically evident myopathy.

### Clinical features of tetanus… [^113qYnHx]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- There are three forms of tetanus with varying clinical presentations.
- Tetanus is diagnosed based on clinical signs and medical history.
- There are no laboratory tests to support or rule out tetanus diagnosis.
- Tetanus is a medical emergency that requires hospitalization and often causes complications.
- Follow CDC's immunization schedule to ensure your patients are protected from tetanus. Clinical presentations There are three forms of tetanus:

- Generalized
- Localized
- Cephalic Generalized Generalized tetanus is the most common form of the disease. It accounts for more than 4 in 5 cases. Neonatal tetanus is a form of generalized tetanus. It occurs in newborns who lack the passive protection derived from maternal antibodies. Localized Localized tetanus is a less common form of the disease. It's possible for it to progress to generalized tetanus. It typically occurs in people with partial tetanus immunity.

Cephalic Cephalic tetanus is the rarest form. It's associated with lesions of the head or face. It may be associated with otitis media. It's possible for it to progress to generalized tetanus. Common signs and symptoms Generalized tetanus Painful muscular contractions are characteristic of tetanus:

- Difficulty in swallowing or breathing
- Generalized spasms
- Rigidity
- Seizures
- Trismus, or lockjaw painful muscle contractions Localized tetanus Like generalized tetanus, localized tetanus is characterized by painful muscle spasms. However, they're in a confined area close to the injury site. Cephalic tetanus Unlike the other two forms, cephalic tetanus results in flaccid cranial nerve palsies rather than spasm. Common first signs in older children and adults Abdominal rigidity is a common first sign suggestive of tetanus in older children and adults. However, it's sometimes confined to the region of injury.

Generalized spasms occur, frequently induced by sensory stimuli. Complications Nervous system abnormalities, as well as a variety of complications related to severe spasms and prolonged hospitalization, can accompany generalized tetanus. Complications of tetanus can also include:

- Aspiration pneumonia
- Fractures
- Hypertension
- Laryngospasms
- Nosocomial infections
- Pulmonary embolism
- Death.

### Significance of coronary artery spasm diagnosis in patients with early repolarization syndrome [^1119nEgG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Approximately 40% of the patients with CAS with prior VF and inferolateral J wave did not experience chest symptoms at the first VF, and could be misdiagnosed as having ERS. This accounted for 19% of possible patients with ERS without prodromal chest symptoms at the time of VF. The management of CAS and ERS is different; therefore, it is important to differentiate the 2 conditions for optimal medical management.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^112WERiL]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

AAPM&R spasticity assessment and management — key findings guiding recommendations emphasize holistic and patient-centered evaluations, treatment, and reassessments, with assessment of the impact of spasticity management not limited to the reduction of objective measures of tone but also including the impact on function and quality of life. The guidance highlights the importance of multimodal therapies, stating that spasticity interventions should often be used in combination for maximal benefit and that coordination of care between physiatrists, physical and/or occupational therapists, caregivers, and surgeons, when appropriate, is key to achieving optimal outcomes. It also notes a lack of studies that explore effectiveness across conditions and that although there have been marked gains and improvements in management of spasticity, more work needs to be done to differentiate pathologic mechanisms and to achieve more targeted treatment; furthermore, access to care is an obstacle and numerous socioeconomic factors affect access to care and need to be addressed at both an individual patient and societal level.

### Hypercalcaemia to hypocalcaemia: tetany as a side effect of intravenous bisphosphonate treatment [^114Pn7q9]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her 40s with advanced bladder cancer was admitted to hospital with hypercalcaemia of malignancy. Initially, she presented with non-specific symptoms of malaise, fatigue and general deterioration. She was treated with intravenous fluids and zoledronic acid in order to bring her calcium levels down, but subsequently developed significant hypocalcaemia. This manifested as tetany in the hands in the form of bilateral carpopedal spasm. She also reported perioral paraesthesia. Bloods during her admission revealed deranged electrolytes, and her vitamin D level was on the lower scale of normal (25nmol/L). The patient's symptoms improved with electrolyte replacement and oral baclofen for her symptomatically distressing wrist and hand muscle spasms. This case report is a reminder that bisphosphonates can cause significant hypocalcaemia with symptoms of tetany, even when they are given for initial hypercalcaemia. Baclofen worked well to improve symptoms.

### Symptomatic rickets in adolescence [^112RmLRQ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2001). Low credibility.

Aim

To describe 21 cases of symptomatic rickets in adolescents.

Methods

The setting was a primary and secondary care hospital in Saudi Arabia providing medical care to Saudi Arab company employees and their families. Cases of symptomatic rickets diagnosed between January 1996 and December 1997 in adolescents aged 10 to 15 years were assessed with respect to clinical presentation, biochemical and radiological evaluation, dietary assessment, and estimation of sun exposure.

Results

Symptomatic rickets developed in 21 adolescents (20 females), with a prevalence rate of 68 per 100 000 children years. Presentation included carpopedal spasms (n = 12), diffuse limb pains (n = 6), lower limbs deformities (n = 2), and generalised weakness (n = 1). Biochemical findings included hypocalcaemia (n = 19), hypophosphoraemia (n = 9), raised serum alkaline phosphatase (n = 21) and parathormone (n = 7), and reduced 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (n = 7). Radiological studies were suggestive of rickets in only eight children. All children had an inadequate dietary calcium and vitamin D intake. All but one had less than 60 minutes sun exposure per day.

Conclusion

Even in sunny climates, adolescents, especially females, can be at risk of rickets. Hypocalcaemic tetany and limb pains were the most common presenting symptoms. Radiological evidence was not present in every case.

### Magnesium lactate in the treatment of gitelman syndrome: patient-reported outcomes [^112ZYtQ1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Gitelman syndrome (GS) is a rare inherited renal electrolyte wasting disorder primarily characterized by hypokalaemia, hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria. The condition was first described in 1966. It was originally thought to be a variant of Bartter syndrome until 1996 when Simon et al. identified the underlying causative mechanism as loss-of-function mutations in SLC12A3, which encodes the sodium chloride co-transporter in the distal convoluted tubule. Inheritance is autosomal recessive and prevalence is estimated at 1:40 000.

GS symptoms are predominantly related to chronic hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia and commonly include generalized fatigue, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, thirst, polyuria, carpopedal spasm, paraesthesiae, palpitations and joint pain. More severe manifestations such as chondrocalcinosis requiring joint replacement, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest have also been reported. The frequency and severity of symptoms and signs are variable, but contrary to earlier descriptions of GS, and as reported by Cruz et al. in 2001, few patients are truly asymptomatic.

The aims of treatment are to improve patient symptoms, quality of life and serum electrolyte levels, and to ensure cardiac rhythm stability. However, it is often not possible to achieve electrolyte levels within the normal range because of poor tolerability of available medications. Standard treatment includes the use of a high-salt/potassium/magnesium diet and oral magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) supplements, sometimes together with K-sparing diuretics (concomitant hypotension permitting). The need for Mg and K replacement is lifelong and oral dose requirements may be very high. Intravenous electrolyte replacement is best reserved for critically low serum Mg/K, emergency situations or elective surgery in GS patients.

While hypomagnesaemia is a common finding in the chronically sick, the elderly, in malabsorbtive syndromes and in dietary deficiency, very little information exists concerning the bioavailability, efficacy and tolerability of Mg compounds in humans. Studies have largely been limited to healthy volunteers or animal models. This may be because Mg is classed as a nutritional supplement rather than medication and also perhaps because hypomagnesaemia, and its sequelae, are under-recognized in clinical practice.

### Therapies in stiff-person syndrome: advances and future prospects based on disease pathophysiology [^116hQ3Vb]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Challenges on Therapies and Future Trial Designs in SPS

The goals of therapy in SPS should focus from the outset on maximizing the control of stiffness and spasms and improve gait, daily activities, and quality of life but without excessive sedation as observed with antispasmodics. Because of the highly subjective nature of some symptoms and the emotional charge connected with the painful spastic attacks that occur often but unexpectedly form sudden stimuli, there is a need to document effectiveness of therapeutic interventions with objective means. Asking the patients to keep a diary, recording the frequency and severity of spasms, the degree of pain associated with them, the number of falls or startle responses, and any changes in ambulation, mobility, or daily activities has been very helpful.

Since SPS is not as rare as believed, it is essential to increase awareness to start early immunotherapies and conduct large-scale controlled studies. The experience with long-term IVIG therapy has identified the need for more effective long-term therapies because IVIg — although still beneficial — cannot arrest disease progression in 30% of the patients after a mean period of 4 years. There are arguably challenges in a future study design because in addition to the standard scales of Activities of Daily Living and "time to walk" as used in other autoimmune neurologic diseases, in SPS there is a need to include methods that statistically capture the frequency and severity of episodic spasms and stiffness and the task-specific phobias. The lack of objective laboratory studies of response to therapies, such as MRI imaging as used in patients with MS, is also a major issue because efficacy is essentially based on clinical assessments. Taking into account the steady and complex symptom progression and the significant disability some of the patients with SPS develop over time, there is a need to select patients with early but significant disease to evaluate efficacy because we learnt from the HSCT study which showed that selecting patients with very advanced disease may be difficult to show improvement. On the other hand, our experience with the rituximab trial has also shown that enrolling patients with mild disease may increase the chances of placebo effect because the clinical scales may not be sensitive enough to objectively capture fluctuating efficacies to convincingly conclude on long-term benefits especially in small-scale enrollments. All these difficulties can now be overcome with more centers seeing patients with SPS, more experienced investigators to construct a meaningful study design, and the increased awareness of the disease through the SPSRF (SPS Research Foundation) which can facilitate patient recruitment.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^1176SiUL]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

B) Clinical Presentation

Tetanus has a clinical spectrum of which the hallmarks are painful muscle spasms, and muscle stiffness from rigidity (Figure 3). Severity is usually categorised using the modified Ablett score. In Metro Manila, the commonest presenting symptoms of generalised tetanus are back and abdominal pain (due to truncal spasms), trismus and dysphagia. Voice changes may occur early in the disease course. Muscle rigidity - particularly abdominal rigidity - persists between spasms. This may mimic a peritonitic 'acute abdomen', and there are reported cases of unnecessary exploratory laparotomy in patients subsequently diagnosed with tetanus. Opisthotonus - extreme hyperextension of the back resulting in an accentuated arched posture - has long been regarded as pathognomonic of tetanus, but this is a relatively late clinical sign which is now encountered infrequently thanks to patients accessing treatment earlier in the disease course. Risus sardonicus is much more commonly seen at hospital admission, but is less specific for tetanus and should be interpreted within a wider clinical context.

Muscle spasms are exacerbated by stimuli, including loud noises, flashes of light, and touch, underscoring the importance of nursing patients in quiet, dark environments. Prolonged spasms may cause rhabdomyolysis, resulting in acute kidney injury (AKI). Spasms typically peak in the second week of illness, though, in our experience, older adults are at higher risk of early laryngeal spasm, even when limb spasms remain relatively mild. Patients may present with reduced oral intake, which may reflect trismus or dysphagia. Retrospective studies from the Ivory Coast and Vietnam suggest that trismus (93–98%) and dysphagia (83%) are almost always present at hospital admission. Severe dysphagia resulting from pharyngeal spasm confers a high risk of aspiration. Conversely, dyspnoea is rare at admission (5–10%), but may signal impending airway compromise and present a diagnostic challenge in resource-limited settings with suboptimal access to cross-sectional imaging. A few case reports have highlighted fractures due to severe spasms, but in our experience, this is very rare.

### Hemifacial spasm: an update on pathophysiology, investigations and management [^116s9C3v]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

It should also be emphasized that the interpretation of MRI in HFS patients relies on a radiologist or neurosurgeon being familiar with the anatomical details of the facial nerve root. In our experience, initial MRI reports may often overlook the compression at the attached or cisternal segments of the facial nerve, or inaccurately implicate an incidental neurovascular contact. This is particularly highlighted by a recent study, which investigated refractory HFS patients who failed to respond to microvascular decompression. On repeat MRI, persistent areas of NVC were identified along the facial nerve, proximal to the previous surgical site. This was thought to be partly attributable to suboptimal interpretation of the pre-operative MRI.

### Pitch-side management of acute shoulder dislocations: a conceptual review [^116jnbXc]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Suitable methods for prehospital relocation

If a decision is made to relocate the shoulder, prompt reduction is always necessary as the procedure becomes more difficult with time. This is partly due to the difficulty experienced in overcoming muscle spasm the longer the shoulder remains out of joint. Although opioid analgesics have been proven effective prior to reduction, Entonox may be more readily available on a pitch-side setting, being used on the assumption that there is no associated head or chest injury. In the absence of a fracture, pain usually occurs due to stretching and the subsequent tension on the encompassing muscles and ligaments. Therefore, an early successful reduction significantly alleviates pain and may negate the need for further analgesia. However, pain may persist despite reduction if the mechanism of injury resulted in damage to other underlying structures. Often, clinical experience and the availability of medical facilities dictate the decision to relocate the shoulder on-site within the confines on a medical room setting. In an ideal setting, clinicians with prior experience at attempting shoulder relocation should do so. In its absence, it may be more appropriate to refer the athlete to the nearest emergency department. Athletes with a dislocated shoulder generally ambulate off the field with minimal support. If medical rooms are in close proximity, often the transfer time lost to attempt relocation does not have a negative effect on spasm development. This time may also allow prior analgesics to take effect. However, if these facilities are not within easy reach, it may be more appropriate to relocate pitch-side to avoid overcoming muscle spasm. A variety of non-sedating techniques have been described with successful outcomes.

### Familial hemifacial spasm: report of cases and review of literature [^113HRdDd]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2002). Low credibility.

We describe clinical characteristics of 10 patients (five families) with familial hemifacial spasm, with reviews of 13 patients hitherto reported in the literature. There is no clear difference in clinical manifestations between sporadic and familial hemifacial spasms. There is no definite inheritance pattern, but may be autosomal dominant with low penetrance. The ages of onset of familial hemifacial spasm are variable, but occasionally can occur at early years of life. There is a left-side predominance with respect to the affected side of cases with familial hemifacial spasm. Similar to sporadic hemifacial spasm, vascular decompression was effective, suggesting that vascular compression is involved in generating hemifacial spasm even in the familial cases. Familial hemifacial spasm may not be a rare disorder, but may possibly be overlooked. Clarifying the role of genetic susceptibility in pathophysiological mechanisms underlying hemifacial spasm is an important approach toward better understanding of the pathogenesis of cranial rhizopathies.

### Subclinical magnesium deficiency: a principal driver of cardiovascular disease and a public health crisis [^115op6oZ]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical signs of magnesium deficiency

'… magnesium is essential for the normal metabolism of potassium and of calcium… the occurrence in clinical situations of otherwise unexplained hypokalemia and hypocalcemia should suggest the possibility of significant magnesium depletion'.

Among the most common laboratory signs of magnesium deficiency are low potassium and calcium levels, as well as low urine and/or faecal magnesium. The most common neurological side effect with magnesium depletion is the Trousseau sign; that is, 'To elicit the sign, a blood pressure cuff is placed around the arm and inflated to a pressure greater than the systolic blood pressure and held in place for 3 min. This will occlude the brachial artery. In the absence of blood flow, the patient's hypocalcemia and subsequent neuromuscular irritability will induce spasm of the muscles of the hand and forearm. The wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints flex, the DIP and PIP joints extend, and the fingers adduct'. Other signs of magnesium deficiency included tremor, fasciculations ('a brief spontaneous contraction that affects a small number of muscle fibres'., spontaneous carpopedal spasm (painful cramps of the muscles in your hands and feet) and generalised spasticity. Other clinical features of magnesium deficiency include mental disturbances such as depression, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, weakness, neuromuscular irritability (tremor), athetoid movements and convulsive seizures.

A full list of potential clinical and lab signs of magnesium deficiency are summarised in box 3 and box 4.

### More than just muscle spasms: a rare presentation of aortic dissection [^116YgJpB]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute aortic dissection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, often from complications including aortic regurgitation, cardiac tamponade and myocardial infarction. Typical clinical presentation includes a sudden onset of severe chest pain, although this is not always consistent. Clinical signs and symptoms are diverse with an estimated 38% of cases being missed on initial evaluation. Primary neurological symptoms at presentation are rare but have been reported often to coexist with chest pain. We present a case of acute aortic dissection in which the initial presenting symptoms were predominantly neurological. Stanford type A dissection is a surgical emergency with a high burden of cardiovascular death; thus, aggressive identification and management is paramount. Our case re-emphasises the importance of having a higher index of suspicion and a keen clinical eye for atypical presentations of acute aortic dissection.

### Menstruation associated hypocalcemic symptoms and serum calcium in patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism [^1164f3M3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Figure 1 shows the flow diagram for the study. The duration of menstruation of 26 patients with IHP varied from two to six days. Twelve of them had history of hypocalcemic symptoms namely, numbness, tingling and carpopedal spasm during menstruation. Patients with (n = 12) and without (n = 14) menstruation associated hypocalcemic symptoms had comparable mean age (28.0 ± 7.09 yr vs. 31.1 ± 9.45 yr, P = 0.35), duration of illness (6.2 ± 4.97 vs. 7.4 ± 7.6 yr, P = 0.62), serum total calcium (1.5 ± 0.24 vs. 1.4 ± 0.25 mmol/l, P = 0.55), inorganic phosphorus (2.2 ± 0.29 vs. 2.2 ± 0.45 mmol/l, P = 0.72) and iPTH (10.2 ± 13.2 vs. 11.3 ± 11.96 ng/l, P = 0.62) at diagnosis of illness.

Flow diagram showing patients enrolled in the study.

The mean age of 26 controls was similar to that of patients (30.7 ± 6.11 vs. 29.4 ± 8.24 yrs, P = 0.53) and none of them had menstruation associated hypocalcemic symptoms. The mean age and BMI of 12 patients and eight controls consenting for prospective monitoring were also comparable (29.3 ± 6.11 vs. 25.8 ± 4.43 yrs and 20.5 ± 2.53 vs. 23.2 ± 3.5 kg/m², P = 0.18 and 0.06, respectively). All of them had regular menstrual cycles (28 ± 1 week). The duration of menstruation varied from 2–6 days in patients and 4–8 days in the controls. Premenstrual sample was drawn 1–5 days before next menstruation in patients and 1–6 days before in controls.

### Diagnosis and management strategies in sclerochoroidal calcification: a systematic review [^112UsJgX]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Associated Systemic Diseases

In this literature review, the most common systemic association seen with SCC was primary hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by the abnormally high amount of parathyroid hormone (PTH) production by the chief cells of the parathyroid gland. PTH is responsible for providing an equilibrium of serum calcium/phosphorus levels and when there is an imbalance due to excessive hormone production, serum calcium level increases resulting in metastatic calcification. Secondary hyperparathyroidism which is usually caused by chronic kidney disease occurs secondary to elevated serum calcium levels and compensatory increased PTH production. The second most common systemic association of SCC was found to be renal tubular metabolic alkalosis syndromes such as Gitelman and Bartter syndromes. These two distinct clinical conditions are associated with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. While Bartter syndrome usually starts at an earlier age, Gitelman syndrome tends to be seen in late childhood. The classical clinical manifestations of Bartter syndrome are polyuria, polydipsia, failure to thrive, and tendency for dehydration. Gitelman syndrome is characterized by muscle weakness, fatigue, and carpopedal spasm. The relationship between these syndromes and SCC is not yet fully understood. Hypomagnesemia is also another important systemic association. Magnesium is known to have a role in the solubility of calcium pyrophosphate in the serum. When the serum magnesium level is low, calcium pyrophosphate deposition occurs in the joints as well as in the sclera and choroid. This mechanism is responsible for the tissue changes seen in calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (pseudogout). Besides, hypervitaminosis D causes hypercalcemia and results in calcification in sclera and choroid. Interestingly, one SCC patient in the literature was diagnosed with hypovitaminosis D. The authors did not bring an explanation to the coexistence of hypovitaminosis D and SCC.

Statistical analysis of patients with sufficient data revealed no differences between the idiopathic SCC and SCC occurring with systemic disease with respect to age, laterality, and unifocal vs multifocal involvement in this review. However, there was a positive correlation between systemic involvement and parameters including younger patient age, bilaterality, and multifocality.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^114ZLqsH]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Currently a rarity in high-income countries, tetanus is a diagnosis not to miss. Deaths from tetanus fell by almost 90% between 1990 and 2019, largely reflecting the success of WHO's Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination campaign. However, deaths among children and adults have plateaued, and tetanus remains an important vaccine-preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, notably in southern Asia, southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Tetanus results from infections with spore-forming Clostridium tetani bacteria, usually acquired via contaminated wounds and burns. C tetani releases a potent neurotoxin, causing muscle spasms, rigidity, and dysautonomia. Important complications include laryngeal spasm and resultant airway obstruction and respiratory arrest, nosocomial infections, and sequelae of prolonged immobility. Tetanus is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, but microbiological tests can serve as useful adjuncts. Treatment is multifaceted, requiring source control, antibiotic therapy, and antitoxin administration. With prolonged, quality intensive care, many patients survive with good functional outcome. However, due to challenges in leveraging routinely-collected health-care data and performing high-quality trials in resource-constrained settings, several key questions remain unanswered and optimal treatment strategies are contested. In this Review, we provide a state-of-the-art summary of global tetanus epidemiology, its clinical features and differential diagnosis, principles of management, and prognosis.

### Artificial ventilation for basic life support leads to hyperventilation in first aid providers [^112GUS69]. Resuscitation (2003). Low credibility.

The 'Guidelines 2000 for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care - International Consensus on Science' recommend an artificial ventilation volume of 10 ml/kg bodyweight (equivalent to a tidal volume of 700–1000 ml) without the use of supplemental oxygen in adults with respiratory arrest. For first aid providers using the mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose-ventilation technique, respectively, a ventilation volume of approximately 9.6 l/min results. Additionally, a deep breath is recommended before each ventilation to increase the end-expiratory oxygen concentration of the air exhaled by the first aid provider. To investigate the effects of these recommendations in healthy volunteers, test persons were asked to ventilate an artificial lung model for a period of up to 10 min. The tidal volume was set at 800 mL at a breathing rate of 12/min. End-tidal carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation (measured by pulse oximetry), and heart rate were measured continuously. Capillary blood gas samples were collected and non-invasive blood pressure readings were recorded prior to the start of ventilation and immediately after the end of the measuring period. The data reveal a statistically significant and clinically relevant decrease in end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (P < 0.001, median decrease 14 mmHg), and the occurrence of hyperventilation-associated symptoms such as paraesthesia, dizziness, and carpopedal spasms in more than 75% of the participants. Clinically and statistically significant hyperventilation results in first aid providers performing artificial ventilation according to the guidelines. This artificial ventilation is associated with a significant decrease in capillary and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure as well as with multiple symptoms of an acute hyperventilation syndrome. Ventilation performed according to these guidelines may cause injury to the health of the first aid provider. Rescuers ventilating the victim should be replaced at regular intervals and the recommendation to take a deep breath before each ventilation should not be upheld in order to minimise the risk of hyperventilation.

Vasospastic angina — diagnostic criteria: Diagnosis considers "Nitrate-responsive angina: during spontaneous episode, with at least 1 of the following" clinical features, plus ECG and angiographic findings. Transient ischemia is supported by "Transient ischemic electrocardiographic changes: during spontaneous episode, including any of the following in at least 2 contiguous leads: ST segment elevation ≥ 0.1 mV; ST segment depression ≥ 0.1 mV; New negative U waves". Coronary spasm is defined as "transient total or subtotal coronary artery occlusion (> 90% constriction) with angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes either spontaneously or in response to a provocative stimulus (typically acetylcholine, ergonovine, or hyperventilation)". "Definitive" vasospastic angina requires nitrate-responsive angina during spontaneous episodes and fulfillment of either transient ischemic ECG changes or coronary spasm criteria, whereas "Suspected" vasospastic angina is when nitrate-responsive angina is present but ischemic ECG changes are equivocal or unavailable and spasm criteria are equivocal.

Coronary spasm is an important and often overlooked etiology of chest pain. Although coronary spasm, or Prinzmetal's angina, has been thought of as benign, contemporary studies have shown serious associated adverse outcomes, including acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, and death. Definitive diagnosis of coronary spasm can at times be difficult, given the transience of symptoms. Numerous agents have been historically described for provocative testing. We provide a review of published data for the role of provocation testing in the diagnosis of coronary spasm.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^115wbZiE]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypocalcemia

Hypocalcemia is caused by decreased gastrointestinal absorption, decreased bone resorption, or increased kidney Ca excretion. It can occur in various conditions such as disturbances in serum magnesium levels, toxic shock syndrome, tumor lysis syndrome, post-thyroid surgery, and fluoride poisoning. Hypocalcemia can be divided into four main categories: neonatal, with high PTH, with low PTH, and miscellaneous. These various categories are demonstrated in Table 9. The main determinant of hypocalcemia is ionized calcium concentration. The onset of symptoms in hypocalcemia typically occurs when ionized levels drop to around a level of 0.63 mmol/L and present as tingling sensations in the extremities and face, carpopedal spasm, stridor, tetany, muscle cramps, and seizures. Patients may also exhibit hyperreflexia with positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs. Cardiac implications include reduced contractility and an increased risk of heart failure, while hypocalcemia can exacerbate digitalis toxicity. Prompt treatment of hypocalcemia involves administration of calcium, typically 10% calcium gluconate or calcium chloride. 1 mL of 10% calcium gluconate contains 100 mg of calcium gluconate, which is equivalent to 9.3 mg of elementary calcium. Contrastingly, 1 mL of 10% calcium chloride contains 100 mg of calcium chloride which is equal to 27 mg of elementary calcium per milliliter. For acute symptomatic cases, give 20 mg/kg of elemental calcium IV over a 10–20 min period, which is approximately 2 ml/kg of 10% calcium gluconate or 0.7 ml/kg of 10% calcium chloride. Follow this with an IV infusion of 200 mg/kg (or 500 mg/kg in neonates) of 10% calcium gluconate over 24 h. Monitor serum calcium levels at intervals of 4 to 6 h to maintain a total serum calcium concentration within the range of 1.75 to 2.25 mmol/L. Any irregularities in magnesium, potassium, and pH should be addressed as well. One thing to note is that untreated hypomagnesemia can render hypocalcemia resistant to treatment. Hence, it is crucial to assess serum magnesium levels when dealing with hypocalcemia, especially if the condition does not respond adequately to the initial calcium therapy.

### CDKL5 mutations cause infantile spasms, early onset seizures, and severe mental retardation in female patients [^116EEh6v]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the frequency of mutations in CDKL5 in both male and female patients with infantile spasms or early onset epilepsy of unknown cause, and to consider whether the breadth of the reported phenotype would be extended by studying a different patient group.

Methods

Two groups of patients were investigated for CDKL5 mutations. Group 1 comprised 73 patients (57 female, 16 male) referred to Cardiff for CDKL5 analysis, of whom 49 (42 female, 7 male) had epileptic seizure onset in the first six months of life. Group 2 comprised 26 patients (11 female, 15 male) with infantile spasms previously recruited to a clinical trial, the UK Infantile Spasms Study. Where a likely pathogenic mutation was identified, further clinical data were reviewed.

Results

Seven likely pathogenic mutations were found among female patients from group 1 with epileptic seizure onset in the first six months of life, accounting for seven of the 42 in this group (17%). No mutations other than the already published mutation were found in female patients from group 2, or in any male patient from either study group. All patients with mutations had early signs of developmental delay and most had made little developmental progress. Further clinical information was available for six patients: autistic features and tactile hypersensitivity were common but only one had suggestive Rett-like features. All had a severe epileptic seizure disorder, all but one of whom had myoclonic jerks. The EEG showed focal or generalised changes and in those with infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia. Slow frequencies were seen frequently with a frontal or fronto-temporal predominance and high amplitudes.

Conclusions

The spectrum of the epileptic seizure disorder, and associated EEG changes, in those with CDKL5 mutations is broader than previously reported. CDKL5 mutations are a significant cause of infantile spasms and early epileptic seizures in female patients, and of a later intractable seizure disorder, irrespective of whether they have suspected Rett syndrome. Analysis should be considered in these patients in the clinical setting.

### Botulinum toxins in pain management [^111ZpbPB]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

BTs are a useful treatment in refractory MPS and have shown promise in various superficial neuropathic pain syndromes. Presumably BTs work by breaking the spasm/pain cycle, giving the patient a "window of opportunity" for traditional conservative measures to have a greater beneficial impact, but several studies suggest that a direct antinociceptive effect distinct from any reduction in muscle spasm may be at play. The major benefit of BTs compared with standard therapies is duration of response. BTs cannot be considered a "first line" treatment for any pain application; however, in refractory cases in which nothing else has helped, BTs may offer the patient and physician a chance for improvement and perhaps even cure.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: updated evidence and new questions [^114JSEhv]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment neuropathy, affecting quality of life for many people. Although it is a well recognised condition, new insights into epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment have emerged in the past 6 years. The availability of disease-modifying treatments for rare systemic disorders associated with carpal tunnel syndrome (eg, amyloidosis) should alert clinicians to these diagnostic possibilities. Besides clinical evaluation and electrophysiology, the role of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool has been confirmed and new ultrasound techniques have been applied, the clinical use and feasibility of which require further investigation. Surgical and non-surgical interventions are beneficial for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome and several treatment options are now available, giving clinicians the possibility to choose the best approach for every patient. New diagnostic and therapeutic techniques require further validation.

### Localised normocalcaemic tetany secondary to dehydration in an individual with gitelman syndrome [^117Pa5vB]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Dehydration is a common presentation to any emergency department with symptoms ranging from lethargy, confusion, oliguria as well as those specific to the underlying cause. In this case we describe a young patient who following a short history of vomiting and abdominal pain developed carpopedal spasm and distal parasthesia on a background of Gitelman syndrome. Biochemical blood analysis showed a marked hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and mild metabolic alkalosis in addition to a prolonged QTc interval of 592 ms seen on ECG. Following fluid replacement and electrolyte correction his clinical symptoms resolved along with QTc normalisation. This case demonstrates a patient with a rare and interesting renal disorder who presented with typical biochemical and ECG abnormalities in addition to tetany in the presence of normal plasma calcium.

### 8.4% sodium bicarbonate [^1121jdVP]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Precautions

The potentially large loads of sodium given with bicarbonate require that caution be exercised in the use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with congestive heart failure or other edematous or sodium-retaining states, as well as in patients with oliguria or anuria. See table in HOW SUPPLIED section for amounts of sodium present in solutions.

Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.

Potassium depletion may predispose to metabolic alkalosis and coexistent hypocalcemia may be associated with carpopedal spasm as the plasma pH rises. These dangers can be minimized if such electrolyte imbalances are appropriately treated prior to or concomitantly with bicarbonate infusion.

Rapid injection (10 mL/min) of hypertonic Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP, solutions into neonates and children under two years of age may produce hypernatremia, a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure and possible intracranial hemorrhage. The rate of administration in such patients should therefore be limited to no more than 8 mEq/kg/day. A 4.2% solution may be preferred for such slow administration. In emergencies such as cardiac arrest, the risk of rapid infusion must be weighed against the potential for fatality due to acidosis.

Drug Interactions

Additives may be incompatible; norepinephrine and dobutamine are incompatible with sodium bicarbonate solution.

The addition of sodium bicarbonate to parenteral solutions containing calcium should be avoided, except where compatibility has been previously established. Precipitation or haze may result from sodium bicarbonate-calcium admixtures. NOTE: Do not use the injection if it contains precipitate.

Additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist, if available. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique, mix thoroughly and do not store.

Laboratory Tests

The aim of all bicarbonate therapy is to produce a substantial correction of the low total CO2 content and blood pH, but the risks of overdosage and alkalosis should be avoided. Hence, repeated fractional doses and periodic monitoring by appropriate laboratory tests are recommended to minimize the possibility of overdosage.

Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with sodium bicarbonate. It is also not known whether sodium bicarbonate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium bicarbonate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

### New evidence for common practices in carpal tunnel syndrome [^111Mh7r9]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on carpal tunnel syndrome:

- **Definition**: CTS is condition characterized by symptomatic compressive neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist.
- **Pathophysiology**: CTS is caused by compression and traction of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, either due to idiopathic causes or secondary to fibrous hypertrophy of synovial flexor sheath or due to repetitive movements of the wrist.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence and incidence of CTS in the United State are 7.8% and 2.3 per 100 person-years, respectively.
- **Disease course**: The combination of increased pressure in the tunnel, median nerve microcirculation injury, median nerve connective tissue compression, and synovial tissue hypertrophy results in altered function of the nerve, demyelination, and degeneration of the nerve at the site of compression and beyond. These events cause paresthesias, weakness, and loss of function in the distal distribution of median nerve (thumb, index, middle finger, and the radial side of the ring finger) and even outside the distribution of the median nerve.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Carpal tunnel release is effective in 70–90% of the patients. The recurrence rate after carpal tunnel release varies from 3–25%.

Predictors of MINOCA as Clinical Presentation

We analyzed predictors of MINOCA as clinical presentation in the overall population and we demonstrated that only a positive acetylcholine test and the presence of MB (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.25–3.26; P = 0.004 and OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.27–4.49; P = 0.007, respectively) were independent predictors of MINOCA (Table S3). Moreover, we performed a sensitivity analysis evaluating the predictive value of MB for MINOCA as clinical presentation in patients with a positive response and in patients with a negative response to acetylcholine test, demonstrating that the presence of MB was a predictor of MINOCA only in patients with a positive acetylcholine test, but not in patients with a negative acetylcholine test (Table S4), suggesting a strong relationship between MB and vasomotor disorders in MINOCA.

Of importance, considering only patients with MB, we assessed the predictors of MINOCA as clinical presentation to identify MB features associated with a more "malignant" clinical course. We demonstrated that among patients having MB, the presence of acetylcholine positive test was the only independent predictor of MINOCA as clinical presentation (OR, 4.37; 95% CI, 1.08–17.72; P = 0.039).

### Paradoxical hypomagnesemia caused by excessive ingestion of magnesium hydroxide [^114FgZTF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Excessive ingestion of magnesium may lead to hypermagnesemia even without kidney dysfunction. Several cases of development of hypermagnesemia after overdose of magnesium hydroxide have been reported. Although magnesium hydroxide is widely used as laxative, its overdose may induce diarrhea, which is followed by excessive magnesium loss. I report a case of paradoxical hypomagnesemia developed after excessive ingestion of magnesium hydroxide. A 39-year-old woman was presented to the emergency department complaining of severe watery diarrhea and carpopedal spasm after ingesting a handful of magnesium hydroxide tablets. The laboratory tests detected hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normokalemia. Calcium gluconate was given to the patient, but her symptom did not improve shortly. The symptom disappeared spontaneously 2 days after the watery diarrhea subsided. This case shows that overdose of magnesium hydroxide, which leads to massive diarrhea, might induce hypomagnesemia unexpectedly. This case also suggests that it should be treated, as well as typical magnesium deficiency.

### An international survey of patients with cervical dystonia [^117TAJKx]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The study found that satisfaction with the information provided at diagnosis was generally low and the majority of patients used the internet to research their condition. Studies in neurology clinics indicate that dissatisfaction with information and emotional support provided by the physician may be important reasons for patients seeking a second opinion. Interestingly, receiving a new diagnosis and/or treatment advice did not appear to influence satisfaction in this study. The high percentage of patients who used the internet to research their condition is likely due to the methodology used in this study in which patients were largely recruited through internet sites and social medial, biasing the study toward those patients with Internet access and skills.

From this study, patient expectations of treatment were high with almost two-thirds expecting to be 'free' of spasms or pain. These high expectations may have negatively influenced the satisfaction with overall (any) treatment of CD — whereas 64% of patients reported symptom improvements with medical treatment, 49% of patients were either equivocal or dissatisfied with their treatment outcome. This is an important insight, as treatment satisfaction has been shown to be a key factor in determining quality of life in CD. The majority (86%) of the patients were treated with BoNT therapy and thus the findings for patient satisfaction with BoNT were similar to satisfaction with treatment overall. Such findings highlight the need to explain to patients that while BoNT-A treatment is often effective, it is not a cure and there may be residual symptoms. Although patient satisfaction with BoNT treatment has not been found to correlate with the severity or complexity of CD, it is our experience (especially with more complex patients) that it is worth discussing that not all types of CD respond in the same way and there will be variability in how well patients respond to treatment.

American Academy of Neurology assessment — symptomatic treatment recommendations state that although likely effective (Level A), quinine derivatives should be avoided for routine use in the management of muscle cramps because of the potential of toxicity, but in select patients they can be considered for an individual therapeutic trial once potential side effects are taken into account. Vitamin B complex, Naftidrofuryl, and calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem are possibly effective and may be considered in the management of muscle cramps (Level C). Further studies are needed to identify agents that are effective and safe for the treatment of muscle cramps.

### Post-thyroidectomy early serum ionic calcium level: predictor of prolonged hypocalcemia [^116ooUZ5]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2013). Low credibility.

One of the more common complications of thyroid surgery is postoperative hypocalcemia, which is potentially serious. Its clinical manifestations range from minimal twitching to life-threatening tetany. Affected patients might require a prolonged hospital stay and supplementation with calcium and vitamin D. In cases of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia, it is not always easy to predict which patients will require close monitoring of serum calcium levels. We conducted a study to determine whether early (< 24 hr) measurement of serum ionic calcium (SiCa) levels can predict the development of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia. We retrospectively analyzed the charts of 150 adults (144 women and 6 men) who had undergone total or partial thyroidectomy, and we identified 42 patients (all women) who had either transient (< 1 mo; n = 27) or prolonged (1 to 6 mo; n = 15) temporary hypocalcemia. We found that the patients who turned out to have prolonged hypocalcemia had significantly lower early levels of SiCa than did the patients who later developed only transient hypocalcemia (p = 0.000002). Also, patients with prolonged hypocalcemia had a significantly higher incidence of serious sequelae, including carpopedal spasms and signs of tetany. We conclude that early measurement of SiCa is a reliable predictor of prolonged temporary hypocalcemia following total or partial thyroidectomy.

Case presentation

This 42-year-old woman was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1986 when she was 23 years old. She had undergone a physical examination and laboratory tests during the prior year with normal results. (These normal laboratory results are no longer available.) She was treated with surgery and 12 courses of cisplatin, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide. Several months after finishing her chemotherapy, she developed right-sided facial and arm twitching (possible seizures suggested by a neurologist), carpopedal spasm, and paresthesias in extremities. Head CT and EEG were normal. Laboratory tests showed hypokalemia (2.5 mEq/l), hypocalcemia (7.8 mg/dl), and hypomagnesemia (0.2 mg/dl). From1986 to 2003, she noted muscle aches and fatigue. Her plasma K⁺ levels ranged from 1.2 to 7.2 mEq/l (n = 44 measurements; 23 values = 3.5 mEq/L), and her Mg²⁺ level ranged from 0.2 to 2.4 mg/dl. (n = 44 measurements; 43 values < 2.1 mEq/L). She required daily treatment with oral KCL 20–80 mEq, Mg oxide 200–2,400 mg, amiloride 5–20 mg, and spironolactone 100–200 mg to maintain her electrolytes in or near the normal range. She was admitted for IV potassium administration one time in 2002.

Case presentation

The proband is a 13-year-old boy who presented to the emergency unit with bilateral carpopedal spasm along with an acute febrile illness. He had a history of similar events since the age of 7 months, presumably triggered by febrile conditions due to respiratory tract infections. He had recurrent muscle cramps and lethargy associated with acute febrile illnesses, and in-between these episodes, he was apparently well. He is the third child of a non-consanguineous couple and was delivered by normal-vaginal delivery, with a birth weight of 2.5 kg. His developmental milestones were age-appropriate and immunization schedule was up-to-date. He has two elder siblings who are apparently healthy.

On admission to the emergency unit, he was alert, conscious and febrile with stable vital signs. He had carpopedal spasm involving mainly the upper limbs (Fig. 1), which was reproducible by inflating a blood-pressure cuff placed on the patient's arms. Chvostek's sign was negative. He had diminished deep tendon reflexes in both upper and lower extremities with flexor plantar response. There was no papilledema, mental slowness or seizures. No facial dysmorphism was observed and other systemic examinations were unremarkable.

Blood samples were taken for basic investigations including full blood count and inflammatory markers, which were all normal. He had persistent low serum corrected calcium levels with hyperphosphatemia, mild hypomagnesaemia, and low parathyroid hormone levels. His renal functions, urine full report, arterial blood gas analysis and renal tract imaging were unremarkable. Other hormonal assays including Thyroid stimulating hormone (2.27 mIU/ L), free thyroxine (1.37 ng/dL), follicle stimulating hormone (2.5 mIU/L), luteinizing hormone (1.01 mIU/L), 9 am cortisol (312 nmol/L), prolactin (138.7 mIU/L) and testosterone (0.6 nmol/L) were within the normal range.

### Significance of coronary artery spasm diagnosis in patients with early repolarization syndrome [^114dqQjQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previously described patients with early repolarization syndrome may have experienced silent coronary artery spasm because the diagnosis ofwas mainly based on symptoms or coronary angiography findings, without performing a spasm provocation test. This study investigated the significance ofdiagnosis and evaluated the incidence of silentin patients with possible(ie, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and inferolateral J wave).

Methods and Results

The study included 34 patients with idiopathicand inferolateral J wave. Thirteen patients (38%) were diagnosed as havingon the basis of coronary angiography with spasm provocation test (n = 8) and documentation of spontaneouselevation (n = 5). Of the 13 patients with, 5 (38%) did not experience chest symptoms before and during, and were diagnosed as having silent. The remaining 21 patients (62%), with a negative provocation test result and absence of chest symptoms, were considered to have ERS. During the 92 months of follow‐up, patients with CAS receiving appropriate medical treatment with antianginal drugs showed a favorable outcome. In contrast, 4 of 21 patients with ERS (19%) hadrecurrences. The use of monotherapy or combination therapy, consisting of quinidine, cilostazol, and bepridil, in the 4 patients with ERS, was effective in suppressing.

Conclusions

Approximately 40% of patients with CAS with documentedand inferolateral J wave did not experience chest symptoms at the first, and could have been misdiagnosed as having. The use of the spasm provocation test is considered essential to differentiate patients for optimal medical treatment.

### The management of pain in spasticity [^117M3jAM]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Pain is a common feature of spasticity and muscle spasms and the reasons for this are discussed in this article. However, the causes of this spasticity have to be determined and for successful management, knowing the underlying mechanisms, which produce spasticity, is necessary. In addition to knowing the range of available treatments, one has to know their particular contribution to the overall management of the patient. The assessment and management of the spastic patient is multi-disciplinary and painful spasticity changes over time. This therefore requires repeated assessments and the direction of the treatment may also change. Pain may be a dominant feature, but is rarely the sole symptom. This article looks at a strategy for the overall management of the patient with the focus on managing pain.

### UK national chronic hypoparathyroidism audit [^114cFMEX]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic hypoparathyroidism is a rare disease with a prevalence of 37 per 100,000. It usually arises due to operative trauma to the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy or other anterior neck surgery although a range of other causes are also seen including autoimmune, genetic, mineral deposition disorders and others. Acute hypoparathyroidism is conventionally defined as that which lasts less than 6 months after surgery and is terminated by spontaneous recovery of parathyroid function and chronic hypoparathyroidism is that lasting longer than 6 months and which rarely recovers. The major clinical manifestations of chronic hypoparathyroidism relate to hypocalcaemia and include tetany, paraesthesia, carpopedal spasm and muscular cramps. Other symptoms include impaired cognition, neuropsychological manifestations and reduced quality of life. Clinical manifestations may also arise due to complications of treatment, especially where this is insufficiently or inexpertly monitored and managed and may include the occurrence of nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and impairment of renal function. Unlike management of other endocrine deficiency states where treatment with hormone replacement therapy is the norm, individuals with chronic hypoparathyroidism are conventionally managed with activated vitamin D compounds in the form of alfacalcidol or calcitriol and oral calcium salts including calcium carbonate and others. The main risks of these treatments arise from insufficient biochemical monitoring and include symptomatic hypocalcaemia, iatrogenic hypercalcaemia and renal manifestations as described above. Treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone as hormone replacement therapy is now licensed in some areas of the world although the field is very much at the dawn of this era and there are still shortcomings and limitations of this treatment in its current form and further development is still required. Individuals with chronic hypoparathyroidism may experience suboptimal care with a high frequency of unplanned hospitalisationand occurrence of iatrogenic harm. In 2015 the European Society for Endocrinology published authoritative, evidence base consensus guidelines on the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism. Since this time other consensus guidelines on the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism have also been published. Specifically, these are: a summary statement and guideline from Brandi and colleagues in 2016and a Canadian and international consensus paper by Khan et al.in 2019. The main difference between these three documents reflects the accumulating evidence base supporting the use of rhPTH1‐84 in that Bollerslev et al.recommend against its use where as Brandi et al.and Khan et al.promote its use under specific circumstances and both documents provide specific evidence based recommendations for when to consider its use. Other differences between the documents are that Brandi et al.suggest the use of phosphate binders when needed and also propose key objectives for a future research agenda in the management of hypoparathyroidism and Khan et al.include a very useful section on the management of hypoparathyroidism in pregnancy and a detailed section summarising the evidence base around complications of treatment.

### Hypocalcemic tetany: a simple bedside marker of poor outcome in acute pancreatitis [^1169iNux]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Comparison of outcome parameters in patients with tetany and asymptomatic hypocalcemia

All patients in the tetany group had POF (100%) compared with 8 (32%) patients in patients with asymptomatic hypocalcemia. Six patients (50%) in the tetany group required intervention compared with 7 (28%) patients in the asymptomatic hypocalcemia group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.189). Interventions in these patients (6 in the tetany group and 7 in the asymptomatic hypocalcemia group) included percutaneous drainage in all of them and surgical necrosectomy in 2 additional patients in the tetany group. Thirty day (early) mortality was observed in 10 (83.3%) patients in the tetany group compared with 2 (8%) patients in the asymptomatic hypocalcemia group. Two more patients in the tetany group succumbed to the illness on days 41 and 81 from the onset of illness and thus all patients in the tetany group died.

Clinical profile of patients with tetany

Tetany was observed in 12 (32.4%) of patients (6 male) with biochemical hypocalcemia. All patients with tetany had severe pancreatitis. CECT could be done in 6 patients with tetany and 3 patients had CTSI score of 8 and the other 3 patients had CTSI of 10. Trousseau sign (Fig. 1A, B, C) could be elicited in all patients, whereas Chvostek sign could be elicited in only 3 (25%) patients. None of the patients with tetany had metabolic alkalosis. Ionized calcium less than 0.652 mmol/L predicted tetany with a sensitivity of 91.2% and specificity of 74.8% (optimal sensitivity and specificity as derived from ROC). Ionized calcium less than 0.652 mmol/L predicted severe pancreatitis with a sensitivity of 60.5% and specificity of 82.1% (optimal sensitivity and specificity as derived from ROC).

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery spasm — Coronary artery spasm results from vasomotor dysfunction and can occur in the presence or absence of atherosclerotic ischemic heart disease, and vasospasm episodes can lead to VA, syncope, and SCD. Treatment includes risk factor elimination including smoking cessation, and treatment with vasodilators including dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with or without nitrates. Patients with coronary artery spasm who survive an SCA are a high-risk population, and recurrent VA, even life-threatening, may be prevented if coronary artery spasm can be effectively addressed with risk factor modification, smoking cessation, and ongoing treatment with nitrates and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers; however, SCA or VA can recur despite medical therapy or if compliance is poor. Whether a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator may provide protection while medical therapy is being evaluated has not been assessed but is of interest, and an ICD can terminate VT/VF initiated by spasm, potentially preventing SCD.

### Managing persistent radial artery spasm during coronary catheterization: a complex case study [^112yzJyx]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Discussion

The etiology of RAS remains elusive, yet emerging research suggests it results from a constellation of factors. Central to the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in RAS is the stretching of nerves within the tunica adventitia, coupled with localized trauma to the tunica intima of the arterial walls. These events trigger vasoreactive reflexes, which are subsequently exacerbated by an overactive autonomic sympathetic system in these settings. Supporting this hypothesis, studies have demonstrated a clear reduction in RAS incidents following interventions that inhibit sympathetic activity, such as blockades at the cervicothoracic ganglion or brachial plexus.

The management of RAS is complex, necessitating a structured yet adaptive approach. Our step‐by‐step management, represented in Figure 1, reflects a synthesis of evidence‐based strategies tailored to our case's unique challenges. Step 1 in managing RAS involves the careful administration of intra‐arterial vasodilators, tailored to the patient's blood pressure and heart rate. Verapamil (2.5−5 mg) or Diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg) works to relax the vascular smooth muscle cells, while nitroglycerin (200−600 mcg) acts on the vascular endothelium to promote relaxation. It is important to note that Clevidipine, an intravenous dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with a specific action on the vasculature, may be more effective in certain instances, although its availability in cath labs is not universal. Simultaneously, we center our attention on the management of pain and anxiety. Local anesthetics like lidocaine are utilized to alleviate discomfort at the puncture site, and this is augmented by systemic analgesia with agents such as morphine or fentanyl. At the same time, benzodiazepines are administered to reduce anxiety, providing a sedative effect and dampening sympathetic nervous system stimulation. In Step 2, we employ nonpharmacological methods to enhance vasodilation. Applying a convective warming system to the forearm and utilizing the "clamp and release" technique with a sphygmomanometer induces local vasodilation, promoting improved blood flow through relative tissue hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis. Should the spasm continue, Step 3 involves more intensive interventions. Orotracheal intubation and deep sedation with propofol substantially decrease central nervous system activity and alleviate vasospasm. Additionally, neuromuscular blockade with rocuronium eliminates skeletal muscle tone around the vasculature and mitigates autonomic nervous system hyperactivity.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^117R6pL6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Do not use unless solution is clear and the container or seal is intact. Discard unused portion.

The potentially large loads of sodium given with bicarbonate require that caution be exercised in the use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with congestive heart failure or other edematous or sodium-retaining states, as well as in patients with oliguria or anuria. See table in HOW SUPPLIED section for amount of sodium present in the solution.

Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.

Potassium depletion may predispose to metabolic alkalosis and coexistent hypocalcemia may be associated with carpopedal spasm as the plasma pH rises. These dangers can be minimized if such electrolyte imbalances are appropriately treated prior to or concomitantly with bicarbonate infusion.

Laboratory Tests

The aim of all bicarbonate therapy is to produce a substantial correction of the low total CO2content and blood pH, but the risks of overdosage and alkalosis should be avoided. Hence, repeated fractional doses and periodic monitoring by appropriate laboratory tests are recommended to minimize the possibility of overdosage.

Drug Interactions

Additives may be incompatible; norepinephrine and dobutamine are incompatible with sodium bicarbonate solution.

The addition of sodium bicarbonate to parenteral solutions containing calcium should be avoided, except where compatibility has been previously established. Precipitation or haze may result from sodium bicarbonate/calcium admixtures. NOTE: Do not use the injection if it contains precipitate.

### Rethinking hypomagnesemia: diagnostic thresholds and metabolic implications in critical illness [^1163JcMg]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Beyond diagnostic thresholds, the physiological role of magnesium in energy metabolism further supports timely supplementation. Magnesium catalyzes most enzymatic reactions involved in aerobic glycolysis and is crucial for the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which connects glycolysis with the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Magnesium deficiency impairs the activity of thiamine pyrophosphate, which is formed through the interaction of Mg²⁺ and thiamine, thereby inhibiting aerobic pyruvate oxidation and diverting pyruvate toward lactate even under adequate oxygenation, creating a state of metabolic pseudohypoxia. Moreover, magnesium also stabilizes adenosine triphosphate; nearly all intracellular ATP exists as Mg-ATP, the active form that powers cellular work. When magnesium is depleted, oxidative phosphorylation becomes inefficient, and cells compensate through accelerated glycolysis, further increasing lactate production. These mechanisms explain the association between hypomagnesemia (or may be low-normal magnesium levels) and hyperlactatemia in sepsis and other critical illnesses. A small clinical study has shown that magnesium repletion improves lactate clearance, shortens ICU stay, and reduces the frequency of lactic acidosis.

From a clinical standpoint, magnesium repletion should not rely solely on an absolute total or ionized magnesium threshold. Waiting until overt manifestations of severe hypomagnesemia, such as unexplained neuromuscular disturbances (confusion, coma, seizures, carpopedal spasm, or tremors), may represent a delayed therapeutic window. Instead, treatment should be individualized and guided by the presence of biochemical or physiological disturbances plausibly linked to magnesium deficiency, including refractory hypokalemia or hypocalcemia, new-onset atrial fibrillation or other unexplained arrhythmias, and persistent hyperlactatemia despite optimization of hemodynamic factors. In such circumstances, even borderline magnesium concentrations may justify reasonable supplementation. However, when magnesium is not truly depleted, excessive administration may lead to accumulation and hypermagnesemia once magnesium is released from intracellular or bone stores, particularly in patients with impaired renal excretion. Therefore, dosing should be carefully titrated to the clinical context and accompanied by close monitoring of magnesium levels and renal function.

Sphincter of oddi and eluxadoline — clinically used opioids predominantly increase sphincter of Oddi phasic pressure, and in post-cholecystectomy patients with suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction 30% had taken opiate-containing drugs 15–120 minutes before pain onset; eluxadoline has been associated with SOD in a small percentage (~0.5%) of patients without a gallbladder, with a study of nearly 2000 patients reporting 10 cases of sphincter of Oddi spasm, most at the higher allowable dose of 100 mg; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned that eluxadoline should not be used in patients who do not have a gallbladder, citing an increased risk of serious pancreatitis that could result in hospitalization or death, including two deaths as of February 2017 — one with symptom onset within 1 hour after a single dose and another associated with sphincter of Oddi spasm with severe abdominal pain and vomiting shortly after the first dose.

### Neuralgic amyotrophy: an update on diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment [^114EG5Bf]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

In this review we provide a current overview of the clinical features, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in neuralgic amyotrophy (NA). The disorder has several phenotypic variations, with a classic form in 70% of the patients. It is not rare, with an incidence of 1 per 1,000 individuals, but it is still often missed. Recurrences are common, yet the proposed multifactorial etiology, which includes genetic, biomechanical, and immunologic factors, limits our capacity to predict or prevent them. NA is a clinical diagnosis, and ancillary studies serve to exclude infectious or malignant causes or to assess a differential diagnosis. If patients are seen early and are still in pain, a short trial of high-dose oral corticosteroids is advised, and adequate analgesia may require opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Persistent complaints are common, and a multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach focusing on scapular coordination, energy distribution strategies, and self-management is indicated.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^111Tqyjo]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Spasticity assessment — initial and follow-up guidance emphasizes consistent tools, comprehensive evaluation, patient-centered goals, and reassessment. We recommend consistency in measurement tools beginning with the initial assessment and continuing through ongoing management. As a component of upper motor neuron syndrome, spasticity includes positive and negative signs/symptoms, with positive signs including excessive muscle tone, hyperactive stretch reflexes, clonus, and spasms, and negative signs including incoordination, fatigue, weakness, and impaired motor control. A comprehensive evaluation of a patient with spasticity should include a patient-centered history and physical examination that incorporates upper and lower limb functional ability, passive range of motion, and active range of motion with repetition of movement. The purpose of the assessment is to set collaborative patient-centered goals for treatment and to evaluate the treatment response in a consistent and repeatable manner, and realistic treatment goal setting for patients (as well as family members and caregivers) is critical because it promotes motivation and cooperation as well as proper management of expectations and can favorably affect outcome. The use of goal attainment scales has been shown to help organize, focus, and clarify the aims of treatment to optimize the clinical response, and Table 3 provides an overview of commonly used tools to guide treatment and for periodic reassessment and follow-up before and after interventions to treat spasticity. Quantitative methods such as motion capture using marker-based or markerless technology can now easily be integrated into clinical practice for reliable and repeated measurement, and electrophysiologic and biomechanical assessments can be used as adjuncts to clinical measures to quantify the associated abnormal muscle activity.

### Decreased activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in non-mitochondrial respiratory chain diseases [^112RCxAV]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to illustrate the difficulties in establishing a diagnosis of mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) disorders based on clinical grounds in combination with intermediate activities of the MRC enzyme complexes. We reviewed retrospectively all medical and laboratory records of patients initially considered likely to have MRC disorders on clinical grounds, and subsequently diagnosed with other disorders (n = 20; 11 males, 9 females). Data were retrieved from hospital records, referral letters, and results of enzymatic analysis at a reference laboratory. Clinical symptoms included developmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, movement disorder, spastic quadriplegia, tetany, microcephaly, visual problems, carpopedal spasms, dysmorphism, hearing loss, muscle weakness and rhabdomyolysis, and fulminant hepatitis. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels were elevated in 13/20 and 9/20 respectively. One or more MRC complex activities (expressed as ratios relative to citrate synthase and/or complex II activity) were less than 50% of control mean activity in 11/20 patients (including patients with deficiencies of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, pantothenate kinase, holocarboxylase synthetase, long-chain hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, molybdenum co-factor, and neonatal haemochromatosis). One patient had a pattern suggestive of mitochondrial proliferation. We conclude that intermediate results of MRC enzymes should be interpreted with caution and clinicians should be actively looking for other underlying diagnoses.

### The neuralgic amyotrophy consultation [^113949tc]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Neuralgic amyotrophy is a distinct clinical syndrome with acute severe pain and patchy paresis in the shoulder and arm region. The clinical phenotype was recently found to be more comprehensive and the long-term prognosis less optimistic than usually assumed for many patients. The disorder can be idiopathic or hereditary in an autosomal dominant fashion, with only few phenotypical variations between the two. This article provides a practical overview of current knowledge on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, pathogenesis and the treatment of pain and complications.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^112zMx6A]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — best-practice documentation advises that in the course of the examination and episode of care, clinicians should document results of the following questions, tests, and measures; upon completion of the clinical patient/client data, clinicians should differentiate CTS from other nerve injuries and then assess the CTS severity to determine if an immediate surgical referral is warranted. Patients may require electrodiagnostic studies when the clinical exam is inconclusive, and when assessing effectiveness of nonsurgical management, results should be documented again at discharge or at other follow-up point. Documentation of standard elements supports standardization for quality improvement in clinical care and research.

### Hypocalcemic cardiomyopathy: a rare presenting manifestation of hypoparathyroidism [^114atjJW]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism patients present with features of hypocalcemia like carpopedal spasm, numbness and paresthesias but hypocalcemic cardiomyopathy leading to congestive heart failure (CHF) is a rare presentation. We present here a case of 55-year-old Asian man who was a known case of dilated cardiomyopathy for 6 months, presented with the chief complaints of shortness of breath on exertion and decreased urine output. On general physical examination, features suggestive of CHF were seen. Chvostek and Trousseau's sign was positive. The patient had a history of cataract surgery of both eyes 15 years ago. Further investigations revealed hypocalcemia. Echo showed severe global hypokinesia of left ventricle with left ventricle ejection fraction 15%. This CHF was refractory to conventional treatment, though, with calcium supplementation, the patient improved symptomatically. On follow-up after 3 months, an improvement was seen in the echocardiographic parameters with ejection fraction improving to 25%.

Table 17 — INOCA endotype vasospastic angina (epicardial spasm) defines spasm as a reduction in coronary diameter ≥ 90% after intracoronary acetylcholine compared with baseline after intracoronary glyceryl trinitrate administration in an epicardial segment together with symptoms and ST-segment deviation on the ECG. Baseline therapy states that if atherosclerosis or endothelial impairment is present, aspirin and statin should be considered, with sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, plus smoking cessation and lifestyle changes. Antianginal therapy is first line CCB (eg, verapamil 40 mg BID uptitrated), second line long-acting nitrate (eg, isosorbide mononitrate 10 mg BID), and third line to change nitrate to nicorandil (eg, nicorandil 5 mg BID), with nicorandil noted as currently unavailable in the United States.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons clinical practice guidelines on arterial conduits for coronary artery bypass grafting [^111acDd3]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Radial artery (RA) conduit — role, harvest, perioperative symptoms, and pharmacologic spasm management are summarized as follows: RA conduits in CABG are typically used as part of a strategy of a multiple, more complete arterial revascularization strategy as an adjunct to a LITA to the LAD or BITA grafting, and unlike BITA, the use of a RA as an adjunct to LITA does not affect sternal vascular supply or increase risk of sternal healing or malunion. According to a STS ACSD study, RA use peaked at 12.3% of all primary CABGs in 2002 and subsequently declined to 5.5% in 2009. The RA graft has the advantage of ease of harvest and ability to reach all coronary territories, is routinely harvested from the nondominant arm, and a properly conducted Allen's test is a useful screening test often supplemented by Doppler or digital pressure or pulse oximetry testing; the incidence of forearm and hand ischemia is exceedingly low when such screening strategies are used. Mild pain, paresthesia, weakness, and other neurologic symptoms in the harvest arm occur in up to one-third of patients in the early postoperative period and are usually transient and self-limiting. RAs are structurally and functionally different from ITAs and are more susceptible to spasm; therefore, the use of pharmacologic prophylaxis against RA spasm is a common practice, and other less frequently used intraoperative antispasmodic agents include milrinone, papaverine, and phenoxybenzamine, with local application preferred because systemic agents may be limited by hypotension; beyond the perioperative period, calcium channel blockers are the mainstay therapy and are frequently continued for weeks or months after.

### Pseudohypoparathyroidism: a series of three cases and an unusual presentation of ocular tetany [^1156dzRC]. Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, increased serum parathormone and insensitivity to the biological activity of parathormone. These patients may present for incidental surgery, procedures related to kidney stones, cataract removals and renal transplants. No particular anaesthetic agent or technique is indicated except that respiratory alkalosis should be avoided as it may further decrease ionised calcium levels and thereby precipitate tetany. In this report, we present the peri-operative management of three patients with this rare condition and describe an unusual presentation of hypocalcaemic extra-ocular muscle spasm.

### Clinical reasoning: a 55-year-old woman with painless hand weakness and atrophy [^116tVFBV]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hand weakness is a frequent chief concern in neurology practice. We report a case of a 55-year-old woman presenting with a chronic, gradually worsening right hand weakness and atrophy, selectively affecting the thenar muscles, without any sensory symptoms. She had a history of carpal tunnel syndrome and previously underwent surgical carpal tunnel release. This case delves into the differential diagnosis of hand weakness and atrophy, emphasizing the significance of myotomal innervation in intrinsic hand muscles. Furthermore, it outlines a systematic approach to diagnosing an uncommon cause for a common clinical presentation, offering a comprehensive differential diagnosis, and exploring various possible causes.

### Impact of electromyographic findings on choice of treatment and outcome [^112xW673]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The subsequent clinical course of patients examined in the EMG laboratory has not been adequately studied before. It is not known how EMG findings in practice affect patients' final diagnosis, treatment and outcome. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that EMG results have an important impact on the choice of patients' treatment and on outcome. Three years after EMG examination, a short questionnaire asking about initial symptoms, the final diagnosis, treatment and current symptoms was sent to 300 consecutive EMG patients. Responses concerning 186 of them (39% men) were received either from patients and/or from their referring physicians. Information obtained during EMG examination was also added. Data was analyzed using methods of bivariate and multivariate statistics. We found that patients with a pathologic EMG had a better clinical outcome 3 years later. Pathologic EMG has an independent effect, pointing to more favorable disease courses, which was further improved by more active treatment approaches received by these patients. The study demonstrated the important impact of EMG findings on the treatment choice and clinical outcome in population consisting mainly of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and radiculopathy. Studies in other patient populations are needed.

### Identification of a G-protein subunit-α₁₁ gain-of-function mutation, val340Met, in a family with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 2 (ADH2) [^117H6s4s]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The identification of a germline gain‐of‐function Gα₁₁ mutation, Val340Met, indicates ADH2 to be the likely cause of hypocalcemia in this family. To date, five other hypocalcemic patients and families have been reported to harbor germline Gα₁₁ mutations, consistent with a diagnosis of ADH2. 3, 6, 7 Similar to the family characterized in this study, individuals with germline gain‐of‐function Gα₁₁ mutations have been reported to generally have mild‐to‐moderate hypocalcemia (serum adjusted‐calcium concentrations ranging from 1.75 to 2.15 mmol/L) in association with serum PTH concentrations that are detectable and within the lower half of the normal range. 3, 6, 7 However, despite ADH2 being associated with mild biochemical features, affected individuals are commonly symptomatic and may present with paresthesia, muscle cramps, carpo‐pedal spasms, or seizures. 3, 6, 7 Moreover, as described for the proband in this study (individual I.4, Fig. 2 A), some ADH2 patients appear susceptible to treatment‐related hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis, 7 although affected individuals likely have a milder urinary phenotype, with significantly reduced urinary calcium excretion compared to ADH1 patients who harbor gain‐of‐function CaSR mutations. 7 Furthermore, patients with germline heterozygous gain‐of‐function Gα₁₁ mutations, in contrast to patients with germline heterozygous gain‐of‐function CaSR mutations, may have non‐calcitropic phenotypes. For example, short stature caused by postnatal growth insufficiency was reported in affected individuals from a multigenerational kindred with hypocalcemia and a germline heterozygous gain‐of‐function mutation, Arg60Leu, 7 and it is possible that the occurrence of mild bilateral cataracts in the proband (individual I.4) may also be due to the germline gain‐of‐function Gα₁₁ mutation, Val340Met. It is also of interest to note that somatic Gα₁₁ mutations that lead to constitutive G‐protein activation are associated with the development of uveal melanomas. 27 However, keratoconus, a corneal disorder, was not observed in all patients harboring the germline Val340Met Gα 11 mutation, thereby indicating that keratoconus is not due to the Gα 11 mutation. Instead, keratoconus in this family is likely due to the identified novel germline variant, His403Gln in TGFBI (Supporting Fig. 1), abnormalities of which have previously been reported in association with keratoconus and autosomal dominant forms of corneal dystrophy. 28, 29 Thus, the occurrence of keratoconus and ADH2 in this family are not genetically associated, but are instead due to digenic inheritance of mutations involving TGFBI and Gα₁₁.

### Are early clinical manifestations of spasticity associated with long-term functional outcome following spinal cord injury? A retrospective study [^116prJX3]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective study of a prospective cohort of patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).

Objectives

Determine the relationship between the occurrence of early spasticity, defined as the development of signs and/or symptoms of spasticity during the hospitalization in traumatology, and the functional outcome 6–12 months following a SCI. Secondly, to determine the specific impact of early clonus, velocity-dependent hypertonia and/or muscle spasms on the functional outcome at the same timepoint.

Setting

Single trauma center specialized in SCI care.

Methods

One hundred sixty-two patients sustaining an acute traumatic SCI were included in the analyses. Comparative analysis was performed to describe the characteristics of patients with early spasticity. Correlations were performed to determine the relationship between the clinical signs of spasticity and the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) scores collected 6–12 months after SCI.

Results

51.9% of the cohort developed clinical signs of spasticity during the hospitalization in traumatology (29.7 days) following SCI. These showed a significantly lower total SCIM score and subscores compared to individuals without early spasticity at follow-up (p < 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, the occurrence of early spasms was only clinical sign of spasticity significantly associated with a decreased mobility at follow-up (r = -0.17, p = 0.04).

Conclusions

The development of signs and symptoms of spasticity, in particular the occurrence of spasms in the first month following the injury may be associated with decreased functional outcome and mobility. Early assessment of spasticity following SCI is thus recommended.

### Hemifacial spasm: an update on pathophysiology, investigations and management [^116CFUt9]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epidemiology

Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, paroxysmal contractions of muscles involved in facial expression, which are innervated by the ipsilateral facial nerve. A recent study of the Finnish population suggested the mean annual age-standardized incidence of HFS is 1.53 per 100,000 individuals, with a 2:1 predilection for women over men (1.94 vs 1.05 per 100,000, respectively). The estimated worldwide prevalence is approximately 14.5 per 100,000 for women and 7.4 per 100,000 for men. Disease onset usually occurs from the fourth through to the sixth decades of life. HFS is often sporadic and unilateral, but in 2.6% of cases may be bilateral. Familial cases are seldom reported in the literature, and account for 2–3% of all HFS cases.

Etiology

It is well established that an ectatic or aberrant arterial loop (typically the anterior-inferior cerebellar artery, posterior-inferior cerebellar artery, or vertebral artery) interacts with facial nerve fibers in the posterior fossa to induce HFS. However, recent studies have enabled further characterisation of this neurovascular conflict (NVC) to provide greater insight into the pathophysiology and enhance pre-operative planning.

Radiological NVC is now classified as being either absent (discernible CSF between vessel and nerve), contact present (vessel merely touches the nerve but there is no discernible CSF between vessel and nerve), or deformity present (vessel displaces/compresses the nerve). Furthermore, the facial nerve can be divided into four anatomical segments: the attached segment (AS), root detachment point (RDP), proximal cisternal segment (PCS) and distal cisternal segment (DCS), providing a useful framework to describe the location of NVC along the nerve.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on the management of patients with STEMI referred for primary PCI [^115vpXrv]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2024). High credibility.

Epicardial vasospasm as a nonatherosclerotic cause of STEMI — recognition and management: Abnormal vasoconstriction sometimes precipitated by a pharmacologic substance and/or emotional stress can lead to transient occlusion of 1 or more epicardial coronary arteries with accompanying ST elevation, and epicardial coronary artery spasm is an uncommon but important nonatherosclerotic mechanism of acute STEMI. The threshold for suspecting coronary artery vasospasm should be especially high in younger patients (< 50 years of age) who do not have cardiac risk factors when diffuse disease is seen on coronary angiography. Irrespective of the suspicion of spasm, unless hemodynamically contraindicated, intracoronary nitroglycerin is useful in patients with an acute STEMI at the time of coronary angiography, helping identify and treat spasm and facilitating accurate assessment of vessel diameter. Patients with myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) and suspected epicardial coronary artery spasm may be referred for comprehensive evaluation with intracoronary acetylcholine provocation in the elective setting, and patients with epicardial coronary vasospasm are best managed with vasodilators such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^113JAnxi]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome worldwide. The clinical symptoms and physical examination findings in patients with this syndrome are recognised widely and various treatments exist, including non-surgical and surgical options. Despite these advantages, there is a paucity of evidence about the best approaches for assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome and to guide treatment decisions. More objective methods for assessment, including electrodiagnostic testing and nerve imaging, provide additional information about the extent of axonal involvement and structural change, but their exact benefit to patients is unknown. Although the best means of integrating clinical, functional, and anatomical information for selecting treatment choices has not yet been identified, patients can be diagnosed quickly and respond well to treatment. The high prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome, its effects on quality of life, and the cost that disease burden generates to health systems make it important to identify the research priorities that will be resolved in clinical trials.

### Development of a clinical prediction rule for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome [^111ResX9]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To develop a clinical prediction rule (CPR) and to assess the reliability and diagnostic accuracy of individual clinical examination items for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

Design

Prospective diagnostic test study with blind comparison to a reference criterion of a compatible clinical presentation and abnormal electrophysiologic findings.

Setting

Multicenter medical center and community hospital with patient referrals from ambulatory primary care and specialty practice settings.

Participants

Eight-two consecutively referred patients (50% men; mean age, 45 ± 12 y) with suspected cervical radiculopathy or CTS referred for electrophysiologic examination.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios.

Results

The CPR identified in this study consisted of 1 question (shaking hands for symptom relief), wrist-ratio index greater than .67, Symptom Severity Scale score greater than 1.9, reduced median sensory field of digit 1, and age greater than 45 years. The likelihood ratio for the CPR was 18.3 when all 5 tests were positive. Interrater reliability was acceptable for all but 2 clinical examination items.

Conclusions

The CPR identified was more useful for the diagnosis of CTS than any single test item and resulted in posttest probability changes of up to 56%. Further investigation is required both to validate the test-item cluster and to improve point-estimate precision.

### Regional citrate anticoagulation for intermittent renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients: a retrospective case-control study [^114ECFf7]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Coagulation-related parameters

Demographic and laboratory information was collected from the electronic medical recording system. Information regarding routine systemic anticoagulants and anti-platelet agents was also documented. Coagulation testing included levels of PT/INR, aPTT, thrombin time, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and fibrinogen degradation product. Thromboelastograms (TEG) assay was conducted and yielded parameters of reaction time (R), K time (K), α-angle, maximum amplitude (MA), and Ly30.

IRRT parameters and outcomes

The following variables were documented: type of vascular access, BFR, citrate infusion rate, surface area of the dialysis or hemofilter membrane, dialysate calcium concentration, hourly ultrafiltration rate, net ultrafiltration, calculated urea clearance index (Kt/V), and urea reduction ratio (URR). Instances of circuit clotting caused by hemofilter clots or clots in the venous bubble trap were also recorded. The severity of hemofilter clots was categorized into three classes: class I (mild), II (moderate), and III (severe). Data on the number of premature terminations of IRRT related to clotting or other causes were collected. Premature termination of IRRT due to circuit clotting more than 30 min ahead of schedule, was defined as the poor IRRT outcome. Other adverse events including hypocalcemia (defined as serum total Ca²⁺ < 2.11mmol/L), severe alkalosis (defined as serum bicarbonate > 30mmol/L) and metabolic acidosis (defined as serum bicarbonate < 20mmol/L) during the whole course of IRRT in the current hospital stay were recorded. Patients with concurrent systemic symptoms were considered having life-threatening hypocalcemia or acid-base disturbance. Patients were considered to have life-threatening hypocalcemia if they exhibited signs of neuromuscular irritability (e.g. carpopedal spasm, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, seizures) and/or cardiovascular instability (e.g. severe hypotension, arrhythmias). Life-threatening acid-base disturbance was defined by the presence of profound neurological impairment (e.g. lethargy, coma), Kussmaul respirations (indicating severe metabolic acidosis), or significant respiratory distress/failure attributable to the acid-base imbalance.

### A pustular psoriasis flare treated with calcium supplementation [^112XbXBc]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Physical examination revealed significant leg edema, disseminated erythematous and squamous plaques, numerous sterile pustules on the legs, and onycholysis. The plaques were hyperkeratotic with inflammatory edges. He had numerous pustules on the legs and some plaques on the abdomen and the thighs associated with gross hyperkeratosis, as can be seen in rupioid psoriasis. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score was not calculated, because it was not suited to his partially pustular clinical presentation (Fig 1).

Fig 1

Physical examination revealed sinus tachycardia and the Trousseau sign (sudden contraction of the fingers and hand into the so-called obstetrical position due to carpal spasms). Laboratory tests revealed significant leukocytosis (12.5 g/L) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (346 mg/L). Albumin and renal function were normal. The remaining laboratory examinations showed severe hypocalcemia (0.96 mmol/L; normal range, 2.2–2.6 mmol/L) and hypomagnesemia (0.62 mmol/L; normal range, 0.7–1.1 mmol/L) and increased levels of creatine phosphokinase (1512 U/L; normal, < 200 U/L) and phosphorus (1.52 mmol/L; normal range, 0.8–1.5 mmol/L). The parathyroid hormone level was low (6 pg/mL; normal range, 9.4–29.8 pg/mL), indicating a diagnosis of primary hypoparathyroidism.

### Treatment of infantile spasms: emerging insights from clinical and basic science perspectives [^1147DW8F]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Infantile spasms is an epileptic encephalopathy of early infancy with specific clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) features, limited treatment options, and a poor prognosis. Efforts to develop improved treatment options have been hindered by the lack of experimental models in which to test prospective therapies. The neuropeptide adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is effective in many cases of infantile spasms, although its mechanism(s) of action is unknown. This review describes the emerging candidate mechanisms that can underlie the therapeutic effects of ACTH in infantile spasms. These mechanisms can ultimately help to improve understanding and treatment of the disease. An overview of current treatments of infantile spasms, novel conceptual and experimental approaches to infantile spasms treatment, and a perspective on remaining clinical challenges and current research questions are presented here. This summary derives from a meeting of specialists in infantile spasms clinical care and research held in New York City on June 14, 2010.

### Gitelman syndrome in a South African family presenting with hypokalaemia and unusual food cravings [^115bbRSt]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Only the index patient (participant A) had previously had significant polydipsia, consuming up to seven litres of water a day. All five affected participants had experienced episodes of paraesthesiae, especially of the lips and hands, often culminating in overt tetany with carpopedal spasm. This was often provoked by anxiety accompanied by mild hyperventilation. Other notable symptoms reported were nausea and vomiting, fatigue, cramps, palpitations, atypical chest pain, muscular weakness and syncopal attacks (Table 1).

Table 1
Clinical data from members of the South African family with Gitelman syndrome

a Treatment for both heart failure and GS

IHD Ischaemic heart disease

All participants but one were heavy smokers and two had a history of ischaemic heart disease. Both unaffected participants had previously been diagnosed with hypertension and one affected participant had high blood pressure recorded for the first time during this study. The index patient's paternal grandfather had died suddenly at age 36, after collapsing at work without any prior history of illness. He was presumed to have died from a myocardial infarction, but the exact cause of death was never established.

All affected female participants in our study had had one or more successful pregnancies, albeit with generally severe gestational nausea and vomiting. The only poor outcome reported was that of the index patient's first pregnancy which ended in foetal death due to abruptio placentae at 35 weeks' gestation. One participant experienced worsening of her food cravings during pregnancy, whereas the others reported improvement in their symptoms.

Biochemical analysis of blood and urine

Analysis of blood and urine samples from the first three participants was done at the National Health Laboratory Service at Tygerberg Hospital. The remaining participants' samples were analysed at PathCare laboratories. These laboratories also provided the results of previous tests done on the study participants.

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^116YsNX4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

The potentially large loads of sodium given with bicarbonate require that caution be exercised in the use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with congestive heart failure or other edematous or sodium-retaining states, as well as in patients with oliguria or anuria. See table in HOW SUPPLIED section for amounts of sodium present in solutions.

Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.

Potassium depletion may predispose to metabolic alkalosis and coexistent hypocalcemia may be associated with carpopedal spasm as the plasma pH rises. These dangers can be minimized if such electrolyte imbalances are appropriately treated prior to or concomitantly with bicarbonate infusion.

Rapid injection (10 mL/min) of hypertonic Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP, solutions into neonates and children under two years of age may produce hypernatremia, a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure and possible intracranial hemorrhage. The rate of administration in such patients should therefore be limited to no more than 8 mEq/kg/day. A 4.2% solution may be preferred for such slow administration. In emergencies such as cardiac arrest, the risk of rapid infusion must be weighed against the potential for fatality due to acidosis.

Drug Interactions

Additives may be incompatible; norepinephrine and dobutamine are incompatible with sodium bicarbonate solution.

The addition of sodium bicarbonate to parenteral solutions containing calcium should be avoided, except where compatibility has been previously established. Precipitation or haze may result from sodium bicarbonate-calcium admixtures. NOTE: Do not use the injection if it contains precipitate.

Additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist, if available. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique, mix thoroughly and do not store.

Laboratory Tests

The aim of all bicarbonate therapy is to produce a substantial correction of the low total CO2 content and blood pH, but the risks of overdosage and alkalosis should be avoided. Hence, repeated fractional doses and periodic monitoring by appropriate laboratory tests are recommended to minimize the possibility of overdosage.

Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with sodium bicarbonate. It is also not known whether sodium bicarbonate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium bicarbonate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

### Clinical outcome assessments for spasticity: review, critique, and recommendations [^1132pVAY]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Recommendations

In this review, the TS was the only ClinRO recommended to assess spasticity, followed by the CSI, S‐NRS, and the MSSS‐88, all recommended with caveats. The latter two evaluate "spasticity" from the patient's perspective, that is, as perceived tone. As such, however, they can only be recommended with caveats. These recommendations are not based solely on the measurement properties of the COA but also on their critical appreciation from the viewpoint of the concept of spastic paresis comprising not only spasticity but also other forms of muscle overactivity. These COAs are recommended for patients with spastic paresis regardless of the cause with the exception of MSSS‐88, which is a disease‐specific PRO.

The TS closely follows the definition of spasticity as an enhancement of velocity‐dependent stretch reflexes. To make full use of its potential, it should be used as one component of the Five‐Step Assessment (FSA) of spastic paresis, specifically designed to evaluate the most important components of spastic paresis. In brief, as the first step, the FSA identifies key muscle groups that contribute to function impairment. These muscles are subsequently evaluated technically using the TS to obtain information about their shortening and spasticity as an indicator of more disabling forms of muscle overactivity, that is, spastic dystonia and spastic cocontraction. Subsequently, active and rapid alternating movements against the resistance of the evaluated muscles are assessed. Several coefficients can be derived from these measurements, reflecting shortening, spasticity, weakness, and fatigability. These have high clinical relevance as they guide the treatment process. Although precise cutoff scores are not yet available for these coefficients, their significance in the decision‐making process can be — in simple terms — described the following way. Patients with a high coefficient of shortening should be primarily prescribed an intensive stretching regimen, or be sent to surgical lengthening procedures. Similarly, patients with a high coefficient of spasticity, if a bothersome clonus is present and/or if spastic dystonia is and/or if the coefficients of weakness and fatigability suggest the presence of spastic cocontraction, might be primarily treated with neuromuscular agents such as botulinum toxin. At the same time, intensive, specific, and long‐term training of active movements against the overactive muscles should be prescribed. Finally, patients with a low coefficient of spasticity, no clonus, and/or without spastic dystonia or cocontraction — which may be objectified using diagnostic nerve blocks — should primarily undergo the aforementioned active training in combination with various adjunct therapies. Functional electrical stimulation or orthotic devices are two examples. Of course, various other treatments are available, but stretching, active training, and possibly botulinum toxin injections should be the basic ones focusing specifically on deforming spastic paresis. On a worldwide scale, this is often not done. Our recommendation to use the TS might change this, paving the way for establishing a more transparent decision‐making process and utilizing efficient treatment methods.

### Hypocalcemic tetany: a simple bedside marker of poor outcome in acute pancreatitis [^111buyiX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Procedures

On admission all patients underwent routine investigations including hemogram with hematocrit, renal function tests, liver function tests, fasting serum triglycerides, serum calcium, ionized calcium levels, phosphorus, magnesium, arterial blood gas analyses, iPTH and vitamin D levels. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of abdomen was done between days 5 and 7 of onset of symptoms. CT severity index (CTSI) score was calculated based on the sum of the Balthazar and pancreatitis necrosis score on a CECT done with pancreatic protocol. Bedside index of severity in AP (BISAP), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and acute physiological and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II were recorded in all patients within 24 h of admission. Severity was defined as per revised Atlanta criteria.

Tetany was defined as presence of either Trousseau or Chvostek sign in a patient with hypocalcemia. Chvostek sign was elicited by tapping on the face at a point just anterior to the ear and just below the zygomatic bone. Twitching of the ipsilateral facial muscles was taken as the positive response. For Trousseau sign, if not present spontaneously, a sphygmomanometer cuff was inflated at 20 mmHg above the patient systolic pressure for 3 min and carpopedal spasm was taken as the positive response. The clinical signs of tetany were sought for in the first 24 h from admission and their demonstration at any time during these 24 h was considered as presence of tetany.

All patients were given standard medical care throughout the study period. In addition, all patients with hypocalcemia received 10 mL of 10% w/v calcium gluconate intravenously given in 5% dextrose or 0.9% saline slowly over 5 min followed by a continuous infusion of 10 ampoules of calcium gluconate dissolved in 5% dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride over 24 h until the resolution of hypocalcemia. All patients who had tetany were given intramuscular 6 lakhs IU of vitamin D. Vitamin D was also given to other patients who were vitamin D deficient. Patients who had hypomagnesemia also received intravenous magnesium bolus followed by infusion. Clinical findings were periodically recorded and investigations were repeated on as and when required basis. Patients were subjected to intervention (surgery, percutaneous drainage or endoscopy) as and when required according to the patients clinical condition. The patients were followed up until clinical recovery or death.

### Preoperative calcium or vitamin D supplement in thyroidectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117E48AT]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Thyroid neoplasms account for approximately 95% of all endocrine tumors. Thyroid surgery is indicated for thyroid cancer and some benign thyroid diseases. One of the most prevalent complications of complete thyroidectomy is postoperative hypocalcemia. Following total thyroid surgery, the incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic hypocalcemia was found to be 13% to 49% in the first 24 ho and 63.6% within 48 h. Some patients have transient hypocalcemia that resolves on its own after the parathyroid function is restored, but others have long‐term hypocalcemia that can last for more than 6 months, a year, or a lifetime and requires treatment.

Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that preoperative vitamin D insufficiency is a substantial risk factor for hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy. Various studies revealed that preoperative vitamin D deficiencies and insufficiencies (VDD) affect around 30% to 50% of the population worldwide, and this number is increasing.

Postoperative hypocalcemia can manifest as asymptomatic hypocalcemia, mild symptomatic hypocalcemia, or severe symptomatic hypocalcemia. Patients with mild symptoms usually present with perioral paresthesia, tingling sensations, or carpopedal tetany, which can be managed with calcium and vitamin D supplements administered orally. Patients with serious life‐threatening symptoms caused by acute severe hypocalcemia, such as laryngospasm, seizures, unconsciousness, or cardiac arrhythmias, must be treated as soon as possible with intravenous calcium supplementation. Some of them, however, may have experienced refractory hypocalcemia, which prolonged their hospitalization.

RCTs on routine post‐total thyroidectomy calcium and vitamin D administration have shown benefits, including lessening the incidence of postoperative hypocalcemia and shortening the hospital stay. Even with a prescription for a routine postoperative supplement, some patients could still experience serum hypocalcemia after surgery, so preoperative supplement regimens were proposed. There were many studies that evaluated the role of preoperative calcium and vitamin D supplements, but the results were still controversial.

The objective of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to evaluate the role of preoperative calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation in patients who underwent total thyroidectomy. We hypothesized that preoperative calcium and/or vitamin D administration would reduce the incidence and severity of post‐total thyroidectomy hypocalcemia.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to patients with coronary artery spasm, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider performing ICD placement in patients resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest due to coronary artery spasm, if medical therapy is ineffective or not tolerated and the meaningful survival is > 1 year.

### Clinical features and prognosis of patients with coronary spasm-induced non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome [^1125ovn1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Disruption of the coronary atherosclerotic plaque complicated by thrombosis is the most common pathophysiological mechanism of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Coronary artery spasm is also considered an important etiologic factor in the pathogenesis of ACS. – In fact, it is not uncommon in the clinical setting to find no significant coronary artery disease in ACS patients who undergo urgent coronary angiography. Although the etiologic mechanisms of ACS in patients lacking obstructive coronary artery disease remain obscure, coronary spasm seems to be the main etiomechanism of nonobstructive ACS. Currently, there is little information on the prevalence and clinical features of coronary spasm in patients with ACS. A recent study reported that one fourth of whites with ACS had no culprit coronary lesion and ~50% of the ACS patients without culprit lesions develop coronary spasm in response to intracoronary administration of acetylcholine (ACh), supporting the hypothesis that coronary spasm is an important cause of ACS.

ACS includes a spectrum of clinical presentations and is classified into ST‐segment elevation ACS (STE‐ACS) and non–ST‐segment elevation ACS (NSTE‐ACS), based on ECG findings. The therapeutic approaches vary considerably between these 2 presentations. Immediate reperfusion therapy is the established treatment for STE‐ACS, while NSTE‐ACS requires initial medical stabilization and early invasive therapy based on risk stratification. – Unlike the invasive percutaneous coronary intervention or intensive medical treatment for complicated coronary atherosclerotic plaques and thrombosis, coronary spasm can be suppressed effectively with calcium channel blockers or nitrates. Therefore, an accurate understanding of the pathological condition in NSTE‐ACS patients is required to provide better medical treatments.

Previous studies described the presence of racial differences in the frequency of coronary spasm, which is more frequent in Japanese subjects than in white subjects. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence, clinical features, and long‐term outcome of NSTE‐ACS associated with coronary spasm in a large Japanese study population.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — symptoms and signs — Hypocalcemia causes neuromuscular excitability and cardiac electrical instability with early symptoms of paresthesias of the perioral region and fingertips, along with muscle stiffness, cramps, and spasms; neuropsychiatric symptoms include confusion, anger, depression, lightheadedness, and irritability. Classic bedside findings include a positive Chvostek sign, which is present at baseline in up to 25% of people, and a positive Trousseau sign described as flexion of the wrist, thumb, and metacarpophalangeal joints with hyperextension of the fingers during brachial artery occlusion. Progressive hypocalcemia can prolong the QT interval leading to torsades de pointes that may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation.

Diagnosis

Tetanus is a clinical diagnosis. Specific diagnostic tests, such as rapid immunoassays, lack standalone confirmatory utility, and may be inaccessible in resource-constrained settings where tetanus is most common. Local or national case definitions aid early recognition and treatment. At the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, tetanus is defined as 'presence of trismus, dysphagia and continuous generalised muscle rigidity or spasms, in the presence of a normal conscious level and without fever at onset'. In contrast, the UK Health Security Agency defines tetanus as an 'acute illness with muscle spasms or hypertonia, and a diagnosis of tetanus made by a healthcare provider'.
The differential diagnosis for generalised tetanus (Table 1) includes hypocalcaemic tetany, NMS, drug-induced dystonias, progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus, stiff-person syndrome, cerebral malaria and strychnine poisoning. Although banned across the European Union and Canada, strychnine-based rat poison is widely available in the USA and many low- and middle-income countries. Strychnine, a competitive glycine receptor antagonist, produces a clinical syndrome virtually indistinguishable from tetanus when accidentally or deliberately consumed. Cephalic tetanus may mimic brainstem stroke, Bell's palsy, myasthenia gravis, or botulism.

Basic tests help rule out differentials and identify complications. All suspected cases should undergo urinalysis to assess for haematuria (a proxy for myoglobinuria) to exclude spasm-induced rhabdomyolysis alongside serum creatine kinase (CK) level where available. Urine is also the preferred sample type for suspected strychnine poisoning.

Other blood tests, including serial full blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), renal, liver and bone profiles, magnesium, and blood gas analysis are also useful. Mild leukocytosis is common; neutrophilia is a poor prognostic indicator.CRP is usually moderately elevated, but may be normal; a marked rise may signify concurrent bacterial infection (typically cellulitis or sepsis at first presentation, and nosocomial infection later). Renal profile may identify AKI, bone profile can exclude hypocalcaemic tetany, and serum magnesium monitoring is useful during IV replacement.
