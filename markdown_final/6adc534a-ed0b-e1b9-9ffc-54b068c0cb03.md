Bariatric surgeries and indications

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bariatric surgeries and indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical NIH 1991 criteria and why they need updating. Then, I should verify the major changes introduced by the 2022 ASMBS/IFSO guidelines. Next, I will examine the updated BMI thresholds, including Asian-specific adjustments and class I obesity with metabolic disease. After that, I need to check special populations such as adolescents, older adults, and those with extreme BMI. I will then review procedure selection principles and the role of revisional surgery. Finally, I should consider implementation gaps, including access, insurance, and the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists, and synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the historical baseline. The 1991 NIH Consensus established that bariatric surgery be considered for adults with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² with at least one serious obesity-related comorbidity, after failure of nonsurgical therapy, which became the de facto standard for decades and is still embedded in many payer policies and older guidelines [^113icVPK] [^114n5Tnd].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for change. Over 30 years, minimally invasive techniques, new procedures like sleeve gastrectomy, and robust long-term data on metabolic benefits and safety have rendered the 1991 criteria outdated; BMI alone fails to capture disease severity and fat distribution, and mounting evidence supports broader indications, especially for type 2 diabetes at lower BMI, prompting ASMBS and IFSO to jointly update indications in 2022 [^116tPdVV] [^116GSejP] [^112yXuRf].

> I will now examine the core updates. The 2022 ASMBS/IFSO guidelines recommend MBS for individuals with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² regardless of comorbidities, and recommend MBS for those with BMI 30–34.9 kg/m² who have metabolic disease such as type 2 diabetes, reflecting disease-based rather than purely BMI-based eligibility and aligning with randomized trials showing superior glycemic outcomes after surgery in this group [^112DYWQa] [^117MyZPs] [^112L67B7].

> Hold on, I should verify Asian-specific thresholds. Because cardiometabolic risk occurs at lower BMI in Asian populations, the updated guidance adjusts obesity definitions to BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² and recommends MBS consideration at BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m², which is a critical correction to avoid undertreatment in this demographic [^112DYWQa] [^112gk3K5] [^115mg86H].

> Let me consider class I obesity without diabetes. The guidelines advise that MBS be considered for BMI 30–34.9 kg/m² even without overt metabolic disease when patients fail to achieve substantial or durable weight loss or comorbidity improvement with nonsurgical therapy, supported by observational data showing meaningful weight loss and comorbidity remission in this group, though the evidence base is smaller than for those with diabetes [^1149vLTm] [^112L67B7] [^112foRpU].

> Next, I should review special populations. For adolescents, MBS is recommended for those with BMI ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile with a major comorbidity, or BMI ≥ 140% of the 95th percentile, after multidisciplinary evaluation; for older adults, there is no absolute age limit, and decisions should be individualized with frailty assessment; for extreme BMI (≥ 60 kg/m²), MBS remains feasible and may be preferred to achieve clinically significant weight loss despite higher perioperative risk, with procedure selection tailored to risk [^113dfShi] [^112SHphr] [^117MyZPs].

> I need to ensure I address procedure selection. Sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass account for roughly 90% of operations worldwide, with similar mid-term weight and diabetes outcomes; sleeve gastrectomy has fewer reoperations, while bypass may offer more durable glycemic control; choice should be individualized to comorbidities, anatomy, and patient preference within a multidisciplinary framework [^113yj99K] [^112yXuRf] [^116D2akF].

> But wait, what if the index operation fails. Revisional surgery is increasingly recognized as part of chronic disease management for obesity; indications include insufficient weight loss, weight regain, persistent comorbidities, or complications; although revisional procedures carry higher complexity and complication rates than primary surgery, carefully selected patients benefit from additional weight loss and comorbidity improvement, and nomenclature now favors "non-responders" rather than "failed" surgery to reflect the chronic disease paradigm [^114HqJun] [^113b2ALS] [^1166GtwQ].

> I should double-check implementation realities. Despite strong evidence, access remains limited, with fewer than 2% of eligible patients undergoing MBS in many countries; payer policies often still anchor to 1991 NIH thresholds, and insurance-mandated preoperative weight loss lacks supportive evidence and may delay care; conversely, the surge in GLP-1 receptor agonists has coincided with a modest decline in MBS utilization, underscoring the need for shared decision-making that weighs pharmacologic, endoscopic, and surgical options [^1148T3Tp] [^1146a6d2] [^115h5nZq].

> Let me synthesize the current indications succinctly. MBS is recommended for BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² regardless of comorbidities, recommended for BMI 30–34.9 kg/m² with metabolic disease such as type 2 diabetes, and considered for BMI 30–34.9 kg/m² without diabetes when nonsurgical therapy fails, with Asian-specific thresholds of ≥ 27.5 kg/m² for surgical consideration; adolescents meeting pediatric BMI criteria and carefully selected older adults or those with extreme BMI may also be candidates after multidisciplinary evaluation [^112DYWQa] [^1111AQzi] [^113dfShi] [^112SHphr].

> Finally, I should confirm the clinical implications. The modern indications mark a shift from BMI-only thresholds to disease severity, metabolic risk, and response to nonsurgical therapy, emphasizing MBS as a chronic disease intervention with durable benefits on weight, diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and mortality; shared decision-making, multidisciplinary assessment, and longitudinal follow-up are essential to realize these benefits while minimizing risks [^116tPdVV] [^113gfZq7] [^113YEcgS].

Bariatric surgery is indicated for **BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²** or **BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² with obesity-related comorbidities** (e.g. type 2 diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea) after failure of nonsurgical therapy [^113icVPK] [^114n5Tnd]. Updated guidelines also recommend surgery for **BMI 30–34.9 kg/m² with type 2 diabetes** or other metabolic disease when medical therapy fails [^112DYWQa] [^111HRs3w]. In Asian populations, lower BMI thresholds apply (** ≥ 27.5 kg/m² with comorbidities**) due to higher metabolic risk at lower BMI [^112DYWQa] [^112gk3K5]. Adolescents with severe obesity and serious comorbidities may be considered after multidisciplinary evaluation [^113dfShi] [^111vKdY1]. Contraindications include uncontrolled psychiatric illness, substance abuse, or high surgical risk [^114BLcwR] [^111vKdY1].

## Indications based on BMI and comorbidities

| **BMI category** | **Indications for bariatric surgery** |
|-|-|
| BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² | Strongly recommended regardless of comorbidities [^112qPFhY] [^112DYWQa] |
| BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² | Recommended with obesity-related comorbidities (e.g. type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease) [^113icVPK] [^114n5Tnd] |
| BMI 30–34.9 kg/m² | Considered with metabolic disease (e.g. type 2 diabetes) when medical therapy fails [^112DYWQa] [^111HRs3w] |

---

## Special populations

### Asian population

In Asian populations, **lower BMI thresholds** are used because metabolic risk is higher at lower BMI: clinical obesity is defined at **BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²**, and bariatric surgery is recommended at **BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m² with comorbidities** [^112DYWQa] [^112gk3K5].

---

### Pediatric and adolescent patients

In pediatric and adolescent patients, **severe obesity** with serious comorbidities (e.g. type 2 diabetes, severe sleep apnea) may be considered for bariatric surgery after multidisciplinary evaluation [^113dfShi] [^111vKdY1].

---

## Contraindications

Contraindications include **uncontrolled psychiatric illness**, active substance abuse, or high surgical risk [^114BLcwR] [^111vKdY1].

---

## Summary of indications

- **BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²**: Strongly recommended.
- **BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities**: Recommended.
- **BMI 30–34.9 kg/m² with metabolic disease**: Considered when medical therapy fails.
- **Asian population**: BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m² with comorbidities.
- **Adolescents**: Severe obesity with serious comorbidities after multidisciplinary evaluation.

Introduction/Purpose

Bariatric surgery is highly effective for patients with severe obesity who fail to achieve sustained weight loss with conventional treatments. Although there is agreement regarding the clinical indications for surgery, little is known about the relative use of bariatric surgery in European countries. The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the current use of bariatric surgery, the degree of endorsement by professional societies, and health technology assessment bodies, as well as the level of reimbursement.

### Clinical indications, utilization, and funding of bariatric surgery in Europe [^115TyZ1u]. Obesity Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

In our analysis, the highest use of bariatric surgery was observed in Belgium, Sweden, and France. As a total spending per capita, these three countries also had the highest level of spending on bariatric surgery. Moreover, high utilization of surgery is not explained by medical tourism, for example, in Belgium, which was not included into analysis. Nevertheless, in all countries, even with a high level of surgery use, the provision of care is still far below demand. Indeed, a recent English study estimated that more than two million people were eligible for surgery according to the National Institute for Care and Clinical Excellence indications, but the actual annual number of surgeries was < 10,000 cases. What is the optimal use of bariatric surgery in the current reimbursement and clinical environment? Based on our comparative analysis of seven European countries, the Swedish model may be the ideal. It includes clinical indications based on a comprehensive health technology assessment process, the specificity of reimbursement tariffs, regular tariff updates, a tight and comprehensive quality assurance program that prevents the overuse and reduction of the quality of surgery, the lack of additional barriers from service commissioners, the understanding of the relative value of surgery and conservative methods by the medical community, and a correlation between the clinical indications and patient characteristics.

There are several limitations to our study. We considered only three of the most common surgical techniques, and the inclusion of other surgeries might have changed the numbers for surgery use. We did not perform a comparison of outcomes of bariatric surgery in different countries as the efficacy and outcomes might depend highly on patient case mix, the number of hospitals involved, and other factors.

There are significant variations in the clinical indications, use, and funding of bariatric surgery in European countries. The update and revision of current clinical recommendations, based on the latest evidence available, are required to ensure optimal access to effective treatment options.

Conclusions

This study provides an overview of the indications, use, and funding of bariatric surgery in patients from seven European countries. Our analysis has highlighted several significant differences between countries.

The indications for bariatric surgery differ significantly among countries despite strong agreement on the clinical guidelines. Interestingly, with increase of utilization of surgery BMI level is lowering, which illustrates inclusion of broader group of patients, although in all countries, indication remains within recommended limit. Despite the availability of substantial evidence for the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery, reimbursement recommendations in Denmark for the coverage of surgery were changed, raising the BMI entry level to 50 kg/m², while England has insisted on mandatory preoperative weight loss programs for which no supporting evidence exists. These changes are not consistent with the current evidence demonstrating the clinical benefit of bariatric surgery in patients with morbid obesity. If left untreated, these patients have significant unmet needs and careful consideration of the clinical, and economic impact of policy changes is required.

The Danish example particularly demonstrates, on one hand, the example of data-driven decision-making in bariatric surgery, but on the other hand, the lack of comprehensive and rational evidence-based disinvestment policy in health care in general across different disease areas. This means that as health care systems operate under substantial resource constraints, for sustainability of a system, it is required to consider both investment (reimbursement of new treatment methods) and disinvestment (termination of reimbursement of noneffective or noncost-effective methods). Tightening reimbursement criteria for bariatric surgery is some form of disinvestment, which, first, should be based on solid scientific ground and, second, should be based on comparison of benefits and costs of bariatric surgery with health care intervention in other clinical areas. In different European countries, bariatric surgery was found to be either very cost-effective or cost-saving and, in general, more cost-effective compared with many technologies in health care. This was supported by an analysis of potential efficiency gains that used cost-effectiveness evidence to reallocate Medicare expenditures in the USA where bariatric surgery was considered worth prioritization in comparison with many other services.

### Bariatric surgery… [^116KGnVU]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

A total of 164 studies were included. Analyses included 161 756 patients with a mean age of 44. 56 years and body mass index of 45.
62. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses and meta-regression. In randomized clinical trials, the mortality rate within 30 days was 0. 08%; the mortality rate after 30 days was
0. 31%. Body mass index loss at 5 years postsurgery was 12 to 17. The complication rate was 17%, and the reoperation rate was 7%. Gastric bypass was more effective in weight loss but associated with more complications. Adjustable gastric banding had lower mortality and complication rates; yet, the reoperation rate was higher and weight loss was less substantial than gastric bypass. Sleeve gastrectomy appeared to be more effective in weight loss than adjustable gastric banding and comparable with gastric bypass.

Conclusions and Relevance Bariatric surgery provides substantial and sustained effects on weight loss and ameliorates obesity-attributable comorbidities in the majority of bariatric patients, although risks of complication, reoperation, and death exist. Death rates were lower than those reported in previous meta-analyses. Treatments of obesity, except surgery, are generally ineffective in long-term weight control. 17–22 In addition to sustained weight loss, surgical treatment provides additional benefits to people with obesity-related comorbidities and reduces relative risk of death due to significant weight loss. 22–26 Consequently, the demand for bariatric surgery has risen dramatically in recent years. The total number of operations performed in the United States and Canada reached 220 000 in 2008 to 2009. 27,
28. The goal of the study was to quantify risks and benefits of various bariatric surgery procedures focusing on adult patients.

Specifically, we report the risks and the effectiveness. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on relevant studies selected from recent publications, including both RCTs and observational studies. For each study design, 32 random-effects or/and fixed-effect models33 were considered, and appropriate meta-analytic techniques were used to analyze the data. A total of 161 756 patients were included in our analyses. Among studies reporting participants' information, mean age of the participants was 44. 56 years,
78. 87% were female, and 74. 64% were white. Presurgery BMI was 45. 62 and presurgery weight was
124. 53 kg. Adjustable GB appeared to have the highest reoperation rate. Body mass index loss was larger for GB than AGB.

Both VBG and SG appeared to have significant effects on BMI loss, although data were limited for these surgical procedures. The 1 OBS that had 5-year follow-up data on ∆BMI after SG reported sustained BMI loss in year 5.
55. Relative category effects compared with the GB category are presented in the shape of rhombuses. Nonsurgical intervention had the least BMI loss, 14 less than LRYGB. Among the 5 categories, AGB and VBG resulted in less BMI loss than GB, while SG had a similar effect.

### Bariatric surgery: the challenges with candidate selection, individualizing treatment and clinical outcomes [^117ATPUJ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The rates of obesity are increasing with at least 300 million people worldwide now classified as obese. Obesity is associated with reduced life expectancy, increased morbidity and mortality, and greater healthcare costs. Bariatric surgery is more effective than non-surgical treatments of obesity with a reduction in overall mortality of 30% demonstrated in surgical recipients. Greater reductions are seen in cancer and diabetes mortality.

Recommendations for referring candidates for bariatric surgery are available but they seldom give guidance to help a specific patient. We will examine the evidence for the magnitude and duration of the positive effects and negative side effects of bariatric surgery. Finally, we will offer a synopsis of the data on post-operative outcomes, and on what to expect in the months and years following surgery.

### Bariatric surgery: the challenges with candidate selection, individualizing treatment and clinical outcomes [^111z9rN2]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Obesity is recognized as a global health crisis. Bariatric surgery offers a treatment that can reduce weight, induce remission of obesity-related diseases, and improve the quality of life. In this article, we outline the different options in bariatric surgery and summarize the recommendations for selecting and assessing potential candidates before proceeding to surgery. We present current data on post-surgical outcomes and evaluate the psychosocial and economic effects of bariatric surgery. Finally, we evaluate the complication rates and present recommendations for post-operative care.

### Systematic review on reoperative bariatric surgery: American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery revision task force [^1145z9bx]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Reoperative bariatric surgery has become a common practice in many bariatric surgery programs. There is currently little evidence-based guidance regarding specific indications and outcomes for reoperative bariatric surgery. A task force was convened to review the current evidence regarding reoperative bariatric surgery. The aim of the review was to identify procedure-specific indications and outcomes for reoperative procedures.

Methods

Literature search was conducted to identify studies reporting indications for and outcomes after reoperative bariatric surgery. Specifically, operations to treat complications, failed weight loss, and weight regain were evaluated. Abstract and manuscript reviews were completed by the task force members to identify, grade, and categorize relevant studies.

Results

A total of 819 articles were identified in the initial search. After review for inclusion criteria and data quality, 175 articles were included in the systematic review and analysis. The majority of published studies are single center retrospective reviews. The evidence supporting reoperative surgery for acute and chronic complications is described. The evidence regarding reoperative surgery for failed weight loss and weight regain generally demonstrates improved weight loss and co-morbidity reduction after reintervention. Procedure-specific outcomes are described. Complication rates are generally reported to be higher after reoperative surgery compared to primary surgery.

Conclusion

The indications and outcomes for reoperative bariatric surgery are procedure-specific but the current evidence does support additional treatment for persistent obesity, co-morbid disease, and complications.

Discussion (see Criteria Table 16)

Table 16
Summary of recommendations with their grade and level of evidence

The indications for MBS have not changed since the NIH proposed them in 1991. In other words, the indications have not kept up with the evolution of surgical technique from open laparotomy to minimally invasive, the changing procedure types, the improved safety of MBS, and the emerging evidence on numerous health benefits of weight loss.

IFSO and ASMBS joined forces to tackle this major problem, and the new MBS guidelines were published in October 2022. Updated guidelines based on current literature and data are vital as access to this life-saving surgery is still very low despite the available evidence — in most countries, access to MBS is less than 2% of eligible candidates.

This study systematically reviewed the best literature available for the outcomes of MBS for various populations with differing demographics and obesity-related complications. Eleven of the 13 criteria were supported by the literature. Where there was a lack of evidence, a Delphi process was employed to achieve expert consensus. PRISMA Prospect summarized the findings.

From these data, MBS impacted positively a range of populations and settings. The majority of examined populations had Grade B recommendations for the indications of surgery. Expert opinion (Grade D) was only relied upon to strengthen the evidence for the role of MBS in a few unique circumstances. This includes patients with a BMI of 35–40 kg/m 2 who have no comorbidities, patients with a concurrent need for arthroplasty, and the role of the multidisciplinary team. Particularly in the pediatric and adolescent populations, the strength of the available data supported a Grade A recommendation. Improved access to surgery in adolescents was one of the two major new emphases of the new IFSO/ASMBS guidelines.

This systematic review highlights the need for well-designed RCTs or large prospective cohort studies to enable better-informed decision-making for clinicians and patients. Clinicians working in the field innately understand the benefit of multidisciplinary teamwork. However, it has yet to be proven in high-quality studies.

Just as the NIH indications from 1991 became outdated as surgical techniques, with a better understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity and improved perioperative safety, these current guidelines should be regularly revisited when new evidence emerges to inform treatment decisions.

### Benefits and risks of bariatric surgery in adults: a review… [^112yXuRf]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance Severe obesity and its related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and sleep apnea, are very common in the United States, but currently very few patients with these conditions choose to undergo bariatric surgery. Summaries of the expanding evidence for both the benefits and risks of bariatric surgery are needed to better guide shared decision-making conversations. Observations There are approximately 252 000 bariatric procedures performed each year in the US, of which an estimated 15% are revisions. The 1991 National Institutes of Health guidelines recommended consideration of bariatric surgery in patients with a body mass index of 40 or higher or 35 or higher with serious obesity-related comorbidities.

These guidelines are still widely used; however, there is increasing evidence that bariatric procedures should also be considered for patients with type 2 diabetes and a body mass index of 30 to 35 if hyperglycemia is inadequately controlled despite optimal medical treatment for type 2 diabetes. Substantial evidence indicates that surgery results in greater improvements in weight loss and type 2 diabetes outcomes, compared with nonsurgical interventions, regardless of the type of procedures used. The 2 most common procedures used currently, the sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass, have similar effects on weight loss and diabetes outcomes and similar safety through at least 5-year follow-up. However, emerging evidence suggests that the sleeve procedure is associated with fewer reoperations, and the bypass procedure may lead to more durable weight loss and glycemic control. Although safety is a concern, current data indicate that the perioperative mortality rates range from 0. 03% to
0.

2%, which has substantially improved since early 2000s. More long-term randomized studies are needed to assess the effect of bariatric procedures on cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other health outcomes and to evaluate emerging newer procedures. Conclusions and Relevance Modern bariatric procedures have strong evidence of efficacy and safety. All patients with severe obesity — and especially those with type 2 diabetes — should be engaged in a shared decision-making conversation about the risks and benefits of surgery compared with continuing usual medical and lifestyle treatment, and the decision about surgery should be driven primarily by informed patient preferences.

### Updated panel report: best practices for the surgical treatment of obesity [^115kVSqC]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

During the 2004 annual meeting of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), a panel of experts convened to provide updated information on best practices in bariatric surgery. The rapid evolution of endoluminal technologies, surgical indications, and training in bariatric surgery since 2004 has led to new questions and concerns about optimal treatment algorithms, patient selection, and the preparation of our current and future bariatric workforce.

Methods

An expert panel was convened at the SAGES 2017 annual meeting to provide a summative update on current practice patterns, techniques, and training in bariatric surgery in order to review and establish best practices. This was a joint effort by SAGES, International Society for the Perioperative Care of the Obese Patient, and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.

Results

On March 23, 2017, seven expert faculty convened to address current areas of controversy in bariatric surgery and provide updated guidelines and practice recommendations. Areas addressed included the expanded indications for use of metabolic surgery in the treatment of diabetes, the safety and efficacy of new and investigational endoluminal procedures, updates on new guidelines for the management of airway and sleep apnea in the obese patient, the development of clinical pathways to reduce variation in the management of the bariatric patient, and new guidelines for training, credentialing, and bariatric program accreditation. The following article is a summary of this panel.

Conclusion

Bariatric surgery is a field that continues to evolve. A timely, systematic approach, such as described here, that coalesces data and establishes best practices on the current body of available evidence is imperative for optimal patient care and to inform provider, insurer, and policy decisions.

### Revisional bariatric surgery [^1149SRog]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Revisional bariatric procedures are increasingly common. With more primary procedures being performed to manage severe obesity and its complications, 5% to 8% of these procedures will fail, requiring revisional operation. Reasons for revisional bariatric surgery are either primary inadequate weight loss, defined as less than 25% excess body weight loss, or weight recidivism, defined as a gain of more than 10 kg based on the nadir weight; however, each procedure also has inherit specific complications that can also be indications for revision.

Thirty years ago, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) convened a Consensus Development Conference that published a Statement on gastrointestinal surgery for severe obesity, reflecting expert assessment of the medical knowledge available at the time. Specifically, it sought to address "the surgical treatments for severe obesity and the criteria for selection, the efficacy and risks of surgical treatments for severe obesity, and the need for future research on and epidemiological evaluation of these therapies", and included specific recommendations for practice. Among these are that nonsurgical programs should be initial therapy for severe obesity; that patients should be carefully selected for surgery after evaluation by a multidisciplinary team; and that lifelong medical surveillance continue after surgery. The 1991 NIH Consensus Statement has been used by providers, hospitals, and insurers, as a standard for selection criteria for bariatric surgery. A body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m 2, or BMI > 35 kg/m 2 with co-morbidities, is a threshold for surgery that is applied universally.

Since its publication, hundreds of studies have been published on the worldwide obesity epidemic and global experience with metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS), which has greatly enhanced the understanding of obesity and its treatment. Now recognized as a chronic disease, obesity is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammatory state and immune dysfunction. It is suspected that the prolonged state of inflammation leads to a disruption of homeostatic mechanisms and consequently to metabolic disorders commonly associated with obesity, mediated by incompletely elucidated pathways involving cytokine production, adipokines, hormones, and acute-phase reactants.

With an increasing global MBS experience, long-term studies have proven it an effective and durable treatment of severe obesity and its co-morbidities. Studies with long-term follow up, published in the decades following the 1991 NIH Consensus Statement, have consistently demonstrated that MBS produces superior weight loss outcomes compared with nonoperative treatments. After surgery, the significant improvement of metabolic disease, as well as the decrease in overall mortality, has been reported in multiple studies further supporting the importance of this treatment modality. Concurrently, the safety of bariatric surgery has been studied and reported extensively. Perioperative mortality is very low, ranging between.03% and.2%. Thus, it is not surprising that MBS has become one of the most commonly performed operations in general surgery.

### Dissemination of the 2022 ASMBS and IFSO guidelines for bariatric surgery: what has reached primary care providers? [^112xUvYp]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Even with improvements in the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery, less than 1% of United States adults meeting the BMI criteria opt for bariatric surgery. A disconnection clearly exists between patients eligible for metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) and those who eventually undergo surgery. The number of eligible patients is expected to rise following the 2022 American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) updated guidelines. In contrast to the prior ASMBS guidelines outlined by the NIH consensus panel in 1991, the new guidelines released in October 2022 lower the BMI thresholds at which MBS referral is suggested in the general population, create separate guidelines for the Asian population, and include the pediatric population (Fig. 1).

Clinical indications for revisional surgery

We define as revisional bariatric/metabolic surgery any re-operative bariatric procedure performed to improve the results in patients with insufficient weight loss, continued comorbid disease, or weight regain. However, an established consensus on which levels of insufficient weight loss or weight regain should be considered as indicators for the need of a revisional procedure is still lacking.

Bonouvrie et al. recently performed a systematic review illustrating the lack of standard definitions of non-responders after bariatric surgery. This is partly due to heterogeneity among studies which precludes evidence synthesis for revisional surgery. There is an urgent need to introduce standard definitions to be used in future research and clinical practice. Current definitions remain arbitrary, due to the lack of solid evidence in this field. A set of diagnostic criteria is proposed in Supplementary Table S30, taking into consideration current indications for bariatric/metabolic surgery and the evidence on the positive effects of a 10% weight loss.

Work-up in case of revisional surgery

Current evidence suggests that revisional surgery may confer an improvement of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities in patients without optimal results after an index procedure. Escalation of therapy in patients with poor response should be considered rational in the long-term management of a chronic disease such as obesity. On the other hand, revisional bariatric surgery confers a higher risk of perioperative complications than primary bariatric surgery. The individual risk/benefit analysis for revisional surgery is, therefore, even more complex than for index procedures. We suggest that the clinical decision to proceed to revisional bariatric surgery be based on a complete multidisciplinary assessment, as recommended for the primary procedure, including endoscopic and radiological studies, with detailed information about the index procedure and proper evaluation of nutritional and behavioral status.

### Clinical indications, utilization, and funding of bariatric surgery in Europe [^112ox1vV]. Obesity Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to evaluate the current utilization, the level of endorsement by professional societies, and health technology assessment bodies, as well as the reimbursement levels for bariatric surgery in European countries.

Materials and Methods

We performed an analysis of the indications for bariatric surgery based on national clinical and commissioning guidelines, current utilization of surgery, characteristics of patients who underwent surgery, and reimbursement tariffs in Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden. Data were obtained from national patient registries, administrative databases, and published literature for the year 2012.

Results

Despite clear consensus outlined in clinical guidelines, significant differences were found in the eligibility criteria for surgery. Patients with no significant comorbidities were deemed eligible if they had a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or 50 kg/m 2 in Denmark. Irrespective of the country, patients with comorbidities were eligible if they had a BMI of 35 kg/m 2. The highest utilization of bariatric surgery (number of surgeries per 1 M population) was observed in Belgium (928), Sweden (761), and France (571) while Italy (128), England (117), and Germany (72) had the lowest utilization. There was a strong negative correlation between utilization and average BMI level of the patient population (r = −.909, p = 0.005). The annual per capita spending on surgery differed significantly between countries, ranging from €0.54 in Germany to €4.33 in Belgium.

Conclusions

There are significant variations in the clinical indications, utilization, and funding of bariatric surgery in European countries.

### Scientific evidence for the updated guidelines on indications for metabolic and bariatric surgery (IFSO / ASMBS) [^1144rh6d]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2022, a group of metabolic bariatric surgeons and other clinicians caring for people with obesity recognized that the 33-year-old guidelines based on expert opinion in the era of open surgery did not reflect the current published literature or state of the field. There was a growing interest in revisiting the 1991 NIH criteria and revising it to reflect MBS's current practice.

The two largest MBS organizations in the world, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO), agreed to partner to create new guidelines that would be evidence-based and rely on the most up to date high quality published literature along with current expert global practice. The group searched the literature for high-level evidence using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Without supportive literature, a Delphi survey of experts in the field was performed. Systematic reviews were performed on 13 topics highlighted in the recently published MBS guidelines. This study aimed to determine the level of evidence and the grade of the recommendations of these 13 previously published criteria. Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13

The operations commonly performed have evolved as well. Older surgical operations have been replaced with safer and more effective operations. The 1991 NIH Consensus Statement described the vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as the dominant procedures in clinical practice at the time. Currently, the dominant procedures are sleeve gastrectomy and RYGB, together accounting for approximately 90% of all operations performed worldwide, and each has well-studied mid- and long-term outcomes. Other operations performed include adjustable gastric banding (AGB), biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, and one-anastomosis gastric bypass. The VBG is of historical interest and no longer performed, and the popularity of the AGB has diminished significantly over the past decade. MBS is now preferably performed using minimally invasive surgical approaches (laparoscopic or robotic assisted).

In light of significant advances in the understanding of the disease of obesity, its management in general, and metabolic and bariatric surgery specifically, the leaderships of the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) have convened to produce this joint statement on the current available scientific information on metabolic and bariatric surgery and its indications.

### Bariatric surgery: an IDF statement for obese type 2 diabetes [^114BLcwR]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes — who to consider for surgery?

There is clear evidence that bariatric surgery is a very effective therapy for obese patients with Type 2 diabetes. The place of surgery in diabetes treatment algorithms needs to be established (see below). Currently, surgery is considered optional and, as such, in the countries with the highest bariatric surgery uptake, less than 2% of eligible patients are treated annually.

Indications for bariatric surgery typically classify those who are eligible for surgery, but a recommendation of surgical referral as best practice or prioritization has not been widely considered. Diabetes management algorithms should now include points at which bariatric surgery should be considered and points at which referral is recommended or prioritized (Table 9).

Table 9
Eligibility and prioritization for bariatric surgery based on failed non-surgical weight-loss therapy *, BMI, ethnicity † and disease control

In patients with Type 2 diabetes, eligibility or prioritization for surgery should consider BMI, ethnicity, associated weight-related co-morbidity, weight trajectory and the response of diabetes and co-morbidity to optimal medical therapy. Conditional eligibility or prioritization should be assessed by a team specializing in diabetes. Surgical referral implies a thorough bariatric surgical multidisciplinary team assessment of risk and benefit.

Contraindications for bariatric surgery include: current drug or alcohol abuse; uncontrolled psychiatric illness; and lack of comprehension of the risks–benefits, expected outcomes, alternatives and lifestyle changes required with bariatric surgery. In addition, there are general conditions that would contraindicate elective surgery and specific conditions that substantially increase the risk of surgery, later complications or poor outcomes. These should be assessed by the surgical team.

Integration into diabetes treatment algorithms

Existing international treatment guidelines for Type 2 diabetes provide little information or direction on the role of bariatric interventions in treatment. By contrast, the American Diabetes Association recommends that bariatric surgery be considered as a treatment option for Type 2 diabetes when the patient's BMI exceeds 35 kg/m 2. Algorithms developed for treating Type 2 diabetes should include recommendations as to where bariatric surgery is an option and the circumstances where it should be prioritized.

Almost all severely obese patients are unsuccessful in their efforts to achieve sustained and significant weight loss and there is evidence that weight loss induced by bariatric surgery can lead to remission of hyperglycaemia in the majority of patients with diabetes. Earlier intervention increases the likelihood of remission. In the remaining patients, residual hyperglycaemia is easier to manage following bariatric surgery. It can therefore be argued that bariatric surgery for the severely obese with Type 2 diabetes should be considered early as an option for eligible patients, rather than being held back as a last resort.

Indications for metabolic and bariatric surgery — conclusion: Since the NIH published its statement on gastrointestinal surgery for severe obesity in 1991, the understanding of obesity and MBS has significantly grown based on a large body of clinical experience and research, and long-term data consistently demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and durability of MBS in the treatment of clinically severe obesity and its co-morbidities, with a result of decreased mortality compared with nonoperative treatment methods.

Metabolic and bariatric surgery — indications and common procedures — The foremost procedures are surgical sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, accounting for around 90% of operations globally. A body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 40.0 kg/m², and a BMI of ≥ 35.0 kg/m² with obesity-related complications (ORCD), have long been the proposed thresholds for surgical indications. In 2016, 45 international professional societies stated that metabolic surgery should be considered for people with T2D and a BMI of 30.0 kg/m² to 34.9 kg/m² if hyperglycemia is inadequately controlled despite optimal treatment with either oral or injectable medications. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders have recommended bariatric surgery as a treatment option for adults with BMI ≥ 35.0 kg/m², regardless of the presence, absence, or severity of obesity-related conditions and BMI of 30.0 kg/m² to 34.9 kg/m² who have metabolic disease, such as T2D, and CVD.

### Bariatric surgery: the challenges with candidate selection, individualizing treatment and clinical outcomes [^114AnBPM]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Bariatric surgery should be considered in individuals with a BMI of greater than 40 kg/m 2 and in those with a BMI of more than 35 kg/m 2 and obesity related co- morbidities. In future, guidelines may recommend surgery for those with BMIs of less than 35 kg/m 2 with diabetes or other metabolic disease.

Not all candidates are suitable to proceed to surgery, and an experienced multi- disciplinary assessment is essential to select the appropriate candidates. The choice of surgical modality should take the individual's goals, surgeon's experience and existing co-morbidities into account. Individualizing care is central to the assessment, and this is determined by clinical evaluation rather than using predictive models, genotyping or biomarkers at present.

Bariatric surgery performed in experienced centers has a low complication rate and leads to long-term weight loss, with associated functional, metabolic and psychological improvements. Bariatric procedures are effective in treating and preventing many obesity related co-morbidities. Long-term follow-up is mandatory to support a safe outcome.

### Considering bariatric surgery in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis… [^1146XCFG]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Obesity is the leading cause of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and is now the second most common indication for liver transplant. 1 With nearly 40% of adults in the United States now classified as obese, this epidemic is far from over. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight loss may stabilize or reverse the effects of NASH. 2 Bariatric surgery remains the most effective treatment for obesity, offering a significant opportunity to reduce the likelihood of progression to cirrhosis and the need for liver transplant. Klebanoff et al3 assess the cost-effectiveness of several weight-loss interventions in patients with NASH compensated cirrhosis. Using a simulated patient population and a Markov-based state-transition model, the authors found that sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-n-Y gastric bypass, and intensive lifestyle interventions all increased quality-adjusted life-years and were cost-effective compared with usual care in patients with NASH compensated cirrhosis.

They also show that, compared with GB, SG was the most cost-effective intervention, and its effectiveness was preserved across the continuum of patients ranging from overweight to severely obese. However, this study uses comparative statistics with a simulated patient population. Real-world decision making for patients with cirrhosis can be much less straightforward. This article adds momentum to a growing literature by suggesting that bariatric surgery in patients with NASH is safe, beneficial, and now cost-effective. 4 Historically, patients with cirrhotic physiological features of any kind were considered to have a prohibitively high surgical risk, which precluded the opportunity for elective or preventive interventions. Increasingly, with the advent of the model for end-stage liver disease score, 5 a more granular risk profile can be delineated, and patients at lower risk can be identified.

These patients with well-compensated cirrhosis are likely to benefit from bariatric intervention in several important ways. First, studies have shown that bariatric surgery can lead to a complete, biopsy-proven reversal of steatosis and hepatic inflammation in more than half of the patient population. 6 In addition, in patients who experience progression of NASH over time, lower body mass index makes the liver transplant operation safer and less complicated. Importantly, from a technical and anatomical perspective, SG preserves gastric continuity for many common posttransplant endoscopic procedures. Finally, global improvements in the severity of medical comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes are also appreciated in this population.
2. During the last decade, SG has become the preferred bariatric procedure in the United States.

7 This trend is particularly relevant for high-risk patient populations, among whom the complication profile may be more favorable than for GB. Growing momentum for the use of SG in patients with end-stage renal disease is a good example. Little to no previous work has characterized the use of bariatric surgery in this high-risk patient population. However, our group has performed preliminary analyses in the Medicare population indicating nearly 85% of patients with end-stage renal disease now undergo SG. This shift in practice was also associated with a several-fold increase in the overall number of bariatric operations being performed on patients with organ failure. This makes intuitive sense: complication profiles are similar to those of healthy patients without end-stage renal disease, and some patients even experience stabilization of their kidney function.

### Indications and coverage of metabolic and bariatric surgery: a worldwide IFSO survey comparing different national guidelines [^115AbYn1]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Knowing how metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is indicated in different countries is essential information for the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO).

Aim

To analyze the indications for MBS recommended by each of the national societies that comprise the IFSO and how MBS is financed in their countries.

Methods

All IFSO societies were asked to fill out a survey asking whether they have, and which are their national guidelines, and if MBS is covered by their public health service.

Results

Sixty-three out of the 72 IFSO national societies answered the form (87.5%). Among them, 74.6% have some kind of guidelines regarding indications for MBS. Twenty-two percent are still based on the US National Institute of Health (NIH) 1991 recommendations, 43.5% possess guidelines midway the 1991s and ASMBS/IFSO 2022 ones, and 34% have already adopted the latest ASMBS/IFSO 2022 guidelines. MBS was financially covered in 65% of the countries.

Conclusions

Most of the IFSO member societies have MBS guidelines. While more than a third of them have already shifted to the most updated ASMBS/IFSO 2022 ones, another significant number of countries are still following the NIH 1991 guidelines or even do not have any at all. Besides, there is a significant number of countries in which surgical treatment is not yet financially covered. More effort is needed to standardize indications worldwide and to influence insurers and health policymakers to increase the coverage of MBS.

What eligibility guidelines exist?

A number of guidelines exist on the use of bariatric surgery for the treatment of severe obesity in general, and for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in particular. They are summarized in Table 5. Most of the existing guidelines reflect the expert recommendations of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference Statement March 1991. The current NIH website warns that their information is dated and provided solely for historic purposes.

Table 5
National and international guidelines * for eligibility for bariatric surgery (adults)

A recent Diabetes Surgery Summit of 50 international experts examined gastrointestinal surgery for the management of Type 2 diabetes. Delegates strongly endorsed that conventional gastrointestinal surgery — Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) or bilio-pancreatic diversion (BPD) — should be considered for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in acceptable surgical candidates with BMI > 35 kg/m 2 who are inadequately controlled by lifestyle and medical therapy. Further trial evidence was deemed necessary for inadequately controlled Type 2 diabetes in candidates suitable for surgery with mild-to-moderate obesity (BMI 30–35 kg/m 2).

Adolescent metabolic and bariatric surgery — indications, contraindications, and eligibility include that adult and pediatric sources contribute to 16 existing recommendation sets; best practice guidelines developed in 2018 recommend that bariatric surgery be considered for youth with BMI ≥ 35 with concurrent severe comorbid disease or for those with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m². Determination of eligibility involves a thoughtful, shared decision-making process among the patient, parent(s) or guardian(s), and providers; generally accepted contraindications include a medically correctable cause of obesity, untreated or poorly controlled substance abuse, concurrent or planned pregnancy, current eating disorder, or inability to adhere to postoperative recommendations and mandatory lifestyle changes. The presence of a disability is a relevant factor but is not an automatic contraindication, and current longitudinal studies do not apply specific age limits; thus, there is no evidence to support the application of age-based eligibility limits.

Revisional metabolic and bariatric surgery — indications, complexity, and outcomes: With the rise in the number of metabolic and bariatric operations and recognition of obesity as a chronic, relapsing disease, there is a rise in the need for revisional surgery. Indications vary but may include weight regain, insufficient weight loss, insufficient improvement of co-morbidities, and managing complications such as gastroesophageal reflux. Surgical revision can involve converting from one kind of operation to another, enhancing the effect of a specific operation such as distalization after RYGB, treating complications of the index operation, or restoring normal anatomy if possible. The complexity of revisional surgery is higher than primary MBS and is associated with increased hospital length of stay and higher rates of complications. Nonetheless, revisional MBS is effective in achieving additional weight loss and co-morbidity reduction after the primary operation in selected patients, with acceptable complication rates and low mortality rates.

Revisional surgery

With the rise in the number of metabolic and bariatric operations performed worldwide, and with the recognition of obesity as a chronic, relapsing, multifactorial disease, comes a rise in the need for revisional surgery. Indications for revisional MBS vary among individual patients, but may include weight regain, insufficient weight loss, insufficient improvement of co-morbidities, and managing complications (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux).

Surgical revision can take the form of converting from one kind of MBS operation to another, enhancing the effect of a specific operation (e.g. distalization after RYGB), treating possible complications of the index operation, or restoring normal anatomy if possible. Furthermore, with the understanding of severe obesity to be a chronic disease there has been a growing recognition of the requirement for long-term management of excess weight and obesity co-morbidities. This often takes the form of multimodal therapy that could include additional or "revisional" surgery, to achieve optimal outcomes. Thus, revisional surgery may also serve as escalation therapy for those individuals who are deemed poor responders to the initial operation.

The complexity of revisional surgery is higher than primary MBS, and is associated with increased hospital length of stay, and higher rates of complications. Nonetheless, revisional MBS is effective in achieving additional weight loss and co-morbidity reduction after the primary operation in selected patients, with acceptable complication rates, and low mortality rates.

### Metabolic bariatric surgery in the era of GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity… [^115h5nZq]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Lin K, Mehrotra A, Tsai TC. Metabolic Bariatric Surgery in the Era of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists for Obesity Management. JAMA Netw Open. 2024; 7: e2441380. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.41380 eMethods. Data Sharing Statement Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and metabolic bariatric surgery use are tracked across 2022 to 2023 quarters. The number of patients who received a metabolic bariatric surgery per 1000 individuals and the number of patients prescribed a GLP-1 RA per 1000 individuals are shown. Use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists semaglutide and liraglutide as antiobesity medications has surged in recent years. 1, 2 Anecdotally, health systems have closed hospital-based metabolic bariatric surgery programs due to decreased demand, but empirical data on the association of increased prescribing of GLP-1 RAs with use of metabolic bariatric surgery is unavailable, to our knowledge.

We assessed national trends and characteristics of patients with obesity who were prescribed GLP-1 RAs compared with those undergoing metabolic bariatric surgery. In this cross-sectional study, we used 2022 to 2023 claims from 16. 8 million unique deidentified adult patients with medical and pharmaceutical coverage through commercial and Medicare Advantage insurance in the OptumLabs Data Warehouse. We included only patients without diabetes. Similarly, we included only GLP-1 RA prescriptions with FDA indications as antiobesity medications. For each quarter, we identified all patients with any claim for any formulation of semaglutide or liraglutide and for metabolic bariatric surgery. We compared enrollee-level characteristics, including age, sex, and Elixhauser comorbidity index, among patients prescribed GLP-1 RAs and who underwent metabolic bariatric surgery during the study period. 3 We used χ2 tests for statistical comparison.

We then assessed trends in use of GLP-1 RAs and metabolic bariatric surgeries per 1000 unique patients without diabetes using a generalized linear regression model. Due to seasonal variations in metabolic bariatric surgery use, we compared the slope of change during quarter 3 and 4 between 2022 and 2023. 4 This study was approved by the institutional review board at Harvard Medical School and deemed exempt from informed consent due to minimal risk. Results are reported in accordance with the STROBE reporting guideline, and 2-sided P values <. 05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed in SAS statistical software version 9.
4. During the study period, 83 346 patients were prescribed GLP-1 RAs and 9863 patients underwent metabolic bariatric surgery. Patient characteristics for the year 2023 are shown in the Table.

Patients with metabolic bariatric surgery were more medically complex than those prescribed GLP-1 RAs or no treatment. We identified a relative 105. 6% increase in patients prescribed GLP-1 RAs between the last 6 months of 2022 vs the last 6 months of
2023. In contrast, there was a relative 8. 7% decrease in patients undergoing metabolic bariatric surgery comparing the same periods. The Figure shows rates for each individual quarter. This cross-sectional study of privately insured patients found a more than 2-fold increase in use of GLP-1 RAs as antiobesity medications from 2022 to 2023, with a relative 8. 7% decrease in the rate of metabolic bariatric surgery during the same period. Our results provide a national contemporaneous estimate of the decline in metabolic bariatric surgery associated with the era of GLP-1 RAs.

### The role of endoscopy in the bariatric surgery patient [^115WKHF2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Bariatric surgery patient overview — body mass index (BMI) thresholds, epidemiology, indications, and care model — is summarized as follows: Body mass index is calculated as weight/height² (kg/m²) and is used to classify adults as overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9) and obese (BMI ≥ 30.0); in 2010, 68% of U.S. adults older than 20 years were overweight or obese, 36% were frankly obese, and 6% had a BMI ≥ 40, with projections that by 2030, 40% of adults will be obese. Bariatric surgery is endorsed as an appropriate therapy in carefully selected individuals with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 or those with a BMI ≥ 30 and significant comorbid conditions) when dietary, behavioral, and pharmacotherapy interventions have failed; in such patients, surgery results in significant and durable weight loss and improvement in weight-related comorbidities. Procedures cause weight loss via gastric volume restriction or malabsorption or a combination of the 2 with associated hormonal changes; these interventions should be offered only as components of a multidisciplinary weight management team approach, and in the modern era sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has supplanted laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) as the most commonly used restrictive procedure.

Introduction

Definitions

Bariatric surgery: Relating to the treatment of obesity. Origin: Greek bar (os) weight (cf. baro-) + −iatrics.

British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society BOMSS defined it as: Surgeons involved in obesity management.

Metabolic surgery: The procedures for weight loss, whether designated as restrictive, restrictive/malabsorptive, malabsorptive, and others, or neuro-hormonal, all fall under the definition as the operative manipulation of a normal organ or organ system to achieve a biological result for a potential health gain.

Current indications for bariatric surgery

The National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) UK guidelines and the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommend bariatric surgery as a treatment option for adults with a Body Mass Index (BMI) 40–50, or those with BMI > 35–40 and one or more severe obesity-related medical complication (e.g. hypertension, heart failure, or sleep apnea) if they have been unable to achieve or maintain weight loss with conventional therapy, have acceptable operative risks, and are able to comply with long-term treatment and follow-up. The updates of these indications are going to be published in the Endocrine Practice 2013; the most updated version of guidelines sponsored by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), The Obesity Society (TOS), and American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS).

Types of operations: Different types of operations including gastric balloon, gastric plication and different types of intestinal bypasses are practiced but the most popular are: Gastric bypass, Sleeve gastrectomy, Gastric band, Bilio-pancreatic diversion+/−Duodenal switch.

The prevalence of noncommunicable diseases has increased dramatically in North America and throughout the world and is expected to continue increasing in coming years. Obesity has been linked to several types of cancers and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality following cancer diagnosis. Bariatric surgery has emerged as the prominent model to evaluate the effects of intentional weight loss on cancer incidence and outcomes. Current literature, comprising prospective cohort investigations, indicates site-specific reductions in cancer risk with select bariatric procedures. Future research is required to establish evidence-based indications for bariatric surgery in the context of cancer prevention.

### Beyond BMI: the need for new guidelines governing the use of bariatric and metabolic surgery [^116GSejP]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Bariatric surgery use is largely governed worldwide by a 1991 National Institutes of Health consensus statement that advocates BMI as the primary operative criterion and restricts surgery to severely obese patients. These guidelines have been enormously valuable in standardising practice, thereby facilitating accumulation of a copious database of information regarding long-term surgical benefits and risks, from vast clinical experience and research. However, the National Institutes of Health recommendations had important limitations from the outset and are now gravely outdated. They do not account for remarkable advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques or the development of entirely new procedures. In the two decades since they were crafted, we have gained far greater understanding of the dramatic, weight-independent benefits of some operations on metabolic diseases, especially type 2 diabetes, and of the inadequacy of BMI as a primary criterion for surgical selection. Furthermore, there is now a substantial and rapidly burgeoning body of level-1 evidence from randomised trials comparing surgical versus non-surgical approaches to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic diseases, including among only mildly obese or merely overweight patients. Herein, we present arguments to impel the development of new guidelines for the use of bariatric and so-called metabolic surgery to inform clinical practice and insurance compensation.

### A commentary review on endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty: indications, outcomes and future implications [^1134Lowo]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic and bariatric surgeries have been shown to be the most effective strategy to induce and maintain significant weight loss for people living with severe obesity. However, ongoing concerns regarding operative risks, irreversibility and excess costs limit their broader clinical use. Endoscopic bariatric therapies are pragmatic alternatives for patients who are not suitable for metabolic and bariatric surgeries or who are concerned regarding their long-term safety. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty has emerged as a novel technique of endoscopic bariatric therapies, which have garnered significant interest and evidence in the past few years. Its safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness have been shown in various studies, while comparisons with sleeve gastrectomy have been widely made. This review brings together current evidence pertaining to the technicality of the procedure itself, current indications, safety and efficacy, cost-effectiveness, as well as its future role and development.

### Bariatric and metabolic surgery: a shift in eligibility and success criteria [^114JFQbF]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

The obesity epidemic, combined with the lack of available and effective treatments for morbid obesity, is a scientific and public health priority. Worldwide, bariatric and metabolic surgeries are increasingly being performed to effectively aid weight loss in patients with severe obesity, as well as because of the favourable metabolic effects of the procedures. The positive effects of bariatric surgery, especially with respect to improvements in type 2 diabetes mellitus, have expanded the eligibility criteria for metabolic surgery to patients with diabetes mellitus and a BMI of 30–35 kg/m². However, the limitations of BMI, both in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients, need to be considered, particularly for determining the actual adiposity and fat distribution of the patients following weight loss. Understanding the characteristics shared by bariatric and metabolic surgeries, as well as their differential aspects and outcomes, is required to enhance patient benefits and operative achievements. For a holistic approach that focuses on the multifactorial effects of bariatric and metabolic surgery to be possible, a paradigm shift that goes beyond the pure semantics is needed. Such a shift could lead to profound clinical implications for eligibility criteria and the definition of success of the surgical approach.

Indication for revisional surgery after MBS varies among patients but may include insufficient weight loss, weight regain, insufficient remission of comorbidities, and management of complications (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux).
Due to its complexity, revisional MBS may be associated with higher rates of perioperative complications. However, revisional MBS induces satisfactory metabolic outcomes with acceptable complications and mortality rates.

### Scientific evidence for the updated guidelines on indications for metabolic and bariatric surgery (IFSO / ASMBS) [^115LbKnX]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since its inception in the mid-1950s, gastrointestinal surgery to treat excess adiposity and associated medical conditions has significantly changed. Weight loss surgery, in its early history, lacked regulation, was associated with a high risk of adverse events, and had a high rate of recurrent weight gain (RWG). There were no uniform guidelines for patient selection, preoperative work-up, procedure selection, and long-term follow-up. These deficiencies contributed to the high rates of suboptimal outcomes.

To create uniform criteria for bariatric surgery, in 1991, the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the USA held a consensus conference on gastrointestinal (GI) surgery for the treatment of severe obesity. A multidisciplinary panel of "experts" reviewed the available peer-reviewed literature and patient experience and created the first criteria for the practice of metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS). However, since 1991, there have been dramatic changes in the field of MBS, including fellowship training, accreditation of MBS centers of excellence, development of MBS registries, the introduction of minimally invasive surgery, and new procedures such as sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and dramatic improvements in perioperative and long-term patient care and safety. Despite these improvements in surgical techniques and perioperative care for patients undergoing MBS, the reliance on the 1991 NIH criteria for determining patient candidacy for surgery remained unchanged, and surprisingly, it is still in wide use more than 33 years later.

Topic 5: revisional surgery

Terminology

The increasing use of bariatric/metabolic surgery was accompanied by a parallel increase of the number of patients who received an additional bariatric procedure after the index one. In 2014, the American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery performed a systematic review on re-operative bariatric surgery and proposed a nomenclature for dividing the secondary procedures based on the technical aspects (Supplementary Table S29).

Reoperations after bariatric surgery may be primarily performed for two reasons: (a) to solve or fix complications or side effects linked to the primary procedures; (b) to improve the results in patients with insufficient weight loss, continued or poorly controlled comorbid disease, or weight regain. We suggest the use of the term revisional bariatric/metabolic surgery only for re-operative procedures performed for the second group of indications. Revisional surgery can correct or convert the primary procedure. The surgical procedures targeting the first category of indications are re-interventions indicated by the patient's medical condition, performed electively or in emergency, and they can include conversions, corrective or reversal procedures.

Severe obesity is a chronic disease that requires lifetime treatment. While bariatric/metabolic surgery is usually an effective and durable therapy, there will be patients who respond well to the initial therapy and others with only partial response, as in many other chronic diseases requiring medical or surgical therapy. There will be also a subset of patients having recurrent or persistent disease. These patients may require escalation of therapy or a new treatment modality. We, therefore, suggest that the term "failure" or "failed" in respect to metabolic/bariatric procedures be abandoned. The term "non-responders" should be adopted because it is more consistent with the frame of obesity as chronic disease.

High-risk body mass index (BMI) populations — While there is no consensus on the best procedure for especially high BMI, efficacy and safety of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) have been demonstrated; mortality risk increases with BMI and older studies implicated BMI > 50 kg/m², individuals with BMI > 60 kg/m² are considered at especially high risk yet some studies found no significant differences versus BMI < 60 kg/m², MBS can be performed safely in patients with BMI > 70 kg/m², and MBS should be considered as a preferred method to achieve clinically significant weight loss in extreme BMI.

ASMBS/IFSO indications — pediatric criteria, perioperative assessment, and chronic disease management — state that children and adolescents with BMI ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile and a major co- morbidity, or a BMI ≥ 140% of the 95th percentile, should be considered for MBS after evaluation by a multidisciplinary team in a specialty center. MBS is an effective treatment of clinically severe obesity in patients who need other specialty surgery, such as joint arthroplasty, abdominal wall hernia repair, or organ transplantation. Consultation with a multidisciplinary team can help manage the patient's modifiable risk factors with a goal of reducing risk of perioperative complications and improving outcomes, and the ultimate decision for surgical readiness should be determined by the surgeon. Severe obesity is a chronic disease requiring long-term management after primary MBS, which may include revisional surgery and/or other adjuvant therapy to achieve desired treatment effect.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^1117YtuB]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Bariatric surgery in NAFLD/NASH — indications and hepatic/metabolic outcomes: Although currently accepted criteria for bariatric surgery are BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² irrespective of metabolic comorbid disease or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities, NAFLD/NASH is increasingly accepted as a comorbid condition benefiting from bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery can resolve NASH, improve hepatic fibrosis, induce sustained weight loss of up to 30%, cure diabetes, and decrease all-cause morbidity and mortality; in a prospective long-term follow-up study with consecutive liver biopsies, resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis occurred in 80% of patients 1 year following bariatric surgery, which was maintained at 5 years. Failure to achieve substantial weight loss following bariatric surgery is associated with persistent NASH, and restrictive surgical procedures result in substantially less weight loss than malabsorptive procedures and are more likely to be associated with persistent NASH. Endoscopic bariatric and metabolic surgery procedures are promising less-invasive options; however, long-term safety and efficacy data are needed. Bariatric surgery should be considered as a therapeutic option in patients who meet criteria for metabolic weight loss surgery, as it effectively resolves NAFLD or NASH in the majority of patients without cirrhosis and reduces mortality from CVD and malignancy.

### Deciphering the sleeve: technique, indications, efficacy, and safety of sleeve gastrectomy [^115ayp99]. Obesity Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Some institutions perform sleeve gastrectomy (SG) as the initial operation for high-risk, high body mass index patients planning a definitive weight loss operation in 12–18 months. Other institutions consider SG a viable alternative to other bariatric operations. SG is frequently debated among the bariatric surgeons. Many questions remain about the current state of SG. Should it be performed as a definitive weight loss procedure or as a bridge for another bariatric procedure? Is there a specific BMI at which point SG should be encouraged? Is the weight loss comparable to other bariatric procedures? Is there a higher risk of gastric leak? What is the appropriate sleeve size? What are the hormonal benefits? Does SG predispose to gastroesophageal reflux disease? What is the mechanism of weight loss? Are long-term results available? And what are the complications? We conducted an extensive literature review aiming to resolve these commonly asked questions.

No Systematic Review Delphi Table 2

Although previous studies support the superiority of MBS compared to non-surgical therapy in patients with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 with no obesity-associated complications, there is a lack of high-grade evidence to support this item. Considering the lack of data from the literature, the leaderships of IFSO and ASMBS have convened a Delphi survey. According to the survey results of 49 experts, MBS is indicated in patients with class II obesity, a BMI of 35–40 kg/m 2, with no associated medical problems in all groups of ages following a comprehensive multidisciplinary team (MDT) assessment. The consensus also supported the fact that MBS is cost-effective in patients with class II obesity when compared to non-surgical therapy.

### Six steps to fast-track insurance approval for bariatric surgery [^115zS2CR]. Obesity Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Most of the health-insurers approve bariatric surgery for patients according to the NIH standards, while others only approve the surgery if the patient has a BMI > 50. Therefore, it is important for the physician to know and carefully follow the various criteria of different insurance companies. We suggest 6 steps to fast-track insurance approval: 1) a multidisciplinary team; 2) 6-month diet; 3) comprehensive medical evaluation; 4) flexibility and consistency; 5) analysis of each patient indication; 6) quality of cost-effectiveness and long-term monitoring and benefits. In the event that an insurance company rejects the request for surgery, a blueprint of an appeal letter is very important. The appeal letter should stress the indications and benefits of surgery for your patients. Insurance company criteria may differ from the NIH guidelines. Irrespective of this, the steps outlined will help speed the insurance approval process and reduce paperwork and confusion. Most often, rejections stem from letters that were not written clearly or that lacked one or more of the elements delineated above. If the surgeon follows the 6 steps described, he/she should meet less disappointment, as in our experience that went from 50% to 90% success because of better communication with insurance and more appropriate paperwork.

Denmark

In 2007, the Danish Centre for Health Technology Assessment issued a report on bariatric surgery that supported the use of gastric bypass and gastric banding. Recommendations for surgery provision were issued in 2008 under the supervision of the National Board of Health. In 2010, based on a review of the use of bariatric surgery in Denmark, the Danish Regions issued new, stricter guidelines for bariatric surgery. The rationale included the overuse of surgery in patients with fewer comorbidities, the rapid increase in the number of surgeries, and the high complication rate. The goal of the treatment guidelines was to reduce the number of surgeries by 40% to provide resources for treatment in other areas.

Interrupted time series analysis showed that the number of bariatric surgeries decreased significantly in 2010 following changes to the clinical indications (Fig. 4). The guidelines reduced the number of procedures by 2879 after 1 year (standard error 566, 95% confidence interval 444–5314 cases). Details of the analysis are provided in the Supplemental Material.

Fig. 4
Number of bariatric surgeries performed in Denmark between 2007 and 2013. Note: the black line indicates when the clinical indications were changed (2010, effective from 2011)

Between 2010 and 2012, although the prevalence of comorbidities increased slightly (5% for type 2 diabetes, 4% for hypertension, and 3% for obstructive sleep apnoea), the average patient BMI remained the same at 45 kg/m 2, but the median decreased to 44 kg/m 2. A high-quality registry for bariatric surgery has been implemented at the Danish national level since 2010, which annually monitors performance using eight indicators.

France

The national health technology assessment body, the French National Authority for Health, issued recommendations for bariatric surgery in 2009. In 2007, national bariatric surgery was established under the umbrella of the French and French-speaking Society of Obesity Surgery, although general reports from the registry are not available. In general, the clinical and policy environment is favorable toward bariatric surgery.

BMI thresholds in the Asian population

The World Health Organization defines the terms overweight and obesity based on BMI thresholds. In its consensus panel statement of 1991, the NIH stated that the "risk for morbidity linked with obesity is proportional to the degree of overweight". However, BMI does not account for an individual's sex, age, ethnicity, or fat distribution, and is recognized as only an approximation of adiposity. The health risk in a patient with BMI 30 kg/m 2 with visceral and ectopic fat accumulation and subsequent metabolic and cardiovascular disease would be significantly higher than a patient with BMI 40 kg/m 2 whose adipose tissue is mainly accumulated in the lower extremity. In the Asian population the prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease is higher at a lower BMI than in the non-Asian population. Thus, BMI risk zones should be adjusted to define obesity at a BMI threshold of 25–27.5 kg/m 2 in this population. Therefore, in certain populations access to MBS should not be denied solely based on traditional BMI thresholds.

ASMBS/IFSO indications — adult criteria and special populations — state that MBS is recommended for individuals with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², regardless of presence, absence, or severity of co- morbidities. MBS is recommended in patients with T2D and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m². MBS should be considered in individuals with BMI of 30–34.9 kg/m² who do not achieve substantial or durable weight loss or co- morbidity improvement using nonsurgical methods. Obesity definitions using BMI thresholds do not apply similarly to all populations, and clinical obesity in the Asian population is recognized in individuals with BMI > 25 kg/m²; access to MBS should not be denied solely based on traditional BMI risk zones. There is no upper patient-age limit to MBS, and older individuals who could benefit from MBS should be considered for surgery after careful assessment of co- morbidities and frailty. Carefully selected individuals considered higher risk for general surgery may benefit from MBS.

### Guidelines for perioperative care in bariatric surgery: enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations: a 2021 update [^116JiSX5]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Information, education and counselling

The patient scheduled for bariatric surgery must be well informed of the impact of extensive changes associated with life after bariatric surgery. They must be motivated and willing to participate in the long-term care, change in dietary patterns and to embrace the revised lifestyle after the operation. A preoperative educational program is often recommended in order to ensure realistic expectations, and to reduce anxiety, wound complications, postoperative pain and LOS. Results however, remain ambivalent. In a meta-analysis covering patients undergoing cancer surgery, education reduced anxiety and health care costs while simultaneously increasing the knowledge and satisfaction of patients. A more recent RCT of 73 patients with colorectal cancer, reported improved body image after surgery and enhanced recovery of self-reported global health status and reduced LOS after extra preoperative group education. However, meta-analyses on education for patients undergoing elective spinal surgery as well as a cluster RCT in patients undergoing visceral surgery did not report any sustained benefit on the majority of clinical outcome. The educational intervention proves hard to standardize, and there is a paucity in research assessing its benefits for bariatric surgery.

While the grade of evidence remains low, a formal psycho-social evaluation including environmental, familiar, nutritional and behavioural factors in line with current recommendations from the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) should be performed prior to bariatric surgery.

Despite the low grade of evidence, preoperative information and education are strongly recommended as a necessary step of informed consent in order to improve knowledge, ensure adequate risk perception, and allow active patient participation in making well-informed choices (Table 1).

Indications and contraindications for surgery

The current indications for bariatric surgery are BMI ≥ 40 kg/m 2 alone or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 and an obesity-related comorbidity that could be expected to improve/resolve by surgery-induced weight loss maintenance. These were established in a consensus meeting in 1991 and subsequently confirmed by more recent guidelines. The major addition to the indications for bariatric or rather, metabolic surgery, has been provided by the international consensus conference of Diabetes Surgery Summit, established in 2007 recommending the use of gastrointestinal surgery to treat type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), including individuals with class-I obesity. The joint statement by international diabetes organizations in 2016 recommends that metabolic surgery should be considered as an option to treat T2D in patients with class-I obesity (BMI 30.0–34.9 kg/m 2) and inadequately controlled hyperglycaemia despite optimal medical treatment (Table 1).

Background

A growing number of revisionary and secondary bariatric operations have been performed in recent years, with the number of operations doubling each year at the authors' center. Diagnostics, indications, and most revisionary operations should be performed by an experienced bariatric surgeon. This study was undertaken to evaluate indications and outcomes of revisionary bariatric operations at a specialized center.

At the Centre of Obesity and Metabolic Surgery (University of Freiburg, Germany), 100 consecutive revisionary bariatric operations performed between March 2007 and September 2009 were analyzed concerning indications and outcomes.

Only 9 of the 100 revisions were due to early complications (< 30 days after the primary operation). The indication for most revisions was poor weight loss (n = 55). A mean body mass index reduction of 10 points could be achieved in 1 year, which equals a 56% excess weight loss (EWL). No significant difference in weight reduction between restrictive and malabsorptive revisions was observed. Revisions due to implant-related problems also were frequent (n = 25). Laparoscopic revision was possible in 95% of the cases.

Conclusion

Insufficient weight loss is the most frequent indication for revisionary bariatric surgery. The surgery can be performed laparoscopically in most cases, and a significant EWL (> 50%) can be achieved in 1 year if the right revisionary procedure is chosen.

3.2 Indications for

Guidance published jointly by ASMBS and IFSO recommends MBS in any individual with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2, regardless of the presence, absence or severity of weight‐related comorbidities. Additionally, MBS should be considered for individuals with BMI 30–34.9 kg/m 2 and the existence of metabolic disease. Adjustments should be made in the Asian population, such that individuals of this ethnicity should be considered for bariatric surgery if BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m 2. Notably, this differs slightly from European and United Kingdom guidance, which recommends MBS for individuals with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m 2, or BMI 35–39.9 kg/m 2 accompanied by a significant health condition that could be improved with weight loss. There is an additional consideration for individuals with BMI 30–34.9 kg/m 2 who have coexisting type 2 diabetes.UK guidance also stipulates that assessment for suitability of bariatric surgery must be performed in a specialist weight management service and reduction of BMI limits by 2.5 kg/m 2 should be applied for individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds.

Obesity is associated with end-stage organ disease and may limit access to transplantation. Obesity is also a relative contraindication for solid organ transplantation and poses unique technical challenges during surgery.
Published data supports considering patients with end-stage renal disease and obesity grade 3 being able to be listed for kidney transplant after MBS.
MBS is shown to be safe and effective as a bridge to liver transplantation in selected patients who would otherwise be ineligible.
MBS can also improve heart transplants outcomes.
Limited data suggest that MBS could improve eligibility for lung transplantation.
MBS can be performed post-SOT or concomitantly to reduce complication rates and mortality.

Conclusion

Since the NIH published its statement on gastrointestinal surgery for severe obesity in 1991, the understanding of obesity and MBS has significantly grown based on a large body of clinical experience and research.
Long-term data consistently demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and durability of MBS in the treatment of clinically severe obesity and its co-morbidities, with a resultant decreased mortality compared with nonoperative treatment methods.
MBS is recommended for individuals with BMI > 35 kg/m 2, regardless of presence, absence, or severity of co-morbidities.
MBS is recommended in patients with T2D and BMI > 30 kg/m 2.
MBS should be considered in individuals with BMI of 30–34.9 kg/m 2 who do not achieve substantial or durable weight loss or co-morbidity improvement using nonsurgical methods.
Obesity definitions using BMI thresholds do not apply similarly to all populations. Clinical obesity in the Asian population is recognized in individuals with BMI > 25 kg/m 2. Access to MBS should not be denied solely based on traditional BMI risk zones.
There is no upper patient-age limit to MBS. Older individuals who could benefit from MBS should be considered for surgery after careful assessment of co-morbidities and frailty.
Carefully selected individuals considered higher risk for general surgery may benefit from MBS.
Children and adolescents with BMI > 120% of the 95th percentile and a major co-morbidity, or a BMI > 140% of the 95th percentile, should be considered for MBS after evaluation by a multidisciplinary team in a specialty center.
MBS is an effective treatment of clinically severe obesity in patients who need other specialty surgery, such as joint arthroplasty, abdominal wall hernia repair, or organ transplantation.
Consultation with a multidisciplinary team can help manage the patient's modifiable risk factors with a goal of reducing risk of perioperative complications and improving outcomes. The ultimate decision for surgical readiness should be determined by the surgeon.
Severe obesity is a chronic disease requiring long-term management after primary MBS. This may include revisional surgery or other adjuvant therapy to achieve desired treatment effect.

Criteria for surgery

BMI

Despite limitations of BMI to accurately risk stratify patients with obesity for their future health risk, it is the most feasible and widely used criteria to identify and classify patients with overweight or obesity. MBS is currently the most effective evidence-based treatment for obesity across all BMI classes.

BMI 30–34.9 kg/m 2. Class I obesity (BMI 30–34.9 kg/m 2) is a well-defined disease that causes or exacerbates multiple medical and psychological co-morbidities, decreases longevity, and impairs quality of life. Prospective and large retrospective studies support the notion that MBS should be considered a treatment option for patients with class I obesity who do not achieve substantial or durable weight loss or co-morbidity improvement with nonsurgical methods, and early findings prompted international diabetes organizations to publish a joint statement supporting the consideration of MBS for patients with BMI < 35 kg/m 2 and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Aminian et al. summarize the available data from randomized controlled trials (RCT's), meta-analyses, and observational studies that also include individuals with BMI < 35 kg/m 2. These data consistently demonstrate the weight loss and metabolic benefits of MBS in individuals with class I obesity. Noun et al. reported on > 500 consecutive patients with BMI < 35 kg/m 2 who had MBS and demonstrated significant weight loss at 5 years and improvement or remission of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. In a cohort study of more than 1000 patients, MBS in individuals with BMI < 35 kg/m 2 produced high rates of co-morbidity remission and was more likely than MBS in BMI > 35 kg/m 2 to achieve BMI < 25 kg/m 2. Ikramuddin et al. and Schauer et al. demonstrated superior diabetes improvement and weight loss following MBS in randomized controlled trials that include the subset of patients with BMI < 35 kg/m 2. A 3-arm randomized controlled trial that had 43% of its subjects with class I obesity, demonstrated that MBS is superior to lifestyle intervention for remission of T2D, 3 years after surgery.

Patient evaluation for metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) — the 1991 NIH Consensus Statement recommends that candidates "should be evaluated by a 'multidisciplinary team with access to medical, surgical, psychiatric, and nutritional expertise'". Subsequent reports note that adding such a team to perioperative care "may decrease rates of complications", and that "the decision for surgical readiness should be primarily determined by the surgeon". The guideline states "there are no data to support the practice of insurance-mandated preoperative weight loss", describing it as "discriminatory, arbitrary, and scientifically unfounded". A nutritional assessment by a registered dietitian with MBS expertise "can help obtain a comprehensive weight history, identify maladaptive eating behaviors or patterns, and correct any micronutrient deficiencies", "provide preoperative nutrition education", and "assist in the management of postoperative patients" with intolerances, malabsorption, micronutrient deficiencies, or weight regain. Mental health conditions "are found at higher rates among candidates for MBS than in the general population"; the pre-surgical process aims to address "disordered eating, severe uncontrolled mental illness, or active substance abuse", with licensed behavioral health providers "important" to assess coping with surgery and lifestyle change. Social stressors "such as financial, housing and food insecurity should be identified".

### Real-world retrospective analysis of outcomes in patients undergoing bariatric surgery with class 1 obesity [^112foRpU]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

NIH-established indications for bariatric surgery were set close to 3 decades ago.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes in patients undergoing bariatric surgery with class I obesity, a class that does not fall into current indications.

Setting

University Hospital.

Methods

De-identified records from a clinic system's Electronic Health Record database were accessed to identify adult patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) (n = 566) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) (n = 730). Patients were compared in terms of resolution of co-morbidities and weight loss outcomes at 3 years following surgery. A mixed effects model was used, adjusting for the type of surgery, the number of quarters after the surgery when the averaged measurements were taken, and the interaction between these two variables.

Results

Patients lost up to 20% of their initial body mass index (BMI). Being of younger age, female, and having an obesity-related co-morbidity were associated with greater weight loss. At around 2 years after the surgery, the likelihood of being in remission from type 2 diabetes reached 45%. Remission probabilities for hypertension are 60% for RYGB and 50% for SG, 3 years after the surgery. On the other hand, the probabilities of remission from hyperlipidemia are close to 50% and 25% for RYGB and SG at 2 years. There was no difference between the BMI trajectories and remission from type 2 diabetes (T2D) when comparing the 2 groups.

Conclusions

Bariatric surgery is effective in weight loss and resolution of comorbidities in patients with class I obesity. This data further supports the need to revisit the current indication criteria.

Obesity is an increasing worldwide epidemic. Bariatric procedures are safe and effective in the treatment of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities. There are numerous different bariatric procedures ranging from less-invasive procedures to more invasive surgeries. This document discusses the guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging in the preoperative and postoperative evaluation of adult bariatric patients, as well as after surgery when a complication is suspected. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Executive summary

Background

As the obesity epidemic continues to worsen, more patients are seeking metabolic and bariatric surgery. These patients frequently have comorbid conditions that can affect their perioperative care. A panel of bariatric surgeons was assembled to provide recommendations regarding routine intraoperative cholangiography in patients with bypass-type anatomy, the management of reflux disease after sleeve gastrectomy, and the optimal bariatric procedure for patients with comorbid inflammatory bowel disease.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted for three key questions regarding comorbidities in patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery. Questions were chosen by members of the SAGES Guidelines Committee who practice metabolic and bariatric surgery with guidance from senior members of the Guidelines Committee. The Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov, Embase, PubMed, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched to identify randomized controlled trials and non-randomized comparative studies. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology by subject matter experts. GRADE is a transparent framework used in the development of clinical practice guidelines, using the highest-level evidence available. Expert opinion was utilized in cases of insufficient data for an evidence-based recommendation. During the manuscript revision process, an experienced patient representative from the Obesity Action Network reviewed the importance ascribed to the outcomes by the panel and the final recommendations themselves. Recommendations for future research were also proposed.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations

All recommendations were assigned either a "strong" or "conditional" recommendation. The words "the guideline panel recommends" are used for strong recommendations, and "the guideline panel suggests" for conditional recommendations, as per the GRADE approach. A conditional recommendation signals that the benefits of adhering to a recommendation probably outweigh the harms although it does also indicate uncertainty. This uncertainty may be due to a lack of high-quality evidence or variability in how individual patients value the outcomes of interest.

How to use this document

The primary aim of these recommendations is to provide guidance for the management of comorbid conditions in patients who are under consideration for or who have undergone metabolic and bariatric surgery. They are also intended to provide education for patients, inform advocacy, and describe future areas for research. Given the lack of strong evidence, these recommendations provide guidance but not mandates. The wide variety of clinical scenarios will require adjustment of treatment plans to suit the needs and priorities of the individual patient. Finally, because these recommendations take a patient-centered approach as opposed to a health systems-centered approach, patients can use these recommendations as a source of information and basis for discussion with their physicians.

In 2020, updated versions of the clinical practice guidelines of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery, the Canadian Adult Obesity Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Dutch Federation for Medical Specialist clinical practice guidelines on bariatric surgery were published. We systematically reviewed and compared them on recommendations and references. Although the authors would have had access to the same literature, only 5 out of 655 unique references were used by all 3 guidelines and just 49 references by any combination of 2 guidelines. These findings attest to the subjectivity involved in clinical practice guidelines development and could be the cause for the observed differences in recommendations. International cooperation in guideline development might be a conceivable solution.

### Clinical practice update: expert review on endoscopic bariatric Therapies [^117TQUgf]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Multiple endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBTs) currently are being evaluated or are in clinical use in the United States. EBTs are well positioned to fill an important gap in the management of obesity and metabolic disease. The purpose of this expert review is to update gastroenterologists on these therapies and provide practice advice on how to incorporate them into clinical practice.

Methods

The evidence reviewed in this work is a distillation of comprehensive search of several English-language databases and a manual review of relevant publications (including systematic reviews and meeting abstracts). Best Practice Advice 1: EBTs should be considered in patients with obesity who have been unsuccessful in losing or maintaining weight loss with lifestyle interventions. Best Practice Advice 2: EBTs can be used in patients with severe obesity as a bridge to traditional bariatric surgery. They also can be used as a bridge to allow unrelated interventions that are unable to be performed because of weight limits (ie, orthopedic surgery, organ transplantation). Best Practice Advice 3: Clinicians should use EBTs as part of a structured weight loss program that includes dietary intervention, exercise therapy, and behavior modification, in both the active weight loss phase and the long-term maintenance phase. Best Practice Advice 4: Clinicians should screen all potential EBT candidates with a comprehensive evaluation for medical conditions, comorbidities, and psychosocial or behavioral patterns that contribute to their condition before enrolling patients in a weight loss program that includes EBTs. Best Practice Advice 5: Clinicians incorporating EBTs into their clinical practice should follow up patients prospectively to capture the impact of the EBT program on weight and weight-related comorbidities, and all related adverse outcomes. Poor responders should be identified and offered a detailed evaluation and alternative therapy. Best Practice Advice 6: Clinicians embarking on incorporating EBTs into their clinical practice should have a comprehensive knowledge of the indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, and outcomes of individual EBTs, as well as a practical knowledge of the risks and benefits of alternative therapies for obesity. Best Practice Advice 7: Institutions should establish specific guidelines that are applied consistently across disciplines for granting privileges in EBTs that reflect the necessary knowledge and technical skill a clinician must achieve before being granted privileges to perform these procedures.

### Review on obesity management: bariatric surgery [^117Rp9Eq]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

As the obesity epidemic continues to grow, an increasing number of individuals require reliable, long-term interventions to help them maintain weight loss. For eligible patients with severe obesity, bariatric surgery is the most effective option to achieve this goal. Out of the four most common procedures, sleeve gastrectomy has overtaken Rou-en-Y gastric bypasses as the most popular option due to the sleeve gastrectomy's reduced postoperative complications, less-invasive approach, and that it achieves a significant long-term weight loss that is similar to the gastric bypass. In addition to weight loss, bariatric surgery is the only proven weight management therapy that helps reduce CV outcomes and mortality. Significant levels of type II diabetes remission (above 90%) are also a benefit of bariatric surgery. To minimise complications and assure optimal safety, current guidelines recommend that physicians prepare their surgery candidates with a multidisciplinary team and screen them for CV, pulmonary and sleep apnoea complications before operation. Bariatric surgery is, therefore, a safe and viable long-term weight management interventions for patients with severe obesity. Therefore, there is not a singular procedure that universally benefits all patients. Physicians and patients must collaboratively determine the most suitable procedure to consider, taking into account factors such as comorbidity profile, individual preferences and weighing the benefits against the risks associated with each surgery.

### Bariatric surgery: an IDF statement for obese type 2 diabetes [^111YtiCt]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Despite a number of evidence-based reviews and consensus statements having been published regarding the utilization of bariatric surgery in patients with obesity and diabetes, the IDF has not previously considered this rapidly developing area of care for worldwide use. Therefore, a need exists for worldwide expert guidance in the preoperative evaluation, choice of interventional procedure, perioperative management and long-term care of patients who seek surgery to improve diabetes control.

The IDF Taskforce on Epidemiology and Prevention convened a consensus working group of diabetologists, endocrinologists, surgeons and public health experts in December 2010 to discuss the appropriate role of bariatric surgery and other gastrointestinal interventions in the treatment and prevention of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The specific goals of the panel were: to develop practical recommendations for clinicians; to identify barriers that currently prevent access to surgery and suggest interventions for health policy changes that ensure equitable access to surgery when indicated; and to identify priorities for clinical research.

This consensus statement considers primarily established bariatric surgical procedures. It is acknowledged that this is an emerging field and there is a large range of novel extraluminal and endoluminal gastrointestinal surgical procedures and devices that are in the development phase. Some focus primarily on weight loss and others additional non-weight loss metabolic benefits. The use of these requires further validation before they can be recommended.

Extremes of age — older population — metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) has been performed successfully in increasingly older patients, including individuals > 70 years of age, and in septuagenarians is associated with slightly higher postoperative complications but substantial benefits of weight loss and remission of co-morbid disease. The presence of obesity co-morbid disease and the choice of operation are more predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes than age alone. Frailty, rather than age alone, is independently associated with higher postoperative complications, and there is no evidence to support an age limit on patients seeking MBS, but careful selection that includes assessment of frailty is recommended.

Cirrhosis and NAFLD/NASH — Obesity increases liver risk and in patients with known cirrhosis conveys a 3-fold increase in risk of decompensation; metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) has been associated with histologic improvement of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), regression of fibrosis, and an 88% risk reduction of progression of NASH to cirrhosis. In compensated cirrhosis, perioperative mortality risk following MBS is higher but remains small (< 1%), and data are limited for those with clinically significant portal hypertension.

Metabolic and bariatric surgery — mortality and life expectancy outcomes: Large prospective and retrospective studies have consistently reported the lower mortality and improved survival benefit of MBS. The Swedish Obese Subjects study demonstrated an adjusted decreased overall mortality by 30.7% in the group of 2010 surgical patients compared with nonsurgical controls, at an average of 10 years after surgery. Similar results were seen in a large retrospective study comparing 9949 individuals who had undergone RYGB with nonsurgical controls, where with a mean follow-up of 7 years, adjusted overall mortality decreased by 40% in the MBS group. In a retrospective cohort study of 2500 mostly male patients, all-cause mortality was significantly lower at 5–10 years after MBS compared to controls. A large meta-analysis with an overall > 170,000 subjects found median life-expectancy increased by 6.1 years after MBS compared with usual care, and among Medicare beneficiaries comprising > 94,000 individuals who had MBS there was a significantly lower risk of mortality. Thus, the durable benefits of MBS for individuals with class II/III obesity are reflected in an overall lower mortality years after surgery in multiple populations.

Patient evaluation

The 1991 NIH Consensus Statement recommends that patients who are candidates for MBS should be evaluated by a "multidisciplinary team with access to medical, surgical, psychiatric, and nutritional expertise". The value of assessments by such a team has since been reiterated, reflecting the recognition of the complexity of the disease of obesity, and the ability to provide a comprehensive risk/benefit analysis when considering MBS. This may also facilitate the patient's ability to comprehend the life-long changes that can be expected after surgery, benefitting from the expertise of different healthcare providers. Studies have suggested that the addition of a multidisciplinary team to the perioperative care of the patient may decrease rates of complications.

While there has been initial enthusiasm for weight loss prior to surgery, there are no data to support the practice of insurance-mandated preoperative weight loss; this practice is understood to be discriminatory, arbitrary, and scientifically unfounded, contributing to patient attrition, unnecessary delay of lifesaving treatment, and progression of life-threatening co-morbid conditions. A multidisciplinary team can help assess and manage the patient's modifiable risk factors with a goal of reducing risk of perioperative complications and improving outcomes; the decision for surgical readiness should be primarily determined by the surgeon.

The nutritional status of patients seeking MBS is important. A nutritional assessment by a registered dietitian with expertise in MBS can help obtain a comprehensive weight history, identify maladaptive eating behaviors or patterns, and correct any micronutrient deficiencies prior to surgery. A registered dietitian can also provide preoperative nutrition education and prepare the patient for expected dietary changes after MBS. In addition, a registered dietitian with expertise in MBS can assist in the management of postoperative patients who may be experiencing food intolerances, malabsorption issues and micronutrient deficiencies, and weight regain.

Mental health conditions such as depression and binge eating disorders, as well as substance abuse, are found at higher rates among candidates for MBS than in the general population. The pre-surgical evaluation process is designed to optimize surgical outcomes and implement interventions that can address disordered eating, severe uncontrolled mental illness, or active substance abuse. Licensed mental health providers with specialty knowledge and experience in MBS behavioral health are important to assess patients for psychopathology, and determine the candidate's ability to cope with the adversity of surgery, changing body image, and life-style changes required after MBS. In addition, stressors that may affect long-term outcomes such as financial, housing and food insecurity should be identified.

### Revisional bariatric surgery due to complications: indications and outcomes [^116QqtyX]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The increasing prevalence of bariatric procedures has led to a surge in revisional surgeries. Failure of bariatric surgery can be attributed to inadequate weight loss or complications necessitating revisional surgery. In this study, we investigated the indications and outcomes of revisional surgery due to complications following primary bariatric surgery.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective study was conducted using data from the Tehran Obesity Treatment Study, which included patients who underwent revisional bariatric surgery between March 2013 and September 2021 due to complications following primary bariatric surgery.

Results

Of the 5382 patients who underwent primary bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomy, one-anastomosis gastric bypass, and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), 203 (3.70%) required revisional surgery, with 37 cases performed due to surgical complications. The indications of revisional operations were gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (n = 17, 45.9%), protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) (n = 14, 37.8%), unexplained abdominal pain (n = 5, 13.5%), and phytobezoar (n = 1, 0.03%). In the postoperative follow-up, most patients exhibited improvement in signs and symptoms related to underlying causes. However, eight patients experienced early or late complications of grade III or higher according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, with one death resulting from liver failure.

Conclusion

Revisional bariatric surgery may effectively address complications from primary bariatric surgery, with the majority of patients experiencing improvements in symptoms. While the overall incidence of revisional surgery due to complications is relatively low, our findings suggest that GERD and PCM are the most common indications for revisional surgery.

### Disease-based criteria vs BMI level for prioritization of metabolic surgery [^115S357M]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The increased prevalence of T2D among candidates for bariatric and metabolic surgery has led to substantial changes in patients' demographics and baseline characteristics compared to traditional bariatric surgery practices. In fact, surgical candidates with T2D are generally older, have higher number of co-morbidities and previous cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to surgical candidates without diabetes.

Despite such transformative changes in the patient population now being considered for bariatric and metabolic surgery, body mass index (BMI)-based eligibility criteria for patients' selection, assessment of treatment urgency, and prioritization of access to surgery remain outdated and increasingly misaligned with the current clinical reality. In fact, BMI is not a measure of health or illness at the individual level as it provides no information about the functioning of organs and tissues. Thus, BMI levels cannot be used as a measure of ongoing disease or disease severity. The health risk associated with BMI also varies substantially with age and ethnicity. In many countries, and especially in Asia, individuals with T2D have mean BMI levels lower than 35 kg/m 2; thus, using BMI-thresholds for surgical indication can effectively exclude many patients from potential surgical benefit. These findings from prior research emphasize the limitations of BMI-centric guidelines and highlight the need for more inclusive and clinically relevant eligibility criteria. Yet, health insurance coverage of bariatric and metabolic surgery is still universally based on BMI thresholds, and criteria for insurance coverage often require surgical candidates to undergo non-surgical pre-operative weight management (e.g. "Tier 3" in UK.

For patients who meet BMI-centric criteria for surgical indication, access to bariatric and metabolic surgery, especially in publicly funded healthcare systems, is often granted on a first-come-first-served basis, regardless of disease severity. These practices may effectively delay treatment in many patients who are at higher risk of disease progression and significant, yet preventable complications.

In many healthcare systems including, as an example, the UK's NHS (National Health Service) expedited access to bariatric and metabolic surgery is reserved only for people with very high BMI (e.g. ≥ 50 kg/m 2); it is unclear, however, if such BMI threshold accurately reflects disease burden or treatment urgency in candidates to metabolic surgery.

In this study, we used an audit of our clinical practice to investigate demographic characteristics, disease severity, and disease-related mortality risk among candidates for bariatric and metabolic surgery, according to diabetes status, the presence of established CVD or BMI ≥ 50 kg/m 2 at baseline.

Currently, the guidelines from the International Pediatric Endosurgery Group (IPEG) state that adolescents with a BMI > 40 kg/m 2 or a BMI > 35 kg/m 2 combined with severe comorbidities should be considered for surgical intervention, if they have (nearly) attained adult stature. These guidelines are largely based upon a systematic review and meta-analysis by Treadwell et al. reviewing studies up to December 2007. The last few years, indication criteria for bariatric surgery have expanded, and surgical techniques have improved. However, the outcome and best techniques to treat morbidly obese adolescents remain relatively unknown.

In this review, we evaluate and compare the efficacy, safety, and (psychosocial) health benefits of various bariatric surgical techniques as a treatment for morbid obesity in adolescents. Our data are obtained with help of supplemental data from several authors and strengthened by inclusion of the most recent high-quality studies.

### Reoperative surgery for nonresponders and complicated sleeve gastrectomy operations in patients with severe obesity. An international expert panel consensus statement to define best practice guidelines [^116AdMGc]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has rapidly become the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in the United States as well as other countries, with approximately 120,000 procedures being performed annually in the United States. Reoperative interventions after SG have become more prevalent in the past few years since the initial development of SG as a primary operation. Given the expected rapid growth of these reinterventions, an expert consensus conference was held with some of the most experienced bariatric surgeons in the world to better understand, discuss, and provide consensus on the reasons, indications, contraindications, and surgical options for nonresponders and complicated SG operations.

Objectives

Provide consensus-based best practice guidelines regarding the performance of reinterventions after failed or complicated SG in patients with obesity, using expert opinion by organizing a consensus meeting of experts and evaluating the current literature.

Setting

The meeting was held in Boca Raton, Florida on February 18, 2017.

Methods

The panel of 32 expert bariatric surgeons representing 12 countries and major regions of the world and all 6 populated continents identified 54 questions for consensus. Questions encompassed patient selection, indications, contraindications, surgical technique, prevention and management of weight regain, and short- and long-term complications after SG. Responses were calculated and defined as achieving consensus (≥ 70% agreement) or no consensus (< 70% agreement). The current available literature was extensively reviewed for each topic in question and proposed to the panel.

Results

Full consensus was obtained for the essential aspects of indications and contraindications, surgical technique, management, and prevention of complications. Consensus was achieved for 35 of 54 key questions. Highlights include consensus recommendations regarding technique in reoperation, management of GERD and Barrett's esophagus after SG, and surgical options for poor initial weight loss. No consensus was reached on topics, such as management of chronic proximal fistula after SG.

Conclusions

This first international expert meeting provides 35 statements and recommendations for a clinical consensus guideline regarding standardization of indications, contraindications, surgical options, and surgical techniques when reoperating on patients who underwent a failed or complicated SG. To our knowledge, the present consensus report represents the first document that defines best practice guidelines for the performance of reinterventions after failed or complicated SG.
