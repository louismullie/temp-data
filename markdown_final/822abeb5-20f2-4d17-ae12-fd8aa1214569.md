## Question

What is pos UPT in OBGYN?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "pos UPT" means in Obstetrics and Gynecology, specifically what constitutes a positive urine pregnancy test and how to interpret and apply it clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the analytical definition of a UPT and what "positive" means. Then, I should verify the biology and timing of hCG appearance in urine. Next, I will review clinical interpretation, including location and viability, test performance, and common pitfalls causing false positives and false negatives. After that, I should compare urine with serum testing, walk through special scenarios like ectopic and molar pregnancy, oncology patients, and post-abortion or GTD surveillance. Finally, I need to synthesize best-practice guidance and indications for when to test and when to escalate to serum and imaging, grounding every step in guidelines and laboratory evidence.

> Let me first confirm the test construct and the meaning of "positive". A urine pregnancy test is a point-of-care immunoassay that detects human chorionic gonadotropin, typically the beta subunit, in urine, and a "positive" reflects hCG at or above the assay's detection threshold, most commonly in the 25 mIU/mL range though sensitivity varies by manufacturer and matrix effects, so I should be careful not to assume a uniform cut-off across all products [^117WL1B7]. hCG is produced by syncytiotrophoblast and becomes detectable in serum 8–10 days after conception and in urine typically within about 16 days post-ovulation, which anchors why tests performed too early can mislead if I do not account for timing and urine concentration effects [^112SMuFo] [^117CZiWS].

> Hold on, I should verify the biological timing and the pre-analytical variables that can skew results. Early gestation with low hCG, dilute urine without first-morning concentration, and inter-assay variability can all push a true pregnancy below the detection threshold of a UPT, so a negative test cannot exclude pregnancy in the first days after a missed menses, especially if symptoms suggest otherwise [^117WL1B7] [^1118v3KR]. Let me consider that repeat testing after 48 hours or proceeding to a serum assay is the safer route when clinical suspicion is nontrivial, particularly to avoid missing ectopic pregnancy or very early intrauterine gestations [^114zkLvw] [^117WL1B7].

> I need to ensure the interpretation remains clinically anchored. A positive UPT confirms hCG exposure but does not establish pregnancy location, viability, or gestational age, so I should not over-interpret a positive strip in isolation [^112uiwwp]. Next, I should review that clinical confirmation requires correlation with history, examination, quantitative serum hCG for trend, and transvaginal ultrasound, and guideline statements caution against using β-hCG values alone to diagnose a normal intrauterine pregnancy because of overlap across normal and abnormal outcomes, including ectopic pregnancy [^112uiwwp] [^1143nGXz].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost defaulted to saying UPTs are " > 99% sensitive", but I need to double-check the context. That high performance applies to confirming established pregnancy when used at appropriate timing and conditions, not to discriminating abnormal from normal pregnancies in the emergency setting, where a prospective evaluation of a urinary test for abnormal first-trimester outcomes showed only 13% sensitivity and 82% specificity, underscoring that such tools are poor at risk stratifying abnormality rather than presence of pregnancy per se [^1177fnnh]. I should confirm that qualitative tests may also be less analytically sensitive than claimed and that early gestation is a leading cause of false negatives, which tempers any overconfident reliance on a single negative UPT result when the pretest probability is meaningful [^117WL1B7] [^114zkLvw].

> Next, I will examine causes of false-positive UPTs, even though they are uncommon. Let me verify that heterophilic antibodies and other serum interferents can cause unexpected positivity on some platforms, exogenous hCG from fertility therapy can transiently drive false positives, certain malignancies can secrete hCG or hCG variants, pituitary hCG in peri- and postmenopausal patients can exceed typical cutoffs, and inflammatory states like septic shock have produced transient false-positive urine results in case reports, all of which argue for confirmatory strategies when results are discordant with the clinical picture [^1118v3KR] [^1118tWvm] [^114S2FXF] [^112SMuFo] [^116gc5mv]. Hold on, I should verify the safeguard: repeating with a serum assay, using serial dilutions, or switching to an assay specific for intact hCG often unmasks interference and reduces false positives substantially in oncology populations, making that a prudent step when cancer is in the differential [^1118v3KR] [^114S2FXF].

> Now, let me consider the more common and clinically consequential false negatives. I should confirm that testing too early is the leading issue, that dilute urine can drop hCG below detection, that ectopic pregnancies often produce lower or atypically rising hCG values, and that the hook effect in trophoblastic disease can paradoxically yield false negatives on qualitative urine assays, all mandating serum confirmation when the stakes are high or the presentation is concerning [^114zkLvw] [^117WL1B7] [^115iRgDd] [^112wBFhC] [^117D7k13]. The classic cautionary example is hemorrhagic shock from ruptured ectopic with serial negative UPTs and a serum hCG of only 7 mIU/mL, which sits below most qualitative detection thresholds and highlights why a negative UPT must not prematurely close the diagnostic loop in high-risk scenarios [^115iRgDd].

> Let me compare urine and serum testing to make sure I am choosing the right tool. Serum hCG testing is more analytically sensitive and quantitative, allowing for appropriate 48-hour trend assessment and ultrasound correlation in pregnancy of unknown location, whereas urine testing is convenient for initial screening but should not replace serum measurement when management depends on precise levels or when results are discordant with the clinical picture [^117WL1B7]. I should also confirm that point-of-care quantitative devices have not yet matched laboratory serum performance for PUL triage, and while creative emergency uses of urine kits on whole blood have been described in unstable settings, these remain workarounds that warrant rapid formal serum confirmation and imaging as soon as feasible [^113RL99M] [^114mf7P2].

> Ectopic pregnancy deserves explicit attention, and I should verify that a negative UPT never excludes it when symptoms are compatible. Guideline-based management relies on quantitative serum hCG dynamics with close ultrasound follow-up, and rupture can occur at very low serum hCG levels, reinforcing the principle that clinical judgment and hemodynamic assessment trump a single qualitative test result [^116mPbiN] [^115iRgDd]. Let me reconsider any temptation to rely on urine testing alone in PUL pathways; that would be unsafe given the limited sensitivity and the catastrophic consequences of a missed ectopic pregnancy [^113RL99M].

> Molar pregnancy is another special scenario where I should double-check for assay pitfalls. Markedly elevated hCG and hCG variant profiles can produce a hook effect with false-negative qualitative urine tests despite extreme serum levels, so the correct approach is quantitative serum hCG plus ultrasound and, when discordant, consideration of dilution studies to expose the true concentration and avoid misclassification [^112wBFhC] [^117D7k13]. Hold on, let me verify that this pitfall applies to partial moles as well, especially if degradation products or variant forms escape detection by specific assays, which further supports confirmatory laboratory strategies when clinical features suggest GTD despite a negative urine test [^117D7k13].

> For patients with malignancy, I need to ensure I reduce false positives driven by hCG variants and heterophile interactions. Using assays specific for intact hCG markedly reduces false-positive rates compared with total β-hCG in oncology cohorts, so if an unexpected positive appears in a cancer population, repeating testing with an intact hCG assay and performing interference mitigation steps is advised before making clinical decisions predicated on pregnancy status [^114S2FXF] [^1118v3KR].

> Post-pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease surveillance require careful use of urine hCG alongside serum testing. I should confirm that persistent or irregular bleeding beyond eight weeks after a pregnancy warrants urine hCG evaluation for GTD per guideline statements, and that urine hCG levels can stratify GTN risk, with higher thresholds linked to substantially increased probabilities of neoplasia and need for intensive follow-up or consideration of prophylactic therapy in select high-risk contexts [^1158Vma5] [^114w8NXu]. Let me verify complementary guidance that symptoms persisting after pregnancy termination, evacuation, or miscarriage warrant hCG testing to expedite GTD diagnosis when pathology is not routinely obtained, which helps prevent delays in care [^116yM7ye].

> I will now examine system-level roles for UPT that impact access and timing of care. Early, accessible urine pregnancy testing facilitates timelier antenatal entry and abortion care, and programs embedding on-site UPT in public clinics or community pathways have been associated with meaningful reductions in gestational age at presentation and faster linkage to appropriate services, although availability alone is not sufficient without clear referral protocols and counseling infrastructure [^114akjkN] [^117QiG9X] [^115bPuPr] [^111Kh9Bq]. Wait, I should also confirm that clinical settings performing UPT should integrate contraceptive counseling when tests are negative for those wishing to avoid pregnancy, as studies suggest gaps and disparities in such counseling outside of family planning clinics that can be addressed at the point of testing [^114uwjQB].

> Pre-procedure and teratogen-related screening are practical scenarios where I need to be precise. Routine point-of-care UPT before hysterosalpingography detects unsuspected early pregnancies that scheduling by cycle day can miss, preventing inadvertent exposure, and isotretinoin programs require two appropriately timed negative pregnancy tests before initiation and monthly testing thereafter, underscoring the medicolegal and safety imperatives around reliable pregnancy screening workflows [^1118tWvm] [^111TbMnc]. Hold on, I should verify that when a pre-procedure positive appears unexpectedly, confirming with serum and repeating if interference is suspected is the right safety step before aborting or proceeding with the procedure, especially if recent hCG administration is possible [^1118tWvm] [^1118v3KR].

> Let me synthesize best-practice indications and escalation triggers. Pregnancy testing should be obtained in all reproductive-age patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, amenorrhea, or symptoms suggestive of pregnancy, and clinicians should maintain a low threshold to test before initiating teratogenic medications or when managing acute presentations where pregnancy status affects testing or treatment [^115E6LBC] [^116WPDXo]. I should confirm that a positive UPT warrants timely quantitative serum hCG and transvaginal ultrasound to determine location and viability, that a negative UPT with persistent suspicion requires repeat testing or direct serum testing after 48 hours, and that discordant clinical–laboratory pictures require interference checks with serum dilutions, alternate assays, or urine–serum cross-verification rather than premature closure on a single result [^112uiwwp] [^1143nGXz] [^1118v3KR].

> In closing, I need to ensure my overall message is both cautious and actionable. A positive urine pregnancy test confirms hCG exposure but does not diagnose intrauterine location or viability, and safe, guideline-concordant care pairs UPT with appropriate serum testing and imaging, while recognizing early timing, ectopic pregnancy, assay interference, and hook effect scenarios where urine testing alone can mislead and where deliberate verification is essential to avoid harm [^112uiwwp] [^116mPbiN] [^117WL1B7].

A positive urine pregnancy test (pos UPT) in OBGYN indicates detection of hCG in urine [^117WL1B7], **confirming pregnancy** and prompting immediate prenatal care, ultrasound dating, and counseling on options and risks. It is a rapid, noninvasive screening tool, but **false positives/negatives can occur** [^114zkLvw]; confirm with serum hCG or ultrasound if results are discordant or clinical suspicion persists [^1118v3KR]. Pos UPT is essential for early pregnancy recognition [^114akjkN], guiding timely antenatal care, and informing management of complications such as ectopic pregnancy or gestational trophoblastic disease [^116mPbiN] [^116yM7ye].

---

## Clinical significance of pos UPT

- **Early pregnancy confirmation**: Pos UPT enables early recognition [^114akjkN], facilitating timely antenatal care and reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity.

- **Initiation of prenatal care**: It prompts early prenatal care, including folic acid, lifestyle counseling, and screening for infections and genetic conditions [^11475s7J].

- **Management of pregnancy complications**: Pos UPT guides evaluation of ectopic pregnancy [^116mPbiN], gestational trophoblastic disease [^116yM7ye], and early pregnancy loss [^1119Cf46].

- **Contraceptive counseling**: It informs counseling and management for women seeking contraception [^114uwjQB] or presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding [^116WPDXo].

## Clinical scenarios requiring pos UPT

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for pos UPT** |
|-|-|
| Amenorrhea or missed period | Confirm pregnancy [^117WL1B7] |
| Abnormal uterine bleeding | Rule out pregnancy-related causes [^116WPDXo] |
| Suspected ectopic pregnancy | Confirm pregnancy and guide management [^116mPbiN] |
| Preoperative assessment | Exclude pregnancy before surgery [^1118tWvm] |
| Initiation of teratogenic medications | Confirm pregnancy status [^111TbMnc] |
| Suspected gestational trophoblastic disease | Confirm pregnancy and guide management [^116yM7ye] |

---

## Limitations and potential errors

Despite high accuracy, pos UPT can yield **false positives/negatives** [^117WL1B7]. Results may be **false-positive** due to heterophilic antibodies [^1118v3KR], trophoblastic tumors [^114S2FXF], recent pregnancy loss, or interfering substances [^116gc5mv]. Results may be **false-negative** with early gestation [^114zkLvw], dilute urine, the hook effect [^117D7k13], or improper testing.

---

## Clinical management following pos UPT

- **Confirmatory testing**: Use serum hCG [^114zkLvw] or ultrasound [^1119Cf46] when results are discordant or suspicion persists.

- **Prenatal care initiation**: Start antenatal care, including folic acid, lifestyle counseling, and screening [^11475s7J].

- **Patient counseling**: Discuss pregnancy options, risks, and next steps [^114akjkN].

- **Monitoring and follow-up**: Schedule regular visits to monitor maternal and fetal health.

---

## Clinical implications of false-positive pos UPT

False positives can cause unnecessary anxiety, interventions, and costs [^1118v3KR]. Confirm with **serum hCG or ultrasound** to avoid inappropriate decisions [^114S2FXF].

---

A positive urine pregnancy test (pos UPT) is a rapid, noninvasive screening tool that **confirms pregnancy**, enabling early prenatal care and guiding management of complications. Despite high accuracy, confirm discordant results with serum hCG or ultrasound to ensure appropriate care [^1119Cf46].

### The role of urine pregnancy testing in facilitating access to antenatal care and abortion services in South Africa: a cross-sectional study [^114akjkN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Effective confirmation of pregnancy is a basic component of reproductive health services. It is a prerequisite for accessing antenatal care (ANC) if the pregnancy is wanted and for abortion services if the pregnancy is unwanted. Pregnancy testing is also often needed to rule out pregnancy prior to contraception. While blood pregnancy tests or clinical examination may be used, administration of sensitive beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-HCG) urine pregnancy tests is an effective and low-cost means of early pregnancy confirmation that is feasible in many resource-limited settings.

- **Under-utilization of services**: It is widely believed that urine pregnancy testing, though theoretically available at all public health facilities in South Africa, is under-utilized by clinic staff. Lack of early pregnancy confirmation services may contribute to late antenatal care and late abortion presentations, which are the norm in South Africa and many other parts of sub-Saharan Africa.

Despite the importance of early pregnancy detection, little is known about how the availability and accessibility of early pregnancy confirmation services, in the form of urine pregnancy testing, may affect gestational age at presentation for ANC and abortion services. We examined the role of urine pregnancy testing in the timing of presentation for public sector ANC and abortion services in South Africa.

### False-negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin testing in the clinical laboratory [^114zkLvw]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assays are used to detect pregnancy, and urine point-of-care tests are frequently used to triage patients. Under certain conditions, urine tests can fail to detect pregnancy, which can have serious consequences for patient management.

- **Objectives**: To understand the prevalence of different factors contributing to false-negative urinary hCG testing results at our institution.

- **Methods**: Clinical data for patients with negative urine hCG results and subsequent positive or equivocal serum hCG results within a 1-year period were reviewed.

- **Results**: Out of 9447 negative urine hCG results, 11 potential missed diagnoses were identified, with early gestational age as the most common factor, followed by β-core hook effects.

- **Conclusions**: Although false-negative urine hCG test results are rare, understanding the commonly encountered reasons for inaccurate testing results can help clinical centers develop strategies to minimize risk for patients.

### Guideline no. 408: Management of gestational trophoblastic diseases [^116yM7ye]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gestational trophoblastic disease, specifically concerning serum hCG levels, the SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining serum or urine hCG for earlier diagnosis of GTD. This is particularly advised if products of conception are not routinely sent for pathology and symptoms of pregnancy persist 4–6 weeks after the termination of pregnancy, evacuation of a nonviable pregnancy, or spontaneous abortion.

### Avoiding inappropriate clinical decisions based on false-positive human chorionic gonadotropin test results [^1118v3KR]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2003). Low credibility.

Clinically significant false-positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test results are rare. However, some individuals have circulating factors in their serum (e.g. heterophilic antibodies or nonactive forms of hCG) that interact with the hCG antibody and cause unusual or unexpected test results. False-positive and false-negative test results can occur with any specimen, and caution should be exercised when clinical findings and laboratory results are discordant. Methods to rule out the presence of interfering substances include using a urine test, rerunning the assay with serial dilutions of serum, preabsorbing serum, and using another assay. Physicians must decide whether the risks of waiting for confirmation of results outweigh the risks of failing to take immediate medical action. Patients should be notified if they are at risk for false-positive hCG test results, and this information should be included in the patient's medical record.

### Patient history and physician suspicion accurately exclude pregnancy [^117Ut2pP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Reliance upon patient assessment in excluding pregnancy is questionable. Physicians are encouraged to obtain pregnancy tests in all women of childbearing age. We affirmed the accuracy of women and their physicians in predicting pregnancy.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, observational study performed in a suburban academic emergency department on adult women with an ordered pregnancy test. A standardized gynecologic history was obtained by trained research assistants. Subjects estimated their likelihood of pregnancy as impossible, possible, or definite. Emergency department physicians estimated the likelihood of pregnancy as high, moderate, or low. All women had either a serum or urine β-human chorionic antigen test. The diagnostic characteristics of patient and physician predictions of pregnancy were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: We enrolled 377 subjects. The median age was 29 (interquartile range, 22–37) years. Twelve percent of the women were pregnant. Women's estimates of pregnancy were as follows: impossible, 64.7%; possible, 22.5%; and definite, 12.7%. The pregnancy rates among women with estimates of impossible, possible, and definite were 0% (95% CI, 0%-1.5%), 4.7% (95% CI, 1.9%-11.5%), and 89.6% (95% CI, 77.8%-95.5%) (P < .001). Physicians' suspicions of pregnancy were high (13.7%), moderate (11.3%), and low (75.1%). The rate of pregnancy among low, moderate, and high physician suspicion groups were 0% (95% CI, 0%-1.4%), 9.5% (95% CI, 3.8%-22%), and 84.3% (95% CI, 72%-92%) (P < .001).

There were no pregnancies among women with estimates of impossible pregnancy likelihood or within the low physician suspicion group.

### Update on prenatal laboratory screening: Joint commission required elements [^11475s7J]. NeoReviews (2019). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend routine screening for pregnant women for evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and syphilis, as well as vaginal-rectal colonization with group B Streptococcus. For each of these pathogens, there are important opportunities to provide maternal treatment, prevent vertical transmission of the pathogen during the prenatal or intrapartum periods, and/or administer neonatal treatment immediately after birth. Such prevention and/or treatment measures are critical to limiting maternal and neonatal morbidity; however, this is dependent on recognition of maternal disease status.

A significant number of women in the United States receive either inadequate prenatal care or inadequate screening for these pathogens. The time of admission to labor and delivery units represents an important opportunity to detect at-risk pregnant women and infants.

To optimize both maternal and neonatal health, the Joint Commission issued new guidance effective July 1, 2018, mandating documentation of maternal disease status for these pathogens in the maternal medical record and documentation of positive results in the newborn medical record. Immediate peripartum testing for women with inadequate screening is also required. These measures should allow for timely interventions to improve maternal health and ideally to prevent perinatal disease transmission to the newborn.

### The role of urine pregnancy testing in facilitating access to antenatal care and abortion services in South Africa: a cross-sectional study [^117QiG9X]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

This study has shown that obtaining a urine pregnancy test at a pharmacy is associated with an earlier presentation for antenatal care (AnC) and abortion services. However, greater access to private sector urine pregnancy testing alone is not likely to decrease gestational age at presentation sufficiently, as private sector tests require financial resources and add at least one visit to the care-seeking process. Making urine pregnancy testing routinely available in public clinics and coupling testing with immediate referral to appropriate pregnancy care — or even initiation of care at the point of confirming pregnancy — has the potential to significantly decrease gestational age at the first visit. The establishment of a pregnancy confirmation clinic, using urine pregnancy testing at select antenatal clinics in urban areas of South Africa, led to an average 10-week decrease in the gestational age of booking for AnC care.

Several specific programmatic recommendations, which may be applicable in diverse healthcare settings, arise from the findings of this study. First, the study identified several client knowledge gaps around pregnancy recognition and care. This misinformation on the part of women requires urgent correction through community- and health service-based education about the importance of early pregnancy recognition and presentation for care. Public awareness campaigns about these issues should be undertaken in general community settings and in all clinics that serve female clients, not only in AnC and abortion services.

### Women's perspectives of the fetal fibronectin testing process: a qualitative descriptive study [^113viMxH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Preterm birth (PTB), defined as birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, resulting in costly neonatal intensive care and long-term negative health outcomes. While some PTB results from the induction of labour or caesarean section due to maternal or fetal indications, spontaneous labour accounts for the majority of PTBs. In Canada, approximately 20,000 (5.5%) newborns per year are born prematurely due to spontaneous preterm labour (PTL). The rate is similar in Europe and slightly higher in the United States (6%).

The medical and nursing care required for preterm infants is specialized and costly. Neonatal outcomes improve when women in PTL are transferred from community hospitals to those with neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) prior to birth. In 2006, two health system issues in Ontario, Canada, were identified: an increase in the number of women giving birth to preterm infants in facilities lacking appropriate neonatal care levels, and more women with PTL symptoms being transferred to hospitals outside their region, province, and even to the United States. Given the unpredictable nature of PTL, many of these women were transferred back home still pregnant.

Fetal fibronectin (fFN) is a glycoprotein. When absent in cervicovaginal secretions between 24–34 weeks gestation, it indicates that a woman is unlikely to give birth within the next 7–14 days. The test, using a vaginal swab, is easy to perform and test results are rapidly available.

### Sensitivity and specificity of a urinary screening test used in an emergency setting to detect abnormal first trimester pregnancies [^1177fnnh]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

To evaluate the performance of a commercial urinary test to screen for abnormal first-trimester pregnancies in women presenting to an emergency room, a prospective observational cohort study was conducted. Women with a confirmed first trimester pregnancy (gestational age < 12 weeks) provided a urine sample for diagnosing the viability of their gestation, which was confirmed by ultrasound and/or laparoscopy.

From 815 eligible patients for the study, 12 were excluded for not having a confirmed pregnancy (n = 6) or were lost to follow-up (n = 6). A total of 803 patients underwent testing and completed follow-up. The pretest probability of an abnormal pregnancy was 44% (9% for ectopic pregnancy and 35% for miscarriage). The test had the following parameters to identify an abnormal first-trimester pregnancy: sensitivity, 13% (95% confidence interval, 10–17); specificity, 82% (95% CI, 78–86); positive predictive value, 36 (95% CI, 28–46); negative predictive value, 54 (95% CI, 50–58); accuracy, 47%; positive likelihood ratio, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.53–1.03); negative likelihood ratio, 1.06 (95% CI, 1–1.12). The reproducibility of the test in this study was high (kappa index between readers, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.77–1).

In our emergency setting, we were not able to confirm that the commercial test is adequate to detect or exclude an abnormal first-trimester pregnancy.

### Predicting gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN): Is urine hCG the answer [^114w8NXu]? Gynecologic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Previous studies on the significance of hCG to predict gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) have been too small for robust conclusions to be reached. Our aim in this study was to analyze the significance of urine hCG in predicting GTN in a large population.

- **Methods**: Details of 3,926 patients were available for analysis. Information regarding age, dates of diagnosis and registration, urine hCG levels, antecedent pregnancy, and chemotherapy were prospectively collected and used for analyses. Patients were stratified into different groups according to urine hCG level (IU/L); 35% in all patients with urine hCG ≥ 500 IU/L. GTN developed in 70% of patients with complete mole and urine hCG ≥ 10,000 IU/L.

- **Conclusion**: Urine hCG is a sensitive test for GTN. The urine hCG level is a powerful prognostic indicator for GTN. Patients with partial mole could be safely discharged from the surveillance program once their hCG levels have normalized. Patients with urine hCG ≥ 249 IU/L, whether partial or complete molar pregnancy, appear to benefit from intensive surveillance. Prophylactic chemotherapy could be considered when there are problems with surveillance.

### Transient false-positive urine human chorionic gonadotropin in septic shock [^116gc5mv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Point-of-care testing for urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) allows rapid diagnosis of pregnancy and pregnancy-related disorders at the bedside. Urine hCG test kits use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technology and incorporate two types of monoclonal antibody in a sandwich structure. There have been case reports in a variety of disease states reporting interference with this method, leading to false-positive results.

We describe the case of a nonpregnant female presenting to the emergency department with septic shock secondary to severe colitis. Three sequential urine tests using the Clearview hCG test kit (Alere Limited, Stockport, United Kingdom) yielded positive results, whereas quantitative serum analysis was negative for hCG. This initial test result reverted to a true-negative result after 48 hours, suggesting the transient passage of an interferent into the urine at the time of initial testing. This may have been a molecule produced as part of the host inflammatory response or from bacterial synthesis of an interferent with hCG-like antigenic structure. It is important that clinicians are aware of the mechanisms and limitations of urine hCG testing and maintain a low threshold to undertake early serum hCG testing to confirm diagnosis.

### What serial hCG can tell you, and cannot tell you, about an early pregnancy [^1143nGXz]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The serial measurement of serum hCG concentrations is an important clinical tool used to differentiate normal from abnormal pregnancies. When hCG values are below the level at which ultrasonography can be diagnostic, comparing a patient's hCG dynamics to established expected curves of rise or fall can assist the clinician in deciding when to follow expectantly and when to intervene. However, this method has limitations and should never supersede clinical judgment based on symptoms or signs.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: executive summary [^113G9ta7]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for preeclampsia, more specifically with respect to screening for proteinuria, SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend suspecting significant proteinuria when urinary dipstick proteinuria is ≥ 1+.

### Guideline no. 460: Diagnosis and management of intrauterine early pregnancy loss [^112uiwwp]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for early pregnancy loss, more specifically with respect to hCG, SOGC 2025 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of β-hCG values alone to diagnose a normal intrauterine pregnancy. This is due to the overlap with non-viable intrauterine pregnancy, viable intrauterine pregnancy, and ectopic pregnancy.

### Acceptability and feasibility of community-based provision of urine pregnancy tests to support linkages to reproductive health services in Western Kenya: A qualitative analysis [^111P9a6w]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). High credibility.

The moderator asked participants about their preferred mode of counseling, either phone-based or through community health volunteers (CHV).

A respondent preferred being counseled and referred by phone, mentioning, "There are some things I cannot tell the CHV" (Woman, Turbo, Pre-intervention FGD #2). Conversely, another viewpoint expressed by a CHV was, "There are those who don't want you to try to even call them, they don't want their people to know" (CHV, Turbo, Post-intervention FGD #2).

A notable majority in the focus group discussions (FGDs) conveyed positive perceptions of CHVs and their crucial role as health leaders. CHVs articulated the immense value they found in delivering urine pregnancy tests (UPT), which not only provided a diagnostic service but possibly enhanced the trust in their skills. The provision of UPT fostered rewarding relationships with community members, equipping CHVs with skills and knowledge beneficial for improving community health and supporting their own families.

One community member reflected positively on the CHVs, stating, "[CHVs] are also respectful and of good morals and are up to task. They also visit and do follow-up on us and our children, whether we are sick or not. So, I can say they can be of great help to us" (Woman, Port Victoria, Pre-intervention FGD #1). Similarly, a CHV shared their experience, saying, "Whenever I was going, people referred to me as a Doctor. They believed that by providing the pregnancy test services to them, then I was a doctor" (CHV, Port Victoria, Post-intervention FGD #1).

Another CHV expressed satisfaction with the process: "We would like to give [UPT] out because they were good in the community and we also got to be educated" (CHV, Turbo, Post-intervention FGD #1).

### Reconsidering the use of urine drug testing in reproductive settings [^116QG7Zy]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Low credibility.

The urine drug test is ubiquitous within reproductive healthcare settings. Although the test can have evidence-based use for a patient and clinician, in practice, it is often applied in ways that are driven by bias and stigma, do not correctly inform decisions about clinical aspects of patient care, and cause devastating ripple effects through social and legal systems.

This paper proposes a framework of guiding questions to prompt reflection on:

- **The question**: The clinical team is trying to answer.
- **Whether a urine drug test answers the question at hand**.
- **Testing benefits versus risks**: How testing benefits compare with the associated risks.
- **Alternative tools**: A more effective tool for clinical decision-making if the urine drug test does not meet the standards for use.
- **Biases**: Individual and institutional biases affecting decision-making.

We demonstrate the use of this framework using three common uses of the urine drug test within abortion care and labor and delivery settings.

### Accuracy of a semi-quantitative urine pregnancy test compared to serum beta-hCG measurement: a possible screening tool for ongoing pregnancy after medication abortion [^112hHqVf]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

Medication abortion protocols commonly rely on ultrasound or serum hCG measurement to confirm completion. In order to explore the use of a urine-based test to screen for ongoing pregnancy, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of a recently developed semi-quantitative urine pregnancy test to serum beta-hCG testing.

- **Methods**: We evaluated the urine test with 97 women in early pregnancy at a hospital and private clinic in Mexico City. The results of the urine test (hCG level > 1000 IU/L) showed a sensitivity of 88.6% (95% CI 74.6–95.7%) and a specificity of 71.7% (95% CI 57.4–82.8%).

The reasonably high sensitivity of this urine test suggests it might be useful as a screening test to detect ongoing pregnancy after medication abortion. Future research should evaluate its utility in clinical follow-up protocols.

### Qualitative beta-hCG urine assays may be misleading in the presence of molar pregnancy: a case report [^112wBFhC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Molar pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy, with diagnosis typically confirmed by markedly elevated beta-hCG levels and a "snowstorm" appearance on pelvic ultrasound. Patients frequently present with a positive pregnancy test, vaginal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting. A 23-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department with a history of 7 weeks of intermittent vaginal bleeding and 1 hour of peri-umbilical abdominal pain. She reported that 7 weeks before this visit, she was diagnosed with a miscarriage. The bedside qualitative urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test we performed was negative; however, the quantitative serum hCG was markedly elevated. Ultrasound and operative findings confirmed the diagnosis of molar pregnancy. We conclude that rapid urine qualitative hCG assays may not be reliable in the presence of markedly elevated hCG levels found in molar pregnancy.

### Zenatane [^111TbMnc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory tests:

- **Pregnancy test**: Patients who can become pregnant must have two negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL before receiving the initial Zenatane prescription. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue qualification of the patient for Zenatane. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) must be done in a CLIA-certified laboratory. The interval between the two tests must be at least 19 days.

	- For patients with regular menstrual cycles, the second pregnancy test must be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of Zenatane therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for 1 month.

	- For patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, the second pregnancy test must be done immediately preceding the beginning of Zenatane therapy and after the patient has used two forms of contraception for 1 month.

- Each month of therapy, patients must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test. A pregnancy test must be repeated each month, in a CLIA-certified laboratory, prior to the patient who can become pregnant receiving each prescription.

### The role of urine pregnancy testing in facilitating access to antenatal care and abortion services in South Africa: A cross-sectional study [^115bPuPr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

This study is one of the few in sub-Saharan Africa to assess the relationship between access to urine pregnancy testing as a means of pregnancy confirmation and gestational age at presentation for pregnancy care. It has demonstrated that the timing of presentation is influenced by access to urine pregnancy testing. Obtaining a urine pregnancy test independently from a pharmacy is associated with a significant decrease in the gestational age at presentation for both antenatal care (AnC) and abortion. This is independent of other factors, including age, language, level of education, markers of socio-economic status, employment status, prior pregnancy, and knowledge of other reproductive health services.

While urine pregnancy tests are theoretically available at all public clinics in South Africa, including those involved in this study, participants who accessed a urine pregnancy test independently did so from a private sector pharmacy. Furthermore, a significant number of participants reported that during their pregnancy, they had been sent from a public clinic to purchase a pregnancy test at a private pharmacy and then return to the public clinic with the results before care could be initiated. This practice needs examination, as women should be able to access urine pregnancy testing free of charge at South African public clinics as part of routine care. Pharmacy urine pregnancy tests may be prohibitively expensive for many women. Additionally, this study has shown that sending pregnant women who have accessed public services to the private sector for pregnancy confirmation is an issue that warrants further investigation.

### First trimester bleeding: Evaluation and management [^1119Cf46]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for early pregnancy loss, particularly concerning hCG, the AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend using the initial β-hCG level when monitoring the rate of β-hCG increase in early pregnancy. In viable intrauterine pregnancies with initial β-hCG levels of 3,000 mIU/mL, there is a 99% chance that the β-hCG level will increase by at least 49%, 40%, and 33%, respectively, over 48 hours.

### Reducing false-positive pregnancy test results in patients with cancer [^114S2FXF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

To assess whether the use of a laboratory test specific for intact human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) would reduce the number of false-positive pregnancy test results, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: From October 21, 2014, to January 20, 2015, and April 1, 2015, to June 2, 2015, all serum samples sent for pregnancy screening at a large cancer center with a value of 5 milli-international units/mL or greater total β-hCG were frozen, stored, and then retested using intact hCG reagent. The study compared the accuracy of total β-hCG and intact hCG results for diagnosing clinically confirmed pregnancy. A negative test was defined as 14 milli-international units/mL or less, our institutional cutoff. Additionally, a cutoff of less than 5 milli-international units/mL was assessed as a historical cutoff to rule out pregnancy.

- **Results**: Intact hCG testing was performed on 64 patient samples, of which 34 had originally tested positive when examined for total β-hCG. This included 21 cases of clinically confirmed pregnancy and 13 false-positive cases. No women were pregnant when their intact hCG concentration was 14 milli-international units/mL or less, and all pregnancies were detected at or above this concentration. Intact hCG reduced the number of false-positive pregnancy test results from 13 to 1, a 92% reduction (95% CI 64–99%), which corresponded to a reduction in the false-positive rate from 38% (95% CI 22–56%) to 3% (95% CI 1–15%).

- **Conclusion**: The use of intact hCG reagent in patients with cancer significantly reduces the rate of false-positive pregnancy test results without increasing the rate of false-negatives.

### Diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy: Green-top guideline No. 21 [^116mPbiN]. BJOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ectopic pregnancy, specifically in relation to serum hCG levels, the RCOG 2016 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of serum β-human chorionic gonadotrophin for the diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy.

### Obstetrical and perinatal outcomes of patients with methamphetamine-positive drug screen on labor and delivery [^1139CxpP]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence of methamphetamine use among reproductive-age women in the United States is increasing. Existing literature indicates an elevated risk of adverse maternal and neonatal health outcomes associated with methamphetamine use during pregnancy.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to investigate pregnancy outcomes in patients with recent methamphetamine use compared to patients who tested negative for methamphetamine at the time of delivery.

- **Study design**: A single-site retrospective cohort study was conducted from January to December 2015. Patients with documented urine drug screens during the delivery encounter were identified from electronic medical records. Outcomes for patients with methamphetamine-positive urine drug screens were compared to controls with negative screens. Maternal outcomes of interest included placental abruption, hypertensive disorders, premature preterm rupture of membranes, postpartum hemorrhage, and preterm birth. Utilization of prenatal care, social work consultations, and referrals to child protective services were also recorded. Neonatal outcomes measured included birthweight, neonatal intensive care unit length of stay, Apgar scores, and perinatal mortality.

- **Results**: The two groups had similar demographic characteristics, such as age, multiparity, and ethnicity, with the methamphetamine-positive group being more likely to have no or limited prenatal care. Both groups engaged in polysubstance use. A methamphetamine-positive urine drug screen at the time of delivery carried an increased risk of abruption [odds ratio, 5].

### Can women determine the success of early medical termination of pregnancy themselves [^115sRCkR]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

To determine the outcome of early medical termination of pregnancy (TOP) among women who choose a "self-assessment" follow-up, a study was conducted using a self-performed low-sensitivity urine pregnancy test with instructions on signs and symptoms that mandate contacting the TOP service.

- **Study design**: A retrospective review of computer databases covered 1,726 women choosing self-assessment after early medical TOP (< 9 weeks) in the UK. The main outcome measures were (a) number of women choosing self-assessment, (b) contact rates with TOP service, and (c) time to presentation with an ongoing pregnancy (failed TOP).

- **Results**: Ninety-six percent of women having an early medical TOP and going home to expel the pregnancy chose self-assessment. Two percent of women made unscheduled visits to the TOP service. One hundred and eighty-eight women (11%) telephoned the service about concerns related to complications or the success of treatment. There were eight ongoing pregnancies (0.5%; 95% confidence interval 0.2–0.9%). Four were detected within 4 weeks of treatment; the remainder were not detected until after one or more missed menses following the procedure.

- **Conclusions**: Most women having an early medical TOP, who go home to expel the pregnancy, choose self-assessment. Relatively few women make unscheduled visits or telephone the TOP service. Most ongoing pregnancies are recognized at an early stage, although late presentation (as with all methods of follow-up) does still occur.

### Urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio in pregnant women after dipstick testing: Prospective observational study [^1156fmNa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Postpartum urine samples were more dilute than those obtained antepartum, as indicated in Table 3. In the 178 women for whom both ante- and postnatal urine samples were available, [Cr] was significantly lower for postnatal urine samples than for those obtained antenatally. Although not statistically significant, the frequency of SPIP among urine samples with negative/equivocal dipstick test results was higher for postnatal than antenatal urine samples (28% [25/89] vs. 16% [7/43], respectively, P = 0.1933), suggesting that false negative dipstick test results were more likely to occur postpartum than antepartum.

Table 3: Comparison between antenatal and postnatal urine samples

- **178 paired urine samples from 178 women were analyzed**. GW, gestational week; NA, not applicable; [P], protein concentration; [Cr], creatinine concentration; and SPIP, significant proteinuria in pregnancy.

- **Note**: P < 0.05 vs. antenatal samples.

Finally, the associations between reasons for the first P/Cr test and P/Cr test results were examined (Table 4). Reasons for the first P/Cr test were specified in 1028 (99.5%) of the 1033 women enrolled in the study. At the first P/Cr test, hypertension was already confirmed in 222 (22%) but not in 806 (78%) of these 1028 women. Among women with similar dipstick test results, the risk of having SPIP was consistently and significantly higher for hypertensive than for normotensive women: 18% (14/77) vs. 3.2% (8/251) for negative/equivocal dipstick test result, 47% (26/55) vs. 8.7% (37/425) for 1+ dipstick test result, and 91% (82/90) vs. 59% (44/75) for ≥ 2+ dipstick test result.

### The role of urine pregnancy testing in facilitating access to antenatal care and abortion services in South Africa: a cross-sectional study [^1135NG8Q]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

The median gestational age at first presentation was 23 weeks (inter-quartile range (IQR) 18–27) for antenatal care (AnC) clients. Only 9 AnC clients (5.8%) presented in the first trimester. The median gestational age at presentation for abortion clients was 13 weeks (IQR 9–15).

For the majority of participants (AnC: n = 87, 55%; abortion: n = 94, 57%), confirmation of pregnancy and the first pregnancy-related healthcare visit occurred outside public health services. AnC clients attended a median of 2 other health facilities before presenting at the public clinic to initiate pregnancy care, while abortion clients attended a median of 2.5 other facilities.

Twenty-seven percent (n = 43) of AnC clients and 38% (n = 63) of abortion clients independently obtained a urine pregnancy test at a private pharmacy during this pregnancy. Additionally, many participants reported that during this pregnancy, they had been sent from a public clinic to purchase a pregnancy test at a pharmacy and then return to the public clinic with the results before care would be initiated (AnC clients: n = 21, 13%; abortion: n = 59, 36%). Importantly, in all clinics where women reported this practice, providers reported that pregnancy tests were available (data not shown).

### Hemorrhagic shock from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy in a patient with a negative urine pregnancy test result [^115iRgDd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy has been increasing in frequency over the past two decades. The sudden rupture of a fallopian tube caused by ectopic pregnancy can lead to hemorrhagic shock and death if not diagnosed and treated in a timely fashion. The emergency physician is often the health professional called upon to make the diagnosis and coordinate timely and effective intervention.

The first step in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy is demonstrating pregnancy via a rapidly performed and sensitive qualitative urine test for the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG). A negative urine pregnancy test result will generally be used to exclude ectopic pregnancy from further consideration.

This report discusses a patient presenting to an emergency department with hypovolemic shock, alongside two negative urine beta-hCG analysis results and a quantitative serum beta-hCG level of 7 mIU/mL. This value is less than the lower limit of detection for the highly sensitive qualitative urine and serum tests. This case report highlights the importance of further considering the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in the presence of a negative urine pregnancy test result.

### Rate of detection of unsuspected pregnancies after implementation of mandatory point-of-care urine pregnancy testing prior to hysterosalpingography [^1118tWvm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the rate of detection of unsuspected pregnancies after the implementation of mandatory point-of-care urine pregnancy testing before hysterosalpingography (HSG).

At the authors' institution, HSGs are scheduled to occur during days 8 to 12 of the menstrual cycle. Upon arrival in the radiology department, all women undergo point-of-care urine pregnancy testing before HSG (at a cost of $1.25 per test). Urine pregnancy test results were retrospectively reviewed.

Four hundred ten women (mean age, 25.9 years; range, 22–50 years) underwent point-of-care urine pregnancy testing before HSG between October 2010 and July 2012. Study indications were infertility evaluation (90.7% [372 of 410]) and tubal patency assessment after placement of tubal occlusive devices (9.3% [38 of 410]). Two positive urine pregnancy test results (0.5%) were recorded. One positive result was deemed a false-positive because the patient had received an intramuscular injection of β-human chorionic gonadotropin before the scheduled HSG, and follow-up laboratory testing showed declining β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels. The second positive result was a true-positive, and the patient was determined to be 4.5 weeks pregnant on the date of the scheduled HSG.

One of 410 women presenting for HSG was found to have an unsuspected early pregnancy, which was detected with a point-of-care urine pregnancy test. Consideration should be given to routine pregnancy testing of women before HSG because scheduling on the basis of the menstrual cycle alone might miss early pregnancies.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: Executive summary [^112fVC2m]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for preeclampsia, specifically concerning the screening for proteinuria, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining more definitive testing for proteinuria, such as a urinary protein:creatinine ratio or a 24-hour urine collection, when there is a suspicion of preeclampsia. This includes circumstances of ≥ 1+ dipstick proteinuria in patients with hypertension and rising blood pressure, as well as in patients with normal blood pressure but with symptoms or signs suggestive of preeclampsia.

### Urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio in pregnant women after dipstick testing: Prospective observational study [^1164qJiX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

The dipstick test is widely used as a primary screening test for the detection of significant proteinuria in pregnancy (SPIP). However, it often shows a false positive test result. This study was performed to determine which pregnant women should be recommended to undergo determination of urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (mg/mg, P/Cr test) after the dipstick test for confirmation of SPIP.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter, prospective, and observational study of 2212 urine specimens from 1033 pregnant women who underwent simultaneous dipstick and P/Cr tests in the same spot urine samples at least once. SPIP was defined as P/Cr > 0.27. Preeclampsia was diagnosed in women with both hypertension and SPIP.

- **Results**: Preeclampsia, hypertension alone, and SPIP alone developed in 202 (20%), 73 (7.1%), and 120 (12%) women, respectively. Creatinine concentration [Cr] varied greatly, ranging from 8.1 to 831 mg/dL in the 2212 urine samples. The rate of positive dipstick test results increased with increasing [Cr], while SPIP prevalence rate was lower in urine samples with higher [Cr], yielding higher false positive rates in samples with higher [Cr]. Postpartum urine samples had significantly lower [Cr] compared to those obtained antepartum (60 [8.7–297] vs. 100 [10–401] mg/dL, respectively). At the first P/Cr test among women with similar dipstick test results, the risk of having SPIP was consistently and significantly higher for hypertensive women than for normotensive women at any dipstick test result: 18% (14/77) vs. 3.2% (8/251), 47% (26/55) vs. 8.7% (37/425), 91% (82/90).

### Exclusion of pregnancy in dialysis patients: Diagnostic performance of human chorionic gonadotropin [^112SMuFo]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Pregnancy can be diagnosed or excluded by measuring human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels in urine or serum. hCG is a heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone composed of an alpha subunit and a specific beta subunit. The hCG alpha subunit is identical to the alpha subunit of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and, before release into circulation, the alpha and beta subunits are non-covalently bound.

Human chorionic gonadotropin is typically secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta, but may also be produced by trophoblastic and gastrointestinal tumors. The primary functions of hCG include maintaining progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum until the placenta assumes this role after approximately 6 weeks of gestation. Additionally, hCG stimulates gonadal testosterone secretion in the male fetus.

In both men and women, trace amounts of hCG primarily originate from the anterior pituitary gland. Approximately 8% of menopausal women exhibit elevated serum concentrations of pituitary-origin hCG exceeding 5 mIU/mL. A higher cutoff of 14 mIU/mL is recommended for women over 55 years of age.

### National outpatient sexually transmitted infection testing in pregnant patients in the United States [^117BJrLd]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continue to increase in the United States, and pregnant patients who acquire STIs are at risk for serious complications. This study estimated the utilization of preventative STI testing among pregnant outpatients on a national scale.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study of outpatient visits in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2014 to 2016 and 2018 to 2019. All patients reported as pregnant were included to assess STI testing for chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis, and HIV. STI testing was described per 1,000 total visits overall and by subpopulations. Data weights were applied to generate national estimates.

- **Results**: Over 177 million visits were included, of which 87.5 per 1,000 included an STI test. Chlamydia testing was the most common, followed by HIV, gonorrhea, and hepatitis (58.0 vs. 42.3 vs. 41.5 vs. 20.3 per 1,000). STI testing rates varied across subpopulations (72.1–236.6 per 1,000 visits). Patients of Hispanic ethnicity, Black race, aged ≤ 25 years old, and those seen by an obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) provider had the highest rates of STI testing.

Independent predictors of STI testing included Black race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.24, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.23–2.24), first trimester (aOR: 5.15, 95% CI: 5.14–5.16), government and private insurance (aOR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.89–1.91 and aOR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.69–1.71), and an OB/GYN provider specialty (aOR: 2.93, 95% CI: 2.93–2.94). STI testing in United States outpatient physician offices varied by subpopulations.

### Noninvasive prenatal testing in the general obstetric population: Clinical performance and counseling considerations in over 85 000 cases [^114URiSY]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

The increasing clinical utilization of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) within the general prenatal screening population has prompted considerable discussion focused on the importance of communicating appropriate test metrics. Several professional societies have called for ongoing reporting of NIPT clinical test performance metrics. As this is still a relatively new area in the prenatal field, with available assays continually updated and improved, it is important to continue reporting on the performance metrics of these NIPT assays.

As NIPT transitions from being a high-risk pregnancy screening test to a screening tool for both high-risk and low-risk women, reporting on the test's performance in this changing patient population is essential. Since the first clinical experience publication, this NIPT has undergone several important validated updates of sequence chemistry and proprietary algorithms. These updates aim to reduce failure rates and false-positive rates of the test, resulting in improved performance of the test offered in the clinical laboratory.

In this study, we compared our recent clinical experience with our initial experience to communicate improvements in test performance and describe the change in the clinical population of patients undergoing NIPT since its introduction. Furthermore, we used these updated metrics to develop a positive predictive value (PPV) clinical counseling tool.

### First trimester screening can predict adverse pregnancy outcomes [^1112VDUT]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

There has been an increasing drive over the last two decades to push the detection of women at risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes into the first trimester. This has led to a plethora of techniques, risk assessments, and biomarkers, both fascinating and bewildering in their breadth. Despite the vast amount of knowledge available, it is often difficult to determine what is practicable and valuable for clinical practice. This is especially true as earlier diagnosis does not necessarily equate to improved outcomes for mother and child.

We suggest that, at least for preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, spontaneous preterm birth, and gestational diabetes, there are effective first trimester tests available to identify the women at risk of subsequently developing complications. Unfortunately, there are no currently reliable first trimester tests available for identifying women at risk of stillbirth. It is likely that this field will continue to develop over time, and we hope that new and better strategies will continue to emerge to target these clinically important pathologies.

### Urine drug screening on labor and delivery [^116YfnmN]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Low credibility.

Substance use, including opioids, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates during pregnancy, is harmful for the pregnant person and the fetus. Routine screening using validated questionnaires is recommended, but often biological sampling is done instead. There is often bias in urine drug screening on labor and delivery units.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to compare characteristics of people who did and did not receive urine drug screening during labor and delivery and to examine the relationship of maternal results to neonatal results.

- **Study design**: This was a retrospective chart review examining all people in 2017 who delivered in the labor and delivery unit at our institution. We collected urine drug screening result information, maternal demographic data, follow-up after positive maternal tests, and neonatal test results. Individual characteristics and obstetrical outcomes were analyzed.

- **Results**: Of 6,265 deliveries, 297 urine drug screening tests were ordered. People who were tested identified most commonly as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (p < 0.0001). The most common indications for ordering tests were a history of substance use and insufficient prenatal care (p < 0.0001). People who tested positive were more likely to self-identify as White (P = 0.03) and have a history of substance use (p < 0.0001). Among the positive test results, 24 (24%) were caused by a provider-ordered medication. Self-identification as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander was not predictive of a positive result. Of the tested people, 36% (108/297) had a positive result on preliminary tests.

### Urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio in pregnant women after dipstick testing: Prospective observational study [^112hQwHY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

The dipstick test is widely used as a primary screening test for the detection of significant proteinuria in pregnancy (SPIP). However, it often shows a false positive test result. This study was performed to determine which pregnant women should be recommended to undergo determination of urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (mg/mg, P/Cr test) following a dipstick test for confirmation of SPIP.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study of 2212 urine specimens from 1033 pregnant women who underwent simultaneous dipstick and P/Cr tests in the same spot urine samples at least once. SPIP was defined as P/Cr > 0.27. Preeclampsia was diagnosed in women with both hypertension and SPIP.

- **Results**: Preeclampsia, hypertension alone, and SPIP alone developed in 202 (20%), 73 (7.1%), and 120 (12%) women, respectively. Creatinine concentration [Cr] varied greatly, ranging from 8.1 to 831 mg/dL in the 2212 urine samples. The rate of positive dipstick test results increased with increasing [Cr], while the SPIP prevalence rate was lower in urine samples with higher [Cr], yielding higher false positive rates in samples with higher [Cr]. Postpartum urine samples had significantly lower [Cr] compared to those obtained antepartum (60 [8.7–297] vs. 100 [10–401] mg/dL, respectively). At the first P/Cr test among women with similar dipstick test results, the risk of having SPIP was consistently and significantly higher for hypertensive women than for normotensive women at any dipstick test result: 18% (14/77) vs. 3.2% (8/251), 47% (26/55) vs. 8.7% (37/425), 91% (82/90).

### Acceptability and feasibility of community-based provision of urine pregnancy tests to support linkages to reproductive health services in Western Kenya: A qualitative analysis [^115LLeBT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Some women are deceitful; they will test themselves frequently because they might be cheating. (Male Participant, Turbo, Pre-intervention FGD #2)

Many CHVs and non-CHV participants thought CHVs should try to prevent abortions for various reasons, including religious beliefs, fears around unsafe abortions, and the illegality of abortion in Kenya. However, some participants voiced their support for safe abortion:

- **Support for safe abortion**:
	"It should be made clear to the parents and these women that the kit has not been provided for promoting ill doings like abortion but for better things like early detection of pregnancy for better and early management and treatment". (Woman, Port Victoria, Pre-intervention, FGD #1)

	"If their only option was to do abortion, then it should be a safe abortion". (CHV, Port Victoria, Post-intervention FGD #2)

	"I counselled her, telling her the effects of abortion and the importance of children, and she decided to keep the baby". (CHV, Turbo, Post-intervention FGD #2)

There were also stories where a CHV conducted repeat follow-up visits to provide counselling that may have been against women's wishes or in ways that violated women's privacy. These stories were usually in the context of an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy. Although it was often unclear what happened during counselling from a CHV in these circumstances, sometimes (but not always or explicitly) the follow-up visits may have been an effort to prevent abortion:

Respondent 1: "For the one who the pregnancy test results came positive and she has refused to be counselled, on my side if she is married you can… "

### Office-based urinalysis: A comprehensive review [^113jyM3S]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Comprehensive urinalysis involves inspection of the urine, dipstick chemical analysis, and microscopy and can be performed in the office setting. When testing for a urinary tract infection, midstream urine should be collected using the clean-catch technique. A urine collection bag specimen can be used for clinically stable febrile infants with suspected urinary tract infection; however, the presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrites warrants more invasive urine collection. Urine specific gravity shows hydration status. Urinary pH levels can indicate diet, metabolism, or the presence of stones. Bilirubin and urobilinogen may suggest hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Glucosuria often indicates uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and ketones suggest illness and inadequate nutrition. Hematuria on dipstick testing can be confirmed in the office using a spun urine sample. Proteinuria on dipstick testing should be followed by a quantitative test such as a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio. In patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, the presence of nitrites is more specific for bacterial infection, and a positive leukocyte esterase result may occur from inflammation and infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often unnecessarily treated in older patients. Without symptoms of urinary tract infection, urine culture is useful only in pregnancy and preparation for endoscopic urologic procedures.

### The role of urine pregnancy testing in facilitating access to antenatal care and abortion services in South Africa: a cross-sectional study [^111Kh9Bq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Given the proven major clinical benefit and public health impact of early presentation for antenatal care (AnC) and abortion services, strategies to decrease gestational age at presentation for pregnancy care, such as the increased use of urine pregnancy testing, should be given priority. Urine pregnancy testing is inexpensive, not staff-intensive, and logistically simple to implement. The implementation of urine pregnancy testing services has the potential to improve both maternal and neonatal health by decreasing gestational age at presentation for AnC and abortion services among women who are pregnant, as well as by channeling non-pregnant women who wish not to become pregnant into contraceptive care.

### Novel use of a urine pregnancy test using whole blood [^114mf7P2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 35-year-old woman with hypotension and abdominal tenderness following acute vomiting and syncope. The patient, who had been breastfeeding since giving birth 8 months earlier, was not menstruating and believed she was having a reaction to sushi. She was unable to provide a urine sample during the initial evaluation; therefore, a drop of whole blood was applied to a qualitative urine human chorionic gonadotropin point-of-care test. This test result was positive for pregnancy. Ultrasound revealed free fluid in the abdominal cavity, and an emergency laparotomy confirmed ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Often, patients are too unstable or dehydrated to provide a urine sample, and serum human chorionic gonadotropin testing can be difficult to obtain promptly. This novel use of the point-of-care urine qualitative test has not been previously described and may be valuable in cases where rapid diagnosis is critical.

### Evaluation of a urinary test as a diagnostic tool of a nonprogressive pregnancy [^116bfQ2C]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

To evaluate the performance of a one-step test detecting intact hCG and free β-hCG isoforms in the urine of pregnant women to diagnose an abnormal pregnancy, a prospective study was conducted. This study took place in emergency gynecology departments within teaching hospitals. A total of 526 patients were enrolled, with 272 not pregnant and 254 pregnant.

The main intervention involved a semiquantitative determination of intact urinary hCG in women, both supposedly not pregnant and pregnant, who presented with vaginal bleeding and/or vaginal pain between 5 and 8 weeks of amenorrhea.

- **Results**:
	- The sensitivity and specificity of the urine test for diagnosing nonpregnancy were both 100% (252/252 for sensitivity and 272/272 for specificity). For diagnosing ectopic pregnancy (EP), the sensitivity was 97% (32/33) and specificity was 83% (142/171). The negative predictive value was 99.3% (142/143). In diagnosing miscarriage, the sensitivity was 89.6% (43/48) and specificity was 83% (142/171), with a negative predictive value of 96.6% (142/147).

- **Conclusions**:
	- Abnormal pregnancies, such as an EP or a miscarriage, can be rapidly detected with the one-step test for intact hCG and free β-hCG isoforms. When ultrasound cannot confirm the localization and/or evolution of a pregnancy, using this test helps in reducing medical supervision and the necessity for repeated quantification of hCG.

### Should the qualitative serum pregnancy test be considered obsolete [^114yW55X]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Qualitative and quantitative serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests are used to diagnose pregnancy. We assessed physicians' perceptions and compared turnaround times (TATs) and performance characteristics of both tests. We surveyed 1,058 physicians about their perceptions of hCG tests. Seven months of TAT data were analyzed, and hCG was measured in all qualitative samples. Pregnancy status was determined by chart review.

Of the physicians surveyed, 183 responded. Forty-nine percent preferred qualitative over quantitative serum tests for determining pregnancy status. Physicians were willing to wait 45 minutes for results from either test. Qualitative tests are performed faster than quantitative tests, but TATs were not significantly different when sample transport time was considered. The negative predictive value of both tests was 99.9%. Qualitative serum hCG testing could be replaced by quantitative hCG tests, but there is no clear advantage to doing so.

### Postdates and antenatal testing [^112Capdj]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

The standard definition of a prolonged pregnancy is 42 completed weeks of gestation. The incidence of prolonged pregnancy varies depending on the criteria used to define gestational age at birth. It is estimated that 4 to 19% of pregnancies reach or exceed 42 weeks of gestation. Several studies that have used very large computerized databases of well-dated pregnancies have provided insights into the incidence and nature of adverse perinatal outcomes, such as increased fetal and neonatal mortality, as well as increased fetal and maternal morbidity in prolonged pregnancy.

Fetal surveillance may be employed in an attempt to monitor the prolonged pregnancy while awaiting the onset of spontaneous labor. This article reviews the different methodologies and protocols for fetal surveillance in prolonged pregnancies. On one hand, false-positive tests commonly lead to unnecessary interventions that are potentially hazardous to the gravida. On the other hand, as of the time of writing, no program of fetal testing has been shown to completely eliminate the risk of stillbirth.

### Comprehensive recommendations for the clinical management of pregnant women with noninvasive prenatal test results suspicious of a maternal malignancy [^111BB5ri]. JCO Oncology Practice (2024). Low credibility.

In this article, we defined comprehensive recommendations for the clinical follow-up of pregnant women with a malignancy-suspicious NIPT result, based on the vast experience with population-based NIPT screening programs in two European countries, complemented with published large data sets. These recommendations provide a tool for classifying NIPT results as malignancy-suspicious and guide health care professionals in structured clinical decision-making for the diagnostic process of pregnant women who receive such a malignancy-suspicious NIPT result.

### The role of urine pregnancy testing in facilitating access to antenatal care and abortion services in South Africa: A cross-sectional study [^114VYzgg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Providers need to be armed with clear guidelines and protocols for urine pregnancy testing. These protocols need to clarify that urine pregnancy testing is an on-site, public sector health service, when pregnancy tests should be done and by whom, and the appropriate referrals for and management of clients with positive and negative pregnancy test results.

An appreciable number of providers held negative views about conducting pregnancy testing for teenage clients and about promoting pregnancy testing more generally. These findings indicate the need for values clarification workshops with providers so that they are able to understand the individual, public health, and health care resource-related benefits of early pregnancy confirmation and are thus better equipped to provide pregnancy testing services to all clients irrespective of their personal views.

A substantial proportion of women who are ultimately cared for in the public sector confirm their pregnancy in the private sector. Better public-private interaction is critical to ensuring that these women receive optimal and timely care. Public sector program managers need to inform private sector providers of the problem of late pregnancy confirmation and the appropriate public sector referral routes if test results are positive or negative.

Healthcare providers voiced concerns that if pregnancy testing is promoted, public sector services will be overwhelmed by clients requesting pregnancy tests, and clients cited long clinic waits as a barrier to obtaining pregnancy testing.

### Pathology consultation on human chorionic gonadotropin testing for pregnancy assessment [^117WL1B7]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study are to provide clarity on the use of qualitative and quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests for pregnancy assessment. A case scenario and a brief review of the relevant literature describe clinical and analytical considerations regarding hCG testing.

In pregnancy, hCG is nearly always detectable in serum and urine within 16 days after ovulation. Serial hCG testing is valuable in evaluating suspected ectopic pregnancy. It is important to note that hCG assays vary in their analytical specificity, and qualitative tests may be less analytically sensitive than claimed. Erroneous hCG test results can occur for several reasons.

hCG assays are reliable diagnostic tests for pregnancy assessment, but a clear understanding of their limitations is essential for appropriate result interpretation.

### Accuracy of prenatal and postnatal biomarkers for estimating gestational age: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pWyTa]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

The assessment of risk of bias in each included study was independently conducted by two authors using a modified version of the QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies)-2 tool. Disagreements in risk of bias assessment were resolved through consensus. We evaluated five domains believed to be important for the quality of studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers for estimating gestational age (GA). Each domain was scored as "low risk", "high risk", or "unclear risk" of bias.

- **Study design**: "Low risk of bias" implies pregnant women or newborns were consecutively or randomly selected, and a prospective cohort design was used. "High risk of bias" involves convenience sampling (arbitrary or non-consecutive recruitment) or a retrospective cohort design.

- **Description of the biomarker**: "Low risk of bias" requires that the study report include a detailed description of the biomarker(s) assessed, including sampling site, assay used, manufacturer of the assay, GA at which the sample was collected (for prenatal biomarkers), age at testing in hours after birth (for postnatal biomarkers), and frequency of testing. "High risk of bias" applies if this information was not reported.

- **Reference standard**: "Low risk of bias" involves GA established by early ultrasound measurement of fetal crown-rump length (between 8+0 weeks and 13+6 weeks), or by the woman's last menstrual period (LMP) corroborated by early ultrasound, or by the woman's LMP that was in agreement (within 7 days) with ultrasound measurements performed later in the pregnancy, or by certain ovulation indicators.

### Accuracy of a point-of-care test for quantifying human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in the management of pregnancy of unknown location in an abortion service [^113RL99M]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2019). Low credibility.

Women may seek an abortion at gestational stages when there is no visible intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound scanning. Clinical protocols for pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) require measurement of serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommending that values above 1500 IU/L be further investigated to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Our aim was to determine whether a point-of-care test (POCT) could be used instead of laboratory serum hCG measurement.

- **Methods**: Over 12 months, women who presented to an abortion service with a PUL had a POCT for blood or urine hCG and laboratory serum hCG measurement. The POCT machine used provides a discrete hCG value below 1000 IU/L and above this gives results as a range. The sensitivity and specificity of the POCT in identifying cases where laboratory serum hCG results were above 1500 IU/L were calculated.

- **Results**: A total of 118 women presented with a PUL, of whom 70 had a POCT on blood (n = 49) or urine (n = 21) and a corresponding laboratory serum hCG. The sensitivity of the blood POCT was 0.67 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.87) and the specificity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.99). The sensitivity of the urine POCT was 0.25 (CI 0.01 to 0.78) and the specificity was 0.94 (CI 0.69 to 0.99).

- **Conclusion**: Although both the blood and urine POCTs had a high level of specificity, neither test was acceptably sensitive. While promising, this POCT for hCG is not sufficiently reliable to replace laboratory serum hCG testing in the management of women with PUL in an abortion service.

### Urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio in pregnant women after dipstick testing: Prospective observational study [^114ziwRc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

The gold standard test for the determination of significant proteinuria in pregnancy (SPIP) is the confirmation of urinary protein loss ≥ 0.3 g/day in urine collected over 24 hours (24-hour urine test). However, the 24-hour urine test is inconvenient for both pregnant women and obstetric service providers, and it is sometimes difficult for pregnant women to collect 24-hour urine accurately. Since daily creatinine production reflects muscle mass and is eliminated solely by renal excretion, 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion also reflects muscle mass and remains relatively constant over time in a given person, ranging from 11.0 mg/kg/day to 25.0 mg/kg/day.

Using the urinary spot protein-to-creatinine ratio (P/Cr test) is currently recommended for evaluating protein loss per day outside pregnancy. The Australian Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy, the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy, and the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology have proposed the P/Cr test as an alternative to 24-hour urine collection, recommending a threshold of 30 mg/mmol (0.265 mg/mg). In Japan, confirmation by the P/Cr test is recommended in pregnant women with dipstick test results ≥ 1+ in the presence of hypertension, ≥ 1+ on two successive antenatal care visits, and ≥ 2+ even in the absence of hypertension. However, the rationale for this recommendation has not been examined in detail. Thus, it is unclear which pregnant women should be recommended to undergo confirmation of SPIP with the P/Cr test after obtaining positive dipstick test results.

This multicenter prospective observational study was designed to address this uncertainty.

### Secretion and excretion of human chorionic gonadotropin during early pregnancy [^117CZiWS]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to characterize the profiles of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secretion in blood and its subsequent excretion in urine during conceptive cycles that ended in successful pregnancy and in spontaneous abortion.

- **Design**: A prospective study.

- **Setting**: University fertility clinic and research laboratories.

- **Patients**: Healthy, spontaneously ovulating women with regular menses, no history of infertility, and either no male partner or an azoospermic partner.

- **Interventions**: Blood and urine samples were collected daily from 63 spontaneously ovulating women during 167 cycles of artificial insemination (AI) with donor semen. hCG concentrations were measured in blood and urine, and luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were measured in blood by immunoassay.

- **Main outcome measures**: Fecundity, the day of ovulation, the day of hCG detection, and the concentration of hCG on the day of detection in blood and urine.

- **Results**: In 62 conceptions detected, 14 resulted in clinical spontaneous abortion (CAB) and 8 resulted in early pregnancy loss (EPL). When successful pregnancies and pregnancy losses were compared, no significant differences existed between the days of hCG appearance in serum or in urine, the concentrations of hCG on the day of detection, or the incremental change in hCG concentration on the day of detection.

- **Conclusions**: These data validate the use of urinary hCG as a biomarker for assessing peri-implantation pregnancy events.

### Increased likelihood of pregnancy using an app-connected ovulation test system: A randomized controlled trial [^111JBxLc]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). High credibility.

The total number of pregnancies was determined by confirming the presence of hCG in the volunteer's urine through quantitative measurement of the urinary hCG concentration in the returned urine sample, which was available for all completed volunteers.

- **Efficacy endpoints**: The efficacy endpoints for each cycle were calculated using a Fisher's exact test 2×2 contingency table. The proportion of pregnant and not-pregnant volunteers in each arm after two cycles was calculated, and the odds ratio was calculated based on the formula: [Pt/(1−Pt)]/[Pc/(1−Pc)], where the proportion of pregnant volunteers in the control group = Pc, and the proportion of pregnant volunteers in the test group = Pt.

- **Time-to-conception analysis**: A Kaplan–Meier analysis was carried out to estimate the time-to-conception distributions in the two arms.

The study was approved by the SPD Ethics Committee on January 17, 2018 (protocol-0987), and all procedures were conducted in accordance with relevant regulations and guidelines.

### Effectiveness of antenatal screening of asymptomatic bacteriuria in reduction of prematurity and low birth weight: Evaluating a point-of-care rapid test in a pragmatic randomized controlled study [^112977ZK]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

- **Study population, sampling, eligibility, and enrolment**: The study population consisted of pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic of the hospital for their first antenatal check-up, regardless of trimester and gravida. Nearly 50 to 150 women visited the antenatal clinic daily and were first registered in an antenatal register. Participants were selected by simple random sampling using the Randomx Android mobile app, based on the line list of the register for that day. Consenting participants were evaluated clinically by a research team, consisting of a doctor and a lab technician, with any showing signs or symptoms of UTI being excluded. Participants who had consumed antibiotics in the preceding week were also excluded. The team aimed to enroll a maximum of ten participants per day, with an average of four participants per day on weekdays, until the required sample size was achieved. Identification details, antenatal history, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and clinical evaluation details were recorded in a pre-approved data collection format. A urine sample was collected in a sterile container from each participant.

- **Randomization and allocation concealment**: The urine samples were sequentially numbered before being sent to the microbiology laboratory. A computerized random allocation sequence was generated by Dr. Manish Gehani using Microsoft Excel's random number generation feature, which was concealed from the team members involved in enrolling and assessing participants in the antenatal clinic.

### Acceptability and feasibility of community-based provision of urine pregnancy tests to support linkages to reproductive health services in Western Kenya: a qualitative analysis [^116p1gS6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

The 2014–2030 Kenya Health Policy outlines several strategies to increase access to antenatal care (ANC) and family planning (FP). At the community level, the policy aims to create appropriate demand for healthcare services and establish strong links between communities and primary care services. Community-level efforts are organized around Community Health Units (CHUs), which are groups of households organized by village or sub-location. Within a CHU, health initiatives are directed by a Community Health Officer and executed by Community Health Volunteers (CHVs), who are members of the local community usually selected at community meetings. CHVs are the primary healthcare system agents responsible for linking women to ANC and FP in rural communities and, as such, are well-positioned to deliver interventions that support the uptake of these services.

One such intervention may be urine pregnancy testing (UPT). Many women in Kenya rely on imprecise symptoms like missed menstrual periods to identify pregnancies. Uncertainty in pregnancy status may contribute to delays in seeking ANC and initiating a hormonal method of FP. Data on the use of store-bought UPT in rural Kenya are limited, but anecdotal evidence from the study setting suggests UPTs are too expensive for many rural women to purchase regularly. Studies in other low- and middle-income countries suggest that point-of-care UPT provision by CHVs is a low-cost intervention that can contribute to earlier ANC initiation and FP uptake. However, no prior study has evaluated the impact of CHV-delivered UPT on ANC and FP uptake in Kenya.

### Racial differences in indications for obstetrical toxicology testing and relationship of indications to test results [^113YY4Nh]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Low credibility.

Despite illicit substance use in pregnancy occurring across all demographic groups, minority pregnant and delivering patients with a low income tend to undergo testing at a higher rate than their counterparts. National guidelines for indications do not exist, and the ordering of toxicology testing may be applied inequitably.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to evaluate whether any documented indications in a large cohort of patients were associated with a positive toxicology test and whether indications for urine toxicology testing were applied consistently to different demographic groups.

- **Study design**: This was a retrospective cohort study reviewing pregnant and delivering patients who underwent toxicology testing on obstetrical units at one institution from May 30, 2015, to December 31, 2018. Age, race, marital status, median income of residential ZIP code, indications for testing, and test results were collected for each patient by individual chart review. Indications included preterm complications (preterm prelabor rupture of membranes or preterm labor), abruption or hypertension, reported substance use, fetal complications, maternal complications, and none. Multivariate logistic regression models were analyzed for the association between indication and test result, and the likelihood of marijuana as the sole positive test result. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship of indication for testing with maternal race.

- **Results**: Among 20,274 births, 551 patients underwent toxicology testing during the study period. No indication for drug toxicology testing…

### Contraceptive counseling following in-clinic pregnancy test among women not expecting pregnancy in the next two years: Disparities by service delivery setting and sociodemographic characteristics [^114uwjQB]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

To compare the frequency of the provision of contraceptive counseling at the time of a clinical pregnancy test at family planning clinics to other clinical settings among women who wish to avoid pregnancy for the next two years or longer, a secondary data analysis was performed.

This study utilized data from the 2011–2017 National Survey of Family Growth. Logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between receiving contraceptive counseling and variables such as source of care, age, educational attainment, race/ethnicity, poverty status, marital status, insurance status, and pregnancy history among 1,790 women aged 15–44 who received in-clinic pregnancy tests and sought to avoid pregnancy for the next two years or longer.

Most clinical pregnancy tests were performed by private practices (52%), community health clinics (20%), and other clinical settings (19%); 8% were performed by family planning clinics. Family planning clinics more frequently provided contraceptive counseling with pregnancy tests than other clinical settings (78% at family planning clinics versus 62% at private doctor's offices and 49% at other settings; aOR = 0.45 [0.25, 0.82] and aOR = 0.26 [0.13, 0.52]).

Regardless of clinical setting, age, marital status, income, and pregnancy history, women were more likely to receive contraceptive counseling along with in-clinic pregnancy testing if they were Black (aOR = 1.84 [1.17, 2.90]). They were less likely to receive contraceptive counseling following an in-clinic pregnancy test if they had educational attainment higher than a high school education (aOR = 0.53 [0.34, 2.90]).

### Partial hydatidiform mole with false-negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin test in the emergency department [^117D7k13]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy) is a benign tumor of placental trophoblastic cells that release human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Several case reports have described complete hydatidiform moles with false-negative urine qualitative hCG tests. These negative pregnancy tests have been attributed to the hook effect. We report an unusual presentation of a partial mole and review an alternative explanation for the negative hCG test. As partial moles are usually not associated with a large proliferation of trophoblastic cells, levels of hCG are commonly less than 100,000 mIU/mL. The most common presentation of a hydatidiform mole is vaginal bleeding. Hydatidiform mole is associated with a risk of malignant transformation and disseminated disease.

- **Objective**: In a pregnant patient, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are common presentations. Molar pregnancy is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding that should be considered.

- **Case report**: A 47-year-old female presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Urine qualitative hCG was negative, and serum quantitative hCG was 1,094,950 mIU/mL. Pelvic ultrasonography showed a uterine cavity containing a soft-tissue mass with multiple cystic lesions, and the hydatidiform mole was extracted with suction curettage. Tissue pathology confirmed partial hydatidiform mole.

- **Conclusions**: In addition to the hook effect, we present another possible explanation for the false-negative test; namely, the inability of some assays to detect hCG-degradation products, which may be higher in clinical contexts such as these.
