## Question

Methadone QT prolong meds

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications prolong the QT interval when combined with methadone, how to monitor and manage the associated risk, and what alternatives to consider if the risk is high. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about methadone's intrinsic QT liability and dose-response. Then, I should verify which concomitant drug classes and exemplars meaningfully increase torsades risk. Next, I will review guideline-based ECG thresholds and monitoring cadence. After that, I need to check modifiable risk factors like electrolytes and CYP interactions. Finally, I will outline management strategies, including when to reduce dose, switch to buprenorphine, or escalate monitoring, and close with practical documentation and patient counseling points.

> Let me first confirm methadone's baseline risk profile. Methadone blocks the cardiac hERG (IKr) channel and prolongs ventricular repolarization in a concentration-related manner, with modeling suggesting roughly a 17 ms QTc increase per 1,000 ng/mL and a predicted 1–3% risk of QTc > 500 ms at doses around 160–200 mg/day, although clinical dose–QT correlations are weak and events can occur even at 30–40 mg/day when other risk factors are present [^112MWo7S] [^1147xgk4] [^111zNbpW]. Hold on, I should verify the regulatory signal: FDA labeling repeatedly warns of life-threatening QT prolongation and torsades, especially at higher doses, and emphasizes that concomitant QT-prolonging drugs and electrolyte disturbances are common contributors, so the intrinsic risk is real even if absolute event rates are low [^112SCC21] [^1179VeNf] [^112iEf7Q].

> Next, I should review which medication classes most consistently add risk when combined with methadone. Class IA and III antiarrhythmics, many antipsychotics (notably haloperidol, ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and several antidepressants (especially citalopram/escitalopram, tricyclics) are repeatedly flagged as high-risk co-medications with methadone in FDA and specialty guidelines, and citalopram carries a specific dose-limiting QT warning that underscores its hazard in this context [^113deT9a] [^111qgCu4] [^115AkAgx]. Wait, let me verify second-generation antipsychotics: quetiapine's label acknowledges postmarketing QT cases and advises avoiding combinations with other QT-prolonging agents, so even agents with less consistent signals warrant caution when layered onto methadone [^111cga56] [^116eNzb9].

> I will now examine antibiotics and antifungals. Macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and azole antifungals (fluconazole, ketoconazole) are well-established QT-prolonging culprits; case reports describe torsades when combined with methadone, and HIV guidance highlights macrolides and fluoroquinolones as problematic in patients on methadone, reinforcing the need to avoid or use alternatives when possible [^111RBcCV] [^115SHHRa]. Hold on, I should double-check oncology and HIV drug–drug interaction sources: ribociclib is explicitly contraindicated with methadone due to potent CYP3A4 inhibition plus direct QT prolongation, and several TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, imatinib) can increase methadone exposure and prolong QT, so these combinations demand enhanced ECG monitoring or avoidance if alternatives exist [^113ZgSu8].

> Let me consider other CNS and miscellaneous agents. Tricyclic antidepressants, certain SNRIs, and some anticonvulsants can prolong QT or destabilize electrolytes; benzodiazepines may not directly prolong QT but increase respiratory depression risk with methadone, complicating overall safety, and agents that cause bradycardia or electrolyte shifts (e.g., diuretics) indirectly amplify torsades risk in this setting [^113deT9a] [^113NZER4]. I should confirm that even agents with modest standalone QT effects can be consequential in polypharmacy; the AHA scientific statement on drug-induced arrhythmias emphasizes cumulative risk and the importance of identifying multiple modest contributors, which fits the methadone polypharmacy scenario [^114qdhoe].

> Next, I should review guideline-based ECG thresholds and monitoring cadence. Strong recommendations converge on avoiding methadone when QTc > 500 ms, considering alternatives when QTc is 450–500 ms, and correcting reversible causes before initiation. Baseline ECG is advised for patients with risk factors or prior QTc > 450 ms, with follow-up ECGs 2–4 weeks after initiation, after dose increases, and when dose milestones like 30–40 mg/day or 100 mg/day are reached, with annual monitoring once stable [^1126KSLa] [^114GEHp8] [^114eF93Z] [^114wXJEF]. Wait, let me verify OTP-specific guidance: SAMHSA-aligned recommendations similarly advise ECG at intake for patients with risk factors, repeat within 30 days, annually, and when doses exceed 120 mg/day, with explicit dose reduction or switching if QTc exceeds 500 ms, which aligns with pain-focused guidance [^112eoF3r].

> I need to ensure modifiable risk factors are addressed proactively. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are major precipitants of torsades; replete potassium to the high-normal range and correct magnesium before and during methadone therapy, and reassess after any dose escalation or addition of interacting drugs [^114DuDGd]. Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interaction mechanisms: methadone is metabolized by CYP3A4, 2B6, and others, so CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolides, some SSRIs, certain antiretrovirals) can raise methadone levels and QT risk; conversely, CYP3A4 inducers can precipitate withdrawal if methadone is reduced too quickly, complicating QT management during interaction adjustments [^116Ee21b] [^1149yzpx]. Let me reconsider pharmacogenetics: while CYP2B6 variants influence methadone pharmacokinetics, current evidence is insufficient to change ECG monitoring or titration practices, so clinical judgment and ECGs remain paramount [^111Wwo3E].

> Now, I should outline management when QTc is prolonged on methadone. If QTc ≥ 500 ms, immediately reduce the methadone dose or discontinue and repeat ECG after the change. If QTc is 450–500 ms, discuss risks and benefits, correct reversible factors, and increase monitoring frequency, with strong consideration of switching to buprenorphine, which lacks clinically meaningful QT prolongation at therapeutic doses [^113yRmcf] [^1126KSLa] [^112BjV2c]. But wait, what if the patient is on multiple QT-prolonging agents? The preferred approach is to stop or substitute the nonessential culprit(s) when feasible, replete electrolytes, and then re-evaluate QTc before making methadone dose changes, documenting the risk–benefit discussion and any shared decision-making if methadone must continue [^1126KSLa] [^112eoF3r].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, continue methadone to avoid relapse but consider split dosing in the third trimester and avoid unnecessary dose increases that raise QT risk. In palliative care, overly rigid ECG monitoring may force suboptimal opioid rotation and worsen pain, so individualize monitoring intensity to goals of care while maintaining safety thresholds [^1141dJga] [^113vjwQa]. For patients with repeated or unexplained syncope, palpitations, or seizures on methadone, obtain urgent ECG and electrolytes and review all QT-active agents. In select high-risk patients who must remain on methadone, cardiology input and even ICD consideration may be appropriate after torsades episodes, though this is rare and case-based [^1126KSLa] [^111CM8Ds].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical steps are explicit. Before initiating or escalating methadone, reconcile all medications using a QT risk tool, check and correct potassium and magnesium, obtain a baseline ECG when indicated, and schedule follow-up ECGs aligned with dose changes and risk factors. Counsel patients on arrhythmia symptoms and to seek urgent care for syncope or palpitations, and document the rationale if continuing methadone despite borderline QTc values after modifiable risks are addressed [^1126KSLa] [^112eoF3r]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach aligns with high-quality guidance: VA/DoD and ASAM recommendations support structured ECG monitoring tied to dose and risk, and FDA labeling reinforces the need to weigh benefits against QT risks and to monitor when interacting drugs are introduced, which operationalizes the plan above [^114GEHp8] [^114Lj6ZC] [^112SCC21].

Methadone prolongs the QT interval and can cause torsades de pointes, especially at higher doses or with other QT-prolonging drugs [^112SCC21]. Avoid methadone if QTc > 500 ms; if QTc is 450–500 ms, use caution and monitor closely [^114wXJEF] [^114eF93Z]. High-risk co-medications include **class IA/III antiarrhythmics** (quinidine, amiodarone, sotalol), **macrolides** (azithromycin, clarithromycin), **fluoroquinolones** (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), **antipsychotics** (haloperidol, ziprasidone), **SSRIs** (citalopram, escitalopram), and **others** (ondansetron, methadone itself) [^114qdhoe] [^111qgCu4] [^111cga56]. Baseline and periodic ECGs are recommended, with closer monitoring at higher doses or when adding QT-prolonging drugs [^1126KSLa] [^111m7ft7].

## Mechanism of methadone-induced QT prolongation

Methadone **blocks cardiac potassium channels** (notably IKr/hERG), delaying repolarization and prolonging the QT interval [^111zNbpW]. This effect is dose-related and worsened by co-administered QT-prolonging drugs or electrolyte abnormalities [^112SCC21].

---

## Medications that increase the risk of QT prolongation when combined with methadone

Several medication classes **significantly increase the risk of QT prolongation** when combined with methadone:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of QT prolongation** |
|-|-|-|
| Antiarrhythmics | - Quinidine <br/> - Amiodarone <br/> - Sotalol <br/> - Procainamide | Block cardiac potassium channels, prolonging repolarization [^114DuDGd] |
| Antibiotics | - Azithromycin <br/> - Clarithromycin <br/> - Ciprofloxacin <br/> - Levofloxacin | - Block potassium channels <br/> - Prolong QT interval [^114qdhoe] |
| Antipsychotics | - Haloperidol <br/> - Ziprasidone <br/> - Chlorpromazine <br/> - Thioridazine | - Block potassium channels <br/> - Prolong QT interval [^114qdhoe] |
| Antidepressants | - Citalopram <br/> - Escitalopram <br/> - Tricyclic antidepressants | - Block potassium channels <br/> - Prolong QT interval [^111qgCu4] |
| Antiemetics | - Ondansetron <br/> - Droperidol | - Block potassium channels <br/> - Prolong QT interval [^116GkXiE] |
| Other opioids | - Methadone itself <br/> - Levomethadyl acetate | - Block potassium channels <br/> - Prolong QT interval [^114qdhoe] |

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines provide clear recommendations for **monitoring and managing QT prolongation risk** in patients receiving methadone:

- **Baseline ECG**: Obtain a baseline ECG before initiating methadone therapy, especially in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation [^111wDEQy] [^1126KSLa].
- **Follow-up ECGs**: Repeat ECGs within 30 days of initiation, annually, and after any significant dose increase or addition of QT-prolonging medications [^111m7ft7] [^114PUHAp].
- **QTc thresholds**: Avoid methadone in patients with QTc > 500 ms. Use caution and closely monitor patients with QTc 450–500 ms [^114wXJEF] [^114eF93Z].
- **Electrolyte management**: Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) before and during methadone therapy [^114DuDGd].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

QT prolongation associated with methadone can lead to **life-threatening arrhythmias**, including torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death. Clinicians should:

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate patients for risk factors, including congenital long QT syndrome, electrolyte abnormalities, and concomitant QT-prolonging medications [^1147xgk4].
- **Dose adjustment**: Consider dose reduction or alternative therapies if QTc prolongation occurs during methadone therapy [^113yRmcf].
- **Patient education**: Inform patients about the risks of QT prolongation and the importance of adhering to monitoring protocols [^111m7ft7].

---

## Alternative medications

If QT prolongation risk is significant, consider **alternative medications** that do not significantly prolong the QT interval, such as buprenorphine for opioid use disorder or other opioids for pain management (e.g. morphine, oxycodone) [^112BjV2c] [^114NeiBo].

---

Methadone is associated with significant QT prolongation risk, especially when combined with other QT-prolonging medications. Clinicians should **carefully monitor patients**, manage risk factors, and consider alternative therapies to minimize the risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.

### A modeling and simulation approach to characterize methadone QT prolongation using pooled data from five clinical trials in MMT patients [^112MWo7S]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation were used to establish a link between methadone dose, concentrations, and Fridericia rate-corrected QT (QTcF) interval prolongation, and to identify a dose that was associated with increased risk of developing torsade de pointes. A linear relationship between concentration and QTcF described the data from five clinical trials in patients on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). A previously published population PK model adequately described the concentration-time data, and this model was used for simulation. QTcF was increased by a mean (90% confidence interval (CI)) of 17 (12, 22) ms per 1,000 ng/ml of methadone. Based on this model, doses > 120 mg/day would increase the QTcF interval by > 20 ms. The model predicts that 1–3% of patients would have ΔQTcF > 60 ms, and 0.3–2.0% of patients would have QTcF > 500 ms at doses of 160–200 mg/day. Our predictions are consistent with available observational data and support the need for electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and arrhythmia risk factor assessment in patients receiving methadone doses > 120 mg/day.

### A twist on torsade: a prolonged QT interval on methadone [^116tbFJU]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

A woman developed a prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes while on methadone treatment for heroin addiction. We think methadone, or its impaired metabolism, was the major cause for her prolonged QT interval and progression to torsade. However, torsade is often multifactorial, as was likely so in this case. We advise physicians treating patients taking methadone to obtain careful medication and drug-use histories, screen for risk factors associated with long QT syndrome, counsel patients about potential drug interactions, and measure the QT interval before and during methadone treatment in high-risk patients.

5.4 Life-Threatening QT Prolongation

Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. In most patients on the lower doses typically used for maintenance, concomitant medications and/or clinical conditions such as hypokalemia were noted as contributing factors. However, the evidence strongly suggests that methadone possesses the potential for adverse cardiac conduction effects in some patients. The effects of methadone on the QT interval have been confirmed in in vivo laboratory studies, and methadone has been shown to inhibit cardiac potassium channels in in vitro studies.

Closely monitor patients with risk factors for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, and those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction. QT prolongation has also been reported in patients with no prior cardiac history who have received high doses of methadone.

Evaluate patients developing QT prolongation while on methadone treatment for the presence of modifiable risk factors, such as concomitant medications with cardiac effects, drugs that might cause electrolyte abnormalities, and drugs that might act as inhibitors of methadone metabolism.

Only initiate methadone hydrochloride tablets therapy for pain in patients for whom the anticipated benefit outweighs the risk of QT prolongation and development of dysrhythmias that have been reported with high doses of methadone.

The use of methadone in patients already known to have a prolonged QT interval has not been systematically studied.

### Arrhythmogenesis and prolonged repolarization from synthetic opioids: finally sorted? [^111zNbpW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The synthetic opioid methadone has long been recognized to cause not only QT prolongation on ECG but also a predilection for torsade de pointes. Despite the limited distribution of the drug in comparison to other opioids, methadone use has been inordinately implicated in sudden death from ventricular arrhythmia. However, the full mechanistic scope of why this drug is arrhythmogenic has been unresolved.

It is well known that the majority of drug‐induced long QT and related proarrhythmia is due to inhibition of HERG, which has a promiscuously vulnerable molecular structure, allowing for drugs to directly block the channel or interfere with normal membrane trafficking. At first glance, methadone appears to fall in line with respect to HERG inhibition. Katchman et al. demonstrate HERG blockade with methadone that was significantly more potent than other synthetic opioids (eg, fentanyl or morphine). However, on further inspection, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was reported at 10‐fold higher dose than therapeutic free serum concentrations. Other puzzlingly features have been documented including a lack of consistent correlation between dose and QT interval. Moreover, torsade de pointes in methadone users has been shown to correlate low serum K+ levels and U waves. Interestingly, U waves are an ECG feature that correlate with a higher risk of torsade de pointes, particularly when present postextrasystole. These key features are noted to be implicated with loss of I K1, either genetic (Andersen‐Tawil Syndrome) or pharmacologic, rather than solely with HERG inhibition.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113KnXph]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP chronic non-cancer pain opioid prescribing — methadone use and monitoring: Given its unique risk profile, the CDC recommends that methadone not be used as a first line long-acting opioid formulation and that it should be prescribed by clinicians familiar with methadone's unique risk profile. The FDA recommends methadone dose not to exceed 30 mg per day, and low methadone may be started in doses as low as 2.5 mg, twice a day, with titration on a weekly basis to achieve appropriate pain relief. If methadone is prescribed, an electrocardiogram shall be obtained prior to initiation, at 30 days, and 6 to 12 months thereafter, with attention to QTc interval–affecting concomitant medications; methadone has torsadogenic potential, especially with other QT-prolonging drugs. Methadone is recommended for use after failure of other opioid therapies only if EKG and evaluation of QT intervals and drug interactions have been conducted and evaluated; commencing with low doses, with dose adjustments with repeat EKG performed at least 6–12 months thereafter, and only clinicians with specific training in methadone prescribing, use, and risk management should offer this agent for noncancer pain resistant to effects of other opioids. Evidence Level: Strong; Strength of Recommendation: Strong.

### Citalopram [^111qgCu4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes

Citalopram tablets cause dose-dependent QTc prolongation an ECG abnormality that has been associated with Torsade de Pointes (TdP), ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death, all of which have been observed in postmarketing reports for citalopram [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Because of the risk of QTc prolongation at higher citalopram tablet doses, it is recommended that citalopram tablets not be given at doses above 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Citalopram tablets should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure unless the benefits outweigh the risks for a particular patient. Citalopram tablets should also be avoided in patients who are taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Such drugs include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications, antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).

### Methadone for pain and the risk of adverse cardiac outcomes [^111EDVzQ]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2014). Low credibility.

Context

There are few studies that describe cardiac adverse events in patients prescribed methadone for pain management.

Objectives

To describe incident cardiac adverse events and risk factors for cardiac adverse events in primary care patients prescribed methadone for pain.

Methods

This was a retrospective, descriptive, cohort study in patients 18 years or older receiving methadone for pain management during 2010. Patients were followed for 12 months and were categorized as "chronic" or "non-chronic" methadone users. The primary outcomes were a cardiac event, at risk for an event, or neither. Patients were grouped on their outcome and were compared on risk factors and methadone monitoring.

Results

A total of 1246 patients were included. Thirty (2.4%), 628 (50.4%), and 588 (47.2%) patients had a cardiac event, were at risk for an event, or had neither an event nor a risk factor, respectively. Overall, the rate of QTc prolongation was 49.4% and the rate of adherence to recommended cardiac monitoring was 39.0%. Similar percentages of chronic and non-chronic users had a cardiac event (P > 0.05). Among the patients who had a cardiac event and were at risk for an event, factors independently associated with having had an event included age (odds ratio = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.03–1.09) and a dose 100 mg/day or higher (odds ratio = 6.18; 95% CI = 1.08–35.45).

Conclusion

Few cardiac adverse events resulting from methadone use for pain were detected. However, a large proportion of patients were at risk for an adverse event, especially patients who were older and had received ≥ 100 mg/day of methadone.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^113Yhfwc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Methadone and methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) in OTPs are characterized by long-standing evidence and dosing considerations: Decades of experience with methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) in OTPs have yielded significant evidence that methadone enhances treatment outcomes, and flexible dosage strategies are better than fixed dosage strategies for improving retention. Under usual practices, a stable target dose is > 60 milligrams (mg)/day, and many patients will require considerably higher doses to achieve a pharmacologic blockade of reinforcing effects of illicit opioids. The risk of relapse to opioid use from lower doses must be weighed against risks of adverse events such as sedation, constipation, hyperalgesia, prolongation of cardiac conduction, and torsade de pointes; torsade de pointes is often fatal, but extremely rare. Two studies found no correlation between methadone daily dose and corrected QT interval (QTc) (the heart rate corrected time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave), and other risk factors must be considered (e.g., history of heart disease and concurrent medications that also prolong QTc). The benefits of MMT also outweigh the harms for many secondary outcome measures, and evidence suggests methadone reduces the morbidity and criminality associated with heroin use, improves social engagement and vocational productivity, and prevents the spread of blood-borne diseases associated with sharing needles.

### Methadone safety: a clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society and College on Problems of Drug Dependence, in collaboration with the Heart Rhythm Society [^114FGTBi]. The Journal of Pain (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for methadone prescribing, more specifically with respect to general principles, APS/CPDD/HRS 2014 guidelines recommend to correct reversible causes of QTc interval prolongation before initiating methadone in patient with QTc interval between 450–500 ms.

### Methadone deaths: risk factors in pain and addicted populations [^113oGZSd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Methadone is highly effective in treating opioid dependence, and it is also used as an analgesic for second-line management of chronic pain. However, recent increases in methadone-related deaths have instigated controversy about the use of this medication. In this paper, we evaluate risk factors for methadone mortality in opioid dependent and pain populations and present guidelines for initiating methadone treatment in these two populations to minimize the risk of death. Early research with methadone-maintained patients revealed that methadone fatalities occur primarily due to respiratory arrest during methadone induction and in the context of polysubstance use. Recent reports of methadone deaths emphasize chronic pain populations, methadone-related QTc prolongation, and the possibility of inducing Torsade de pointes (TdP), a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Retrospective analyses of these deaths show that patients who develop TdP often present with multiple risk factors, including high methadone doses, use of other medications that cause QTc prolongation, and electrolyte abnormalities. To minimize fatalities, guidelines are presented for initiating methadone in opioid treatment and pain populations that consider the drug's pharmacology along with behavioral, medical and psychiatric risk factors.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113deT9a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methadone — indications, contraindications, cautions, and interactions: Methadone is frequently used to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms and is recommended for pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder. Methadone is contraindicated for patients with known hypersensitivity to methadone hydrochloride, those experiencing respiratory depression in the absence of resuscitative equipment or in unmonitored settings, patients with acute bronchial asthma or hypercapnia (also known as hypercarbia), and patients with known or suspected paralytic ileus. Methadone should be used with caution in patients with decompensated liver disease (e.g., jaundice, ascites) due to increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory insufficiency, concomitant substance use disorders — particularly sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorders — because interactions may be life-threatening, a current psychiatric diagnosis that may impair their ability to maintain daily attendance at an OTP, and in patients with low levels of physical dependence to opioids who should be started with low doses of methadone. Significant medication interactions include that methadone may prolong the QT interval and should be used in caution with other agents that may also prolong the QT interval, including class I or class III anti-arrhythmic drugs, calcium channel blockers, some antipsychotics, and some antidepressants, and that methadone is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway with many agents interacting with this pathway including alcohol, anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals, and macrolide antibiotics.

### Low-dose methadone added to another opioid for cancer pain: a multicentre prospective study [^116H7Hc8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is a prevalent symptom among cancer patients. As cancer progresses, nearly two-thirds of patients experience an exacerbation of pain. Overall, more than 40% of individuals with cancer endure moderate to severe pain, which can significantly affect their quality of life.

The management of cancer-related pain generally involves the combination of multiple drugs, with opioids as a key component of most therapeutic strategies. In some cases, pain relief is not achieved due to lack of efficacy or because of intolerable adverse reactions, defining refractory pain. Opioid rotation is frequently employed in such circumstances to improve pain relief while simultaneously managing opioid side effects.

Methadone is frequently utilised in opioid rotation due to its distinctive properties, including a rapid onset of action, prolonged effects, high oral bioavailability, and incomplete cross-tolerance with other opioids. These characteristics render it an optimal choice for opioid rotation.

However, methadone-based opioid rotation can pose challenges. The frequent need for high doses and the possibility of tissue accumulation carry the risk of overdose and QT lengthening-related cardiac complications. For these reasons, opioid rotation to methadone is usually conducted in specialised pain management units, where the objective of a stable pain control can be achieved with adequate safety.

Using methadone as co-analgesic with other opioids can improve its risk profile through dose reduction while preserving the benefits derived from its pharmacological specificities. This approach is increasingly considered in clinical practice, facilitating access to methadone-optimized analgesic treatment, including in outpatient settings.

To date, few studies — mostly retrospective — have assessed the safety and efficacy of low-dose methadone co-analgesia in cancer patients with moderate to severe cancer pain. We therefore designed a multicentre prospective observational study to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of low-dose methadone co-opiate analgesia in a real-world clinical setting.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^116MDKrB]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

WHY HOSPITALISTS AVOID OFFERING METHADONE FOR OPIOID WITHDRAWAL

Methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone are the three Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for OUD. Methadone is a schedule II-controlled substance and in US ambulatory settings, only Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) can dispense methadone — with few exceptions. Strict ambulatory regulations contribute to misconceptions about methadone's legality for opioid withdrawal treatment during hospitalization.

Methadone's pharmacology leads to concerns about patient safety. It is a long-acting opioid agonist, peaks at 3–4 h, has a half-life of 24 h, and reaches a steady state at 3–7 days. It requires a specific titration so that dose-stacking, oversedation, and overdose do not occur. Since the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) pathway primarily metabolizes methadone, its levels can increase or decrease in the setting of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. Methadone can also cause QTc prolongation at higher doses (> 100 mg/day) or in combination with other QTc prolonging medications.

Hospitalists also avoid methadone due to lack of addiction training and stigma toward patients with addiction. These reasons for avoiding methadone compound and result in hospitalists ignoring addiction, viewing it as outside the scope of hospital medicine, or leaving it to specialists to address resulting in low overall rates of treatment during hospitalization. –

5.3 Life-Threatening QT Prolongation

Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. In most patients on the lower doses typically used for maintenance, concomitant medications and/or clinical conditions such as hypokalemia were noted as contributing factors. However, the evidence strongly suggests that methadone possesses the potential for adverse cardiac conduction effects in some patients. The effects of methadone on the QT interval have been confirmed in in vivo laboratory studies, and methadone has been shown to inhibit cardiac potassium channels in in vitro studies.

Closely monitor patients with risk factors for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, and those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction. QT prolongation has also been reported in patients with no prior cardiac history who have received high doses of methadone.

Evaluate patients developing QT prolongation while on Methadone Hydrochloride treatment for the presence of modifiable risk factors, such as concomitant medications with cardiac effects, drugs which might cause electrolyte abnormalities, and drugs which might act as inhibitors of methadone metabolism.

Only initiate therapy with Methadone Hydrochloride in patients for whom the anticipated benefit outweighs the risk of QT prolongation and development of dysrhythmias that have been reported with high doses of methadone. The use of methadone in patients already known to have a prolonged QT interval has not been systematically studied.

5.4 Accidental Ingestion

Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Methadone Hydrochloride, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose. Keep Methadone Hydrochloride out of reach of children to prevent accidental ingestion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.5 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids

Methadone Hydrochloride contains methadone, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Methadone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. Opioid agonists are sought by and people with opioid use disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.

Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^114NeiBo]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular comorbidities

In patients with heart failure, particular care must be taken with methadone and caution should be used with morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. Some patients who are placed on chronic methadone therapy for pain management may be at increased risk for development of a prolonged QT interval or may already have a congenital QT prolongation. This could influence rotation to methadone as an alternative. The Cardiac Expert Panel of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) recommends the following: 1) informing patients of the arrhythmia risk associated with methadone; 2) asking about any history of structural heart disease, arrhythmia, and syncope; 3) obtaining a pretreatment electrocardiogram (ECG) for all patients to measure the QT interval and a follow-up ECG within 30 days and annually; 4) avoiding interactions between methadone and other drugs that possess QT interval–prolonging properties or slow the elimination of methadone; and 5) reducing or discontinuing methadone if the QT interval exceeds 500 milliseconds. Similar but less detailed precautions to avoid arrhythmias with methadone are recommended in the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) and American Pain Society (APS)/American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM) chronic noncancer pain guidelines.

Tramadol has been recommended ahead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for patients with significant cardiovascular riskand a similar case might be argued for tapentadol. Clinicians may also consider fentanyl, morphine, or oxycodone for these patients because none of these opioids is a significant cause of QT prolongation.–

Methadone — arrhythmia precautions and electrocardiogram (ECG) use: Patients should be informed of the potential risk of arrhythmia, a history of structural heart disease, arrhythmia, or syncope is recommended, and clinicians should assess other risk factors for QT interval prolongation; an ECG should be conducted for patients with significant risk factors including any prior ECG demonstrating a QTc > 450 milliseconds or a history suggestive of prior ventricular arrhythmia, ECG should also be considered in the presence of other risk factors such as high methadone doses, cardiac risk history, abnormal liver enzymes, electrolyte abnormalities, or QT‑prolonging medications, and despite no clear data on a threshold dose the consensus is that ECG should be considered for patients receiving over 120 mg per day, although there is no research on using ECG data to improve outcomes.

Cardiac Conduction Effects

Laboratory studies, both in vivo and in vitro, have demonstrated that methadone inhibits cardiac potassium channels and prolongs the QT interval. Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction.

Methadone should be administered with particular caution to patients already at risk for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). Careful monitoring is recommended when using methadone in patients with a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction, and in other cases where history or physical exam suggest an increased risk of dysrhythmia. QT prolongation has also been reported in patients with no prior cardiac history who have received high doses of methadone. Patients developing QT prolongation while on methadone treatment should be evaluated for the presence of modifiable risk factors, such as concomitant medications with cardiac effects, drugs which might cause electrolyte abnormalities, and drugs which might act as inhibitors of methadone metabolism. For use of methadone to treat pain, the risk of QT prolongation and development of dysrhythmias should be weighed against the benefit of adequate pain management and the availability of alternative therapies.

Methadone treatment for analgesic therapy in patients with acute or chronic pain should only be initiated if the potential analgesic or palliative care benefit of treatment with methadone has been considered to outweigh the risk of QT prolongation that has been reported with high doses of methadone.

The use of methadone in patients already known to have a prolonged QT interval has not been systematically studied.

In using methadone an individualized benefit to risk assessment should be carried out and should include evaluation of patient presentation and complete medical history. For patients judged to be at risk, careful monitoring of cardiovascular status, including QT prolongation and dysrhythmias and those described previously should be performed.

### Routine monitoring of QTc interval as a barrier for efficient use of methadone in palliative care [^113vjwQa]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Methadone is a commonly prescribed opioid amongst cancer patients. It has unique pharmacological properties which can benefit in treating complex pain syndromes and neuropathic pain. However, strict guidelines have been created in a generalized manner for chronic pain and long-term survival patients. These guidelines, such as QT interval monitoring can lead to limitations for methadone use in patients with comfort-associated goals. We present two cases of patients with metastatic cancer who were treated for pain with methadone and had to undergo opioid rotation due to abnormal QT intervals.

Case Description

Case one was a female with open ulcerated wounds due to metastatic breast cancer who presented with uncontrolled pain on her current opioid regimen. She achieved pain relief when rotated to methadone but a repeat electrocardiogram a few months later showed QTc prolongation. She underwent opioid rotation with different medications, but her pain remained poorly controlled. Case two was a female with poorly controlled pain in the setting of bilateral breast cancer. She presented with concerns for opioid-induced neurotoxicity and was rotated to methadone. She achieved optimal pain relief. A few weeks later, her machine read QT interval was prolonged and she was rotated off methadone. The electrocardiogram was manually read which showed a normal QT interval and she was restarted on methadone with pain relief.

Conclusion

In the palliative care setting, monitoring QTc per chronic pain guidelines may lead to uncontrolled pain and a significant impact on quality of life.

### Drug-induced arrhythmias: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114qdhoe]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Many widely used medications may cause or exacerbate a variety of arrhythmias. Numerous antiarrhythmic agents, antimicrobial drugs, psychotropic medications, and methadone, as well as a growing list of drugs from other therapeutic classes (neurological drugs, anticancer agents, and many others), can prolong the QT interval and provoke torsades de pointes. Perhaps less familiar to clinicians is the fact that drugs can also trigger other arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, and Brugada syndrome. Some drug-induced arrhythmias (bradyarrhythmias, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia) are significant predominantly because of their symptoms; others (monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome, torsades de pointes) may result in serious consequences, including sudden cardiac death. Mechanisms of arrhythmias are well known for some medications but, in other instances, remain poorly understood. For some drug-induced arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes, risk factors are well defined. Modification of risk factors, when possible, is important for prevention and risk reduction. In patients with nonmodifiable risk factors who require a potentially arrhythmia-inducing drug, enhanced electrocardiographic and other monitoring strategies may be beneficial for early detection and treatment. Management of drug-induced arrhythmias includes discontinuation of the offending medication and following treatment guidelines for the specific arrhythmia. In overdose situations, targeted detoxification strategies may be needed. Awareness of drugs that may cause arrhythmias and knowledge of distinct arrhythmias that may be drug-induced are essential for clinicians. Consideration of the possibility that a patient's arrythmia could be drug-induced is important.

### Cardiac effects of opioid therapy [^113PAFT6]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of opioids to treat chronic pain has come under increased scrutiny, as such use has been associated with significant risk of death, with limited data regarding the long-term effectiveness, especially when used to treat noncancer pain. The purpose of this manuscript is to discuss the cardiac effects associated with long-term opioid therapy.

Design

A literature search was performed using OVID.

Results

Most opioids have little direct negative effect on cardiac contractility. However, opioid administration can be associated with decreased cardiac function when administered in combination with other medications, including benzodiazepines. Opioids can lead to bradycardia and vasodilation, and as a result can rarely lead to edema, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope when used at analgesic doses. While most opioids have no effect on cardiac conductivity, methadone, and buprenorphine can prolong QTc, especially when used in patients at increased risk for QTc prolongation. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring of QTc at baseline and following dose increases is appropriate in patients receiving these medications.

Conclusions

There are limited data to suggest that chronic opioid administration may be associated with an increased risk for cardiac-related adverse effects. However, this observation has not yet been confirmed. Regardless, while opioids are an important medication for the treatment of a multitude of chronic pain conditions, careful patient selection, and diligent monitoring is likely to decrease the risk of harm and improve patient outcomes.

### Quetiapine extended-release (quetiapine) [^111cga56]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12 QT Prolongation

In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine [see Overdosage (10.1)], in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval.

The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).

Quetiapine should also be avoided in circumstances that may increase the risk of occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death including (1) a history of cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.

Caution should also be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with increased risk of QT prolongation (e.g., cardiovascular disease, family history of QT prolongation, the elderly, congestive heart failure and heart hypertrophy).

### Validation of a handheld 6-lead device for QT interval monitoring in resource-limited settings [^111mgdmp]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Given such apparent reassurance in the literature in the broader context of underfunded national TB programs, the dangers of interrupting treatment of an infectious respiratory disease with high mortality, and the poorly understood predictive value of the QTc surrogate marker, it is not unreasonable to ask whether universal ECG screening and monitoring should be abandoned in place of screening only patients with specific and significant risk factors. Such has been the case with methadone maintenance programs, although not without controversy, under analogous circumstances of a potentially lethal disease with few viable treatment alternatives, busy clinics, and low risk of torsade de pointes at typical doses of methadone. However, contemporary RR-TB treatment regimens include up to 4 concurrent anti-TB QT-prolonging medicines administered to patients with common comorbidities and/or concomitant medications that themselves increase risk of torsade de pointes due to hypokalemia, impaired kidney function, age, hypothyroidism, and HIV, among other factors. Episodes of torsade de pointes have been attributed to clofazimine, bedaquiline, fluoroquinolones, and delamanid in pharmacovigilance databases (although the context of such reports is typically unknown), and there is increasing capacity to analyze these systems for causality. Several studies, including the present trial, include patients who died suddenly of a suspected cardiac cause or of an unknown cause with preceding QTc measurements exceeding 500 milliseconds. Although programmatic identification of a prolonged QTc interval has never been shown to reduce mortality in a general population, developing prospective randomized evidence supporting the superiority of specific ECG monitoring strategies or QTc interval action thresholds is implausible given the rarity of torsade de pointes and the difficulty of establishing causality. Nevertheless, several investigators, have reasonably suggested ECG monitoring schedules either more targeted or less intensive than current regulatory guidelines. Simple, handheld 6-lead devices could reduce the need to perform 12-lead ECG monitoring in resource-limited settings and extend the reach of QTc assessment when needed, resulting in more patient-centered care. Such devices could also be used within planned and ongoing phase 2 and 3 TB treatment trials where mean change in QTc interval is a secondary end point.

Methadone — initiation, dosing principles, and monitoring: Methadone should be initiated and adjusted by, or in consultation with, a practitioner who has the relevant knowledge and expertise; if a provider with clinical experience is not available, then another long-acting opioid may be used until such consultation is obtained. Dose titration should occur after at least 5–7 days on a designated dose (in the large majority of cases), and careful consideration must be given to potential drug interactions and to the potential for QT prolongation. Methadone is considered to be safe in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment but should be used with caution in end-stage disease cases of these conditions. There are a number of methods available that use conversion ratios to initiate or titrate methadone; no single method is considered superior to others, and titration should be based on patient response and not solely based on equianalgesic dosing tables. Monitoring ECG for QTc interval prolongation is recommended based upon certain clinical scenarios.

Methadone

Methadone is mainly metabolized through demethylation by CYP2B6 and also via CYP3A4. According to the DDI-checker, enzalutamide, ribociclib, imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib potentially have clinically significant interactions with methadone (Figure 4).

Figure 4.
Proposed DDIs between methadone (center) and selected anticancer drugs (gray) categorized as "should not be coadministered" (red) or 'potentially clinically significant' (amber) according to the DDI-checker. The inner rings indicate relevant enzymes and transporters involved and whether anticancer drugs act as inhibitors or inducers. Abbreviation: CYP, cytochrome P450. *Coadministration of ribociclib with methadone is contraindicated due to QT prolongation.

Enzalutamide should not be coadministered with methadone. Its strong CYP3A4 induction may significantly reduce methadone concentrations and thereby decrease analgesia. As a dose-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4, ribociclib may increase methadone concentrations and is also a QT prolonging agent (linked to the risk of potentially fatal torsades de pointes and arrhythmias,) which contraindicates coadministration at higher doses.

Methadone concentrations may also increase when coadministered with dasatinib, nilotinib, and imatinib, which are all weak/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Methadone-related toxicity may cause sedation, respiratory depression, and QT prolongation associated with the risk of potentially fatal torsades de pointes and arrhythmias. Therefore, close monitoring including electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment is recommended, with dose adjustment where necessary.

There is a lack of clinical studies to support these DDI-checker findings. However, there is a case report of potential DDIs between methadone and gefitinib (Table 1). A patient with stage IV lung carcinoma on long-term methadone treatment died of respiratory failure less than 2 months after taking gefitinib.

Morphine

Morphine can be used as such or formed from a prodrug like codeine via O-demethylation catalyzed by CYP2D6. It is primarily metabolized via glucuronidation by UGT2B7 to the inactive morphine-3-glucuronide and, secondarily, to the active morphine-6-glucuronide, which has superior pharmacological activity and longer half-life compared with morphine. Despite lacking an analgesic effect, morphine-3-glucuronide may display neuroexcitatory effects that may cause allodynia, myoclonus, and seizures in humans.

No clinically significant DDIs between morphine and selected anticancer drugs were identified, neither with the DDI-checker nor in the literature search.

POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND RISKS FOR PATIENTS

While CYP2B6 genotype is associated with the pharmacokinetics of methadone, specifically S‐ methadone more than R ‐methadone, this has not been associated with clinically significant implications for therapeutic or adverse effects. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to change the prescribing practices of methadone based on CYP2B6 genetics. There is also insufficient evidence to change currently recommended ECG monitoring practices based on CYP2B6 genetics and an absence of evidence to recommend a slower methadone dose titration schedule based on CYP2B6 genetics.

### QT interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^116XFHK6]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Fatal arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, may be precipitated by prolongation of ventricular repolarisation caused by medication. Numerous marketed drugs have been associated with effects on repolarisation interval, characterised by lengthening of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram; some drugs were withdrawn from the market when such lengthening was identified in postmarketing surveillance. Several commonly used psychotropic medications, including some antidepressants, have been reported to prolong QT interval. Because incidence of torsades de pointes is extremely low, QT prolongation is widely used as a surrogate marker of risk, albeit an imperfect one.

In August 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram had been associated with QT prolongation at higher doses, informing clinicians that "Citalopram causes dose-dependent QT interval prolongation. Citalopram should no longer be prescribed at doses greater than 40 mg per day". Further clarification issued in March 2012 restricted the maximum dose to 20 mg for subgroups of patients, including those older than 60 years and those taking an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C19. This change, affecting the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the US, with 37.8 million prescriptions in 2011, left clinicians unclear about appropriate next-step strategies because of the lack of data comparing citalopram with other antidepressants.

Traditionally, QT interval is examined in registration trials and postmarketing surveillance, both of which have substantial limitations. The former may sample a restricted group of patients and may not be reflective of the medical comorbidities or concomitant treatments that may increase risk of QT prolongation. The latter captures only severe or unexpected outcomes, does not do so consistently, and may be slow to detect rare outcomes.

To address these limitations and to better understand the extent of QT prolongation in a general clinical population, we used a pharmacovigilance approach, which applied natural language processing and machine-learning algorithms to examine electronic health records from a large New England healthcare system encompassing more than four million individuals. This approach has been shown to be valid and sensitive to adverse cardiovascular outcomes in multiple investigations. Here, we examined QT intervals in individuals prescribed antidepressants, as well as in individuals prescribed the opioid methadone, known to be a contributor to QT prolongation and included as a measure of assay sensitivity.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113JTKn1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Clinicians should not treat acute pain with ER/LA opioids or initiate opioid treatment for subacute or chronic pain with ER/LA opioids, and clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for intermittent or as-needed use.
ER/LA opioids should be reserved for severe, continuous pain. FDA has noted that some ER/LA opioids should be considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of opioids of immediate-release opioids daily for at least 1 week.
When changing to an ER/LA opioid for a patient previously receiving a different immediate-release opioid, clinicians should consult product labeling and reduce total daily dosage to account for incomplete opioid cross-tolerance.
Clinicians should use additional caution with ER/LA opioids and consider a longer dosing interval when prescribing to patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction because decreased clearance of medications among these patients can lead to accumulation of drugs to toxic levels and persistence in the body for longer durations.
Methadone should not be the first choice for an ER/LA opioid. Only clinicians who are familiar with methadone's unique risk profile and who are prepared to educate and closely monitor their patients, including assessing risk for QT prolongation and considering electrocardiographic monitoring, should consider prescribing methadone for pain.
Only clinicians who are familiar with the dosing and absorption properties of the ER/LA opioid transdermal fentanyl and are prepared to educate their patients about its use should consider prescribing it.

Supporting Rationale

ER/LA opioids include methadone, transdermal fentanyl, and extended-release versions of opioids such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and morphine. Clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on short-term pain and function were generally consistent across duration of action (short- or long-acting) and opioid type (opioid agonist, partial agonist, or mixed mechanism [with mixed opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of action] agent), although five trials directly comparing different types of opioids found a mixed mechanism agent associated with greater pain relief versus a pure opioid agonist, with fewer nonserious adverse events. A fair-quality study demonstrated a higher risk for overdose among patients treated with ER/LA opioids than among those treated with immediate-release opioids, especially within the first 2 weeks of therapy, with relative risk decreasing with longer duration of exposure. Clinical evidence reviews did not find evidence that continuous, time-scheduled use of ER/LA opioids is more effective or safer than intermittent use of immediate-release opioids or that time-scheduled use of ER/ LA opioids reduces risk for opioid use disorder.

### The clinical significance of QT interval prolongation in anesthesia and pain management: what you should and should not worry about… [^116GkXiE]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The most feared drug-induced complication is fatal cardiac arrest. Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia occurring in the setting of a QT interval prolongation and is the most frequent type of drug-induced pro-arrhythmia. The most common mechanism of QT prolongation and TdP is blockade of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier repolarizing potassium conductance IKr. Anesthesiologists have extensive experience with QT prolonging drugs, but there are relatively few reports of TdP occurring in the perioperative setting. Nevertheless, regulatory concern regarding the drug droperidol resulted in a significant reduction in its use. Concern regarding two other agents that potently block IKr, i.e., sevoflurane and methadone, has grown, and practitioners are worried that these valuable agents may meet the same fate. In this review, the data regarding the TdP risk of droperidol, sevoflurane, and methadone are compared with particular emphasis on the different settings in which they are employed. While the three drugs are potent IKr inhibitors, little evidence exists to suggest that droperidol or sevoflurane are associated with significant proarrhythmia in the perioperative setting. Due to factors such as inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system, prevention of hypoxia and hypercarbia, and attention to serum electrolytes, TdP is a very rare occurrence in the perioperative environment. Methadone, however, is typically given to outpatients, over long periods, and in combination with agents that inhibit its metabolism or are QT prolonging in their own right. Thus, pre- and post-drug electrocardiograms may be appropriate when prescribing methadone for outpatients, while the much lower risk for TdP (and the difficulties inherent in QT measurement in the perioperative period) render this approach unfruitful and worthy of reevaluation.

### Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline for CYP2B6 genotype and methadone therapy [^1147xgk4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

While most other clinically relevant opioids are essentially pure μ agonists, methadone has several non‐opioid targets. For example, methadone blocks N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors in laboratory studies. However, clinical methadone concentrations (often < 1 μM) are lower than the IC 50 or Ki of methadone for the NMDA receptor (3–10 μM). Thus, the clinical occurrence or significance of this non‐opioid receptor effect remains unknown. Methadone also interacts with norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake transporters at concentrations which more closely resemble those achieved clinically.R‐methadone appears more potent than S‐methadone at these non‐opioid receptors. Whether this influences methadone‐induced analgesia is unknown.

In contrast to analgesia, some studies indicate that S‐methadone is more potent than R‐methadone at blocking the cardiac hERG channel, particularly at high (therapeutic or supratherapeutic) concentrations tested in vitro.hERG channel inhibition by methadone in vitro is concentration‐dependent. There is concern that this blockade may lead to prolongation of the electrocardiogram QTc interval and in severe cases, torsade de pointes ventricular arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death. The definition of "long" QT interval is > 450 ms in males and > 460 ms in females, but generally more relevant is a drug effect which increases QTc by ≥ 60 ms or QTc > 500 ms. Clinically significant QTc prolongation (> 500 ms) and torsade de pointes have occurred, typically at high methadone doses (e.g. median 345 mg/day) and longer use, but torsade de pointes has occurred at daily doses as low as 30–40 mg. However, the relationship between dose and clinical QTc interval is weak (correlation coefficient, r, of ~0.2–0.3,), the magnitude of methadone effect on QTc is small (i.e. ~10 ms per 100 mg dose, and 15–30 ms per 1,000 ng/mL S‐ methadone,), and the QTc rarely exceeds 500 msec. Multiple factors alone or in conjunction with methadone can affect QTc (e.g. genetic long‐QTc interval, history of arrhythmia or prolonged QTc, electrolyte abnormalities, and concomitant medications). Clinical practice guidelines for methadone and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring are variable. Some recommend universal ECG prescreening, and others recommend screening only in patients with significant risk factors, and/or in patients receiving greater than 100–120 mg daily, and are beyond the scope of this guideline.

Methadone is known to prolong the QT interval and precipitate torsades de pointes. A 54-year-old prescription methadone user with hypokalaemia was referred to Critical Care with acute confusion and respiratory distress. Alcohol withdrawal was the presumed precipitant. The real precipitant only became evident on analysis of a 24-h ECG (Holter monitor) attached to the patient at the time. The patient had suffered prolonged (10 min) ventricular arrhythmias including torsades de pointes and self-terminating ventricular fibrillation. The patient made a full recovery. Risk factors for acquired long QT syndrome and the treatment of torsades de pointes are discussed.

### QTc interval screening for cardiac risk in methadone treatment of opioid dependence [^1112YeAH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Methadone represents today the gold standard of efficacy for the pharmacological treatment of opioid dependence. Methadone, like many other medications, has been implicated in the prolongation of the rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG), which is considered a marker for arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes (TdP). Indications on the association between methadone, even at therapeutic dosages, and TdP or sudden cardiac death have been reported. On these bases, consensus and recommendations involving QTc screening of patients receiving methadone treatment have been developed to identify patients with QTc above the thresholds considered at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, and they provide these individuals with alternative treatment (reduction of methadone dosage; provision of alternative opioid agonist treatment; treatment of associated risk factors).

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of QTc screening for preventing cardiac-related morbidity and mortality in methadone-treated opioid dependents.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (to April 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Review Group Specialised Register (Issue 3, 2013), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists of all relevant papers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and non-randomised studies (cohort studies, controlled before and after studies, interrupted time series studies, case control studies) examining the efficacy of QTc screening for the prevention of methadone-related mortality and morbidity in opioid addicts.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened and extracted data from studies.

Main Results

The search strategy led to the identification of 872 records. Upon full-text assessment, no study was found to meet the quality criteria used for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

It is not possible to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of QTc screening strategies for preventing cardiac morbidity/mortality in methadone-treated opioid addicts. Research efforts should focus on strengthening the evidence about the effectiveness of widespread implementation of such strategies and clarifying the associated benefits and harms.

### Opioid switching from morphine to methadone causes a minor but not clinically significant increase in QTc time: a prospective 9-month follow-up study [^112dq2S9]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2006). Low credibility.

Case reports and retrospective studies suggest that methadone causes an increase in QTc (QT time corrected for heart rate) time and risk of torsades de pointes arrhythmia. No prospective studies in pain patients have been conducted, and data on whether a methadone-induced increase in QTc time persists during long-term treatment have not been reported. Eight chronic nonmalignant pain patients experiencing insufficient pain control or intolerable side effects during treatment with oral morphine switched to oral methadone and were included in this study. Electrocardiograms were obtained at baseline and at follow-up 2 weeks, and 3 and 9 months after the opioid switch. Start of methadone caused a minor but statistically significant increase in QTc time, while fluctuations in QTc during treatment with stable doses of methadone were neither clinically nor statistically significant. We observed no episodes of arrhythmias.

C ytochrome P450 Interaction

T he concomitant use of methadone hydrochloride tablets with all cytochrome P450 3A4, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9 or 2D6 inhibitors may result in an increase in methadone plasma concentrations, which could cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4, 2B6, 2C19, or 2C9 inducers may also result in an increase in methadone plasma concentration. Follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation and consider dosage reduction with any changes of concomitant medications that can result in an increase in methadone levels [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

C onditions For Distribution And Use Of Methadone Products For The Treatment Of Opioid Addiction

For detoxification and maintenance of opioid dependence, methadone should be administered in accordance with the treatment standards cited in 42 CFR Section 8, including limitations on unsupervised administration [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1)].

WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF METHADONE HYDROCHLORIDE TABLETS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Methadone hydrochloride tablets expose users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk before prescribing, and monitor regularly for development of these behaviors and conditions. (5.1)
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. The peak respiratory depressant effect of methadone occurs later, and persists longer than the peak analgesic effect. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. (5.2)
Accidental ingestion of methadone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in fatal overdose of methadone. (5.2)
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. (5.3, 7)
QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have occurred during treatment with methadone. Closely monitor patients with risk factors for development of prolonged QT interval, a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, and those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction (5.4)
Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of use of methadone hydrochloride tablets during pregnancy. NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. The balance between the risks of NOWS and the benefits of maternal methadone hydrochloride tablets use may differ based on the risks associated with the mother's underlying condition, pain, or addiction. Advise the patient of the risk of NOWS so that appropriate planning for management of the neonate can occur. (5.5)
To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. (5.6)
Concomitant use with CYP3A4, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9 or 2D6 inhibitors or discontinuation of concomitantly used CYP3A4, 2B6, 2C19, or 2C9 inducers can result in a fatal overdose of methadone (5.7, 7)
Methadone products, when used for the treatment of opioid addiction in detoxification or maintenance programs, shall be dispensed only by certified opioid treatment programs as stipulated in 42 CFR 8.12. (1, 2.1)

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^114hDmvU]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

When an ER/LA opioid is prescribed, using one with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is preferred to minimize unintentional overdose risk. In particular, unique characteristics of methadone and transdermal fentanyl make safe prescribing of these medications for pain especially challenging. Methadone should not be the first choice for an ER/LA opioid. Only clinicians who are familiar with methadone's unique risk profile and who are prepared to educate and closely monitor their patients, including risk assessment for QT prolongation and consideration of electrocardiographic monitoring, should consider prescribing methadone for pain. A clinical practice guideline regarding methadone prescribing for pain has been published previously. Because dosing effects of transdermal fentanyl often are misunderstood by both clinicians and patients, only clinicians who are familiar with its dosing and absorption properties of and are prepared to educate their patients about its use should consider prescribing transdermal fentanyl.

Recommendation 4

When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage. If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully evaluate individual benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage, and should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 3).

5.3 Life-Threatening QT
Prolongation

Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. In most patients on the lower doses typically used for maintenance, concomitant medications and/or clinical conditions such as hypokalemia were noted as contributing factors. However, the evidence strongly suggests that methadone possesses the potential for adverse cardiac conduction effects in some patients. The effects of methadone on the QT interval have been confirmed in in vivo laboratory studies, and methadone has been shown to inhibit cardiac potassium channels in in vitro studies.

Closely monitor patients with risk factors for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, and those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction. QT prolongation has also been reported in patients with no prior cardiac history who have received high doses of methadone.

Evaluate patients developing QT prolongation while on methadone hydrochloride tablets for oral suspension treatment for the presence of modifiable risk factors, such as concomitant medications with cardiac effects, drugs which might cause electrolyte abnormalities, and drugs which might act as inhibitors of methadone metabolism.

Only initiate therapy with methadone hydrochloride tablets for oral suspension in patients for whom the anticipated benefit outweighs the risk of QT prolongation and development of dysrhythmias that have been reported with high doses of methadone. The use of methadone in patients already known to have a prolonged QT interval has not been systematically studied.

5.4 Accidental Ingestion

Accidental ingestion of even one dose of methadone hydrochloride tablets for oral suspension, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose. Keep methadone hydrochloride tablets for oral suspension out of reach of children to prevent accidental ingestion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Pharmacological management of chronic pain in persons living with HIV on methadone — a signed release for the exchange of health information between the provider and the opioid treatment program (OTP) is recommended prior to any controlled substance prescribing (strong, low). Ongoing communication with the OPT is essential when there are 2 controlled substance prescribers, and sharing information about a patient's progress in recovery is an important component of the assessment and periodic monitoring of a pain treatment's risks and benefits, for example, whether to pursue a trial of or to continue or discontinue opioid analgesic therapy. Initial screening with electrocardiogram to identify heart rate corrected QT (QTc) prolongation for all patients on methadone is recommended, with interval follow-up with dose changes.

Intake risk factors can include family history of sudden cardiac death, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, prolonged QTc interval, or unexplained syncope; current use of medications that may increase QT interval; and electrolyte assessment for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.

### Improving cardiac assessment and monitoring in methadone prescribing at an addiction service [^114Z52J2]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Methadone is associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes such as QTc interval prolongation, which is a risk factor for the often fatal ventricular arrhythmia torsades de pointes. Methadone alone may prolong the QTc particularly at doses over 100 milligrams daily or when concurrent with other QTc prolongation risk factors. Such other risk factors include heart or liver disease, family history of QTc prolongation, electrolyte abnormalities, and medications known for QTc prolongation such as citalopram, tricyclic antidepressants, and most antipsychotics. Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines recommend careful monitoring of patients prescribed methadone with risk factors for QTc interval prolongation, in particular for doses of methadone over 100 milligrams of daily. These recommendations ideally comprise a baseline assessment with ECG measurement of the QTc interval and subsequent annual monitoring.

The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).

Quetiapine should also be avoided in circumstances that may increase the risk of occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death including (1) a history of cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.

Caution should also be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with increased risk of QT prolongation (e.g., cardiovascular disease, family history of QT prolongation, the elderly, congestive heart failure, and heart hypertrophy).

### Is levorphanol a better option than methadone? [^1145oseo]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Methadone has been a stalwart pharmacologic option for the management of opioid drug dependence for many years. It substitutes for opioid agonists and possesses certain pharmacokinetic properties that confer characteristics preferable to those of other opioids for this application. Methadone is likewise used as an option for the treatment of pain, particularly chronic pain. It has a spectrum of pharmacodynamic activity, including contributions from non-opioid components, that translates to its specific clinical attributes as an analgesic. Unfortunately, basic science studies and accumulated clinical experience with methadone have revealed some undesirable, and even worrisome, features, including issues of safety. The benefit/risk ratio of methadone might be acceptable if there was no better alternative, but neither its pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties are unique to methadone.

Objective

We review the basic and clinical pharmacology of methadone and suggest that levorphanol should receive attention as a possible alternative.

Conclusion

Unlike methadone, levorphanol is a more potent NMDA antagonist, possesses a higher affinity for DOR and KOR, has a shorter plasma half-life yet longer duration of action, has no CYP450 interactions or QTc prolongation risk, can be a viable option in the elderly, palliative care, and SCI patients, requires little to no need for co-administration of adjuvant analgesics, and has potentially a lower risk of drug-related Emergency Department visits compared to other opioids.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^111wmpiz]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

WHEN HOSPITALISTS SHOULD AVOID OFFERING METHADONE FOR OPIOID WITHDRAWAL

Patient preference should guide opioid withdrawal treatment. Some patients may prefer buprenorphine for withdrawal when they want to continue OUD treatment after discharge given variable geographical availability of methadone and strict methadone regulations requiring frequent OTP visits which makes methadone adherence challenging. Weighing the risks and benefits through shared decision-making can help patients determine the best treatment option.

When the QTc (> 500 ms) is prolonged, hospitalists should replete electrolytes, limit nonessential QTc prolonging medications, reassess the QTc, and discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives to methadone, including buprenorphine and other opioid agonists (e.g. oxycodone, hydromorphone) for opioid withdrawal. Hospitalized patients may have metabolic derangements or require medications that prolong the QTc and these should be addressed and discussed with the patient when selecting opioid withdrawal treatment. In one study, the methadone dose was only weakly associated with QTc prolongation and not associated with cardiac events.

When optimized, methadone should not sedate patients. However, individuals with conditions affecting respiratory drive (e.g. advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or methadone metabolism (e.g. end stage renal disease, end stage liver disease) may not tolerate methadone due to sedation. In these instances, hospitalists should also discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives with patients.

Methadone

Methadone is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers with applications to treat pain with nociceptive and neuropathic components. The L isomer (R-methadone) is a Mu/Delta receptor agonist while the D isomer (S-methadone) is a NMDA receptor antagonist and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Methadone has higher intrinsic activity but lower Mu receptor affinity than morphine allowing for pain relief while minimizing related side effects. The NMDA antagonism decreases excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate binding at the NMDA receptor site, leading to reduction of hyperalgesia, neuropathic pain, and depressed opioid receptor functionality.

According to the WHO analgesic ladder, strong opioids are considered the third step in treating adult cancer pain. Methadone is utilized when patients develop opioid tolerance, intolerance to side effects, or allergic reaction to other strong opioids such as morphine. Methadone is excreted through the feces showing benefit in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. Patients having developed neuropathic pain from cancer treatment or compressive/radiation plexopathy may benefit from the dual nociceptive and neuropathic properties.

Methadone initiation dosing should be 2.5 mg TID in opioid naive patients with dose adjustments of 5 mg/day or less every 5–7 days. Opioid tolerant patients should be converted to an equianalgesic dose (1:2 to 1:20 conversion factor) with maximum starting dose of 30 mg/day and dose adjustment of 10 mg/day or less every 5–7 days. The analgesic half-life is 6–8 hours, so dosing every 6–8 hours is recommended. Common side effects include somnolence, nausea, constipation, and xerostomia, however rarer side effects have been described and include fatal arrhythmia, serotonin syndrome, respiratory depression, pruritus, diaphoresis, and neurotoxicity. Prior to initiation, cardiac arrhythmia risk should be assessed, and a baseline EKG obtained to evaluate for QT prolongation. A QTc between 450 and 500 ms puts the patient at a higher risk for development of torsades de pointes. When QTc > 500 ms, alternative therapy should be considered. Follow-up EKG is recommended 2–4 weeks after methadone initiation. High gastric pH or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use increases methadone absorption, while high urinary pH reduces methadone clearance leading to accumulation despite primarily fecal clearance.

According to a Cochrane review and secondary literature search, there is no evidence comparing methadone to placebo in the cancer population and there is weak evidence (small sample size, limited scope) with comparison to morphine. Studies demonstrate equipotent efficacy in treating mild pain when comparing methadone to morphine or transdermal fentanyl with comparable associated side effects.

### Improving cardiac assessment and monitoring in methadone prescribing at an addiction service [^114Kc13e]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The assessment and monitoring of cardiac risk in patients prescribed methadone is important for patient safety. Although uncommon, QTc interval prolongation is potentially life-threatening. Known risk factors for QTc prolongation include methadone, particularly at doses above 100 milligrams daily. This project aimed to improve the cardiac assessment and monitoring at Barnet Drug and Alcohol Service through raising the awareness of this clinically importance issue as well as through amending the medical assessment guidance to promote the comprehensive assessment of QTc prolongation risk factors and ensure the identification of cardiac risk in patients prescribed methadone. The project also provided guidance on QTc prolongation management and monitoring (including performance of an electrocardiogram) at the service to provide a baseline measurement and arrangement of annual monitoring. Prior to the intervention, a randomised sample of 26 patients that had been prescribed methadone revealed no comprehensive cardiac risk assessments. Analysing 52 medical assessments in the month following the intervention suggested an improvement in assessment and management of QTc interval prolongation risk, with seven comprehensive cardiac risks assessments performed and one patient having QTc interval prolongation identified following an electrocardiogram and appropriately managed. This project was limited by small sample sizes and the relatively low incidence of QTc prolongation. The poor rate of attendance for requested electrocardiograms in this population was noted as a challenge that needed further consideration.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^113Bjs11]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Methadone QTc monitoring — chronic pain management in people living with HIV (PLWH) and related populations — includes study data and society guidance: a small prospective study of low-dose (< 60 mg/day) methadone used automated QTc calculations from 12-lead electrocardiograms at baseline and 6 months, with clinically significant QTc prolongation defined as (> 470 milliseconds or > 60 milliseconds increase from baseline); methadone patients showed an early first-month increase (P = 0.073) that was not statistically significant and disappeared in the third and sixth months. For monitoring, an initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is recommended in patients with increased arrhythmia risk and an initial ECG is considered for all patients starting methadone; follow-up ECGs should be based on the initial recording, with higher QTc requiring closer follow-up as early as 2 to 4 weeks and as late as when the patient reaches 100 mg/day of methadone.

Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS)

If opioid use is required for an extended period of time in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of NOWS, which may be life threatening if not recognized and treated. Ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to complete a REMS compliant education program and to counsel patients and caregivers on serious risks, safe use, and the importance of reading the Medication Guide with each prescription [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)].

Li f e - T hreatening QT Prolongation

Q T interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have occurred during treatment with methadone. Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. Closely monitor patients with risk factors for development of prolonged QT interval, a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, and those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction for changes in cardiac rhythm during initiation and titration of methadone hydrochloride tablets [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].

To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of methadone are essential (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Overestimating the methadone dosage when initiating treatment can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.

To further reduce the risk of respiratory depression, consider the following:

Life-Threatening QT Prolongation

Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. In most patients on the lower doses typically used for maintenance, concomitant medications and/or clinical conditions such as hypokalemia were noted as contributing factors. However, the evidence strongly suggests that methadone possesses the potential for adverse cardiac conduction effects in some patients. The effects of methadone on the QT interval have been confirmed in in vivo laboratory studies, and methadone has been shown to inhibit cardiac potassium channels in in vitro studies.

Closely monitor patients with risk factors for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, and those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction. QT prolongation has also been reported in patients with no prior cardiac history who have received high doses of methadone.

### Role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in patients with methadone-induced long QT syndrome [^111CM8Ds]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with methadone-induced long-QT syndrome may experience Torsades de Pointes (TDP) or aborted sudden death requiring the placement of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Outcomes after ICD implantation in these patients are unknown. Eight patients presenting with methadone-induced long-QT syndrome and episodes of symptomatic TDP were followed after having undergone ICD implantation. The study group included 5 women and 3 men (mean age 48.5 ± 5 years) receiving methadone doses of 204 ± 173 mg. All but 1 subject had preserved ventricular function (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 61 ± 1.1%). All of the patients had prolonged QTc intervals (mean 613 ± 71 ms) while taking methadone. After ICD implantation, 6 of the 8 patients continued treatment with methadone as a result of intractable dependence. Over a mean follow-up period of 27 months, 1 patient expired from unknown causes. Three of those patients had interrogation-proved ICD shocks for TDP. In conclusion, patients with methadone-induced long-QT syndrome and TDP are at high risk for recurrent arrhythmic events if methadone is continued. This small cohort of patients suggests that ICDs may be lifesaving in those subjects who continue taking methadone after initial episodes of TDP.

### Methadone and the QTc interval: paucity of clinically significant factors in a retrospective cohort [^113bF5HQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Methadone is associated with prolongation of the electrocardiographic QTc interval. QTc prolongation may be linked to cardiac dysrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. The rate of these events is unknown in methadone-maintained patients.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of 749 patients with opioid use disorder receiving methadone maintenance therapy through a single safety-net hospital, queried the electronic health record for electrocardiogram results, demographics, methadone dose, and diagnostic codes consistent with cardiac conduction disorder (International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] 426) and cardiac dysrhythmia (ICD-9 427). Factors associated with QTc interval were explored; Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to analyze time to an event that may predispose to sudden cardiac death.

Results

One hundred thirty-four patients had an electrocardiogram while on methadone, 404 while off methadone, and 211 both while on and off methadone. Mean QTc interval while on methadone (436ms, SD 36) was significantly greater than while off methadone (423ms, SD 33). Age and methadone dose were weakly associated with increased QTc interval (P < 0.01 and P < 0.0005, respectively, adjusted R = 0.05). There were 44 ICD-9 426 and 427 events over 7064 patient-years (6.3events/1000 patient-yrs). Having a QTc greater than sex-specific cut-off values was significantly associated with time to event (hazard ratio 3.32, 95% confidence interval 1.25–8.81), but being on methadone was not.

Conclusions

Methadone is associated with QTc prolongation in a nonclinically significant dose-related manner. Cardiac events were rare and the sudden cardiac death rate was below that of the general population. Current recommendations for cardiac risk assessment in methadone-maintained patients should be reconsidered.

### Improving cardiac assessment and monitoring in methadone prescribing at an addiction service [^113EU3EC]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Design

The initial new medical assessment and subsequent medical reviews performed by clinicians are guided by a new medical assessment document. This reference document consists of a series of important sections that are clinically important for the assessor to cover. This document was lacking a specific area that was focused on cardiac risk factors, with no list of the specific risk factors for QTc interval prolongation. Therefore, the initial intervention amended this document to include a section covering cardiac risk with a reference list of the range of specific QTc risk factors. It was noted from feedback from clinicians after the initial implementation that it would be useful to also include a clear question for clinicians to address whether the patient presented a cardiac risk or not. It also needed to provide recommendations for management for those patients who did have this risk identified.

After editing the document several times in response to feedback from clinicians, the final version comprised of a checklist of the main specific QTc risk factors along with a more detailed list alongside these factors for reference. For example, an item of the checklist to be checked off (whether it had been assessed or not) related to the patient being currently prescribed any medication with a QTc prolongation risk. Alongside this 'yes or no' checkbox was a detailed list of the medications to consider, subdivided within their medication classes for ease of reference. The checklist also included a family history of heart disease, including the details specifically assessing for a family history of QTc interval prolongation. It included heart disease, specifically bradycardia, ischaemic heart disease, and myocardial infarction. It also included liver disease and electrolyte abnormalities as can be seen in alcohol dependency.

The document was also amended to include recommendations in case of identified cardiac risk. This guidance included performance of a mandatory baseline ECG, including measurement of the QTc interval and the arrangement of annual monitoring of cardiac risk through future ECGs at the cardiac assessment clinic.

Amended editions of the document were disseminated as the standard reference for medical assessments at BDAS, with opportunities for amendments to be made in response to feedback from clinicians. It was expected that it would take months to observe any impact of the interventions due to the number of medical assessments of new patients requiring methadone, as well as the relatively low incidence of QTc risk factors and QTc interval prolongation.

### Multimodal acute pain management in the parturient with opioid use disorder: a review [^1141dJga]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Occurrence of QT prolongation and the possibility of precipitating Torsades de Pointes is a well-known side effect of methadone; the higher the dose, the more likely the effect (> 200 mg in healthy patients). Methadone has had an Food and Drug Administration black box warning for this rare ventricular arrhythmia since 2006. Thus, ECG monitoring is recommended with methadone dosages that exceed 150 mg/day and in patients with either risks for QT prolongation or symptoms that may attribute to arrythmias. For the parturient taking methadone, it is recommended to continue using methadone in the peripartum period rather than discontinuing therapy, as this could lead to relapse and hyperalgesia. One retrospective study revealed that although women who were on methadone for OUD experienced similar pain compared to pregnant patients without OUD during cesarean delivery, they required 70% higher analgesic dosage. This poses concerns for increased postpartum opioid use or even relapse. Due to changes to drug metabolism in the third trimester of pregnancy, splitting the once-daily dosing into a two- or three-times daily dosing may be more beneficial in treating OUD and the associated pain around birth. Increasing the dosage is not indicated, as it puts the mother at an increased risk of prolonged QT interval and subsequent arrhythmias.

### Improving cardiac assessment and monitoring in methadone prescribing at an addiction service [^114pXRRf]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The assessment and management of cardiac risk in patients being prescribed methadone is important for patient safety. QTc interval prolongation is uncommon but potentially life-threatening. There are known risk factors for QTc prolongation which include the prescription of methadone especially at doses above 100 milligrams daily. This project amended the current system at BDAS for the content of medical assessments and monitoring to specifically include a detailed checklist of QTc prolonging risk factors. It encourages and supports those prescribers that are undertaking medical assessments and reviews of patients prescribed methadone to provide a comprehensive assessment and identify any cardiac risk present, as well as providing guidance for managing and monitoring QTc prolongation risk. Implementation of the project highlighted the importance and challenges of recruiting prescribers in utilising amendments to current systems, as well as to the poor attendance for clinics seen in this population of patients prescribed methadone attending an addiction service.

### Methadone: to ECG or not to ECG… That is still the question [^1165uhWh]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2008). Low credibility.

There is significant controversy about the potential deleterious effect of methadone on cardiac conduction. Although several reports suggest that patients receiving methadone are at increased risk for QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia, others have not replicated these findings. Hence, it is not surprising that there is no consensus on when to perform an electrocardiogram, a simple test to assess the QTc interval, during methadone therapy. Most of the uncertainty is generated by the lack of large controlled studies. This review presents the current data on this issue in an effort to help in the decision-making process until more conclusive data become available.

HIVMA/IDSA chronic pain — patients on methadone maintenance: A signed release for the exchange of health information with the opioid treatment program (OTP) is recommended prior to any controlled substance prescribing (strong, low), and ongoing communication with the OTP is essential when there are 2 controlled substance prescribers with sharing of progress in recovery. Initial screening with electrocardiogram to identify heart rate corrected QT (QTc) prolongation for all patients on methadone is recommended, with interval follow-up with dose changes, especially if other QTc‑prolonging medications are prescribed (strong, low). The splitting of methadone into 6- to 8-hour doses is recommended to lengthen active analgesic effects for continuous pain control (strong, low), and 5%–10% of the current methadone dose should be added as afternoon and evening doses for a total 10%–20% increase over the regular dose for the treatment of opioid use disorder (strong, very low). If prescribing additional methadone is not possible, adding another medication for chronic pain management depending on etiology (eg, gabapentin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or an additional opioid) may be recommended (weak, low). Acute exacerbations or "breakthrough pain" should be treated with small amounts of short-acting opioid analgesics in patients at low risk for opioid misuse (strong, low), and providers and patients should agree on the number of pills, their frequency of use, and the expected duration of this treatment.

5.4 Life-Threatening QT Prolongation

Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, although cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. In most patients on the lower doses typically used for maintenance, concomitant medications and/or clinical conditions such as hypokalemia were noted as contributing factors. However, the evidence strongly suggests that methadone possesses the potential for adverse cardiac conduction effects in some patients. The effects of methadone on the QT interval have been confirmed in in vivo laboratory studies, and methadone has been shown to inhibit cardiac potassium channels in in vitro studies.

Closely monitor patients with risk factors for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, and those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction. QT prolongation has also been reported in patients with no prior cardiac history who have received high doses of methadone.

Evaluate patients developing QT prolongation while on methadone treatment for the presence of modifiable risk factors, such as concomitant medications with cardiac effects, drugs that might cause electrolyte abnormalities, and drugs that might act as inhibitors of methadone metabolism.

Only initiate Methadone Hydrochloride Tablets therapy for pain in patients for whom the anticipated benefit outweighs the risk of QT prolongation and development of dysrhythmias that have been reported with high doses of methadone.

The use of methadone in patients already known to have a prolonged QT interval has not been systematically studied.

### The QTc effect of low-dose methadone for chronic pain: a prospective pilot study [^115Jph3m]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Methadone is associated with QT prolongation and serious cardiac complications, but this has been primarily demonstrated in opioid dependent patients receiving moderate to high doses. This study investigates the effect of low-dose methadone on the QTc interval in a chronic pain population.

Design and Subjects

We conducted a prospective cohort study in a chronic pain clinic including 82 patients receiving methadone and 102 patients receiving non-methadone opioid therapy.

Methods

We analyzed automated QTc calculations from 12-lead electrocardiograms at baseline and during the subsequent 6 months. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of QTc greater than 470 milliseconds or an increase from baseline of greater than 60 milliseconds.

Results

The methadone group did not manifest an overall higher frequency of QTc > 470 milliseconds (6% for the methadone group vs 5% for controls, P = 0.722) or an increase in the QTc of > 60 milliseconds (4% for the methadone group vs 4% for controls, P = 0.94). In the first month after initiating methadone, patients demonstrated an increase in QTc compared to controls (5% for the methadone group vs 0% for the controls, P = 0.073) but the difference disappeared in the third and sixth months.

Conclusion

Data from our chronic pain clinic support a potential association of QTc prolongation during the initiation of methadone, but this effect is small and short lived. We believe larger scale studies to further characterize the safety profile of low-dose methadone are warranted.

### Methadone hydrochloride (methadone HCl) [^115V1WVv]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiac Conduction Effects

This information is intended to alert the prescriber to comprehensively evaluate the risks and benefits of methadone treatment. The intent is not to deter the appropriate use of methadone in patients with a history of cardiac disease.

Laboratory studies, both in vivo and in vitro, have demonstrated that methadone inhibits cardiac potassium channels and prolongs the QT interval. Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Although most cases involve patients being treated for pain with large, multiple daily doses of methadone, cases have been reported in patients receiving doses commonly used for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. In most of the cases seen at typical maintenance doses, concomitant medications and/or clinical conditions such as hypokalemia were noted as contributing factors. However, the evidence strongly suggests that methadone possesses the potential for adverse cardiac conduction effects in some patients.

Methadone should be administered with particular caution to patients already at risk for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). Careful monitoring is recommended when using methadone in patients with a history of cardiac conduction abnormalities, those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction, and in other cases where history or physical exam suggest an increased risk of dysrhythmia. QT prolongation has also been reported in patients with no prior cardiac history who have received high doses of methadone. Patients developing QT prolongation while on methadone treatment should be evaluated for the presence of modifiable risk factors, such as concomitant medications with cardiac effects, drugs which might cause electrolyte abnormalities and drugs which might act as inhibitors of methadone metabolism.

The potential risks of methadone, including the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, should be weighed against the risks of discontinuing methadone treatment. In the patient being treated for opiate dependence with methadone maintenance therapy, these risks include a very high likelihood of relapse to illicit drug use following methadone discontinuation.

The use of methadone in patients already known to have a prolonged QT interval has not been systematically studied. The potential risks of methadone should be weighed against the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with untreated opioid addiction.

In using methadone an individualized benefit to risk assessment should be carried out and should include evaluation of patient presentation and complete medical history. For patients judged to be at risk, careful monitoring of cardiovascular status, including evaluation of QT prolongation and dysrhythmias should be performed.

### Changes of QTc interval after opioid switching to oral methadone [^1142LRgG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

A consecutive sample of patients who were switched from strong opioids to methadone in a period of 1 year was surveyed. QTc was assessed before switching (T0) and after achieving adequate analgesia and an acceptable level of adverse effects (Ts). Twenty-eight of 33 patients were switched to methadone successfully. The mean initial methadone doses at T0 were 67.1 mg/day (SD ± 80.2, range 12–390). The mean QTc interval at T0 was 400 ms (SD ± 30, range 330–450). The mean QTc interval at Ts (median 5 days) was 430 ms (SD ± 26, range 390–500). The difference (7.7%) was significant (p < 0.0005). Only two patients had a QTc of 500 ms. No serious arrhythmia was observed. At the linear regression analysis, there was no significant association between mean opioid doses expressed as oral morphine equivalents and QTc at T0 (p = 0.428), nor between mean methadone doses and QTc at Ts (p = 0.315). No age differences were found with previous opioid doses (p = 0.917), methadone doses (p = 0.613), QTc at T0 (p = 0.173), QTc at Ts (p = 0.297), and final opioid-methadone conversion ratio (p = 0.064). While methadone used for opioids switching seems to be an optimal choice to improve the opioid response in patients poorly responsive to the previous opioid, the possible QTc prolongation should be of concern despite not producing clinical consequences in this group of patients. A larger number of patients should be assessed to quantify the risk of serious arrhythmia.

ASIPP chronic opioid therapy — initial steps of opioid therapy include the following directives with stated evidence grades: Comprehensive evaluation of pain history, medical history, psychosocial history, functional assessment, and appropriate consultations are recommended prior to initiation of opioid therapy (Evidence Level: Strong; Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Review of Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data prior to initiating any/all controlled substance prescriptions and periodically or as mandated by regulations during treatment in order to provide information on patterns of prescribing from all providers registered with the system (Evidence Level: Moderate to strong; Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Risk stratification as part of patient management is essential for opioid therapy and controlled substance medication management (Evidence Level: Limited; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate). Urine drug monitoring (UDM) should be implemented at the initiation of opioid therapy and conducted periodically for monitoring therapeutic compliance as per available guidance referential to mode and frequency of testing (Evidence Level: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Prior to starting opioid therapy, clinicians should discuss the realistic benefits, and known risks with patients; should establish clear treatment goals for pain and/or function, and should consider – and discuss – how opioid therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks (Evidence Level: Strong; Strength of Recommendation: Strong). It is essential to establish goals of opioid therapy related to pain relief, improvement in function if and as possible, improvement in quality of life, and a plan for opioid tapering and cessation if and when meaningful, realistic improvement is not achieved from opioid therapy (Evidence Level: Strong; Strength of Recommendation: Strong). A controlled substance agreement that is detailed with each item, including safe storage and disposal, and initialed and signed by the patient is essential prior to initiating therapy (Evidence Level: Strong; Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Once medical necessity is established, opioid therapy may be initiated using low doses and short-acting drugs, with appropriate monitoring to provide effective relief and avoid side effects (Evidence Level: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate to Strong). Long-acting opioids should not be utilized for the initiation of opioid therapy (Evidence Level: Strong; Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Methadone is recommended for use after failure of other opioid therapies only if EKG and evaluation of QT intervals and drug interactions have been conducted and evaluated; commencing with low doses, with dose adjustments with repeat EKG performed at least 6–12 months thereafter, and only clinicians with specific training in methadone prescribing, use, and risk management should offer methadone for noncancer pain resistant to other opioids (Evidence Level: Strong; Strength of Recommendation: Strong).

### Current concepts in the mechanisms and management of drug-induced QT prolongation and torsade de pointes [^114DuDGd]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome is characterized by a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) and increased risk of a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as torsade de pointes (TdP). We review mechanisms, predispositions, culprit agents, and management of this potentially fatal phenomenon. Virtually all drugs that prolong QTc block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier current (I(kr)). Some drugs prolong QTc in a dose-dependent manner, others do so at any dose. Most patients that develop drug-induced TdP have underlying risk factors. Female sex is the most common. Implicated drugs include class 1A and III antiarrhythmics, macrolide antibiotics, pentamidine, antimalarials, antipsychotics, arsenic trioxide, and methadone. Treatment for TdP includes immediate defibrillation for hemodynamic instability and intravenous magnesium sulfate. Potassium levels should be maintained in the high normal range, and all QT prolonging agents must be promptly discontinued.

### QTc interval screening in methadone treatment [^111m7ft7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Description

An independent panel developed cardiac safety recommendations for physicians prescribing methadone.

Methods

Expert panel members reviewed and discussed the following sources regarding methadone: pertinent English-language literature identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE searches (1966 to June 2008), national substance abuse guidelines from the United States and other countries, information from regulatory authorities, and physician awareness of adverse cardiac effects. RECOMMENDATION 1 (DISCLOSURE): Clinicians should inform patients of arrhythmia risk when they prescribe methadone. RECOMMENDATION 2 (CLINICAL HISTORY): Clinicians should ask patients about any history of structural heart disease, arrhythmia, and syncope. RECOMMENDATION 3 (SCREENING): Obtain a pretreatment electrocardiogram for all patients to measure the QTc interval and a follow-up electrocardiogram within 30 days and annually. Additional electrocardiography is recommended if the methadone dosage exceeds 100 mg/d or if patients have unexplained syncope or seizures. RECOMMENDATION 4 (RISK STRATIFICATION): If the QTc interval is greater than 450 ms but less than 500 ms, discuss the potential risks and benefits with patients and monitor them more frequently. If the QTc interval exceeds 500 ms, consider discontinuing or reducing the methadone dose; eliminating contributing factors, such as drugs that promote hypokalemia; or using an alternative therapy. RECOMMENDATION 5 (DRUG INTERACTIONS): Clinicians should be aware of interactions between methadone and other drugs that possess QT interval-prolonging properties or slow the elimination of methadone.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^112C9PEw]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

When a patient already receives methadone for OUD at an OTP, confirm their dosing information with the methadone clinic and continue it. If a patient missed doses, the OTP can guide methadone dosing, unless an addiction consultation team can provide recommendations.

In cases where patients prefer methadone and the QTc remains prolonged after addressing intervenable causes, hospitalists should communicate with outpatient clinicians and the OTP, document the risk-benefit conversation, and consider more slowly titrating methadone while monitoring the QTc if the patient is stable.

CYP3A4 interactions are not contraindications to methadone, and guidance from a pharmacist can aid in a safe titration plan. We can initiate methadone even if patients are unsure about continuing it after discharge or may want to switch to buprenorphine later. When patients want to continue methadone after discharge, connect them to an OTP, if available. Hospitals can partner with OTPs to directly admit patients and support rapid treatment access. Hospitalists can also request an exception to 1306.07(b) Code of Federal Regulations to dispense methadone for up to 3 days to patients with opioid withdrawal newly started on methadone who want to continue it after discharge while they connect to an OTP. Offer all patients naloxone and harm reduction as part of overdose prevention.

Recent case reports have raised concerns about the potential for methadone to prolong the QTc interval (QT corrected for heart rate) and predispose patients to torsade de pointes (TdP), a life-threatening arrhythmia. We present a case report that describes the successful use of parenteral and oral methadone in a patient with uncontrolled cancer pain and a history of QTc prolongation. We describe an approach to the use of methadone in this patient and review both case reports and recent prospective studies that have evaluated the risk of TdP and the long-term outcome with respect to the development of TdP in patients receiving methadone for chronic pain or addiction.

Daily dose is limited to Maximum 40 mg/day on first day, and the usual dosage range for optimal effects is 60–120 mg/day. Administration is orally in a single dose, and dosing should be individualized.

### Citalopram (Celexa) [^115AkAgx]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.2 QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes

CELEXA causes dose-dependent QTc prolongation an ECG abnormality that has been associated with Torsade de Pointes (TdP), ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death, all of which have been observed in postmarketing reports for citalopram [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Because of the risk of QTc prolongation at higher CELEXA doses, it is recommended that CELEXA not be given at doses above 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

CELEXA should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure unless the benefits outweigh the risks for a particular patient. CELEXA should also be avoided in patients who are taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Such drugs include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications, antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).

### QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes associated with methadone therapy [^1173mz8v]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Oral methadone therapy is an effective and increasingly popular treatment for opioid dependency and chronic pain. Although it is not typically considered pro-dysrhythmic, we present the unique case of a 52-year-old HIV-positive woman without underlying cardiac disease who developed QTc prolongation and pulseless Torsades secondary to high dose methadone therapy.

### Measurement of QTc in patients receiving chronic methadone therapy [^113S1QH9]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

Recent reports suggest that methadone may prolong the QTc interval and cause torsades de pointes. This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of QTc prolongation during oral methadone therapy and identify factors associated with prolongation. Patients receiving oral methadone as treatment for chronic pain or addiction were eligible for the study. One hundred four patients who were receiving ≥ 20 mg methadone per day for ≥ 2 weeks underwent electrocardiograms to measure QTc interval duration. Sixty-three (61%) patients were male and 63 (61%) were receiving methadone maintenance for opioid addiction. The mean (± SD) age was 45.3 ± 9.4 years. The median (range) methadone dose was 110 mg/day (20–1200 mg/day); median (range) number of months on methadone was 12.5 months (1–444 months). The median (range) QTc interval was 428 msec (396–494 msec). Thirty-three percent had QTc prolongation (males 40%, females 20%; P = 0.03). No patient had a QTc longer than 500 msec. Significant dose response was observed in males on methadone < 12 months (rho = 0.60, P = 0.02). Our study suggests that methadone may prolong the QTc interval in specific subpopulations but poses little risk of serious prolongation.
