## Question

25 yo F, previously healthy, presents with severe abdominal pain and new-onset anxiety; vitals stable, exam shows mild hypertension and tachycardia, labs pending; ED prescribes phenobarbital for agitation/abdominal pain (patient reports opioid allergy) — is this an appropriate symptomatic management choice?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether phenobarbital is an appropriate symptomatic management choice for a 25-year-old woman with severe abdominal pain, new-onset anxiety, mild hypertension, and tachycardia, given a reported opioid allergy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether the presentation suggests an organic abdominal process versus functional or anxiety-related pain. Then, I should verify phenobarbital's pharmacology, labeled indications, and safety profile, especially in the presence of pain. Next, I will review evidence-based alternatives for acute abdominal pain when opioids are avoided, including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and nonpharmacologic strategies. After that, I need to consider the differential diagnosis that could explain pain with anxiety and autonomic features, including acute hepatic porphyria. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit conclusion and outline safer, evidence-aligned management and monitoring steps, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: severe abdominal pain with new-onset anxiety and mild autonomic elevation (hypertension, tachycardia) in a young woman warrants a broad differential spanning surgical and medical causes, and I should not jump to conclusions that this is purely anxiety-related without a targeted workup, even though anxiety can amplify pain perception and autonomic signs [^70db7c6b].

> Now, I need to check phenobarbital's pharmacology and labeled uses. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate indicated for sedation, preoperative sedation, and seizure control; it is not indicated for pain management, and its labeling warns that in the presence of pain, barbiturates may cause restlessness, excitement, or even delirium, which argues against using it for analgesia or anxiolysis in this context [^46950c91] [^b87821ae] [^bd2e440a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sedation helping anxiety. I should verify adverse effects that could worsen the presentation: phenobarbital commonly causes CNS depression, respiratory depression, hypotension, and paradoxical reactions including agitation and anxiety; in a patient with undifferentiated abdominal pain, these effects can obscure the exam, depress respirations, and complicate ongoing evaluation, which is precisely why it is not a suitable first-line agent here [^fe9b0a0d] [^01369965] [^b87821ae].

> Next, I should review evidence-based pain management when opioids are avoided. Wait, let me verify whether analgesia truly masks diagnosis in acute abdominal pain; high-quality evidence shows that appropriate analgesia does not increase management errors, so I should not withhold analgesia, but I should choose agents with analgesic efficacy and a favorable safety profile in the ED setting [^4c3a5b32]. NSAIDs are first-line for many visceral pain syndromes (e.g., renal colic, biliary colic) when not contraindicated, and IV acetaminophen is a reasonable alternative when NSAIDs are unsuitable; both are supported by ED-focused guidance and systematic reviews of nonopioid strategies [^c4e8d6d2] [^9e3d93ca]. Nonpharmacologic measures like splinting and ice can reduce medication requirements and should be considered adjuncts [^c4e8d6d2].

> I will now examine the anxiety piece. Benzodiazepines are reasonable short-term options for significant anxiety in the ED when vitals are stable and there is no respiratory compromise, with lorazepam 1 mg IV q1h PRN or midazolam 4 mg IV q30min PRN as common protocols; I should confirm that benzodiazepines are not combined with other CNS depressants outside monitored settings and that we screen for substance use and respiratory risk before use [^e490f1ae] [^68e57472]. But wait, what if the anxiety is secondary to pain or a toxic-metabolic process? Treating the underlying cause and using the lowest effective benzodiazepine dose with reassessment is prudent to avoid oversedation and diagnostic delay [^notfound].

> Let me consider the differential that fits severe abdominal pain with anxiety and autonomic features in a young woman. Acute hepatic porphyria should be on the list because it classically presents with severe, diffuse abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety, and autonomic instability; phenobarbital is porphyrinogenic and contraindicated in acute porphyria, so using it here could precipitate or worsen an attack, which is a critical safety issue I must not overlook [^a0e6d1bc] [^60edeacf]. I should double-check for red flags and, if suspected, obtain a random urine for porphobilinogen and delta-aminolevulinic acid while avoiding porphyrinogenic drugs and initiating supportive care if positive [^a039282d].

> I should confirm other important differentials and immediate steps. Gynecologic emergencies like adnexal torsion, urologic causes such as urolithiasis, hepatobiliary disease, and mesenteric ischemia remain on the table; targeted labs (CBC, chemistries, LFTs, lipase, urinalysis, beta-hCG) and selective imaging (often CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast when diagnostic uncertainty persists) are indicated based on risk stratification and exam evolution [^70db7c6b]. Given the autonomic features, I need to ensure continuous monitoring and reassess pain, anxiety, and vitals frequently to detect deterioration early [^notfound].

> Synthesizing the risk–benefit, I should conclude that phenobarbital is inappropriate here. There is no analgesic benefit, there are meaningful risks of respiratory depression, hypotension, and paradoxical agitation, and in the wrong diagnosis (e.g., acute porphyria) it could be harmful; safer, evidence-based alternatives exist for both pain and anxiety, and withholding analgesia is not supported by evidence in acute abdominal pain [^b87821ae] [^4c3a5b32] [^c4e8d6d2].

> Final recommendation: I would stop phenobarbital and pivot to nonopioid analgesia (NSAID if no contraindication, otherwise IV acetaminophen) plus short-course benzodiazepine for anxiety if needed, while initiating a diagnostic workup for the cause of pain and monitoring closely. If NSAIDs are contraindicated, I should consider alternatives such as a selective COX-2 inhibitor per allergy phenotype guidance, and I will avoid other CNS depressants in combination unless in a monitored setting [^c4e8d6d2] [^28aa96d9] [^68e57472]. I need to ensure we screen for porphyria in this demographic and avoid porphyrinogenic medications until excluded, and I will document the rationale for avoiding opioids given the reported allergy, noting that many opioid "allergies" are non–IgE-mediated side effects and may be clarifiable for future care [^a0e6d1bc] [^210cbc45].

Phenobarbital is **not appropriate** for managing severe abdominal pain with new-onset anxiety in a previously healthy 25-year-old woman. It lacks analgesic efficacy, can mask clinical findings, and carries risks of respiratory depression, hypotension, and paradoxical agitation [^b87821ae] [^fe9b0a0d]. Benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam) are **preferred for anxiety** and agitation, while acetaminophen or NSAIDs are first-line for pain when no contraindications exist [^e490f1ae] [^c4e8d6d2]. Phenobarbital should be avoided unless there is a clear indication, such as alcohol withdrawal or seizures, and not for undifferentiated abdominal pain with anxiety [^5f91d8cb] [^46950c91].

---

## Pharmacological properties and clinical indications of phenobarbital

Phenobarbital is a long-acting barbiturate primarily indicated for seizure control, preoperative sedation, and alcohol withdrawal management [^46950c91] [^5f91d8cb]. It has **minimal analgesic properties** and is not indicated for acute pain management [^b87821ae].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of phenobarbital in this clinical context

Phenobarbital carries significant risks that outweigh any potential benefit in this scenario:

- **Respiratory depression**: Risk of hypoventilation and apnea, particularly when combined with other CNS depressants [^fe9b0a0d] [^b87821ae].
- **Cardiovascular effects**: Hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope are common adverse effects [^01369965] [^fe9b0a0d].
- **Paradoxical reactions**: Agitation, anxiety, and confusion can occur, especially in patients with pain or psychiatric symptoms [^b87821ae] [^fe9b0a0d].
- **Masking of clinical findings**: Sedation can obscure neurological status and delay diagnosis of underlying conditions [^notfound].

---

## Alternative pharmacological management strategies

Given the patient's opioid allergy and clinical presentation, **alternative medications** should be considered:

| **Medication class** | **Recommended medications** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Benzodiazepines | Lorazepam, midazolam | Effective for anxiety and agitation; minimal respiratory depression at therapeutic doses [^e490f1ae] [^6851fba6] |
| Non-opioid analgesics | Acetaminophen, NSAIDs (if no contraindications) | First-line for mild to moderate pain; no respiratory depression [^c4e8d6d2] [^9e3d93ca] |
| Antiemetics | Ondansetron, metoclopramide | Manage nausea and vomiting associated with abdominal pain [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines do not support the use of phenobarbital for acute pain or anxiety management in the emergency department. Phenobarbital is reserved for specific indications such as seizure control, alcohol withdrawal, or preoperative sedation, and is **not recommended for undifferentiated abdominal pain with anxiety** [^46950c91] [^5f91d8cb].

---

## Potential diagnostic implications and risks of delaying appropriate treatment

Using phenobarbital in this context may delay appropriate diagnostic evaluation and treatment by masking symptoms, causing sedation, and obscuring neurological findings. This delay could lead to **missed diagnoses** and worsening clinical outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Phenobarbital is **not appropriate** for managing severe abdominal pain with new-onset anxiety in a previously healthy 25-year-old woman. It lacks analgesic efficacy and carries significant risks, including respiratory depression, hypotension, and paradoxical agitation. Benzodiazepines and non-opioid analgesics are preferred alternatives. Phenobarbital should be reserved for specific indications such as seizure control or alcohol withdrawal, not for undifferentiated abdominal pain with anxiety.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions have been reported:

CNS Depression - Residual sedation or "hangover", drowsiness, lethargy, and vertigo. Emotional disturbances and phobias may be accentuated. In some persons, barbiturates such as phenobarbital repeatedly produce excitement rather than depression, and the patient may appear to be inebriated. Irritability and hyperactivity can occur in children. Like other nonanalgesic hypnotic drugs, barbiturates such as phenobarbital, when given in the presence of pain, may cause restlessness, excitement, and even delirium. Rarely, the use of barbiturates results in the localized or diffuse myalgic, neuralgic, or arthritic pain, especially in psychoneurotic patients with insomnia. The pain may appear in paroxysms, is most intense in the early morning hours, and is most frequently located in the region of the neck, shoulder girdle, and upper limbs. Symptoms may last for days after the drug is discontinued.

Respiratory/Circulatory - Respiratory depression, apnea, circulatory collapse.

Allergic - Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma, urticaria, angioedema, and similar conditions.

### Phenobarbital sodium (Sezaby) [^60edeacf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Phenobarbital-associated hypersensitivity reactions may include symptoms and signs such as rash, fever, facial or limb edema, and lymphadenopathy.

SEZABY is contraindicated in patients who have experienced hypersensitivity to phenobarbital or other barbiturates. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine) and hydantoins (e.g., phenytoin) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to SEZABY. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions are present in a patient treated with SEZABY, the patient should be evaluated immediately and SEZABY should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

5.8 Exacerbation of Porphyria

SEZABY may precipitate acute attacks in patients with acute porphyrias. These episodes may be life-threatening, and include symptoms and signs such as anxiety, confusion, limb or abdominal pain, hyponatremia, seizures, and muscle weakness. Therefore, SEZABY is contraindicated in patients with acute porphyrias [see Contraindications (4)].

5.9 Infusion Site Reactions

SEZABY is highly alkaline [see Description (11)]. Therefore, extreme care should be taken to avoid perivascular extravasation or intra-arterial injection. Extravascular injection may cause local tissue damage with subsequent necrosis; consequences of intraarterial injection may vary from transient pain to gangrene of the limb. Any evidence of pain, swelling, discoloration, or temperature change in the limb warrants stopping the injection.

Pharmacologic analgesia — opioid safety and co-administration guidance — Opioids remain the standard of effectiveness comparison for the treatment of acute, severe nociceptive pain but are associated with dose-dependent respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) depression. Avoid opioid use concomitantly with other CNS depressants outside of specific clinical scenarios in highly monitored settings, and because opioid use delays return of bowel function and increases risk of ileus, a bowel regimen containing a stimulant laxative is recommended for all patients receiving opioids unless contraindicated. Repeated use increases risk of dependence and addiction, and chronic opioid use after surgery remains a significant concern.

Definitions

Adverse Events are any untoward medical occurrence or effect in a patient participating in the trial, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with trial treatment. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavourable symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of the trial treatment, whether or not it is related to the allocated trial treatment.
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are AEs that Result in death; Are life-threatening; Require in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; Result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or Result in a congenital anomaly/birth defect

All AEs were graded for severity:

0. **None**: indicates no event or complication.

1. **Mild**: complication results in only temporary harm and does not require clinical treatment.

2. **Moderate**: complication requires clinical treatment but does not result in significant prolongation of hospital stay. Does not usually result in permanent harm and where this does occur the harm does not cause functional limitation to the patient.

3. **Severe**: complication requires clinical treatment and results in significant prolongation of hospital stay, permanent functional limitation.

4. **Life-threatening**: complication that may lead to death.

5. **Fatal**: indicates that the patient died as a direct result of the complication/adverse event.

7.2 Potential "expected" AE's in patients with multi-organ failure
Abdominal distension – new, clinically significant change in appearance. Considered severe if acute obstruction.
Abdominal pain – new, localised to abdomen and requiring more than just simple analgesia. Considered severe if not controlled with opiates.
Electrolyte disturbance – new change that is clinically significant requiring active monitoring or treatment.
Hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylactic reaction) – anaphylactic reaction.
Hypoglycaemia – new, clinically significant hypoglycaemia requiring active monitoring or treatment.
Ischaemic bowel – inferred on radiology or diagnosed visually, e.g. surgery or endoscopy.
Nausea requiring treatment with anti-emetics; Vomiting – any episode
Regurgitation/aspiration – any episodes

### Management of common symptoms in terminally ill patients: part II. constipation, delirium and dyspnea [^15cc707d]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

In addition to pain, patients who are approaching the end of life commonly have other symptoms. Unless contraindicated, prophylaxis with a gastrointestinal motility stimulant laxative and a stool softener is appropriate in terminally ill patients who are being given opioids. Patients with low performance status are not candidates for surgical treatment of bowel obstruction. Cramping abdominal pain associated with mechanical bowel obstruction often can be managed with morphine (titrating the dosage for pain) and octreotide. Delirium is common at the end of life and is frequently caused by a combination of medications, dehydration, infections or hypoxia. Haloperidol is the pharmaceutical agent of choice for the management of delirium. Dyspnea, the subjective sensation of uncomfortable breathing, is often treated by titration of an opioid to relieve the symptom; a benzodiazepine is used when anxiety is a component of the breathlessness.

### Naloxone hydrochloride (rezenopy) [^5c75bae7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:

Precipitation of Severe Opioid Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The following adverse reactions were observed in a REZENOPY nasal spray clinical study.

In a pharmacokinetic study of 30 healthy adult volunteers exposed to one spray of REZENOPY nasal spray, adverse reactions of abdominal pain upper, nasopharngitis and dysgeusia were observed.

The following adverse reactions have been identified primarily during post-approval use of naloxone hydrochloride in the post-operative setting. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypotension, hypertension, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. Death, coma, and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae of these events. Excessive doses of naloxone hydrochloride in post-operative patients have resulted in significant reversal of analgesia, and have caused agitation.

Abrupt reversal of opioid effects in persons who were physically dependent on opioids has precipitated an acute withdrawal syndrome. Signs and symptoms have included: body aches, fever, sweating, runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, yawning, weakness, shivering or trembling, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, increased blood pressure, tachycardia. In some patients, there may be aggressive behavior upon abrupt reversal of an opioid overdose. In the neonate, opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms also included convulsions, excessive crying, and hyperactive reflexes.

The following adverse reactions were observed in a REZENOPY nasal spray clinical study: abdominal pain upper, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. (6)

### Label: PREGABALIN capsule… [^175b07a2]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
- Angioedema can occur, and may be associated with life-threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Discontinue pregabalin immediately in these cases.
- Hypersensitivity reactions can occur. Discontinue pregabalin immediately in these patients. Exercise caution when prescribing pregabalin to patients who have had a previous episode of angioedema. In addition, patients who are taking other drugs associated with angioedema may be at increased risk of developing angioedema. Anyone considering prescribing pregabalin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness.

Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.
5. 5 Respiratory Depression There is evidence from case reports, human studies, and animal studies associating pregabalin with serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression when co-administered with central nervous system depressants, including opioids, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment.

When the decision is made to co-prescribe pregabalin with another CNS depressant, particularly an opioid, or to prescribe pregabalin to patients with underlying respiratory impairment, monitor patients for symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation, and consider initiating pregabalin at a low dose. The management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and reduction or withdrawal of CNS depressants. There is more limited evidence from case reports, animal studies, and human studies associating pregabalin with serious respiratory depression, without co-administered CNS depressants or without underlying respiratory impairment.
5. 7 Peripheral Edema Pregabalin treatment may cause peripheral edema.

In short-term trials of patients without clinically significant heart or peripheral vascular disease, there was no apparent association between peripheral edema and cardiovascular complications such as hypertension or congestive heart failure. Peripheral edema was not associated with laboratory changes suggestive of deterioration in renal or hepatic function.

Searching other resources

To limit publication bias, searches were conducted in Clinical-Trials.gov website, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR). Abstracts of the conference proceedings of the relevant disciplines were also searched (past 5 years) to identify any presented but not published abstracts. We also contacted the experts in the field and inquired about the possible ongoing trials that might not have been identified in our search. Unpublished or "in press" trials that met inclusion criteria were eligible for inclusion if only the authors responded to inquiry from ACM with requested primary data sets or unpublished results.

Selection of studies

Three authors (ACM, AMK, and AACB) reviewed the titles and abstracts to determine eligibility for inclusion based on relevance. Studies eligible for inclusion were prospective and randomized clinical trials enrolling patients with AAP treated in acute care environments (ED, ICU, and postoperative). The butyrophenone of interest must have been administered by either the IV or intramuscular route. Acceptable comparison groups included placebo, opiate only, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or acetaminophen. The full articles of relevant abstracts were obtained and reviewed in their entirety.

Data extraction and management

Reference management and application of inclusion/exclusion criteria was performed with Rayyan (Qatar Computing Research Institute, Ar-Rayyan, Qatar;). Three authors applied inclusion exclusion criteria (ACM, AMK, and YM). Four review authors (ACM, AMK, AACB, and YM) extracted data onto a pre-designed structured data extraction forms. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. We arranged translation of any papers by experts where necessary.

Assessment of reporting biases and quality assessment

Three review authors (AMK, AACB, and YM) independently assessed the risk of bias using two validated tools: Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE), and RoB 2.0: "Revised tool for Risk of Bias in randomized trials". ACM reviewed the Risk of Bias assessments. The review authors considered methods of randomization and allocation, blinding (of treatment administrator, participants, and outcome assessors), selective outcome reporting (eg, failure to report adverse events), and incomplete outcome data. Each trial was graded as high, low, or unclear risk of bias for each of these criteria.

Because of the clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the studies, the intended meta-analysis was omitted.

5.1 Opioid Withdrawal

Clusters of symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, including hyperhidrosis, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anxiety, irritability, and yawning have occurred in patients treated with MOVANTIK [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In addition, patients receiving methadone as therapy for their pain condition were observed in clinical trials to have a higher frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions that may have been related to opioid withdrawal than patients receiving other opioids [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients having disruptions to the blood-brain barrier may be at increased risk for opioid withdrawal or reduced analgesia. Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using MOVANTIK in such patients. Monitor for symptoms of opioid withdrawal in such patients.

5.2 Severe Abdominal Pain and/or Diarrhea

Reports of severe abdominal pain and/or diarrhea have been reported, some of which resulted in hospitalization. Most of the cases of severe abdominal pain were reported in patients taking the 25 mg dosage. Symptoms generally occurred within a few days of initiation of MOVANTIK. Monitor patients for the development of abdominal pain and/or diarrhea with MOVANTIK and discontinue therapy if severe symptoms occur. Consider restarting MOVANTIK at 12.5 mg once daily, if appropriate.

5.3 Gastrointestinal Perforation

Cases of gastrointestinal (GI) perforation have been reported with use of peripherally acting opioid antagonists, including MOVANTIK. Postmarketing cases of GI perforation, including fatal cases, were reported when MOVANTIK was used in patients at risk of GI perforation (e.g., infiltrative gastrointestinal tract malignancy, recent gastrointestinal tract surgery, diverticular disease including diverticulitis, ischemic colitis, or concomitantly treated with bevacizumab). MOVANTIK is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction or in patients at risk of recurrent obstruction [see Contraindications (4)]. Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using MOVANTIK in patients with these conditions or other conditions which might result in impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal tract wall (e.g. Crohn's disease). Monitor for the development of severe, persistent or worsening abdominal pain; discontinue MOVANTIK in patients who develop this symptom.

Results

Part 2 of the guidelines on responsible opioid prescribing provides the following recommendations for initiating and maintaining chronic opioid therapy of 90 days or longer. 1. A) Comprehensive assessment and documentation is recommended before initiating opioid therapy, including documentation of comprehensive history, general medical condition, psychosocial history, psychiatric status, and substance use history. (

Evidence

good) B) Despite limited evidence for reliability and accuracy, screening for opioid use is recommended, as it will identify opioid abusers and reduce opioid abuse. (

Evidence

limited) C) Prescription monitoring programs must be implemented, as they provide data on patterns of prescription usage, reduce prescription drug abuse or doctor shopping. (

Evidence

good to fair) D) Urine drug testing (UDT) must be implemented from initiation along with subsequent adherence monitoring to decrease prescription drug abuse or illicit drug use when patients are in chronic pain management therapy. (

Evidence

good) 2. A) Establish appropriate physical diagnosis and psychological diagnosis if available prior to initiating opioid therapy. (

Evidence

good) B) Caution must be exercised in ordering various imaging and other evaluations, interpretation and communication with the patient, to avoid increased fear, activity restriction, requests for increased opioids, and maladaptive behaviors. (

Evidence

good) C) Stratify patients into one of the 3 risk categories - low, medium, or high risk. D) A pain management consultation, may assist non-pain physicians, if high-dose opioid therapy is utilized. (

Evidence

fair) 3. Essential to establish medical necessity prior to initiation or maintenance of opioid therapy. (

Evidence

good) 4. Establish treatment goals of opioid therapy with regard to pain relief and improvement in function. (

Evidence

good) 5. A) Long-acting opioids in high doses are recommended only in specific circumstances with severe intractable pain that is not amenable to short-acting or moderate doses of long-acting opioids, as there is no significant difference between long-acting and short-acting opioids for their effectiveness or adverse effects. (

Evidence

fair) B) The relative and absolute contraindications to opioid use in chronic non-cancer pain must be evaluated including respiratory instability, acute psychiatric instability, uncontrolled suicide risk, active or history of alcohol or substance abuse, confirmed allergy to opioid agents, coadministration of drugs capable of inducing life-limiting drug interaction, concomitant use of benzodiazepines, active diversion of controlled substances, and concomitant use of heavy doses of central nervous system depressants. (

Evidence

fair to limited) 6. A robust agreement which is followed by all parties is essential in initiating and maintaining opioid therapy as such agreements reduce overuse, misuse, abuse, and diversion. (

Evidence

fair) 7. A) Once medical necessity is established, opioid therapy may be initiated with low doses and short-acting drugs with appropriate monitoring to provide effective relief and avoid side effects. (

Evidence

fair for short-term effectiveness, limited for long-term effectiveness) B) Up to 40 mg of morphine equivalent is considered as low dose, 41 to 90 mg of morphine equivalent as a moderate dose, and greater than 91 mg of morphine equivalence as high dose. (

Evidence

fair) C) In reference to long-acting opioids, titration must be carried out with caution and overdose and misuse must be avoided. (

Evidence

good) 8. A) Methadone is recommended for use in late stages after failure of other opioid therapy and only by clinicians with specific training in the risks and uses. (

Evidence

limited) B) Monitoring recommendation for methadone prescription is that an electrocardiogram should be obtained prior to initiation, at 30 days and yearly thereafter. (

Evidence

fair) 9. In order to reduce prescription drug abuse and doctor shopping, adherence monitoring by UDT and PMDPs provide evidence that is essential to the identification of those patients who are non-compliant or abusing prescription drugs or illicit drugs. (

Evidence

fair) 10. Constipation must be closely monitored and a bowel regimen be initiated as soon as deemed necessary. (

Evidence

good) 11. Chronic opioid therapy may be continued, with continuous adherence monitoring, in well-selected populations, in conjunction with or after failure of other modalities of treatments with improvement in physical and functional status and minimal adverse effects. (

Evidence

fair).

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: evaluation and diagnosis… [^70db7c6b]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

20, 29, 30 Hepatobiliary markers such as transaminase, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase levels help identify hepatic or ischemic disease processes. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values suggest prerenal, intrarenal, or postrenal etiologies of acute kidney injury. Urinalysis findings may indicate urinary tract infection or urolithiasis. The absence of hematuria does not exclude urolithiasis because 16% of patients with a confirmed diagnosis do not have microscopic hematuria. 31 Strained urine collects stones for subsequent analysis. In patients with suspected sepsis or mesenteric ischemia, serum lactate should be checked even though the level may be normal in early sepsis. 2 A clinical diagnosis of diverticulitis is reasonable for patients who are immunocompetent without risk factors for complicated diverticulitis.

21, 47, 56 The American College of Physicians recommends imaging in patients with diagnostic uncertainty or risk factors for complicated diverticulitis. 47 These risk factors include symptoms for more than five days, signs of peritonitis or obstruction, rectal bleeding, history of multiple occurrences, and immunocompromise. 21, 47 CT is the modality of choice. 21, 34 POCUS can identify uncomplicated diverticulitis and patients who require additional imaging. 45, 56. In patients with right lower quadrant pain, abdominopelvic CT with intravenous contrast media is the most accurate stand-alone test and the current standard of care in the United States. Acute onset flank pain may indicate urolithiasis. An expert consensus panel applied systematic review findings and endorsed no imaging in patients younger than 35 years with typical symptoms, hematuria, pain relief with analgesics, and a previous stone history.

GYNECOLOGIC Adnexal torsion, a gynecologic emergency, often presents with nonspecific symptoms of lower abdominal pain. Nausea, vomiting, peritoneal signs, white blood cell counts greater than 11, 000 per μL (11 × 10. The higher rates of atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation in older patients are risk factors because approximately 50% of acute mesenteric ischemia events are caused by emboli. 50 If mesenteric ischemia is suspected, CT angiography is indicated, even in patients with renal insufficiency, because delayed or missed diagnosis is more detrimental than intravenous contrast media exposure. 50, 51.

### General anaesthesia in end-of-life care: extending the indications for anaesthesia beyond surgery [^9a0cf2df]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

The specific need for sedation over and above opioid analgesia in end‐of‐life care is variable, reported as being between 3% and 51% in different case series. This may reflect differences in local practices and the host of different terms used, including: 'palliative sedation', 'terminal sedation' or 'continuous deep sedation'. In this paper, we will use the latter term. Current UK guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), supported by the Royal College of Anaesthetists, makes no specific recommendations about sedation, and instead constitutes broad principles underlying the management of end‐of‐life care.

Regardless of the intended level of sedation, what is actually experienced by patients receiving continuous deep sedation varies. Some patients are lightly sedated, others are mostly unconscious, stirring intermittently or only in response to vigorous stimulation, while others are almost anaesthetised. In part, this is because a variety of techniques, drugs and doses are used. Benzodiazepines are employed commonly (usually midazolam), but other drugs, including barbiturates (such as phenobarbital), are also prescribed. Moreover, 'sedation' encompasses a continuous spectrum, with anxiolysis in an awake patient at one extreme and a state approaching general anaesthesia at the other. There is no clear clinical or neuroscientific cut‐off between these states of loss of consciousness, and the term 'dysanaesthesia' has been used to describe one such 'in‐between' state. Sedation typically means that verbal contact with the patient is retained; that is, they are co‐operative when aroused. By contrast, general anaesthesia refers to a state where the patient is unarousable even to painful stimuli.

### Recurrent abdominal pain visits to the emergency department: a case report using the central sensitization inventory [^749d848a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain conditions are among the most common complaints seen in the emergency department (ED). Exacerbations of these conditions are often approached as one would an acute painful condition, with liberal use of imaging, labs, and analgesics. This patient population is often prescribed short courses of opioids without a definite explanation for their painful episodes and often leave the ED dissatisfied with their experience. We describe a patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain who presented to the ED with an exacerbation of his pain. Upon further review of his previous records, we noted that this patient experienced many similar events, resulting in 46 imaging studies over the past year. At this point, the patient was given the Central Sensitization Inventory, and his score demonstrated severe underlying central sensitization. The patient was counseled about his condition and provided with appropriate follow-up care.

Conclusions

Patients with acute alcohol withdrawal who were discharged from the ED after receiving phenobarbital were less likely to return to the ED within three days when compared to patients who received benzodiazepines alone. Despite similar baseline characteristics, patients who received phenobarbital were provided higher lorazepam equivalents. A prospective, randomized trial is needed to verify these results.

### Allergy alerting and overrides for opioid analogues across two health systems [^210cbc45]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). High credibility.

Analysis of reaction type and severity reveals this is a critical element to consider when tailoring alerts. Nevertheless, it is also important to keep in mind when creating algorithms to consider other patient-specific concerns that may be documented as an allergy, intolerance or non-life-threatening side effects such as a patient who gets opioid-induced itching (without urticaria or anaphylaxis) or codeine-induced chest pain (oesophagitis-like) reactions. There is a balance to consider alongside clinical judgement, and we focused on one potential area to reduce interruptive alerts with reaction type and severity levels.

Based on previous studies, most opioid alerts are triggered by non-immune-mediated reactions, including opioid side effects. Among the overridden alerts, approximately one-third of reactions are true immune-mediated reactions (29.3%) and 72.8% were associated with mild and medium reactions. Furthermore, 7% of all opioid overridden entries which were mild reactions at both institutions would still trigger an interruptive alert with the new algorithm. The high proportion of override rates associated with entries of low severity indicates that allergy entries with mild reactions may be appropriate to not trigger interruptive alerts. Our findings indicate that strategically assigning interruptive alerts for severe reactions has the potential to reduce interruptive alerts. Discriminating between opioid immune-mediated reactions may also reduce overrides notably, as non-immune-mediated side effects were overridden 70.7% of the time.

Our findings also uncovered that over a quarter of overridden alerts are triggered by severe allergies. The concerning implications of overriding alerts associated with severe allergic reactions warrant greater analysis to evaluate why they are overridden. According to previous studies, physician-reported override reasons include previous tolerance of the medication, absence of a true allergy and a lack of reasonable alternative. These high override rates may be reflective of the effects of alert fatigue. As with excessive, untargeted alerting, clinicians may be more likely to insensitively trigger alerts despite varying levels of severity, as they are conditioned to override alerts rather than accept alerts. Greater investigation of the reasons for overriding highly severe allergy alerts can uncover what factors play a role in overriding alerts for more nuanced scenarios and the extent to which alert fatigue plays a role.

The management of undifferentiated agitation

When people present with severe agitation, healthcare staff may be unable to safely approach the patient and undertake a standard physical health assessment. Clinical investigations and clinical procedures are frequently not possible without sedation. Conversely, sedation is normally delivered in a highly monitored and controlled environment, with prior patient assessment and clinical optimisation. This is the paradox which ABD guidelines have historically tried to address, providing strategies (such as potent intramuscular sedation prior to the application of clinical monitoring) which differ from standard care.

Agitation guidelines will always require adaptation to specific care settings, considering differing expertise, resources, and the level of clinical risk related to unidentified or unmanaged conditions.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen (nalocet) [^7a24bc39]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

Limitations of Use

Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see WARNINGS], reserve oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics]

Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated,
Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia

Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

Second-line treatment

Cumulative effects of first-line and second-line treatment (levetiracetam, fosphenytoin and valproate) were assessed using data from 33 patients with pPNES unresponsive to antecedent first-line benzodiazepine treatment within ESETT.

Of the 28 patients for whom information on timing of first-line medication was available, 18 (55%) received benzodiazepines before arriving at the emergency department and the rest were medicated in-hospital. Ten patients (31%) were admitted to the ICU and remained there for up to twelve days (median: one day). Twelve patients (36%) were admitted to a non-ICU unit, and eleven (33%) were discharged directly from the emergency department. Overall, the hospital stay of admitted patients had a median duration of one day (range 1–12 days).

All patients were assessed for seizure manifestations and responsiveness at 20 and at 60 min after the start of the study drug administration. At 20 min assessment, clinically apparent seizures were observed in nine (27%) patients; at that time, responsiveness to verbal or noxious stimuli was not improved in eleven (33%) patients. At the 60 min assessment, three patients still had clinically apparent seizures (9%), while responsiveness was still not improved in nine patients (27%). The Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale was administered at the 60 min assessment (table 2). Nine patients (27%) were deeply sedated or unarousable at this point.

Table 2
Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score of patients with pPNES from ESETT at 60 min assessment

In eleven (33%) patients, a total of 13 adverse events were recorded (online supplemental table S1), four of which were rated as 'serious'. Four events were reported as being likely related to the study intervention: abdominal pain, hypersensitivity, hypotension and pruritus. The adverse events were graded as more severe in patients who received benzodiazepines before emergency department arrival than those who did not (Fisher's exact test = 10.455, p = 0.033). In two patients (6%), endotracheal intubation was performed. The adverse events leading to intubation were documented as 'depressed level of consciousness' in one case and 'cerebrovascular accident' in the other case.

### Effects of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with buprenorphine and morphine alone and in combination during the first 12 postoperative hours: a randomized, double-blind, four-arm trial in adults undergoing abdominal surgery [^85691f3f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Intense pain in the first 12 hours after major abdominal surgery requires the use of large amounts of analgesics, mainly opioids, which may produce undesirable effects. Buprenorphine (BUP) is not typically used intravenously in this setting, particularly in combination with morphine (MO), due to concerns that BUP might inhibit the analgesic effect of MO.

Objective

This study compared the analgesic effect of BUP and MO separately and in combination for postoperative pain control in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

Methods

In this double-blind study, adult patients were randomized to receive 1 of 4 regimens for 12 hours: a basal BUP infusion (BUP-i) of 0.4 microg/kg/h + BUP boluses (BUP-b) of 0.15 microg/kg each; a basal MO infusion (MO-i) of 10 microg/kg/h + MO boluses (MO-b) of 5 microg/kg each; a basal BUP-i of 0.4 microg/kg/h + MO-b of 5 microg/kg each; or a basal MO-i of 10 microg/kg/h + BUP-b of 0.15 microg/kg each. Bolus doses were delivered by intravenous patient-controlled anesthesia, with a bolus lockout time of 7 minutes. Diclofenac 75 mg IM q6h was available as rescue pain medication. Every 15 minutes during the first 2 postoperative hours and hourly thereafter, patients used visual analog scales to rate their pain (from 0 = totally free of pain to 10 = unbearable pain), level of sedation (from 1 = totally awake to 10 = heavily sedated), and satisfaction with treatment (from 1 = totally unsatisfied to 10 = fully satisfied). Blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) were monitored, and adverse effects reported by patients or noted by clinicians were recorded at the same times. Study end points included total opioid consumption (infusion + boluses), demand:delivery ratio, and use of rescue medication.

Results

One hundred twenty patients (63 men, 57 women; age range, 21–80 years; weight range, 40–120 kg) were included in the study. Seventy-four percent had other mild, treated diseases (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical class 2). Pain visual analog scale ratings were comparably high in all groups during the first 2 postoperative hours. Pain intensity ratings at 3 to 12 hours were significantly lower in those who received BUP-i + BUP-b compared with the other treatment groups (P = 0.018). The drug requirement during the postoperative period decreased significantly in all groups (P = 0.01); however, there was a significant difference between groups in the demand:delivery ratio at 3 to 12 hours (group * psydrug interaction, P = 0.026). The numerically lowest demand:delivery ratio was seen with BUP-i + BUP-b. BUP-i was associated with a significantly lower heart rate compared with the other groups (P = 0.027); there were no drug-related differences in respiration rate, SpO(2), or sedation. Patients' level of satisfaction with treatment was significantly higher in the group that received BUP-i + BUP-b compared with the other 3 groups (P < 0.001). Postoperative nausea and vomiting were mild and occurred at a similar incidence in all groups, as did rescue diclofenac use.

Conclusions

In these patients undergoing abdominal surgery, the BUP-i + BUP-b regimen controlled postoperative pain as well as did MO-i + MO-b or the combinations of BUP and MO. BUP neither inhibited the analgesia provided by MO nor induced undesired sedation or hemodynamic or respiratory effects.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Serious adverse reactions associated with codeine are respiratory depression and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest.

The most frequently observed adverse reactions with codeine administration include drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and constipation.

Other adverse reactions include allergic reactions, euphoria, dysphoria, abdominal pain, pruritus, rash, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis.

Other less frequently observed adverse reactions expected from opioid analgesics, including TYLENOL®with Codeine:

Cardiovascular system: faintness, flushing, hypotension, palpitations, syncope.

Digestive System: abdominal cramps, anorexia, diarrhea, dry mouth, gastrointestinal distress, pancreatitis.

Nervous system: anxiety, drowsiness, fatigue, headache, insomnia, nervousness, shakiness, somnolence, vertigo, visual disturbances, weakness.

Skin and Appendages: rash, sweating, urticarial.

Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.
Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.
Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in TYLENOL®with Codeine.
Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

### Pharmacological management of the agitated pediatric patient [^29669b9d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Children with behavioral or psychiatric complaints are often evaluated in pediatric emergency room settings, and may present as agitated or violent at any point during the evaluation process. Emergency department-based practitioners should be aware of risk factors associated with agitation and should be able to assess the agitated patient in a timely fashion. Management may require the use of pharmacological agents that can mitigate agitation safely and effectively, thus ensuring good outcomes for patients and emergency department staff.

### The clinical implications of cytochrome p450 interactions with opioids and strategies for pain management [^b9de4ab2]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic differences among opioids influence a patient's response to opioid treatment. An important element affecting a drug's pharmacokinetics, its metabolism, may be altered under various circumstances, thereby enhancing or mitigating a patient's response to opioids. The genetic background of the metabolic enzymes involved in opioid metabolism, comorbid medical conditions, older age, and the presence of other drugs that influence metabolism are such factors that can cause the response to opioid therapy to vary greatly from the expected response to a standard dose. As a result of the variability in individual responses to opioids, clinical management of pain with opioids must be empirical.

Benzodiazepines for anxiety in adult ICU patients — Recommendation 1 states: "There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of benzodiazepines to treat anxiety in adult patients admitted to the ICU", and the panel adds, "Due to a lack of evidence, the panel cannot currently make a recommendation regarding the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety in ICU patients", noting that "no studies directly answered our PICO with the exception of one before-and-after cohort study conducted in burn patients which presented limited evidence". Special considerations report that "Severe anxiety is experienced by more than one quarter of intubated patients 6 hours after the interruption of midazolam or propofol, while ten of 16 patients reported anxiety about the endotracheal tube at hospital discharge regardless of sedation", and caution that "abrupt cessation of benzodiazepines prescribed for baseline chronic anxiety may precipitate acute withdrawal; hence, continuation of the chronic benzodiazepines upon admission to the ICU should be considered".

Chemical restraint for agitation in children and adolescents — The most commonly used medications for agitation are antihistamines, benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics. Choice of medication(s) usually depends on many factors, including the severity and underlying cause of the agitated behavior, collaboration between ED, psychiatric, and pharmacy colleagues, and which medication(s), if any, the patient is currently taking. Diphenhydramine may be used for mild agitation. Benzodiazepines are common first-line drugs for medical causes of agitation. Either benzodiazepines or antipsychotics may be used.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^66f640e1]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methadone — indications, contraindications, cautions, and interactions: Methadone is frequently used to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms and is recommended for pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder. Methadone is contraindicated for patients with known hypersensitivity to methadone hydrochloride, those experiencing respiratory depression in the absence of resuscitative equipment or in unmonitored settings, patients with acute bronchial asthma or hypercapnia (also known as hypercarbia), and patients with known or suspected paralytic ileus. Methadone should be used with caution in patients with decompensated liver disease (e.g., jaundice, ascites) due to increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory insufficiency, concomitant substance use disorders — particularly sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorders — because interactions may be life-threatening, a current psychiatric diagnosis that may impair their ability to maintain daily attendance at an OTP, and in patients with low levels of physical dependence to opioids who should be started with low doses of methadone. Significant medication interactions include that methadone may prolong the QT interval and should be used in caution with other agents that may also prolong the QT interval, including class I or class III anti-arrhythmic drugs, calcium channel blockers, some antipsychotics, and some antidepressants, and that methadone is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway with many agents interacting with this pathway including alcohol, anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals, and macrolide antibiotics.

Opioid Withdrawal

Advise patients that clusters of symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal may occur while taking MOVANTIK, including sweating, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anxiety, irritability, and yawning. Inform patients taking methadone as therapy for their pain condition that they may be more likely to have gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as abdominal pain and diarrhea that may be related to opioid withdrawal, than patients receiving other opioids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Severe Abdominal Pain and/or Diarrhea

Advise patients that symptoms may occur after starting treatment. The patient should discontinue MOVANTIK and contact their healthcare provider if they develop severe abdominal pain and/or diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Gastrointestinal Perforation

Advise patients to discontinue MOVANTIK and promptly seek medical attention if they develop unusually severe, persistent or worsening abdominal pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Pregnancy

Advise females of reproductive potential, who become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant that the use of MOVANTIK during pregnancy may precipitate opioid withdrawal in the pregnant women and the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Lactation

Advise females that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with MOVANTIK [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

### Efficacy and safety of multiple doses of tapentadol oral solution in the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain in children aged 2 to… [^7a7a8e1d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients

Male and female patients were eligible to participate if they had undergone surgery that, in the investigator's opinion, would lead to moderate to severe acute pain that would require opioid treatment for at least 24 hrs after the first dose of trial medication and were hospitalized until the end of treatment. Brain surgeries increasing the risk of CNS side effects or gastrointestinal surgery procedures expected to affect tapentadol absorption were not included. Patients should have received morphine or hydromorphone as PCA or NCA with or without a background infusion of the same opioid (i.e. morphine or hydromorphone) according to standard of care prior to allocation to trial medication. Patients were expected to continue requiring opioid therapy by NCA/PCA after start of trial medication intake. Main exclusion criteria were concomitant diseases or disorders that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect or compromise patient safety during the trial, a current condition or history of CNS disorders or diseases (such as non-febrile seizure disorder, epilepsy, serotonin syndrome, traumatic or hypoxic brain injury, brain tumor), moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment as confirmed by local screening laboratory results, abnormal pulmonary function or clinically relevant respiratory disease, postsurgical clinically relevant abnormal laboratory or hematology values, or clinically relevant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. Subjects had to be clinically stable postsurgically and mentally capable of complying with the trial procedures. The following also led to exclusion: previous exposure to tapentadol; clinically relevant history of hypersensitivity, allergy, or contraindication to the supplemental opioid analgesic medication, tapentadol, the excipients, or naloxone; history of suicidal ideation or behavior; history of alcohol and/or substance abuse; or breastfeeding.

The following medications/procedures were prohibited for prespecified time frames prior to and following trial medication allocation: monoamine oxidase inhibitors, strong enzyme inducing drugs, methadone, neuroleptics, anticonvulsants (except for gabapentin used in association with surgery), antiparkinsonian drugs, all serotonergic drugs including selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, linezolid, triptans, St. John's Wort, long-acting opioids, sedatives (except for benzodiazepines for muscle spasms or anxiety), or peri- or postsurgical analgesia supplied by a continuous regional technique or patient-controlled epidural analgesia, opioid analgesics other than morphine, hydromorphone, and tapentadol, as well as continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^68e57472]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Although in some circumstances it might be appropriate to prescribe opioids to a patient who is also prescribed benzodiazepines (e.g. severe acute pain in a patient taking long-term, stable low-dose benzodiazepine therapy), clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently. In addition, clinicians should consider whether benefits outweigh risks for concurrent use of opioids with other central nervous system depressants (e.g. muscle relaxants, nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, and potentially sedating anticonvulsant medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin).
Buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder should not be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other medications that depress the central nervous system.
Clinicians should check the PDMP for concurrent controlled medications prescribed by other clinicians (see Recommendation 9) and should consider involving pharmacists as part of the management team when opioids are coprescribed with other central nervous system depressants.
In patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines long term, clinicians should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of continuing therapy with opioids and benzodiazepines and discuss with patients and other members of the patient's care team.
Risks of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use are likely to be greater with unpredictable use of either medication, with use of higher-dosage opioids and higher-dosage benzodiazepines in combination, or with use with other substances including alcohol (compared with long-term, stable use of lower-dosage opioids and lower-dosage benzodiazepines without other substances).
In specific situations, benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing.
Clinicians should taper benzodiazepines gradually before discontinuation because abrupt withdrawal can be associated with rebound anxiety, hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens, and, rarely, death. The rate of tapering should be individualized.
If benzodiazepines prescribed for anxiety are tapered or discontinued, or if patients receiving opioids require treatment for anxiety, evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy), specific antidepressants or other nonbenzodiazepine medications approved for anxiety, or both, should be offered.
Clinicians should communicate with other clinicians managing the patient to discuss the patient's needs, prioritize patient goals, weigh risks of concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid exposure, and coordinate care.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^1a152b01]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Overlap with IBS is common in severe or refractory FD, with more primary and secondary care consultations, prescriptions, and more severe pain. Somatisation and female sex are also associated features. The largest multicentre study of refractory FD, which was conducted in China, also reported associations with unhealthy eating behaviours, lack of physical activity, sleeping disorders, more medical consultations, increased drug costs and worse quality of life. A highly diverse and large range of associations have been reported in patients with severe or refractory FD, including iatrogenic, psychological, physiological, genetic, comorbid, socioeconomicand dietary. It is, therefore, clear that a multidisciplinary and multimodal management approach is needed. One RCT reported superior outcomes with an integrated approach involving gastroenterologists, dietitians and clinical psychologists, rather than a gastroenterologist alone, in a mixed population of patients with DGBI, almost one-third of whom had FD.

Patients with FD are willing to accept considerable risk in return for symptom cure. In one study, when asked about a hypothetical medication that could cure their symptoms, 50% of respondents reported they would accept a mean 13% risk of sudden death for a 99% chance of cure. This risk profile underscores that it is important to avoid iatrogenesis in those with severe or refractory FD. This includes avoiding opioids, which are associated with vomiting, constipation, more severe dyspeptic symptoms, higher rates of depression and worse quality of life in FD. Unnecessary surgery may also be a danger for patients with severe FD, and more severe symptoms and opioid use were more likely after cholecystectomy. Use of opioids should prompt consideration of the differential of the narcotic bowel syndrome, and chronic continuous abdominal pain with minimal association with physiological events raises the possibility of centrally-mediated abdominal pain syndrome.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^8b8ca328]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Managing acute pain in individuals with preexisting chronic pain — prevalence and opioid avoidance for common syndromes are outlined: Frequent headaches occur in up to 15% of adolescents, and functional abdominal pain occurs in 13.5% of children and adolescents. Some chronic conditions that PHCPs commonly encounter (eg, headache, migraine, abdominal pain) should generally not be treated with opioids; in these cases, opioid treatment might mask a more serious underlying diagnosis, and nonopioid medications are often more effective at providing symptomatic relief, and hence, in general, these pain syndromes should not be treated with opioids.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^6851fba6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Appendix N — medications for managing intoxication: Benzodiazepines (BZDs) (first line) are GABAergic and indicated for excitatory symptoms, anxiety/agitation, neuromuscular excitation, and seizures. Initial dosing includes lorazepam 1–2 mg IV based on clinical signs and symptoms and duration of effects; diazepam 5–10 mg PO for less severe symptoms based on patient parameters; and midazolam 5 mg IM or 0.01–0.05 mg/kg IV for acute agitation in adult patients, and redosing frequency and dose should be guided by the degree and duration of the clinical effects of the initial dose. Other considerations note parenteral vs. PO administration based on signs and symptom severity and drug availability (eg, parenteral BZD shortages), and IM administration allows for administration in agitated patients without IV access; lorazepam has very slow IM onset (15–30 min); midazolam has very rapid IV onset, allowing for easy titration, and a relatively fast IM onset; if psychosis is primary symptom, antipsychotics should be considered primarily or adjunctively.

### Pharmacologic management of the agitated child [^9c769f62]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Agitation is a chief complaint that causes many children and adolescents to present to emergency medical attention. There are many reasons for acute agitation, including toxicologic, neurologic, infectious, metabolic, and functional disorders. At times it may be necessary to pharmacologically treat the agitation to prevent harm to the patient, caregivers, or hospital staff. However, one should always be mindful that the differential diagnosis is broad, and a complete although timely assessment with targeted testing must be done before concluding that the agitation is rooted solely in nonorganic causes. There are various pharmacologic choices for the treatment of agitation, and they will be reviewed here. While treatment of agitation may be necessary to keep the patient as well as staff safe, as well as to facilitate medical evaluation in some cases, care must be taken to treat the patient with compassion, never using pharmacologic treatment for reasons of punishment or staff convenience. The focus is on the pharmacologic management of acute agitation of patients in the pediatric age group, in the context of a full evaluation for possible nonfunctional causes of agitation. Goals, risks, and benefits of medication use will be reviewed.

Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of stimulant intoxication — recommendations: Clinicians should evaluate the patient to identify causal factors for agitation and/or psychosis other than stimulant intoxication, and treatment should address all underlying causes. Clinicians should use verbal and nonverbal de-escalation strategies to calm patients who are agitated, delirious, and/or psychotic to support cooperation with care. Clinicians can consider treating stimulant-induced agitation or confusion with medication, and benzodiazepines can be considered a first-line treatment. De-escalation strategies should not delay the use of medication to manage patients who are agitated, delirious, and/or psychotic and at imminent risk for severe complications.

### Are oral medications effective in the management of acute agitation? [^b47a3b34]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Current expert guidelines recommend treating agitation with oral medications instead of intramuscular medications if possible. Oral medications are sometimes believed to be inappropriate for the emergency department (ED) as they require patient cooperation and may have a slower onset of action. This review examined published literature for the efficacy of oral agents in agitation.

Clinical Question

Are oral medications effective at managing acute agitation?

Methods

Structured review of PubMed of articles in which the first timepoints of evaluation were < 24 hours (i.e., the typical timecourse in the ED).

Results

11 articles included for final analysis. CONCLUSIONS/CLINICAL BOTTOM LINE: Treatment with oral medications is as effective as intramuscular medications in rapidly reducing psychotic agitation in the ED. Their use is thought to pose less risk to both patient and ED staff and is less coercive. There is little to no evidence about the use of oral medications for ED patients with extreme agitation.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^9e3d93ca]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 Question 4 (nonopioid analgesics) — evidentiary table summarizes emergency department (ED) studies with populations and eligibility criteria. Afshar 2015 evaluated "Randomized or quasi-randomized studies of adult patients with renal colic that included at least one nonopioid arm and reported a pain outcome" and reports "37 studies". Barnaby 2019 (2 affiliated academic EDs, Jun–Nov 2017) describes "220 patients, mean (± SD) age 42 (± 12) years" with inclusion "Age 21–64 years, pain severe enough to warrant IV opioids". Chinn 2019 (single ED in the United States, between Jan and Aug 2018) included "Age 18–64 years, weight 60–120 kg, < 7 days of severe abdominal pain (requiring opioids), requiring additional analgesia 1 h after receipt of ED pain medication". Farnia 2016 (ED in Iran, Aug 2012 through Aug 2013) lists "87, mean age 49 years" and included "Age 18–65, new-onset upper abdominal pain with concerns for biliary origin, VAS > 3, gallstones in bile duct evidenced by ultrasound and labs". Fraquelli 2016 summarizes "12 trials of 823 participants age ranges 18–86 years" as "RCTs recruiting participants presenting with biliary colic and comparing NSAIDs vs. no intervention, placebo, or other drugs".

### Pain management principles in the critically ill [^02181930]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

This article addresses conventional pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of pain in patients in ICUs. For the critically ill patient, opioids have been the mainstay of pain control. The optimal choice of opioid and dosing regimen for a specific patient varies depending on factors such as the pharmacokinetics and physicochemical characteristics of an opioid and the body's handling of the opioid, concomitant sedative regimen, potential or actual adverse drug events, and development of tolerance. The clinician must appreciate that favorable pharmacokinetic properties such as a short-elimination half-life do not necessarily translate into clinical advantages in the ICU setting. A variety of medications have been proposed as alternatives or adjuncts to the opioids for pain control that have unique considerations when contemplated for use in the critically ill patient. Most have been relatively unstudied in the ICU setting, and many have limitations with respect to availability of the GI route of administration in patients with questionable GI absorptive function. Nonpharmacologic, complementary therapies are low cost, easy to provide, and safe, and many clinicians can implement them with little difficulty or resources. However, the evidence base for their effectiveness is limited. At present, insufficient research evidence is available to support a broad implementation of nonpharmacologic therapies in ICUs.

### Do opiates affect the clinical evaluation of patients with acute abdominal pain? [^4c3a5b32]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Clinicians have traditionally withheld opiate analgesia from patients with acute abdominal pain until after evaluation by a surgeon, out of concern that analgesia may alter the physical findings and interfere with diagnosis.

Objective

To determine the impact of opiate analgesics on the rational clinical examination and operative decision for patients with acute abdominal pain.

Data Sources and Study Selection

MEDLINE (through May 2006), EMBASE, and hand searches of article bibliographies to identify placebo-controlled randomized trials of opiate analgesia reporting changes in the history, physical examination findings, or diagnostic errors (those resulting in "management errors", defined as the performance of unnecessary surgery or failure to perform necessary surgery in a timely fashion).

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study, abstracted data, and classified study quality. A third reviewer independently resolved discrepancies.

Data Synthesis

Studies both in adults (9 trials) and in children (3 trials) showed trends toward increased risks of altered findings on the abdominal examination due to opiate administration, with risk ratios for changes in the examination of 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 2.69) and 2.11 (95% CI, 0.60 to 7.35), respectively. When the analysis was restricted to the 8 adult and pediatric trials that reported significantly greater analgesia for patients who received opiates compared with those who received placebo, the risk of physical examination changes became significant (risk ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.14 to 3.98). These trials exhibited significant heterogeneity (I2 = 68.6%; P = 0.002), and only 2 trials distinguished clinically significant changes such as loss of peritoneal signs from all other changes; consequently, we analyzed risk of management errors as a marker for important changes in the physical examination. Opiate administration had no significant association with management errors (+0.3% absolute increase; 95% CI, -4.1% to +4.7%). The 3 pediatric trials showed a nonsignificant absolute decrease in management errors (-0.8%; 95% CI, -8.6% to +6.9%). Across adult and pediatric trials with adequate analgesia, opiate administration was associated with a nonsignificant absolute decrease in the risk of management errors (-0.2%; 95% CI, -4.0% to +3.6%).

Conclusions

Opiate administration may alter the physical examination findings, but these changes result in no significant increase in management errors. The existing literature does not rule out a small increase in errors, but this error rate reflects a conservative definition in which surgeries labeled as either delayed or unnecessary may have met appropriate standards of care. In published research reports, no patient experienced major morbidity or mortality attributable to opiate administration.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^19bda864]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to choice of agent and dosage, ASCO 2022 guidelines recommend to consult with palliative care or pain specialists when initiating or rotating to methadone in case of limited experience with methadone prescribing.

Treating severe pain in opioid-experienced patients

If patients with severe pain are opioid experienced, tolerance has likely developed with prolonged opioid exposure. Opioids should be titrated to the effective dosage, which may be high in opioid-experienced patients with severe pain. It is important to consider carefully complaints raised by patients about inadequate analgesia. In some cases, the patients may be experiencing tolerance, in which cases, judicious titration to a higher dose of opioids is appropriate. Tolerance to one opioid may also be addressed by rotating to a different opioid which may be effective at lower doses. In other cases, the patient may ask for higher doses because he or she is seeking to obtain more drugs. It is also important to consider the seemingly paradoxical condition of opioid-induced hyperalgesia in which prolonged exposure to opioids lowers the pain threshold. In the latter case, opioids should be tapered and discontinued in favor of a different analgesic regimen.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have advocated against high doses of opioids. However, high doses of opioids for individual patients might be justified, particularly for palliative care cancer patients at the end of life or patients in severe or very severe pain of likely limited duration (e.g. traumatic injury, burn patients, severe postsurgical pain). The use of high-dose opioid therapy may increase the risk of opioid abuse. In addition, high-dose opioid therapy has been associated with other health-related concerns, more severe pain intensities, and greater utilization of health care resources.–
