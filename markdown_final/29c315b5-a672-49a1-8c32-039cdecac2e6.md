## Question

Is chlorthalidone advisable for bp lowering bp in egfr 43

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chlorthalidone is advisable for blood‑pressure lowering in a patient with eGFR approximately 43 mL/min/1.73 m². Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the CKD stage and whether thiazide-like diuretics retain efficacy at this level of kidney function. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for chlorthalidone in CKD, including RCTs and regulatory guidance. Next, I will assess safety signals and monitoring needs, especially electrolytes and kidney function. After that, I need to consider dosing and titration strategies. Finally, I should integrate guideline recommendations and provide a clear bottom line with contingencies if eGFR approaches 30 or if loop diuretics are already in use [^1162LoMg].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and staging. An eGFR around 43 mL/min/1.73 m² corresponds to moderate CKD and falls within the range where thiazide-like diuretics often remain effective as part of multi-drug regimens for hypertension; most guidelines endorse diuretics in CKD to achieve BP control provided therapy is tolerated, with treatment generally considered at or above 130/80 mmHg and individualized to patient factors [^1162LoMg] [^116VhNKh].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility efficacy data. The CLICK trial, a double-blind RCT in stage 4 CKD with a mean eGFR about 23, showed that chlorthalidone starting at 12.5 mg and titrated up to 50 mg reduced 24‑hour ambulatory systolic BP by roughly 10–14 mmHg versus placebo over 12 weeks and improved albuminuria; the published summaries also note a modest improvement in eGFR at 12 weeks, although I need to be mindful that creatinine can transiently increase when BP is lowered in CKD [^113jY41P] [^113upVBB] [^114iszGH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions solely from stage 4 CKD; I will now examine whether these findings extrapolate to eGFR ≈ 43. Mechanistically, chlorthalidone's distal tubular action and very long half‑life maintain natriuretic and antihypertensive effects into moderate CKD, and smaller trials in eGFR 20–45 have shown approximately 10 mmHg reductions in systolic BP with acceptable short‑term safety, suggesting efficacy is at least preserved at eGFR ≈ 43 [^116AZZc7] [^115yW9gx] [^117XP6yg].

> I should confirm regulatory guidance to ensure safety at this kidney function. FDA labeling for chlorthalidone permits use above very low GFRs, advising caution when CrCl is 10–30 mL/min and avoidance below 10 mL/min; for the azilsartan/chlorthalidone fixed‑dose combination, use is acceptable with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and insufficiently supported below 30, which sits comfortably above this patient's eGFR of about 43 [^114e567E] [^112WxL4f] [^116vmf8Q] [^114f6491] [^116P8MN5] [^115EaUxs].

> Wait, let me verify key safety considerations and the monitoring plan. Thiazide-like diuretics can cause hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia; CLICK reported manageable hypokalemia and favorable effects on albuminuria, and FDA labeling recommends routine electrolyte and renal function monitoring, especially after initiation or dose changes; an initial eGFR drop up to about 20% is often hemodynamic and acceptable, but I should double‑check creatinine 1–2 weeks after changes and reassess if the rise exceeds about 30% or if symptomatic volume depletion is present [^113upVBB] [^114e567E] [^1139yZaT].

> Let me think about dosing. Although the FDA starting dose lists 25 mg qAM, in CKD I should start low at 12.5 mg daily and titrate every 2–4 weeks based on BP and labs, mirroring the CLICK protocol up to 25–50 mg if needed and tolerated; if using the azilsartan/chlorthalidone combination, typical titration is from 40/12.5 mg to 40/25 mg after 2–4 weeks, again with close monitoring for electrolytes and renal function [^115K9ArS] [^113upVBB] [^114f6491] [^117FYq3Y].

> But wait, what about comparative effectiveness versus hydrochlorothiazide. Large pragmatic data show no superiority of chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide for major cardiovascular outcomes and a higher risk of hypokalemia with chlorthalidone; however, chlorthalidone tends to provide stronger, more sustained 24‑hour BP reductions than equipotent doses of hydrochlorothiazide, which is clinically relevant in resistant hypertension, so I should balance potency against electrolyte risk and monitor accordingly [^111EyFYE] [^111actrK] [^1139wFbm] [^111poCTc] [^117XP6yg].

> I need to ensure I address scenarios near the lower GFR threshold and combination diuretic therapy. If eGFR drifts toward 30 or there is concomitant loop diuretic use, sequential nephron blockade with a loop plus low‑dose chlorthalidone can further reduce volume overload and BP, as suggested by short‑term randomized data in stage 4–5 CKD, but this increases the need for vigilant electrolyte and creatinine surveillance; in special populations such as kidney transplant recipients on tacrolimus, chlorthalidone lowered BP and proteinuria compared with amlodipine but transiently reduced kidney function and raised uric acid and HbA1c, so I should verify individual risk tolerance and monitoring capacity [^111sHuxv] [^115sZpht] [^117TNxRN].

> Next, I should review how guidelines synthesize these data for practice. Major guidelines endorse diuretics as part of standard multidrug therapy in CKD with elevated BP, typically alongside ACE inhibitors or ARBs, while acknowledging uncertainty around ideal BP targets and the need to individualize based on tolerance and albuminuria; in a patient with eGFR ≈ 43, this supports the appropriateness of a thiazide-like diuretic such as chlorthalidone as an add‑on to achieve targets if tolerated [^116VhNKh] [^1162LoMg] [^116bJBsk].

> Bottom line, after verifying the evidence, labeling, and safety profile, chlorthalidone is advisable for BP lowering at eGFR ≈ 43 mL/min/1.73 m², provided I start low, titrate thoughtfully, and monitor electrolytes and kidney function closely; I should confirm concomitant medications, volume status, and gout history, educate on sick‑day rules, and be prepared to adjust if creatinine rises excessively or if significant hyponatremia or hypokalemia emerges [^113upVBB] [^114e567E] [^1139yZaT] [^1162LoMg].

Yes, chlorthalidone is advisable for BP lowering at **eGFR 43 mL/min/1.73 m²**. It **remains effective in stage 3b CKD** [^113jY41P], with evidence of ~10 mm Hg systolic reduction and albuminuria lowering in advanced CKD [^114iszGH]. Use low starting doses (**12.5–25 mg/day**), monitor for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperuricemia, and adjust as needed [^114e567E]. Chlorthalidone is preferred over hydrochlorothiazide for its longer half-life and greater potency [^1139wFbm], but loop diuretics may be needed if volume overload or eGFR declines further [^111DXbTp].

## Efficacy of chlorthalidone in CKD stage 3b

In the **CLICK trial** [^113upVBB] (stage 4 CKD; mean eGFR ~23 mL/min/1.73 m²), chlorthalidone reduced 24-hour systolic BP by ~10 mm Hg and decreased albuminuria by ~50% over 12 weeks [^114iszGH]. At an **eGFR of 43**, chlorthalidone is expected to be effective because thiazide-like diuretics retain antihypertensive efficacy down to ~30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111DXbTp] [^116AZZc7].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Monitor for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperuricemia; these are more common in CKD and may require dose adjustment or supplementation [^114e567E].

- **Renal function monitoring**: Regularly check renal function, especially with other nephrotoxic drugs or RAAS inhibitors [^1139yZaT].

- **Dose adjustment**: Start low (12.5–25 mg/day) and titrate cautiously based on response and labs [^113jY41P].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

According to **KDIGO 2021**, thiazide-like diuretics are appropriate for hypertension in CKD, with monitoring of electrolytes and renal function. The **ESC 2024** [^1162LoMg] guideline recommends initiating BP-lowering therapy in moderate-to-severe CKD (including stage 3b) when BP is ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, if tolerated.

## Comparison with other antihypertensive agents

| **Attribute** | **Chlorthalidone** | **Loop diuretics** | **ACE inhibitors/ARBs** | **Calcium channel blockers** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Efficacy in CKD stage 3b | Effective; reduces BP and albuminuria [^113jY41P] | Effective, especially with volume overload [^111sHuxv] | Effective; reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression [^116VhNKh] | Effective; minimal renal impact |
| Safety considerations | Monitor electrolytes and renal function | Monitor electrolytes and renal function | Monitor for hyperkalemia and renal function | Monitor for edema and hypotension |
| Clinical recommendations | Recommended with monitoring | Preferred if eGFR < 30 or volume overload | First-line in CKD with proteinuria | Alternative or adjunctive therapy |

---

## Clinical scenarios where chlorthalidone may not be advisable

- **Severe renal impairment**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or CrCl < 10 mL/min [^112WxL4f] [^116vmf8Q].

- **Severe electrolyte disturbances**: Persistent hypokalemia or hyponatremia despite correction.

- **Gout**: History of frequent flares due to hyperuricemia risk [^116AZZc7].

- **Allergy**: Known hypersensitivity to sulfonamide-derived diuretics.

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Initial dose**: 12.5–25 mg once daily [^113jY41P] [^115K9ArS].

- **Monitoring**: Check serum electrolytes and renal function within 1–2 weeks of initiation or dose change [^114e567E].

- **Dose titration**: Adjust based on BP response and labs; consider potassium supplementation or a potassium-sparing diuretic if hypokalemia occurs [^111poCTc].

- **Combination therapy**: Consider with loop diuretics if volume overload or resistant hypertension [^111sHuxv].

---

Chlorthalidone is effective at **eGFR 43** for BP control, with evidence of BP and albuminuria reduction in advanced CKD. Use low doses, monitor electrolytes and renal function, and adjust therapy as needed [^113jY41P].

### Chlorthalidone for hypertension in advanced chronic kidney disease [^113jY41P]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The study CLICK, published by Rajiv Agarwal and colleagues in 2021 in the journal New England Journal of Medicine, is related to chronic kidney disease and hypertension. The trial question addressed was: what is the role of chlorthalidone in patients with advanced CKD and poorly controlled hypertension?

- **Study design**: The study was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: The study involved 160 patients (36 female, 124 male). Patients with stage 4 CKD and poorly controlled hypertension were included.

	- **Exclusion criteria**: Key exclusions included 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 100 mmHg; history of stroke or myocardial infarction; receipt of high-dose loop diuretics; and thiazide or thiazide-like drugs within 12 weeks.

- **Interventions**: Patients were assigned to two groups:
	- n = 81 received chlorthalidone (initial dose of 12.5 mg/day, doubled every 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 50 mg/day, for 12 weeks).
	- n = 79 received a placebo (matching placebo for 12 weeks).

- **Primary outcome**: At week 12, there was a significant increase in the reduction of 24-hour ambulatory SBP (11 mmHg vs. 0.5 mmHg; absolute difference 10.5 mmHg, 95% CI 14.6 to 6.4).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- There was a significant reduction in the urine albumin/creatinine ratio at week 12 (52% vs. 4%; absolute difference 50%, 95% CI 60 to 37).
	- There was a significant reduction in N-terminal pro-BNP at week 12 (30% vs. 11%; absolute difference 21%, 95% CI 35 to 4).
	- There was a significant improvement in eGFR at week 12 (2.7 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 0.5 mL/min/1.73 m²; absolute difference 2.2 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI 3.3 to 1).

### In advanced CKD with poorly controlled hypertension, chlorthalidone reduced BP at 12 weeks [^114iszGH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Chlorthalidone has been studied for its effects on hypertension in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The study, conducted by Agarwal et al. and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, examined the impact of chlorthalidone over a 12-week period.

- **Study findings**: The research demonstrated that chlorthalidone effectively reduced blood pressure in these patients. This reduction in blood pressure was observed as early as 12 weeks into treatment, suggesting that chlorthalidone may be beneficial for patients with poorly controlled hypertension in the context of advanced CKD.

Understanding the effects of this medication is critical for managing hypertension in patients with CKD, given their unique physiological challenges.

### Thiazide and the thiazide-like diuretics: Review of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and indapamide [^117XP6yg]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

The term thiazide is universally understood to refer to diuretics that exert their principal action in the distal tubule. The thiazide class is heterogeneous and can be further subdivided into compounds containing the benzothiadiazine ring structure — the thiazide-type (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide) — and those lacking the benzothiadiazine ring — the thiazide-like (e.g. chlorthalidone and indapamide) drugs. Thiazide-like agents are longer-acting and constitute the diuretics used in most cardiovascular outcome trials that established the benefits of treatment with diuretics; however, pragmatic aspects, such as lack of availability in convenient formulations, limit their use.

Regardless of class heterogeneity, thiazides have retained importance in the management of hypertension for over 60 years. They are reliably effective as monotherapy for a majority of hypertensive patients and augment the efficacy of other classes of antihypertensives when used in combination. Importantly, a thiazide-based treatment regimen lowers cardiovascular events, and their sturdy effect reinforces their place among the recommended first-line agents to treat hypertension in major domestic and international hypertension guidelines. There are few head-to-head comparisons within the class, but potential differences have been explored indirectly as well as in non-blood pressure mechanisms and potential pleiotropic properties. Until proven otherwise, the importance of these differences remains speculative, and clinicians should assume that cardiovascular events will be lowered similarly across agents when equivalent doses are used.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should it be [^114T3Cvz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

These key pharmacologic differences have contributed to the longstanding debate among clinicians and hypertension experts about whether chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide is superior. Multiple systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have previously demonstrated that thiazide-like diuretics better prevent cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality compared with thiazide-type diuretics. These systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, however, included many RCTs conducted before 1990 and few RCTs of indapamide. Consequently, the generalizability of the findings to the current era may be limited as the prevalence and nature of cardiovascular disease risk factors have evolved and as we have refined our knowledge about which classes should be used first line for hypertension treatment.

Observational studies have provided contrasting conclusions on this debate, with one finding no difference between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide, whereas another showed better outcomes with hydrochlorothiazide, not chlorthalidone. However, the follow‐up period in these observational studies was probably too brief to detect differences in clinical endpoints, and the conflicting findings are likely due to residual confounding. For these reasons, the available meta‐analyses and observational studies offer little practical guidance in thiazide selection.

Instead, what may be more helpful for clinicians is to recall the findings from more recent, large RCTs that have critically appraised these agents.

### Hydrochlorothiazide [^115qB3xy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Hydrochlorothiazide does not usually affect normal blood pressure. It affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosage, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic efficacy. Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate. After oral use, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours, and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.

- **Pharmacokinetics and metabolism**: Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized and is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. When plasma levels have been observed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life varies between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk.

### Initial estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and long-term renal function during intensive antihypertensive therapy: A post hoc analysis of the SPRINT and ACCORD-BP randomized controlled trials [^1139yZaT]. Hypertension (2020). High credibility.

When blood pressure (BP) is acutely lowered by antihypertensive treatment, renal function often declines. There is debate about the extent to which such a decrease in renal function can be accepted. An initial decline in renal function can be attributed to a reduction in glomerular hyperfiltration because of lower glomerular perfusion pressure but carries the risk of iatrogenic renal ischemia. Guidelines recommend that tapering of BP-lowering therapy should be considered when the initial increase in serum creatinine exceeds 30%, corresponding to an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decrease of approximately 20%.

Multiple observational studies have shown that an initial decrease in renal function is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. However, recent studies, including our own, suggest that the increased risk in adverse outcomes may not be causally related to a decrease in BP. In contrast, hypertension is an important risk factor and accelerator for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with diabetic and non-diabetic CKD, BP-lowering therapy is effective in preventing the progression of CKD and death. Moreover, BP-lowering treatment is important for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with and without CKD. It is therefore important to know the normal range of the initial eGFR decrease that is observed following the initiation or intensification of antihypertensive therapy.

### Blood pressure and kidney outcomes in patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate: a nationwide observational cohort study [^116vTPmc]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

The mean annual loss of eGFR was −1.49 (95% confidence interval −1.55 to −1.44) ml/min per 1.73 m² per year. The unadjusted eGFR decline per year increased gradually from −0.93 (−1.13 to −0.74) ml/min per 1.73 m² per year in those with an achieved SBP less than 120 mmHg at baseline to −2.14 (−2.39 to −1.89) ml/min per 1.73 m² in those with achieved BP greater than 160 mmHg. Similarly, eGFR decline increased with higher achieved DBP. The differences in eGFR remained after adjustment for confounders in all categories.

- **Annual decline in eGFR by blood pressure category at baseline**: See Table 2 for detailed figures.

- **Association between baseline achieved SBP and DBP on eGFR slope**:
	- (a) The association between baseline achieved SBP in mmHg and eGFR slope in ml/min per 1.73 m².
	- (b) The association between baseline achieved DBP in mmHg and eGFR slope in ml/min per 1.73 m².

	(a) Adjusted for baseline eGFR, albumin, calcium, phosphate, hemoglobin, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Blood pressure is expressed in mmHg. The eGFR slope is expressed in ml/min per 1.73 m².

### Tarpeyo [^112qTJQp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Of the 364 randomized patients evaluated for efficacy, 66% were male, 76% were Caucasian, 23% were Asian, and 20% were from North America. The median age was 43 years (range 20 to 73 years). At baseline, the mean eGFR was approximately 58 mL/min/1.73 m², with 60% of patients having an eGFR of 3.5 g/24 hours. Approximately 70% of patients had a history of hypertension, and 7% had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. At baseline, 98% were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and less than 1% of patients were on a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. At study entry, the median systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 125/79 mmHg.

The trial met the prespecified Part A primary endpoint based on an interim analysis of 199 randomized patients who had completed the Month 9 visit. The interim analysis showed a 31% reduction in UPCR in patients treated with Tarpeyo 16 mg once daily compared to placebo (95% CI: 16% to 42% reduction; p = 0.0001). In the final analysis of 364 patients, the percentage change in UPCR observed at 9 months was consistent with the results in the subset of 199 patients included in the interim analysis. The final analysis of the percentage change in UPCR during the treatment and follow-up phase is shown in Figure 1.

These blood pressure-independent effects are likely to be fundamental contributors to the differences in long-term endpoints between thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics. They are also likely to be the result of pleiotropic effects that are not governed by the targeting of the kidney.

**Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m²). In a dedicated renal impairment study, patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) showed no clinically significant difference in total parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels compared to subjects with normal renal function upon treatment with Yorvipath [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: Rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^113vL8hE]. American Heart Journal (2017). High credibility.

The trial employs a run-in phase for patients who wish to participate but are not immediately eligible due to existing diuretic therapy or the absence of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. This phase lasts 4 to 6 weeks. For patients currently using loop or thiazide diuretics, diuretic therapy is halted after obtaining consent, and they are reassessed after four weeks to confirm eligibility. For patients not on ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, after obtaining consent, an ACE inhibitor or ARB of the physician's choice is introduced and adjusted to a well-tolerated therapeutic dose over a four-week period. Eligibility is then reassessed. For patients on dual ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy, consent is obtained, and either the ACE inhibitor or the ARB is stopped, followed by a review to ensure eligibility. Patients meeting all entry criteria are consented and enrolled in the main SPIRO-CKD trial.

Once informed consent is received and baseline assessments completed, patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either spironolactone (25 mg once daily) or chlorthalidone (half a 50 mg tablet once daily, as 25 mg tablets are unavailable in the UK) for 40 weeks without blinding. Randomization is managed by the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit at the University of Birmingham using a computer-generated program with a minimization algorithm.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic renal disease [^116bJBsk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the development of end-stage renal disease, and all-cause mortality. It affects around 10% of the population worldwide. The prevalence of hypertension in individuals with CKD ranges from 22% in stage 1 to 80% in stage 4. Elevated arterial blood pressure is one of the major independent risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events; therefore, reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial, but could also increase the risk of adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and CKD remains unknown.

- **Objectives**:

- **Primary**: To compare the effects of standard and lower-than-standard blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease on mortality and morbidity outcomes.
- **Secondary**: To assess the magnitude of reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the proportion of participants reaching blood pressure targets, and the number of drugs necessary to achieve the assigned target.

- **Search methods**:

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database, and two trial registers up to 8 February 2023. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**:

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with hypertension and CKD that provided at least twelve months' follow-up. Eligible interventions compared…

### Chlorthalidone for hypertension in advanced chronic kidney disease [^113upVBB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Little evidence has been available to support the use of thiazide diuretics to treat hypertension in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease and poorly controlled hypertension, as confirmed by 24-hour ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring, in a 1:1 ratio to receive chlorthalidone at an initial dose of 12.5 mg per day. Doses increased every 4 weeks if needed, up to a maximum of 50 mg per day, or placebo. Randomization was stratified according to previous use of loop diuretics. The primary outcome was the change in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the change from baseline to 12 weeks in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, plasma renin and aldosterone levels, and total body volume. Safety was also assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 160 patients underwent randomization, of whom 121 (76%) had diabetes mellitus and 96 (60%) were receiving loop diuretics. At baseline, the mean (± SD) estimated glomerular filtration rate was 23.2 ± 4.2 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area, and the mean number of antihypertensive medications prescribed was 3.4 ± 1.4. At randomization, the mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure was 142.6 ± 8.1 mm Hg in the chlorthalidone group and 140.1 ± 8.1 mm Hg in the placebo group. The mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure was 74.6 ± 10.1 mm Hg and 72.8 ± 9.3 mm Hg, respectively. The adjusted change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure from ba…

### Blood pressure and kidney outcomes in patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate: a nationwide observational cohort study [^116WXjNA]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a leading risk factor for death and disability, including stroke, accelerated coronary artery disease, systemic atherosclerosis, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD and hypertension are closely associated with an overlapping and intermingled cause and effect relationship. A decline in kidney function is typically associated with rises in blood pressure (BP), and sustained elevations in BP hasten the progression of kidney function decline. BP control is essential for the care of patients with CKD, regardless of the underlying cause. Older randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational data indicate that higher BP is a risk factor for the progression of CKD, especially in patients with albuminuria.

More recently, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) investigated the effect of intensive BP control with a lower target (SBP < 120 mmHg) in people with cardiovascular risk factors but no diabetes. The results showed lower rates of the primary endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular events and death, in the intensive treatment group.

In people with CKD, two large meta-analyses and subgroup analyses from SPRINT also demonstrated lower cardiovascular event risk in those with an intensive BP treatment target. Whether a lower BP target also reduces the risk of kidney outcomes is not clear. In SPRINT, no positive effect was observed on kidney outcomes; instead, patients randomized to the intensive treatment group had significantly higher rates of acute kidney injury.

### Edarbyclor [^114f6491]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The starting dose of Edarbyclor is 40/12.5 mg, taken orally once daily. It can be used to provide additional blood pressure lowering for patients not adequately controlled on azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg or chlorthalidone 25 mg. The dose may be increased to 40/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks as necessary to achieve blood pressure goals, with the maximal dose being 40/25 mg. Edarbyclor can be administered with other antihypertensive agents and may be taken with or without food.

- **Dosing information**: The recommended starting dose of Edarbyclor is 40/12.5 mg. Most of the antihypertensive effect becomes apparent within 1 to 2 weeks. The dosage may be increased to 40/25 mg after 2 to 4 weeks, as needed, to achieve blood pressure goals. Doses above 40/25 mg are likely not useful. Patients titrated to individual components (azilsartan medoxomil and chlorthalidone) may instead receive the corresponding dose of Edarbyclor. Edarbyclor may be administered with other antihypertensive agents as needed.

- **Prior to dosing**: Correct any volume depletion prior to administering Edarbyclor, particularly in patients with impaired renal function or those treated with high doses of diuretics [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on chlorthalidone may switch to Edarbyclor, initially with a lower dose of chlorthalidone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Handling instructions**: Do not repackage Edarbyclor. Dispense it as instructed.

### Association between chlorthalidone treatment of systolic hypertension and long-term survival [^115sWPau]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

In the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial, conducted between 1985 and 1990, antihypertensive therapy with chlorthalidone-based stepped-care therapy resulted in a lower rate of cardiovascular events than placebo, but the effects on mortality were not significant.

- **Objective**: To study the gain in life expectancy of participants randomized to active therapy at the 22-year follow-up.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A National Death Index ascertainment of death in the long-term follow-up of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (SHEP) of patients aged 60 years or older with isolated systolic hypertension. Recruitment was between March 1, 1985, and January 15, 1988. After the end of a 4.5-year randomized phase of the SHEP trial, all participants were advised to receive active therapy. The time interval between the beginning of recruitment and the ascertainment of death by the National Death Index (December 31, 2006) was approximately 22 years (21 years and 10 months).

- **Main outcome measures**: Cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: At the 22-year follow-up, life expectancy gain, expressed as the area between active (n = 2365) and placebo (n = 2371) survival curves, was 105 days (95% CI, -39 to 242; p = 0.07) for all-cause mortality and 158 days (95% CI, 36–287; p = 0.009) for cardiovascular death. Each month of active treatment was therefore associated with approximately a 1-day extension in life expectancy. The active treatment group had higher survival free from cardiovascular death compared to the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95%).

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone [^115k7nVP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetics and metabolism: In man, absorption of an oral dose is rapid and consistent but incomplete. Approximately 50% of an oral dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, the remainder being excreted unchanged in the feces. Peak blood levels are reached between 2 and 4 hours after ingestion. Unlike propranolol or metoprolol, but like nadolol, hydrophilic atenolol undergoes little or no metabolism by the liver, and the absorbed portion is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Atenolol also differs from propranolol in that only a small amount (6% to 16%) is bound to proteins in the plasma. This kinetic profile results in relatively consistent plasma drug levels with about a fourfold interpatient variation. There is no information as to the pharmacokinetic effect of atenolol on chlorthalidone.

- **Elimination half-life**: The elimination half-life of atenolol is approximately 6 to 7 hours, and there is no alteration of the kinetic profile of the drug by chronic administration. Following doses of 50 mg or 100 mg, both beta-blocking and antihypertensive effects persist for at least 24 hours. When renal function is impaired, elimination of atenolol is closely related to the glomerular filtration rate; significant accumulation does not occur until the creatinine clearance falls below 35 mL/min/1.73 m² (see prescribing information for atenolol).

- **Atenolol geriatric pharmacology**: In general, elderly patients present higher atenolol plasma levels with total clearance values about 50% lower than younger subjects. The half-life is markedly longer in the elderly compared to younger subjects.

### Chlorthalidone for poorly controlled hypertension in chronic kidney disease: an interventional pilot study [^116AZZc7]. American Journal of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that thiazide-type diuretics effectively lower blood pressure (BP) in moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD; estimated GFR 20–45 ml/min/1.73 m²), chlorthalidone was added to existing medications in a dose of 25 mg/day after confirming poorly controlled hypertension with 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. The dose was doubled every 4 weeks if the BP remained elevated. The average age of the 14 subjects was 67.5 years. A median of four antihypertensive drugs were used, and the estimated GFR was 26.8 ± 8.8 ml/min/1.73 m². Twelve subjects completed the 12-week treatment phase, and the 24-hour BP, which was 143.1/75.1 mm Hg at baseline, was reduced by 10.5/3.1 mm Hg (p = 0.01/p = 0.17). Home BP prior to initiating chlorthalidone was 152.4/82.6 mm Hg and fell at 4, 8, and 12 weeks by 10.2/4.8, 13.4/6.0, and 9.4/3.7 mm Hg, respectively (all p < 0.05).

Maximal reduction in body weight and total body volume, as measured by air displacement plethysmography, was observed at 8 weeks, coinciding with the maximal elevation in serum creatinine concentration and plasma renin activity. Albuminuria was significantly reduced by 40–45%. Adverse events were noted following chlorthalidone therapy in seven subjects who experienced a total of 18 events: hypokalemia (n = 4), hyperuricemia (4), hyponatremia (3), transient creatinine changes (3), dizziness (2), hyperglycemia (1), and constipation (1). One subject had an ischemic stroke during the study. In conclusion, among people with moderate to advanced CKD with poorly controlled hypertension, chlorthalidone may significantly reduce BP via volume control.

### Chlorthalidone versus amlodipine for hypertension in kidney transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus: A randomized crossover trial [^117TNxRN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Chlorthalidone is a very effective antihypertensive drug, but it has not been studied prospectively in kidney transplant recipients with hypertension. Recent data indicate that calcineurin inhibitors activate the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter, providing further rationale to test thiazides in this population.

- **Study design**: Randomized noninferiority crossover trial (noninferiority margin, -2.8 mmHg).

- **Setting & participants**: Hypertensive kidney transplant recipients using tacrolimus (median duration, 2.4 years after transplantation; mean estimated glomerular filtration rate, 63 ± 27 [SD] mL/min/1.73 m²; mean systolic blood pressure [SBP], 151 ± 12 mmHg).

- **Intervention**: Amlodipine (5–10 mg) and chlorthalidone (12.5–25 mg) for 8 weeks (separated by 2-week washout).

- **Outcomes**: Average daytime (9 am to 9 pm) ambulatory SBP.

- **Measurements**: Blood pressure and laboratory parameters.

- **Results**: 88 patients underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, of whom 49 (56%) with average daytime SBP > 140 mmHg were enrolled. 41 patients completed the study. Amlodipine and chlorthalidone both reduced ambulatory SBP after 8 weeks (mean changes of 150 ± 12 to 137 ± 12 [SD] vs 151 ± 12 to 141 ± 13 mmHg; effect size, -4.2 [95% CI, -7.3 to 1.1] mmHg). Despite these similar blood pressure responses, chlorthalidone reduced proteinuria by 30% (effect size, -65 [95% CI, -108 to -35] mg/g) and also reduced physician-assessed peripheral edema (22% to 10%; P < 0.05 for both). In contrast, chlorthalidone temporarily reduced kidney function and increased both serum uric acid and glycated hemoglobin.

### Chlorothiazide [^1167KPSd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clinical pharmacology: The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Chlorothiazide does not usually affect normal blood pressure. Chlorothiazide affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosage, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic efficacy. Chlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate. After oral use, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours, and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Following intravenous use of chlorothiazide sodium, the onset of the diuretic action occurs in 15 minutes, and the maximal action is reached in 30 minutes.

- **Pharmacokinetics and metabolism**: Chlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney; 96 percent of an intravenous dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 23 hours. The plasma half-life of chlorothiazide is 45 to 120 minutes. Chlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk.

### Association between more intensive vs less intensive blood pressure lowering and risk of mortality in chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WzKdb]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Trials in patients with hypertension have demonstrated that intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality but may increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence and progression. Whether intensive BP lowering is associated with a mortality benefit in patients with prevalent CKD remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to investigate if more intensive compared with less intensive BP control is associated with reduced mortality risk in persons with CKD stages 3 to 5.

- **Data sources**: Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Science Citation Index, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov electronic databases.

- **Study selection**: All RCTs were included that compared 2 defined BP targets (either active BP treatment vs. placebo or no treatment, or intensive vs. less intensive BP control) and enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) with CKD stages 3 to 5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) exclusively or that included a CKD subgroup between January 1, 1950, and June 1, 2016.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two of us independently evaluated study quality and extracted characteristics and mortality events among persons with CKD within the intervention phase for each trial. When outcomes within the CKD group had not previously been published, trial investigators were contacted to request data within the CKD subset of their original trials.

- **Main outcome and measure**: All-cause mortality during the active treatment phase.

### Prediction of cardiovascular outcome by estimated glomerular filtration rate and estimated creatinine clearance in the high-risk hypertension population of the VALUE trial [^115Nn47C]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Reduced renal function is predictive of poor cardiovascular outcomes, but the predictive value of different measures of renal function is uncertain.

- **Methods**: We compared the value of estimated creatinine clearance, using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, with that of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula, as predictors of cardiovascular outcome in 15,245 high-risk hypertensive participants in the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial. For the primary endpoint, the three secondary endpoints, and for all-cause death, outcomes were compared for individuals with baseline estimated creatinine clearance and estimated GFR ≥ 60 ml/min using hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Coronary heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, age, sex, and treatment effects were included as covariates in the model.

- **Results**: For each endpoint considered, the risk in individuals with poor renal function at baseline was greater than in those with better renal function. Estimated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) was significantly predictive only of all-cause death [hazard ratio = 1.223, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.076–1.390; P = 0.0021], whereas estimated GFR was predictive of all outcomes except stroke. Hazard ratios (95% CIs) for estimated GFR were: primary cardiac endpoint, 1.497 (1.332–1.682), P < 0.0001; myocardial infarction, 1.501 (1.254–1.796), P < 0.0001; congestive heart failure, 1.699 (1.435–2.013), P < 0.0001; stroke, 1.152 (0.952–1.394) [P = 0].

### Outcomes in hypertensive black and nonblack patients treated with chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril [^113H6sFS]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

Few cardiovascular outcome data are available for blacks with hypertension treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium channel blockers (CCBs). The objective of this study was to determine whether an ACE inhibitor or CCB is superior to a thiazide-type diuretic in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in racial subgroups.

This research involved a prespecified subgroup analysis of ALLHAT, a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, clinical outcome trial conducted between February 1994 and March 2002. It included 33,357 hypertensive US and Canadian patients aged 55 years or older, 35% of whom were black, with at least one other cardiovascular risk factor.

The antihypertensive regimens involved either a CCB (amlodipine) or an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) compared to a thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone). Additional medications were added as necessary to achieve goal blood pressures of less than 140/90 mm Hg. The primary outcome measured was combined fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), analyzed by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CVD, end-stage renal disease, and other related health issues.

Results indicated no significant difference in the primary CHD outcome between treatment groups in either racial subgroup. In the comparison of amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, heart failure (HF) was the only prespecified clinical outcome that showed a significant difference, with an overall relative risk (RR) of 1.37.

### Effects of spironolactone and chlorthalidone on cardiovascular structure and function in chronic kidney disease: A randomized, open-label trial [^114Bb7rE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, treatment with spironolactone in early-stage CKD reduced left ventricular mass and arterial stiffness compared with placebo. It is not known if these effects were due to blood pressure reduction or specific vascular and myocardial effects of spironolactone.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point study conducted in four UK centers (Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and London) compared spironolactone 25 mg to chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily for 40 weeks in 154 participants with nondiabetic stage 2 and 3 CKD (eGFR 30–89 ml/min per 1.73 m²). The primary end point was change in left ventricular mass on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were on treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and had controlled blood pressure (target ≤ 130/80 mm Hg).

- **Results**: There was no significant difference in left ventricular mass regression; at week 40, the adjusted mean difference for spironolactone compared with chlorthalidone was -3.8 g (95% confidence interval, -8.1 to 0.5 g, P = 0.08). Office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures fell in response to both drugs with no significant differences between treatments. Pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups; at week 40, the adjusted mean difference for spironolactone compared with chlorthalidone was 0.04 m/s (-0.4 m/s, 0.5 m/s, P = 0.90). Hyperkalemia (defined as ≥ 5.4 mEq/L) occurred more frequently with spironolactone (12 versus two participants).

### Effect of the combination of bumetanide plus chlorthalidone on hypertension and volume overload in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4–5 KDIGO without renal replacement therapy: a double-blind randomized HEBE-CKD trial [^115sZpht]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

The co-administration of loop diuretics with thiazide diuretics is a therapeutic strategy in patients with hypertension and volume overload. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with bumetanide plus chlorthalidone in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4–5 KDIGO.

- **Methods**: A double-blind randomized study was conducted. Patients were randomized into two groups: the bumetanide plus chlorthalidone group (intervention) and the bumetanide plus placebo group (control) to evaluate differences in TBW, ECW, and ECW/TBW between baseline and 30 days of follow-up. Volume overload was defined as bioelectrical impedance analysis as fluid volume above the 90th percentile of a presumed healthy reference population.

- **Results**: Thirty-two patients with a mean age of 57.2 ± 9.34 years and a median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 16.7 ml/min/1.73 m² (2.2–29) were included. There was a decreased volume overload in the liters of total body water (TBW) on Day 7 (intervention: -2.5 vs. control: -0.59, p = 0.003) and Day 30 (intervention: -5.3 vs. control: -0.07, p = 0.016), and in liters of extracellular water (ECW) on Day 7 (intervention: -1.58 vs. control: -0.43, p < 0.001) and Day 30 (intervention: -3.05 vs. control: -0.15, p < 0.000). There was also a decrease in systolic blood pressure on Day 7 (intervention: -18 vs. control: -7.5, p = 0.073) and Day 30 (intervention: -26.1 vs. control: -10, p = 0.028) and in diastolic blood pressure on Day 7 (intervention: -8.5 vs. control: -2.25, p = 0.059)

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: Rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^115A2RoD]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency categorizes this trial as type A, indicating no higher risk than standard medical care. Patients receive close follow-up throughout the study, with continuous risk evaluation during the recruitment period. Within the SPIRO-CKD trial, both spironolactone and chlorthalidone are investigational medicinal products (IMPs). Any adverse or serious adverse events during the trial are reportable to the SPIRO-CKD Trials Office at the trials unit up to 6 weeks following the last administration of the IMP. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions related to the IMP are reported regardless of how long after IMP administration they occur. Management plans pre-determine responses to abnormalities in serum sodium, potassium, and eGFR (refer to Appendix 2).

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: To test the trial hypothesis, it is crucial that the change in blood pressure during the treatment period is not significantly different in each trial arm. Achieving a tight blood pressure target was deemed impractical. Therefore, a blood pressure monitoring committee (BPMC) reviews the blood pressure data after each block of 20 patients for the first 100 patients and after each block of 30 patients thereafter, until the end of trial recruitment. The BPMC may alter the review frequency based on its independent data review. Patients join the trial with controlled blood pressure to avoid anticipated complications.

### Long-term effects of chlorthalidone versus hydrochlorothiazide on electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy in the multiple risk factor intervention trial [^112ds7QP]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Chlorthalidone (CTD) reduces 24-hour blood pressure more effectively than hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but whether this influences electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy is uncertain. One source of comparative data is the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, which randomly assigned 8012 hypertensive men to special intervention (SI) or usual care. SI participants could use CTD or HCTZ initially. Previous analyses have grouped clinics by their main diuretic used (C-clinics: CTD; H-clinics: HCTZ). After 48 months, SI participants receiving HCTZ were recommended to switch to CTD, in part because higher mortality was observed for SI compared with usual care participants in H-clinics, whereas the opposite was found in C-clinics.

In this analysis, we examined change in continuous measures of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy using both an ecological analysis by previously reported C- or H-clinic groupings and an individual participant analysis where use of CTD or HCTZ by SI participants was considered and updated annually. Through 48 months, differences between SI and usual care in left ventricular hypertrophy were larger for C-clinics compared with H-clinics (Sokolow-Lyon: -93.9 versus -54.9 μV, P = 0.049; Cornell voltage: -68.1 versus -35.9 μV, P = 0.019; Cornell voltage product: -4.6 versus -2.2 μV/ms, P = 0.071; left ventricular mass: -4.4 versus -2.8 g, P = 0.002). At the individual participant level, Sokolow-Lyon and left ventricular mass were significantly lower for SI men receiving CTD compared with HCTZ through 48 months and 84 months of follow-up.

### Renal considerations in the treatment of hypertension [^114eZqGc]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

There are renal implications when employing intensive blood pressure control strategies. While this approach provides cardiovascular benefits in patients with and without chronic kidney disease, the impact on renal disease progression differs according to the pattern of underlying renal injury. In the setting of proteinuria, stringent blood pressure control has generally conferred a protective effect on renal disease progression, but in the absence of proteinuria, this benefit tends to be much less impressive.

Thiazide diuretics are frequently part of the regimen to achieve intensive blood pressure control. These drugs can cause hyponatremia and present with biochemical evidence mimicking the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Altered prostaglandin transport may explain the unique susceptibility to this complication observed in some patients. Hyperkalemia is also a complication of intensive blood pressure lowering, particularly in the setting of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade.

There are strategies and new drugs now available that can allow the use of these blockers and at the same time ensure a normal plasma potassium concentration.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^113Qw3rs]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Chlorthalidone is currently recommended as the preferred thiazide diuretic to treat hypertension, but no trials have directly compared risks and benefits.

- **Objective**: To compare the effectiveness and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide as first-line therapies for hypertension in real-world practice.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This is a Large-Scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation in a Network of Databases (LEGEND) observational comparative cohort study with large-scale propensity score stratification and negative-control and synthetic positive-control calibration on databases spanning January 2001 through December 2018. Outpatient and inpatient care episodes of first-time users of antihypertensive monotherapy in the United States based on two administrative claims databases and one collection of electronic health records were analyzed. Analysis began in June 2018.

- **Exposures**: Chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes were acute myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and a composite cardiovascular disease outcome including the first three outcomes and sudden cardiac death. Fifty-one safety outcomes were measured.

- **Results**: Of 730,225 individuals (mean [SD] age, 51.5 [13.3] years; 450,100 women [61.6%]), 36,918 were dispensed or prescribed chlorthalidone and had 149 composite outcome events, and 693,337 were dispensed or prescribed hydrochlorothiazide and had 3,089 composite outcome events. No significant difference was found in the associated risk of myo…

### Parallel-group 8-week study on chlorthalidone effects in hypertensives with low kidney function [^115yW9gx]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

The short-term effects of chlorthalidone in individuals with low kidney function are unknown. This study compared the effects of an 8-week treatment with 25-mg chlorthalidone added to ongoing treatment between hypertensive patients with normal kidney function and those with low kidney function, as assessed by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Exclusion criteria included the use of three antihypertensive drugs, severe hypertension, severe comorbidities, and unreliable eGFR.

The treatment period consisted of five visits at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Post-treatment laboratory evaluations were performed 3 to 4 days before the week-8 visit. The two groups differed in baseline eGFR (n = 60 for each group; mean eGFR: 39 for low kidney function and 76 for controls; range: 15–59 for low kidney function and 60–104 for controls), but not in sex, age, or baseline blood pressure.

At week 8, blood pressure decreased in both groups. For systolic pressure, the changes were -20 mmHg for low kidney function and -23 mmHg for controls, with 95% confidence intervals of -22/-18 and -26/-19, respectively. Diastolic pressure changes were -9 mmHg for low kidney function and -10 mmHg for controls, with confidence intervals of -11/-7 and -13/-8. There were no significant between-group differences in blood pressure changes.

The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups, with 15.0% in the low kidney function group and 16.7% in the control group. Baseline eGFR did not predict changes in blood pressure or the occurrence of adverse events in either group (P > 0.6). In both groups, post-treatment…

### Summary of revisions for the 2009 clinical practice recommendations [^111DXbTp]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

- **Prevention and management of diabetes complications**: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) cut points for the use of thiazide or loop diuretics have been revised. Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should include either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. To achieve blood pressure targets, if needed, a thiazide diuretic should be added for those with an estimated GFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m², and a loop diuretic should be used for those with a lower GFR.

Aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) is recommended as a primary prevention strategy in those with diabetes who are at increased cardiovascular risk, which includes most men and women aged > 50 years with one or more additional risk factors such as a family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria.

### Edarbyclor [^115Wkvwz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Chlorthalidone produces diuresis with increased excretion of sodium and chloride. The site of action appears to be the distal renal tubule (early convoluted part), inhibiting NaCl reabsorption by antagonizing the Na+-Cl-cotransporter and promoting Ca++ reabsorption through an unknown mechanism. The enhanced delivery of Na+ and water to the cortical collecting tubule and/or the increased flow rate leads to increased secretion and elimination of K+ and H+. The diuretic effects of chlorthalidone result in decreased extracellular fluid volume, plasma volume, cardiac output, total exchangeable sodium, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow. Although the mechanism of action of chlorthalidone and related drugs is not entirely clear, sodium and water depletion seem to provide a basis for its antihypertensive effect.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Edarbyclor tablets have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. Both azilsartan medoxomil and chlorthalidone lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance, but through complementary mechanisms.

Azilsartan inhibits the pressor effects of an angiotensin II infusion in a dose-related manner. A single dose of azilsartan equivalent to 32 mg of azilsartan medoxomil inhibited the maximal pressor effect by approximately 90% at peak and approximately 60% at 24 hours. Plasma angiotensin I and II concentrations and plasma renin activity increased, while plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased after single and repeated administration of azilsartan medoxomil to healthy subjects.

### Effect of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring guided antihypertensive treatment on renal progression in patients with chronic kidney disease: a randomized comparative study [^116QapKE]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). High credibility.

Adequate blood pressure (BP) control is pivotal for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD). The optimal approach for monitoring BP to delay CKD progression is not yet clear. In this study, patients with hypertension and CKD stage 3–4 were randomized into ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or office BP groups. All patients had ABPM at baseline and 18 months. The ABPM group additionally underwent ABPM at 3 and 6 months, with each result notified only for the ABPM group. The BP target was daytime ABP less than 135/85 mmHg for the ABPM group and office BP less than 140/90 mmHg for the office BP group. The primary outcome was a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during 18 months.

A total of 146 patients were randomized into the ABPM (n = 69) and office BP groups (n = 77). Although office BP was comparable in the two groups at baseline, daytime ABP was higher in the ABPM group (median 140 vs. 132 mmHg). Initial eGFR was 35.7 ± 12.5 ml/min per 1.73 m² in the ABPM group and 34.6 ± 12.0 ml/min per 1.73 m² in the office BP group. The eGFR change was -5.5 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -7.7 to -3.4] ml/min per 1.73 m² in the ABPM group and -5.0 [95% CI -6.9 to -3.0] ml/min per 1.73 m² in the office BP group (P = 0.704). Renal events occurred in 10 patients (15.6%) from the ABPM group and five (7.1%) from the office BP group (P = 0.120).

The present study did not show a beneficial effect of ABPM for controlling hypertension in CKD compared with conventional office BP monitoring in terms of renal outcomes.

### Blood pressure lowering and major cardiovascular events in people with and without chronic kidney disease: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114Pnykq]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

To define the cardiovascular effects of lowering blood pressure in people with chronic kidney disease, a collaborative prospective meta-analysis of randomized trials was conducted. The analysis included participating randomized trials of drugs to lower blood pressure compared with placebo or each other, or trials that compared different blood pressure targets, with at least 1000 patient years of follow-up per arm.

- **Main outcome measures**: Major cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or cardiovascular death) were evaluated both in composite and individually, as well as all-cause death.

- **Participants**: The study included 26 trials with 152,290 participants, comprising 30,295 individuals with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Data extraction**: Individual participant data were available for 23 trials, and summary data were obtained from another three. A meta-analysis according to baseline kidney function was performed. Pooled hazard ratios per 5 mm Hg lower blood pressure were estimated using a random effects model.

Results showed that compared with placebo, blood pressure-lowering regimens reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by about a sixth per 5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure in individuals with (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.90) and without reduced eGFR (0.83, 0.79 to 0.88), with no evidence for any difference in effect (P = 1.00 for homogeneity). The results were similar irrespective of whether blood pressure was reduced by regimens based on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium antagonists.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^116VhNKh]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

For patients with hypertension, particularly those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the JNC8 2014 guidelines recommend initiating an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as the initial or add-on antihypertensive treatment to improve kidney outcomes, regardless of the patient's race or the presence of diabetes.

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone [^116C7Kx8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**: Atenolol and chlorthalidone is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been observed in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including atenolol and chlorthalidone.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, which includes lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake, as appropriate. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, consult published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from various pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It can be concluded that blood pressure reduction, rather than any other pharmacologic property of the drugs, is largely responsible for these benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, though reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality have also been regularly observed.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of monotherapy with thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension [^1179wYUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose, and lipids.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014), and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

### Comparative antihypertensive effects of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone on ambulatory and office blood pressure [^1139wFbm]. Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Low-dose thiazide-type diuretics are recommended as initial therapy for most hypertensive patients. Chlorthalidone has significantly reduced stroke and cardiovascular endpoints in several landmark trials; however, hydrochlorothiazide remains favored in practice. Most clinicians assume that the drugs are interchangeable, but their antihypertensive effects at lower doses have not been directly compared.

We conducted a randomized, single-blinded, 8-week active treatment, crossover study comparing chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day (force-titrated to 25 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day (force-titrated to 50 mg/day) in untreated hypertensive patients. The main outcome, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, was assessed at baseline and week 8, along with standard office BP readings every 2 weeks. Thirty patients completed the first active treatment period, whereas 24 patients completed both.

An order-drug-time interaction was observed with chlorthalidone; therefore, data from only the first active treatment period was considered. Week 8 ambulatory BPs indicated a greater reduction from baseline in systolic BP with chlorthalidone 25 mg/day compared with hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/day (24-hour mean = -12.4 ± 1.8 mm Hg versus -7.4 ± 1.7 mm Hg; P = 0.054; nighttime mean = -13.5 ± 1.9 mm Hg versus -6.4 ± 1.8 mm Hg; P = 0.009). Office systolic BP reduction was lower at week 2 for chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day versus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day (-15.7 ± 2.2 mm Hg versus -4.5 ± 2.1 mm Hg; P = 0.001); however, by week 8, reductions were statistically similar.

### Effect of the combination of bumetanide plus chlorthalidone on hypertension and volume overload in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4–5 KDIGO without renal replacement therapy: a double-blind randomized HEBE-CKD trial [^117Xvy8e]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

One of the main adverse effects reported in the literature associated with thiazide use is hydroelectrolytic imbalance, hyperuricemia, or an increased diabetes risk. Our results did not show any significant differences in uric acid risk (there was no gout attack in any group), blood glucose, potassium, or sodium levels at the end of follow-up. There was one case of acute myocardial infarction in the intervention group, which required endoprosthesis insertion via catheterization. Cardiovascular function improved significantly following intervention; however, kidney function remained unchanged, with final GFR readings similar to baseline.

This study has some other limitations. First, the follow-up in our study was short; therefore, further prospective trials are needed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of this regimen. Second, there was patient noncompliance with dietary recommendations, even though all patients were evaluated and counseled in terms of renal nutrition, with an emphasis on sodium dietary restriction, as it is known that sodium excretion is directly proportional to kidney function and sodium dietary intake. Third, this trial was done at a single center which could limit generalizability. Fourth, this study does not include hard clinical outcomes, which may be interesting to investigate in future studies. Finally, most of our patients did not have a basal echocardiogram at the time of enrollment. Having an estimate of ventricular function beforehand may have allowed us to identify the presence of cardiac failure or changes in left ventricular function.

### Chlorthalidone vs. hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension-cardiovascular events [^111EyFYE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Whether chlorthalidone is superior to hydrochlorothiazide for preventing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension is unclear.

- **Methods**: In a pragmatic trial, we randomly assigned adults 65 years of age or older who were patients in the Department of Veterans Affairs health system and had been receiving hydrochlorothiazide at a daily dose of 25 or 50 mg to continue therapy with hydrochlorothiazide or to switch to chlorthalidone at a daily dose of 12.5 or 25 mg. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure resulting in hospitalization, urgent coronary revascularization for unstable angina, and non-cancer-related death. Safety was also assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 13,523 patients underwent randomization, with a mean age of 72 years. At baseline, hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 25 mg per day had been prescribed to 12,781 patients (94.5%). The mean baseline systolic blood pressure in each group was 139 mm Hg. At a median follow-up of 2.4 years, there was little difference in the occurrence of primary-outcome events between the chlorthalidone group (702 patients [10.4%]) and the hydrochlorothiazide group (675 patients [10.0%]) (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.16; P = 0.45). There were no between-group differences in the occurrence of any of the components of the primary outcome. The incidence of hypokalemia was higher in the chlorthalidone group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (6.0% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: In this large pragmatic trial of thiazide diuretics, no significant differences were found in preventing major adverse cardiovascular events between the chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide groups.

### Aldosterone-targeted therapies: early implementation in resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease [^112DGCT3]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Chlorthalidone, a thiazide-like diuretic, is often used to lower blood pressure and may help mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the CLICK trial, which included 160 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and Stage 4 CKD, the addition of chlorthalidone 12.5 mg/day versus placebo lowered 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure by 10–14 mmHg and decreased albuminuria levels over 12 weeks. However, chlorthalidone also significantly increased plasma renin and aldosterone levels, and co-administration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) has been suggested. Switching from hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide, to chlorthalidone resulted in additional blood pressure reduction in several studies. However, in a trial involving 13,523 hypertensive patients on hydrochlorothiazide, the rates of primary cardiovascular outcomes and acute kidney injury-related hospitalizations were similar between those who continued hydrochlorothiazide and those switched to chlorthalidone.

Furthermore, in patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², an adequately up-titrated loop diuretic is an option for managing treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH). Torsemide, a long-acting loop diuretic, inhibited aldosterone secretion by adrenal cells in a preclinical study and may be preferable to shorter-acting agents such as bumetanide or furosemide.

### Blood pressure and kidney outcomes in patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate: A nationwide observational cohort study [^1119v9En]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

- **Association between SBP and eGFR slope**: The association between baseline achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope was evaluated. Lower achieved SBP was associated with a slower decline in eGFR in patients with albuminuria grade A3. Specifically, an SBP of 100–120 mmHg was associated with an eGFR decline of −1.29 (−1.49 to −1.10) ml/min per 1.73 m² per year, while an SBP of 130–140 mmHg showed a decline of −2.01 (−2.18 to −1.83) ml/min per 1.73 m² per year. For SBP at least 160 mmHg, the decline was −2.22 (−2.41 to −2.04) ml/min per 1.73 m² per year (P trend < 0.001).

- **Association between DBP and eGFR slope**: Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than 70 mmHg in patients with albuminuria grade A2 was associated with a slower eGFR decline compared to all higher DBP levels. There was also a tendency for slower eGFR decline in patients with lower SBP and albuminuria grade A1, although this did not reach statistical significance.

- **Combined albuminuria categories**: Merging patients from albuminuria grades A1 and A2 did not significantly change the relationship between SBP and eGFR decline. However, the association between lower DBP and slower eGFR decline became statistically significant.

### Real-world impact of blood pressure control in patients with apparent treatment-resistant or difficult-to-control hypertension and stages 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease [^115SbSa8]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a leading contributor to preventable mortality worldwide and a major cause of cardiovascular and kidney disease, highlighting the need for improved blood pressure (BP) control strategies to reduce the associated burden on individuals and health services. For many patients, hypertension is adequately controlled with a regimen of up to three antihypertensive drugs. However, for some patients, BP remains above the goal despite treatment with three antihypertensive medications of different classes, or they require four or more antihypertensives to achieve the target BP. Such cases are termed apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (aTRH). Pooled data from 2009 to 2014 showed that more than 10.3 million adults in the United States had aTRH according to the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) 2017 guidelines definition of uncontrolled BP (systolic BP/diastolic BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg). When using the older definition of uncontrolled BP (≥ 140/90 mm Hg), 9.2 million adults met the definition of aTRH.

Compared with individuals with nonresistant hypertension, patients with aTRH are at an increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes, have impairments in health-related quality of life, and have an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. There appears to be a close association between aTRH and the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Almost 20% of patients with aTRH have CKD, while in patients with CKD, up to half meet the definition of aTRH. In patients with CKD, the presence of aTRH is statistically significantly associated.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111poCTc]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Thiazide diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics (e.g. chlorthalidone and indapamide) were the primary drugs tested in landmark randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that demonstrated a high degree of efficacy in blood pressure (BP) lowering, preventing major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, there are no RCTs comparing the efficacy of different thiazides, alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics, to prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Indirect comparisons through meta-analyses and evidence from observational studies have returned conflicting results.

Comparisons of the BP-lowering effect of several thiazides, alone and in combination with potassium-sparing agents, have been rarely investigated in head-to-head clinical trials. The effect of amiloride and triamterene on BP remains uncertain and was not identified in a systematic review of six double-blind RCTs with a total of 496 participants. However, in two isolated trials, amiloride increased the BP-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. Amiloride may be effective in resistant hypertension, particularly at higher doses. Potassium supplementation has a BP-lowering effect, and replacing a proportion of sodium chloride with potassium chloride in meals has been shown to reduce BP. A pioneering nutritional RCT demonstrated that replacing 25% of sodium chloride with potassium chloride significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events and death. The antihypertensive efficacy of spironolactone and eplerenone has been well documented.

### Effect of the combination of bumetanide plus chlorthalidone on hypertension and volume overload in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4–5 KDIGO without renal replacement therapy: A double-blind randomized HEBE-CKD trial [^111sHuxv]. BMC Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

The co-administration of loop diuretics with thiazide diuretics is a therapeutic strategy in patients with hypertension and volume overload. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with bumetanide plus chlorthalidone in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4–5 KDIGO.

- **Methods**: A double-blind randomized study was conducted. Patients were randomized into two groups: the bumetanide plus chlorthalidone group (intervention) and the bumetanide plus placebo group (control) to evaluate differences in total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW), and ECW/TBW between baseline and 30 days of follow-up. Volume overload was defined by bioelectrical impedance analysis as fluid volume above the 90th percentile of a presumed healthy reference population. The study's registration number was NCT03923933.

- **Results**: Thirty-two patients with a mean age of 57.2 ± 9.34 years and a median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 16.7 ml/min/1.73 m² (range 2.2–29) were included. There was decreased volume overload in the liters of total body water (TBW) on Day 7 (intervention: -2.5 vs. control: -0.59, p = 0.003) and Day 30 (intervention: -5.3 vs. control: -0.07, p = 0.016); and in liters of extracellular water (ECW) on Day 7 (intervention: -1.58 vs. control: -0.43, p < 0.001) and Day 30 (intervention: -3.05 vs. control: -0.15, p < 0.000). There was also a decrease in systolic blood pressure on Day 7 (intervention: -18 vs. control: -7.5, p = 0.073) and Day 30 (intervention: -26.1 vs. control: -10, p = 0.028) and in diastolic blood pressure on Day 7 (intervention: -8.5 vs. control).

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^114KJgdd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Our observational analysis across three large and disparate databases showed no significant difference in the effectiveness of chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide for a range of cardiovascular outcomes. However, chlorthalidone exhibited a worse safety profile, including an association with an increased risk of hypokalemia, with a hazard ratio of 2.72 (95% CI, 2.38–3.12). Other electrolyte abnormalities were also more frequent.

Our study represents the largest multisite analysis of real-world evidence to address this comparison, encompassing 36,918 records of individuals prescribed chlorthalidone and 693,337 prescribed hydrochlorothiazide across the three databases. We found consistent results across these databases, excellent balance on more than 60,000 covariates after stratification, little bias based on our controls, minimal sensitivity to changes in time at risk, and to the inclusion of baseline blood pressure or initial dose. The differences in potassium were confirmed by laboratory measurement.

### Evidence-based diuretic therapy for improving cardiovascular prognosis in systemic hypertension [^115ojWaM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Diuretics are among the most commonly prescribed cardiovascular (CV) medications. The strength of evidence supporting the effectiveness of diuretics in lowering blood pressure and preventing major adverse CV events in patients with hypertension varies considerably among diuretic classes, and even among agents within the same class. Unfortunately, common prescribing habits among American physicians, including specialists in CV diseases, are not in line with the existing evidence regarding diuretic therapy for improving CV prognosis. In conclusion, although hydrochlorothiazide is the standard diuretic used for hypertension, the outcomes data suggest that chlorthalidone, indapamide, and possibly even the aldosterone receptor blockers (spironolactone and eplerenone) may be superior agents.

### Chlorthalidone vs. hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension-cardiovascular events [^111actrK]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The Diuretic Comparison Project, published in 2022 by Areef Ishani and colleagues in the Journal of N Engl J Med, addresses hypertension. It posed the trial question: Is chlorthalidone superior to hydrochlorothiazide for preventing cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension? This multi-center, open-label, RCT involved a population of 13,523 patients, comprising 431 females and 13,092 males. The inclusion criteria specified adult patients aged ≥ 65 years receiving hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 25–50 mg/day. The key exclusion criteria were the receipt of blood-pressure medication containing hydrochlorothiazide combined with other agents.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 6756 received chlorthalidone (at a daily dose of 12.5–25 mg)
	- n = 6767 received hydrochlorothiazide (at a daily dose of 25–50 mg).

- **Primary outcome**:
	- No significant difference in the composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure resulting in hospitalization, urgent coronary revascularization for unstable angina, and non-cancer-related death (10.4% vs. 10%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in myocardial infarction (2.1% vs. 2.1%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.28).
	- No significant difference in hospitalization due to heart failure (3.6% vs. 3.4%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25).

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: Rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^111pYSoa]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The effect of thiazide-like drugs on left ventricular (LV) mass in early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not previously been examined, although they are effective in lowering blood pressure in this group. The study will also provide evidence on the safety of both spironolactone and chlorthalidone in subjects with early-stage CKD, giving valuable data on the effects of both drugs on kidney function measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and on changes in serum potassium and sodium concentrations.

If safety and efficacy are confirmed, the rationale would be provided for a larger clinical trial designed to examine the effects of mineralocorticoid receptor blocker (MRB) drugs on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality end points. It is acknowledged that the nonblinded study design increases the risk of bias, but the Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-point (PROBE) design maintains the benefits associated with a strict randomization procedure, whereas the blinded end points help to eliminate bias. In a meta-analysis of trials of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), changes in mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in double-blind and PROBE trials were not significantly different.

### Are diuretics a clandestine risk factor for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension [^115d76VK]? Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

The control of blood pressure in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension is paramount and requires the use of thiazide or loop diuretics to enhance renal salt excretion and reduce expanded body fluid volumes. However, the use of diuretics in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, without suppressing the production of aldosterone and MR (mineralocorticosteroid receptor) activation and signaling, may not be sufficient to prevent the development of heart failure, excessive cardiovascular mortality, and the progression of chronic kidney disease. This review examines the evidence that diuretic therapy for treatment-resistant hypertension may constitute a risk factor for preventable cardiovascular and renal disease progression, which is concealed by the strong offsetting effects of a fall in blood pressure.

To gain the full benefits of diuretic therapy in treatment-resistant hypertension may require the earlier prescription of MR antagonists coincident with diuretics, rather than delaying their use to fourth-line agents in those who remain uncontrolled. This will require testing in appropriate clinical trials.
