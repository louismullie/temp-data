## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which scenario best explains sudden-onset diplopia with blurred vision and left mydriasis in a 65-year-old diabetic man, and to choose among left third nerve palsy, right third nerve palsy, left sympathetic pathway dysfunction, or a left optic nerve lesion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy of the oculomotor nerve and its pupillary fibers. Then, I should verify how diplopia and mydriasis localize within the efferent pathway. Next, I will consider diabetes as a risk factor for pupil-sparing versus pupil-involving third nerve palsy. After that, I need to check why the alternative options do not fit the clinical picture. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and confirm the correct choice with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the key clinical clues and their localizing value. Sudden diplopia implies an acute extraocular muscle palsy, and a dilated, poorly reactive pupil on the same side as the motility deficit points to oculomotor nerve involvement with parasympathetic fiber compromise; in adults with vascular risk factors, this pattern raises concern for a compressive or ischemic third nerve palsy, including aneurysm or microvascular disease, and mandates urgent neuroimaging to exclude aneurysm when the pupil is involved [^111gwKzX] [^114ypqtm].

> Wait, let me verify the neuroanatomy before I jump to conclusions. The oculomotor nerve carries somatic motor fibers to the superior, inferior, and medial recti, inferior oblique, and levator palpebrae, plus parasympathetic fibers to the iris sphincter and ciliary muscle; the pupillary fibers travel superficially near the posterior communicating artery, making them especially vulnerable to compressive lesions such as posterior communicating artery aneurysm, whereas microvascular ischemia more often spares the pupil early on, though exceptions occur in diabetics [^111gwKzX] [^114ypqtm].

> Hold on, I should verify the laterality carefully. Diplopia arises from impaired extraocular muscle function, and when accompanied by ipsilateral mydriasis, that constellation localizes to an ipsilateral third nerve palsy; thus, left diplopia with left mydriasis indicates a left third nerve palsy rather than a right third nerve palsy, which would produce right eye findings and would not explain the left pupil abnormality [^notfound].

> I need to check diabetes as a modifier. Diabetes increases the risk of ischemic cranial neuropathies, and historically many diabetic third nerve palsies are described as pupil-sparing. However, wait, let me reconsider — pupil involvement can still occur in diabetics, and when the pupil is involved, compressive etiologies must be urgently excluded with appropriate neuroimaging because compressive lesions (e.g., posterior communicating artery aneurysm) can present with pupil-involving third nerve palsy and carry high morbidity if missed [^114HHbyP] [^111gwKzX] [^114ypqtm].

> Next, I should review why the alternatives fail to fit. A right third nerve palsy would cause right eye motility deficits and right pupil changes, not left mydriasis, so that option is anatomically inconsistent. Left sympathetic pathway dysfunction (Horner syndrome) produces miosis with ptosis and anhidrosis, not mydriasis, so that contradicts the exam. A left optic nerve lesion would cause afferent visual loss and a relative afferent pupillary defect, not efferent pupillary dilation, and would not by itself cause diplopia, so that does not match the motility complaint [^1163HMT6].

> Let me synthesize and confirm the diagnosis. The combination of sudden diplopia and ipsilateral mydriasis in a 65-year-old diabetic man localizes to a left oculomotor nerve palsy with parasympathetic fiber involvement. Given the pupil involvement, compressive causes must be excluded emergently, even though microvascular ischemia remains possible in diabetes, and the correct answer is therefore left third nerve palsy [^111gwKzX] [^114ypqtm].

The best explanation for left mydriasis with sudden diplopia and blurred vision in a 65-year-old diabetic is **left third nerve palsy** [^111gwKzX] due to microvascular ischemia or aneurysmal compression [^111jHzPm], causing parasympathetic fiber involvement and pupil dilation [^114ypqtm]. Diabetes increases the risk of ischemic cranial neuropathies, and **pupil involvement suggests a compressive lesion** (e.g. posterior communicating artery aneurysm) until proven otherwise [^111jHzPm] [^111gwKzX]. Right third nerve palsy would cause left eye symptoms, sympathetic dysfunction would cause miosis, and an optic nerve lesion would not cause mydriasis or diplopia [^notfound].

---

## Anatomical and physiological basis of mydriasis

Mydriasis is **pupil dilation** caused by increased sympathetic tone or decreased parasympathetic tone. The pupil is controlled by the parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve (CN III) and sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion. Parasympathetic fibers constrict the pupil, while sympathetic fibers dilate it; thus, mydriasis results from impaired parasympathetic innervation or increased sympathetic activity.

---

## Clinical significance of mydriasis in third nerve palsy

Third nerve palsy causes mydriasis when parasympathetic fibers are affected, producing a **dilated, fixed pupil** that reacts poorly to light [^114jaPcR]. This pattern is especially concerning for compressive lesions (e.g. posterior communicating artery aneurysm) and mandates urgent neuroimaging [^111gwKzX].

## Differential diagnosis of mydriasis with diplopia and blurred vision

| **Option** | **Explanation** | **Clinical correlation** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Left third nerve palsy | Microvascular ischemia or compressive lesion (e.g. aneurysm) affecting CN III | - Sudden onset <br/> - Diplopia <br/> - Ptosis <br/> - Mydriasis <br/> - Common in diabetes [^111jHzPm] |
| B. Right third nerve palsy | Lesion affecting right CN III | - Would cause right eye symptoms <br/> - Not left mydriasis [^115zCvhv] |
| C. Left sympathetic pathway dysfunction | Horner's syndrome (sympathetic lesion) | - Miosis <br/> - Ptosis <br/> - Anhidrosis <br/> - Not mydriasis [^notfound] |
| D. Left optic nerve lesion | Optic neuropathy or compressive lesion | - Visual loss <br/> - RAPD <br/> - No mydriasis or diplopia [^1148jy1K] |

---

## Analysis of the clinical scenario

- **Sudden onset**: Favors vascular etiology (ischemia or hemorrhage) [^111jHzPm].
- **Diplopia and blurred vision**: Suggest ocular motor nerve involvement (CN III) [^notfound].
- **Left mydriasis**: Indicates left CN III parasympathetic fiber involvement [^notfound].
- **Diabetes mellitus**: Increases risk of microvascular ischemic neuropathies, including CN III palsy [^114HHbyP].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely explanation is **left third nerve palsy** [^notfound] due to microvascular ischemia or compressive lesion (e.g. posterior communicating artery aneurysm) [^111gwKzX] [^114ypqtm]. Immediate neuroimaging (MRI/MRA or CT angiography) is essential to exclude aneurysm or other compressive lesions [^1163fi6g]. Right third nerve palsy would not cause left mydriasis, sympathetic dysfunction would cause miosis, and an optic nerve lesion would not cause mydriasis or diplopia [^notfound].

Adult strabismus — skew deviation examination and localization: The examination should include the following elements: complete ophthalmic examination with emphasis on the sensorimotor evaluation, complete three-step test, and consideration of the additional upright-supine test; a careful check for other neuro-ophthalmic signs and symptoms looking for Horner's syndrome, cranial nerve palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), nystagmus, and hearing loss; fundus examination to check for papilledema or optic atrophy; visual field testing, which may provide additional information on the etiology; and assessment of lesion localization, where abnormalities in the rostral pons and midbrain (e.g. INO) will result in contralateral hypotropia and head tilt, whereas abnormalities in the vestibular periphery, medulla, and more caudal pons will result in ipsilateral hypotropia and head tilt.

The causes of ophthalmoplegia in 24 consecutive patients with neurologically isolated, relative pupil-sparing third nerve palsy included infarction in 10 patients, compression by tumors or aneurysms in 10 patients, and miscellaneous disorders in four patients. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with pain, degree of external ophthalmoplegia, or degree of internal ophthalmoplegia between the groups with infarction or mass lesions. Therefore, screening for mass lesions using neuroimaging is indicated in patients with this presentation of third nerve palsy.

### Nerve fibre organisation in the human optic nerve and chiasm: what do we really know? [^114cNaFF]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Wilbrand's knee

Lesions of the anterior chiasm where it is joined by the optic nerve clinically give rise to a pattern of visual field loss known as a 'junctional scotoma'. This consists of central visual loss in the eye whose optic nerve is affected along with visual loss in the upper temporal quadrant of the other eye. An apparent explanation for this phenomenon was provided by Wilbrand in 1904 who described fibres from the inferior nasal retina looping forward into the contralateral optic nerve before they continued their journey posteriorly into the contralateral optic tract [Fig. 1]. Damage to this loop of fibres (subsequently known as 'Wilbrand's knee') neatly explained the visual loss in the eye contralateral to the affected optic nerve. Thereafter, the existence of Wilbrand's knee was widely accepted, becoming established in anatomical textbooks as well as in general medical, neurological, and ophthalmological teaching. Some 'indirect' support for its existence was provided by anisotropic light imaging, but it is likely that these results were confounded by artefact.

Subsequent, careful analysis has not supported the existence of Wilbrand's knee. Studies of both normal monkeys and humans have clarified that what Wilbrand saw was almost certainly an artefact of enucleation. Similarly, a careful study of three patients whose optic nerves were sectioned precisely at their junction with the optic chiasm demonstrated no evidence of contralateral visual field loss. More recently, a histological study of macaque anterior visual pathway showed no evidence of Wilbrand's knee in their Fig. 1. Accordingly, the concept is now considered to have been debunked.

Having said this, an explanation is still required for the clinical observation that compression in the very anterior portion of the chiasm results in a junctional scotoma. An alternative explanation for this phenomenon was recently suggested by Jain et al. who observed that inferior nasal fibres (presumably those subserving the upper temporal visual fields) crossed more anteriorly in the chiasm, unlike the superior nasal fibres which crossed more posteriorly. A similar arrangement was, incidentally, found by Glaser and has also been reported in the macaque. This arrangement could explain the junctional scotoma: a lesion of the anterior chiasm at the point where it is joined by an optic nerve could result in selective visual field loss of the superior temporal field of the contralateral eye (in addition to visual field loss in the ipsilateral eye) because the nerve fibres originating from the contralateral inferior nasal retina of one eye cross just behind the entrance of the other optic nerve.

Similarly, painless optic nerve pathologies without disc swelling may be mistaken for acute ON. The clinical history will identify patients at risk of a traumatic or drug-induced or metabolic syndrome optic neuropathy, or post-surgical posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (PION). This is seen rarely in patients following protracted surgery, most commonly associated with coronary artery bypass grafting and back or spinal surgery. The presumed cause is ischaemic hypoperfusion, and a number of risk factors have been reported in the literature including anaemia, intraoperative blood loss, operative duration, and low blood pressure. Symptoms are typically reported within 1–2 days of surgery and frequently upon awakening, although this may be delayed in those sedated after surgery. Presentation is usually with painless central or peripheral vision loss or both, decreased or absent colour vision which is bilateral in over 60% of cases. Rarely, PION presents in patients with occult giant cell arteritis (GCA), malignant hypertension, or other vasculitides. In GCA, PION occurs in less than 3–6% of cases and presents as sequential vision loss. The optic disc examination is normal in the acute setting, with the development of optic atrophy approximately 6 weeks after the event. Functional enquiry may reveal other symptoms suggestive of vasculitis, and inflammatory markers and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antigen (ANCA) may be abnormal. Patients sometimes suddenly notice the monocular vision impairment associated with a compressive optic nerve lesion such as a mucocele, or optic nerve sheath meningioma, which may be mistaken for ON prior to neuroimaging. Scleritis, myositis and orbital inflammation may result in pain on eye movement which could mimic ON without optic disc swelling, but in these conditions, there are usually other clinical signs, and no colour desaturation or RAPD (unless there is compression or concurrent ON).

Cone dysfunction will also impair colour perception and other subtle retinal pathologies may impair visual acuity (e.g. acute macular neuroretinopathy, paracentral acute middle maculopathy) or visual field (e.g. acute zonal occult outer retinopathy, acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement syndrome). Multimodal imaging (with optical coherence tomography, autofluorescence, and even fundus fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography) valuably aids identification of alternate pathologies. Electrodiagnostic testing with 30 Hz flicker, multifocal ERG and visual evoked potentials can also helpfully differentiate primary retinal from optic nerve pathology, but may not be available in the acute setting.

### Glaucomatous optic nerve damage in the contralateral eye of a patient with peripapillary retinoschisis: a case report [^112LdGCF]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 55-year-old man presented for a routine physical examination. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye (0 Diopters Sphere) and 20/20 in the left eye (-2.00 Diopters Sphere), and intraocular pressure was 18 mmHg OD and 19 mmHg OS (central corneal thickness: 539 µm OD and 546 µm OS). In slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination, the cornea, anterior chamber, iris and lens were normal. However, fundus examination (Optos p200t, Optos PLC, Dunfermline, UK) revealed an elevated, red, boundary-blurred ONH in the right eye. In addition, scattered patchy red lesions were seen on the retina on the temporal side of the optic disc, similar to retinal hemorrhage (Fig. 1, pseudocolor). The color and boundary of the left optic disc were normal, and the cup-to-disc ratio was 0.6. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT, Spectralis HRA-OCT, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) was performed and showed retinoschisis on the ONH of the right eye throughout the entire circumference, extending to the retina on the temporal side of the optic disc. The splitting was mainly located in the RNFL layer. The outer nuclear layer, inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer were also involved in the temporal side of the optic disc. The red elevated ONH was caused by the splitting and towering of the neuroretina rim. On infrared fundus imaging, the lesion on the temporal side of the optic disc presented as a wedge-shaped dark area with the base attached to the edge of the optic disc, scattered along the nerve fiber bundles (Fig. 2 A-D). The OCT and infrared fundus image of the left eye was normal (Fig. 2 E). The patient was diagnosed with PPRS (OD). However, no optic disc pit or optic disc coloboma was found. Since PPRS is often associated with glaucoma, visual field examination was subsequently performed. Visual field examination (Humphrey visual field analyzer 750i, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, USA) showed that the right side was generally normal, while a nasal step visual field defect was found in the left eye (Fig. 3). Furthermore, stereophotography and a red-free fundus image revealed two RNFL defects in the supratemporal and infratemporal regions of the retina of the left eye (Fig. 4). In line scan OCT, obvious RNFL thinning was found through the areas of RNFL defects (Fig. 2 F). Intraocular pressure was continuously measured and fluctuations between 18 and 22 mmHg OD and 19–26 mmHg OS were found during the daytime. Because no other factors leading to secondary glaucoma were found and the anterior chamber angle was open, the patient was diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma and treated with local intraocular pressure lowering drugs.

However, fundus imaging of the left eye revealed a circumscribed and disc-like lesion located one disc diameter below the true optic disc that showed profound central cupping and resembled a second optic disc with a vascular supply (Fig. 1 a). FAF imaging demonstrated that the area located between the true disc and the disc-like lesion was hyperfluorescent, indicating the accumulation of lipofuscin between the nerve fibre layer and choroidal membrane layer (Fig. 1 b). Of additional interest were the B scan ultrasonography results of the left eye, which showed an optic nerve with a weak-echo region, indicating that two strands originated from the optic nerve (Fig. 1 c). A perimetric examination of the left eye revealed a relatively horizontal superior defect in the nasal region (Fig. 1 d). An additional OCT examination showed that the structure of the true optic disc and the macular area of the left eye were normal (Fig. 2 a). However, an OCT scan demonstrated a large crater-like depression in the disc-like lesion in the left eye, indicating a colobomatous defect that was covered by a mysterious membranous structure, a disturbed nerve fibre layer and the absence of regular outer retinal layers (Fig. 2 b). MRI examination of the orbital region revealed that the morphology of the left eye globe was abnormal and that the abnormally shaped optic nerve in the left eye was shifted partially toward the nasal side. The right eye showed only a single optic nerve (Fig. 3). Initially, it was difficult to determine whether true duplication or pseudoduplication of the optic disc had occurred. Therefore, to more precisely diagnose either true duplication or pseudoduplication of the optic disc, an invasive examination was performed after informed consent was provided by the patient and her guardians.

Case 3

A 28-year-old female with a history of essential hypertension and living with obesity (BMI 38 kg/m²) presented complaining of darkening vision, worse in the left eye. She reported 3 weeks of progressively worsening severe headache and diplopia. Over the last week she developed frequent transient visual obscurations in both eyes and pulsatile tinnitus. On examination BCVA was 6/9 in the right eye and 6/60 in the left eye. She was able to identify 10/14 Ishihara plates with the right eye and 3/14 with the left eye. Both pupils were sluggish with left RAPD. A right cranial nerve VI palsy was present. Dilated fundus exam revealed severe optic nerve oedema bilaterally (Fig. 4). The global pRNFL thickness was 338microns in the right eye and 334microns in the left eye. Humphrey perimetry 24–2 showed severe generalised depression in both eyes, worse on the left (Fig. 4).

A colour fundus image of the left eye; and B right eye. Humphrey 30–2 perimetry showed mild enlargement of the blind spot bilaterally with very mild peripheral changes; C grey scale left eye; and D right eye.

Due to rapidly evolving symptoms of increased ICP and worsening vision over days, along with severe optic nerve oedema, we made the presumptive diagnosis of fulminant IIH. Fulminant IIH is a form of IIH that affects a small percentage of patients. These patients have a very aggressive course with acute onset of symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension with severe visual loss occurring within weeks of the initial diagnosis or at a relapse of symptoms. Acute presentation with rapid loss of vision is not common and requires ruling out other causes of loss of vision, such as: malignant hypertension, meningitis, cerebral venous disease, optic neuritis (such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, sarcoidosis, syphilis, etc), and optic nerve infiltration (leukaemia, lymphoma). All of which should be picked up in the investigational pathway.

Summary of clinical findings, videooculography and neuroimaging. A Clinical neuroophthalmologic assessment shows a left hypertropia, rightward head deviation in the roll plane (ear to shoulder; dashed line approximation of a true horizontal, solid line approximation of patient's actual head deviation) and esodeviation with right eye deviating inwards, greater on attempted upgaze. Vertical but not horizontal gaze range is limited. B Binocular videooculography. In darkness, the binocular vertical trace (light grey) shows a low frequency nystagmus with an upward directed quick phase and linear slow phase waveforms (highlighted in grey box I), co-occurring with a sparse convergent jerk (purple box) with following slow divergence visible in the horizontal trace. With fixation in light, the vertical and horizontal oscillations become significantly more intense and assume pendular waveforms (highlighted in grey box II and purple box). In left gaze, the horizontal oscillations are markedly attenuated, while vertical oscillations show a gaze-dependent shift of waveforms (highlighted in grey box III and IV). Vertical and horizontal oscillations are strongly correlated in both eyes. BIN V = binocularly averaged vertical trace, LE H = left eye horizontal, RE H = right eye horizontal.

### Neuro-ophthalmic evaluation and management of pituitary disease [^115RMVYy]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Visual acuity can range from normal to no light perception in compressive chiasmopathy, and usually remain unaffected until associated field defects encroach centrally towards fixation. Colour vision deficits can be detected both in the presence or absence of reduced visual acuity. Patients can occasionally miss reading figures that fall in the temporal field, and temporal red desaturation may also be detected when tested across the vertical meridian. Patients with complete bitemporal visual field defect will not have a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). However, a RAPD will be present if there is significant asymmetry in the visual field loss.

Pituitary lesions compressing the optic chiasm cause peripheral visual field defects more commonly than compromised central acuity, and therefore automated static perimetry is recommended routinely in the neuro-ophthalmic evaluation of affected patients. The pattern of visual field loss is dependent on a myriad of factors, including individual microanatomical variation in the decussation of nerve fibres, the anatomical relationship between the chiasm and skull base, as well as the type and location of the compressive lesion. Chiasmal contact and compression usually do not occur until pituitary adenomas expand 8 mm or more above the diaphragma sellae. Typical visual field deficits include bitemporal defects, junctional scotomas, monocular cecocentral defects, and incongruous homonymous hemianopias [Fig. 2].

C Right Incomplete incongruous hemianopia: pre-fixed chiasm or a tumour that impact on the optic tract. D Left Junctional Scotoma or 'anterior chiasmal syndrome': a lesion located at the medial aspect of the junction between the chiasm and the left optic nerve will affect the left optic nerve fibres and the fibres that cross in the anterior chiasm to the contralateral side producing a left central scotoma and a right temporal hemianopic defect. E Unilateral hemianopia: a small lesion damaging only the crossing fibres of the right eye at the anterior chiasm can produce a monocular temporal hemianopic defect.

### Pituitary adenoma presenting as acute onset isolated complete third cranial nerve palsy without vision changes [^115zCvhv]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We report a case of isolated unilateral complete pupil involving third cranial nerve palsy due to pituitary adenoma with parasellar extension into the right cavernous sinus. The patient was referred to us from neurosurgery with sudden onset binocular vertical diplopia with complete ptosis, and mild right-sided headache of 5-day duration. Ocular examination revealed pupil involving third cranial nerve palsy in right eye while rest of the examination including automated perimetry was normal. MRI brain with contrast revealed a mass lesion with heterogenous enhancement in the sella suggestive of a pituitary macroadenoma with possible internal haemorrhage (apoplexy). In addition, the MRI showed lateral spread to the right cavernous sinus which was causing compression of the right third cranial nerve. The patient was systemically stable. This report highlights a unique case as the lesion showed a lateral spread of pituitary adenoma without compression of the optic chiasm or other cranial nerves.

### Contralateral supraorbital keyhole approach to medial optic nerve lesions: an anatomoclinical study [^1166gQ2F]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE The authors describe the supraorbital keyhole approach to the contralateral medial optic nerve and tract, both in a series of cadaveric dissections and in 2 patients. They also discuss the indications and contraindications for this procedure. METHODS In 3 cadaver heads, bilateral supraorbital keyhole minicraniotomies were performed to expose the ipsilateral and contralateral optic nerves. The extent of exposure of the medial optic nerve was assessed. In 2 patients, a contralateral supraorbital keyhole approach was used to remove pathology of the contralateral medial optic nerve and tract. RESULTS The supraorbital keyhole craniotomy provided better exposure of the contralateral superomedial nerve than it did of the same portion of the ipsilateral nerve. In both patients gross-total resections of the pathology was achieved. CONCLUSIONS The authors demonstrate the suitability of the contralateral supraorbital keyhole approach for lesions involving the superomedial optic nerve.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^111zrU8B]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult Strabismus PPP — cavernous sinus and orbital associations note that in the cavernous sinus, the 6th nerve is in proximity to the intracavernous carotid artery, ocular sympathetics, and cranial nerves III, IV, and the first division of the trigeminal nerve; thus, carotid artery aneurysms, inflammatory cavernous sinus processes, or other structural lesions may include a concomitant Horner's syndrome, 3rd nerve palsies and 4th nerve palsies, or facial pain; the 6th nerve then passes through the superior orbital fissure into the orbit; orbital infections, mass lesions, or inflammation can affect the 6th nerve as well as the lateral rectus muscle itself; associated proptosis and optic neuropathy may be present; and venous congestion from either an orbital process or back pressure from cavernous sinus lesions can cause chemosis with increased IOP.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^111jHzPm]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Classification of the etiologies

The etiologies of the oculomotor nerve palsy were classified into microvascular, vascular anomalies, neoplastic, inflammatory, traumatic, congenital, vascular, infectious, recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy, iatrogenic, central demyelination, Fisher syndrome and idiopathic. Microvascular oculomotor nerve palsy was diagnosed when the ophthalmoplegia was of an acute onset with a spontaneous recovery within 1 year in adults (≥ 20 years) with at least one vascular risk factor (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia or smoking), and when there were no lesions that may explain the oculomotor nerve palsy on MRIs and no other disorders that may explain the oculomotor nerve palsy better. Vascular anomalies were diagnosed when the oculomotor nucleus, fascicle or nerve was affected by vascular malformation (e.g. intracranial aneurysm, dural arteriovenous fistula, cavernous malformation or arteriovenous malformation). Inflammatory etiology was presumed when MRIs demonstrated T2 hyperintense and gadolinium‐enhanced lesions affecting the oculomotor nucleus, fascicle or nerve (e.g. Tolosa–Hunt syndrome) and the symptoms responded to steroid treatments. A traumatic cause was defined when there was a documented onset of oculomotor nerve palsy following head trauma and no other disorders to explain the oculomotor nerve palsy better. Congenital oculomotor nerve palsy was diagnosed when the patients had an infantile onset of ophthalmoplegia after excluding congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders, such as Duane syndrome and congenital Horner syndrome. Vascular etiology included ischaemic and hemorrhagic strokes not related to vascular anomalies. Infectious etiology was diagnosed when the clinical features and results of serology and cerebrospinal fluid analyses were consistent with a specific pathogen affecting the oculomotor nerve. Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy was diagnosed according to the criteria proposed in the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Central demyelination was defined as inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), including multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Fisher syndrome was diagnosed when the patients had a positive serum ganglioside antibody without a lesion on MRIs that may explain the ophthalmoplegia, and the ophthalmoplegia was not better accounted for by other etiologies. Finally, the oculomotor nerve palsy was classified as idiopathic when the etiology could not be determined even with appropriate evaluation for the etiology of oculomotor nerve palsy. Myasthenic or neuromuscular causes of ophthalmoplegia were excluded. The etiology assigned to each patient by the primary physician was reviewed by the authors (HJK and JSK) and was finally accepted when considered appropriate.

Seven months later, the patient developed acute painless visual loss in the right eye. Visual acuity decreased to 20/200 in the right eye. He showed a central scotoma in the right eye, while visual acuity and the visual field in the left eye were normal (Fig. 2 -c). On fundus examination, there was no optic disc swelling in the right eye, with mild temporal disc pallor. No macular or vascular change was observed (Fig. 1 -b). MRI showed no enhancement in either optic nerve. The patient was given 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone daily for three days again, but his visual acuity did not improve.

### Nerve fibre organisation in the human optic nerve and chiasm: what do we really know? [^1172WNFm]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Studies in non-human primates suggest that the projections from the eyes to the pretectal nuclei are largely contralateral. In humans, a careful study of pupillary responses to maximal light stimulation in subjects with lesions of the optic tract demonstrated that between 54%-67% of fibres destined for the pretectal region were crossed.

The superior colliculi are involved in the generation of saccadic eye movements while the AOS (the anterior and posterior pretectal nuclei and the nucleus of the optic tract) is concerned with generating optokinetic nystagmus, visual-vestibular interaction and visuomotor coordination. All these centres require, and receive, considerable visual input: it has been estimated that 1%-6% of all visual fibres project to the AOS in non-human primates. The projection to the superior colliculi is bilateral. That to the AOS is predominantly crossed though the proportion of fibres projecting ipsilaterally to the AOS varies between studies, ranging from small numbers to equal numbers of ipsilateral and contralateral projections. Information regarding the innervation of the superior colliculi and AOS in humans is lacking.

In summary, an average of about 2 million optic nerve fibres pass through the human optic chiasm. The majority of these are destined for the two LGNs but perhaps 5% are destined for other structures in the brain, including the SCN, the pretectal region, and structures involved in the control of eye movements. While all these pathways might differ somewhat regarding the proportion of crossed and uncrossed fibres, it does appear that a reasonable working assumption is that most fibres not destined for the LGN behave in a similar manner to those destined for the LGN: about half cross to the contralateral side of the brain as they pass through the optic chiasm while the other half do not.

### Laterality of brain and ocular lesions in Aicardi syndrome [^114PzM9B]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

This study reports a large case series of children with Aicardi syndrome. A new severity scoring system is established to assess sidedness of ocular and brain lesions. Thirty-five children were recruited from Aicardi syndrome family conferences. All children received dilated ophthalmologic examinations, and brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were reviewed. Ocular and brain MRI Aicardi lesion severity scores were devised. A linear mixed model was used to compare each side for the ocular and brain MRI severity scores of Aicardi-associated disease. Twenty-six children met the inclusion criteria for the study. All subjects were female, ages 3 months to 19 years. Rates per child of optic nerve coloboma, severe lacunae, and microphthalmos in one or both eyes (among those with complete fundus examinations available) were 10/24 (42%), 8/22 (36%), and 7/26 (27%), respectively. Ocular and brain MRI asymmetry was found in 18% (4/22) and 58% (15/26) of subjects, respectively, with more right-sided brain lesions than left-sided ones (V = 52, P = 0.028). A significant correlation between sidedness of brain disease and microphthalmos was noted (T = 2.54, P = 0.02). This study substantiates the range and severity of Aicardi syndrome-associated ophthalmologic and brain MRI lesions from prior smaller case series.

### Supraorbital keyhole approach for resection of prechiasmatic craniopharyngioma: 2-dimensional operative video [^114yQzon]. Operative Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Craniopharyngioma are benign extra-axial tumors occurring classically in the vicinity of the sella. Because of the complex anatomy surrounding the sella turcica comprising, among others, the vessels of the circle of Willis, the optic nerves, chiasma and optic pathway, the hypothalamus, the third ventricle, and the pituitary gland, a large variety of technical approaches have been described. We illustrate, in this video, a unilateral supraorbital keyhole approach to access and entirely extirpate a prechiasmatic craniopharyngioma. A 40-yr-old healthy male presented to the emergency department with a history of rapid visual deterioration in the left eye in the last 10 d. A brain computed tomography scan showed a circumscribed prechiasmatic cystic lesion partially calcified that was radiologically compatible with a craniopharyngioma on the magnetic resonance imaging. We decided to access the lesion by a right-sided subfrontal corridor using a frontal wrinkle for the skin incision. This technique allows rapid and safe access to the central prechiasmatic region. By choosing a contralateral approach, we aim at optimizing the control on the opposite optic nerve with a perpendicular view. Total removal of the craniopharyngioma was accomplished without causing neurological deterioration. In fact, left eye visual disturbances were immediately retrieved after the surgery. No endocrinological issue or postoperative complication was reported. Minimal cosmetic disturbances are achieved with a meticulous skin incision and bone flap reconstruction.

### Choristoma of the optic nerve: case report [^116UgfiG]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Optic nerve choristoma is a rare lesion composed of adipose tissue and smooth muscle involving the optic nerve. Few cases have been reported.

Clinical Presentation

A 20-year-old woman presented with a history of slowly progressive visual loss in the left eye. On T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging studies, after frequency-selective fat saturation, an optic nerve mass was detected at the level of the optic canal with signal characteristics suggesting the diagnosis of optic nerve lipoma.

Intervention

At left frontotemporal craniotomy, the intracranial optic nerve appeared thin and atrophic proximally and was covered by abundant adipose tissue distally. Because no cleavage plane could be identified between the fatty lesion and the optic nerve, which appeared splayed within the adipose tissue, the nerve was resected after an intraoperative biopsy. The presence of two heterotopic mesodermal elements, a rim of adipose tissue admixed with bundles of mature smooth muscle, extending into the nerve septa, warranted a diagnosis of optic nerve choristoma.

Conclusion

Optic nerve choristoma is an uncommon optic nerve lesion. Even if imaging studies are highly suggestive of the diagnosis, pathological confirmation is required because of the high adipose tissue content in the majority of cases. The lesion, most likely malformative and nonneoplastic in nature, can be the cause of progressive visual loss.

### Dorsolateral pontine lesions produce distinct ocular motor abnormalities with anatomical correlations [^114PNCCp]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This study has demonstrated that patients with unilateral DLP lesions frequently present isolated AVS with a broader range of eye‐movement abnormalities than previously documented. These characteristics may be due to the complex involvement of afferent or efferent fibers to and from the VN within the DLP. Since false‐negative initial MRI results are also common in DLP infarctions, it is essential to thoroughly examine abnormal eye movements when diagnosing this type of stroke in patients with AVS.

### Effect of brimonidine on retinal ganglion cell survival in an optic nerve crush model [^116dwzHx]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the effect of brimonidine on the retinal ganglion cell survival in an optic nerve crush model.

Design

Experimental animal study.

Methods

Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a study group of eight animals receiving intraperitoneal injections of brimonidine (1 mg/kg) and into a control group of 12 animals receiving intraperitoneal saline injections. All injections were performed one hour before the optic nerve crash and daily afterwards. For each animal, the right optic nerve was crushed for 60 seconds by a microclip with 40-g power. At 23 days after the optic nerve crush, the retinal ganglion cells were retrogradely labeled by injecting 3% fluorogold into both sides of the superior colliculus of the brain. At four weeks after the optic nerve crush, the animals were sacrificed. Photographs taken from retinal flat mounts were assessed for number and density of the retinal ganglion cells.

Results

The retinal ganglion cell density of the right eyes with an optic nerve lesion was statistically significantly (P = 0.02) higher in the brimonidine study group (1281 ± 189 cells/mm²) than in the control group (1060 ± 148 cells/mm²). Correspondingly, the survival rate (ratio of retinal ganglion cell density in the right eye divided by cell density in the left eye) was statistically significantly (P = 0.027) higher in the study group than in the control group (61.0% ± 6.0% vs 53.5 ± 8.0%).

Conclusion

Intraperitoneal injections of brimonidine given prophylactically prior to and posttreatment daily after an experimental and standardized optic nerve crush in rats were associated with a higher survival rate of retinal ganglion cells.

### IgG4-related disease presenting as recurrent scleritis combined with optic neuropathy [^115SkToH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

We report a case of atypical presentation of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with recurrent scleritis and optic nerve involvement.

Case Presentation

A 61-year-old male presented with ocular pain and injection in his left eye for 2months. Ocular examination together with ancillary testing led to the diagnosis of scleritis, which relapsed in spite of several courses of steroid treatment. After cessation of steroid, the patient complained of severe retro-orbital pain and blurred vision. His best corrected vision was count finger, the pupil was mid-dilated and a relative afferent pupillary defect was found. Funduscopic examination demonstrated disc swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enhancing soft tissue encasing the left globe, medial rectus muscle and optic nerve. Systemic work-up revealed multiple nodules in right lower lung and a biopsy showed histopathological characteristics of IgG4-RD. Long-term treatment with corticosteroids and a steroid-sparing agent (methotrexate) led to significant improvement in signs and symptoms with no recurrence for 2years.

Conclusions

This case highlights the significance of IgG4-RD in the differential diagnosis of recurrent scleritis. IgG4-RD may cause optic neuropathy resulting in visual loss. Early diagnosis and proper treatment can prevent irreversible organ damage and devastating visual morbidity.

### Traumatic optic neuropathy management: a systematic review [^111pj6py]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI)

TBI may occur after open or closed head injury and is always associated with altered brain function. Closed injury, with intact skin and skull, is most common and the mechanism of injury is acceleration and deceleration of the brain within the skull, twisting, stretching, and damaging the axons and blood vessels. Initial damage with acute injury to the axonal and nerve soma is called primary injury from the physical impact. Secondary injuries may occur from pathophysiological consequences and neurodegenerative processes. The biochemical reactions taking place after the primary injury and their role in initiating a cycle of neurodegeneration are poorly understood.

TBI may be categorised as mild, moderate, or severe, although symptom severity does not always coincide with injury severity, making TBI severity difficult to diagnose and TBI difficult to manage. Whilst there are many classification systems for TBI severity, the Mayo classification is used most frequently (Table 1).

Table 1
The Mayo classification of TBI.

Mild TBI is usually classified in terms of normal structural brain imaging on computed tomography and has common symptoms of headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, and disorientation, which can last indefinitely. Moderate to severe TBI may be associated with haematomas and tissue necrosis, losing brain functionality, and releasing toxins with more prolonged unconsciousness and long-term neurological impairment.

### Longitudinal evidence for anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration after optic neuritis [^111ZrnHu]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

In multiple sclerosis, microstructural damage of normal-appearing brain tissue is an important feature of its pathology. Understanding these mechanisms is vital to help develop neuroprotective strategies. The visual pathway is a key model to study mechanisms of damage and recovery in demyelination. Anterograde trans-synaptic degeneration across the lateral geniculate nuclei has been suggested as a mechanism of tissue damage to explain optic radiation abnormalities seen in association with demyelinating disease and optic neuritis, although evidence for this has relied solely on cross-sectional studies. We therefore aimed to assess: (i) longitudinal changes in the diffusion properties of optic radiations after optic neuritis suggesting trans-synaptic degeneration; (ii) the predictive value of early optic nerve magnetic resonance imaging measures for late optic radiations changes; and (iii) the impact on visual outcome of both optic nerve and brain post-optic neuritis changes. Twenty-eight consecutive patients with acute optic neuritis and eight healthy controls were assessed visually (logMAR, colour vision, and Sloan 1.25%, 5%, 25%) and by magnetic resonance imaging, at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Magnetic resonance imaging sequences performed (and metrics obtained) were: (i) optic nerve fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (optic nerve cross-sectional area); (ii) optic nerve proton density fast spin-echo (optic nerve proton density-lesion length); (iii) optic nerve post-gadolinium T1-weighted (Gd-enhanced lesion length); and (iv) brain diffusion-weighted imaging (to derive optic radiation fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity). Mixed-effects and multivariate regression models were performed, adjusting for age, gender, and optic radiation lesion load. These identified changes over time and associations between early optic nerve measures and 1-year global optic radiation/clinical measures. The fractional anisotropy in patients' optic radiations decreased (P = 0.018) and radial diffusivity increased (P = 0.002) over 1 year following optic neuritis, whereas optic radiation measures were unchanged in controls. Also, smaller cross-sectional areas of affected optic nerves at 3 months post-optic neuritis predicted lower fractional anisotropy and higher radial diffusivity at 1 year (P = 0.007) in the optic radiations, whereas none of the inflammatory measures of the optic nerve predicted changes in optic radiations. Finally, greater Gd-enhanced lesion length at baseline and greater optic nerve proton density-lesion length at 1 year were associated with worse visual function at 1 year (P = 0.034 for both). Neither the cross-sectional area of the affected optic nerve after optic neuritis nor the damage in optic radiations was associated with 1-year visual outcome. Our longitudinal study shows that, after optic neuritis, there is progressive damage to the optic radiations, greater in patients with early residual optic nerve atrophy, even after adjusting for optic radiation lesions. These findings provide evidence for trans-synaptic degeneration.

Orbital RDD

Orbital RDD was bilateral in 42.8% of patients. Eyelid swelling and decreased vision were the presenting complaints for 60 and 40% of eyes, respectively. On examination, visual acuity in the affected eyes ranged from 20/25 to LP. A relative afferent pupillary defect was documented in two eyes and mild limitation of ocular motility in one eye. Proptosis and/or dystopia were observed in 9/10 eyes (Fig. 1 A). The median proptosis value was 4.5 mm (range: 2–16). Compressive optic neuropathy was seen in three eyes, with an average proptosis of 4.3 mm and no documented ocular motility limitation. A rubbery inferonasal mass was palpable in one patient.

B Axial high-resolution MRI showing bilateral orbital infiltration with right intracanalicular optic nerve encroachment (arrow) in case 2. C External photo of a patient (case 5) with scleral RDD showing inflamed and edematous sclera with conjunctival, superficial and deep episcleral vascular congestion. D Excellent result was observed in case 3 shown in A

Apart from eyelid swelling and proptosis/dystopia, no other signs of infection or inflammation were observed. Exposure keratopathy secondary to lagophthalmos was documented in one eye. Relevant systemic associations occurred in all patients, including paranasal sinus infiltration (4 cases), intracranial involvement (3 cases), submandibular gland enlargement (2 cases) and facial tumours (1 case). The patients were otherwise healthy. Imaging studies revealed extraconal soft tissue masses in all orbits, with an additional intraconal component in 5/10 orbits. Erosion/destruction of the surrounding bones was observed in all involved orbits. Sclerosis and hyperostosis of the facial bones occurred in one patient. The histiocytic infiltrate involved the paranasal sinuses bilaterally in four patients. Intra-orbital optic nerve compression was documented in two eyes and intracanalicular segment compression in one (Fig. 1 B). Intracranial involvement presenting as parenchymal lesions (case 2), extension (case 3) and dural tumours (case 6) was found. Enlargement of the lacrimal gland and V2/V3 branches of the trigeminal nerve was also seen in case 6. Two out of seven patients (cases 3 and 8) were classified as nodal RDD.

### Neuroradiological and clinical features in ophthalmoplegia [^111oDyCf]. Neuroradiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Especially in acute onset of ophthalmoplegia, efficient neuroradiological evaluation is necessary to assist differential diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment options.

Methods

Different manifestations of ophthalmoplegia are explained and illustrated by characteristic neuroradiological and clinical findings.

Results

To present those ophthalmoplegic disorders in a clear manner, this review refers to different neuroanatomical structures and compartments. From neuroophthalmological point of view, diseases going ahead with ophthalmoplegia can be divided into (1) efferent infranuclear/peripheral disturbances involving oculomotor cranial nerves, (2) conjugate gaze abnormalities due to internuclear or supranuclear lesions, and (3) diseases of the extraocular eye muscles or their impairment due to intraorbital pathologies.

Conclusion

The knowledge of the relationship between neurological findings in ophthalmoplegia and involved neuroanatomical structures is crucial, and neuroradiology can be focused on circumscribed anatomical regions, using optimized investigation protocols.

### Third-nerve palsy with sparing of pupil in diabetes mellitus… [^114HHbyP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE PURPOSE of this paper is the presentation of a case of extraocular-muscle paralysis complicating long-standing diabetes mellitus. Since Dieulafoy, 1 in 1905, first collected the cases of extraocular-muscle paralyses due to diabetes mellitus, the association of such paralyses with diabetes mellitus has been noted in large series of patients by several investigators. It is the consensus of most authors that this complication is uncommon. Waite and Beetham, 2 in 1935, found only 16 cases of ocular-muscle paralyses in 4, 001 eyes of diabetic patients, an incidence of 0. 4%. Leopold, 3 however, 10 years later, found an incidence of 5% in 100 cases. Most authors, nevertheless, agree with Waite and Beetham.
2. Walsh4 and Weinstein and Dolger5 believed that a minute hemorrhage, either into the nerve trunk or about the nucleus of the oculomotor nerve, produced the paralysis. This idea is supported by the rapidity of onset in the. EARECKSON VO, MILLER JM.

Two patients demonstrating both optic neuritis and trigeminal nerve lesions. a Axial T2 weighted images (T2W1) of the optic nerves showed bilateral hyperintensities (yellow arrows) at acute phase, which completely resolved at the remission phase in case 1 (a patient with inflammatory demyelinating disease of undefined type). Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences showed a high signal intensity at the REZ of the left trigeminal nerve of this patient (yellow arrow) at acute phase, which partially resolved at remission phase. b Axial T2WI images showed a hyperintensity lesion of the left optic nerve at acute phase of case 2 (a MOGAD patient), which was nearly completely resolved at remission phase. The double inversion recovery (DIR) sequences showed bilateral lesions at the pons and the REZ of the trigeminal nerves that extended from the pons distally up to 4 mm. The trigeminal nerve lesions were partially resolved at remission phase. Coronal views (right panels) show the red scanned line corresponding to the axial view at the acute phase

Case 2: MOGAD patient

A 13-year-old female developed worsening headaches, eye pain, and vision loss over several days. One month later, she experienced right lower limb weakness, gait disturbance, and decreased sensation on the left side of her tongue. Brain MRI revealed a longitudinally extensive high-intensity lesion in the left optic nerve (longitudinal length = 39 mm) (Fig. 1 b). Bilateral trigeminal nerve lesions extended peripherally 4 mm beyond the pons. Serum MOG antibodies were positive. Her acute symptoms worsened despite steroid pulse therapy but improved with plasma exchange. The MRI signal abnormalities were partially resolved. Recurrences were successfully suppressed with steroids and immunosuppressants. Based on the MRI lesions location, we speculated that the trigeminal nerve lesions of this patient formed around or slightly beyond the TZ.

### Clinical reasoning: a 51-year-old woman with diplopia and headache [^115uMNqX]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

A 51-year-old woman presented with a pressure-like headache behind her right eye and horizontal diplopia. On examination, she was unable to abduct or adduct the right eye but had intact vertical eye movements. Her deficits could not be overcome using the oculocephalic reflex. Imaging initially was interpreted as optic neuritis, but on careful review with radiology, a diffuse enhancing hyperintense signal within the orbital apex confirmed an orbital infiltrate. The focus of this case study is to review the localization approach for diplopia and build a differential diagnosis for orbital processes. Another key point is the importance of relying on the physical examination as the guide to a patient's management rather than imaging findings, which can often be misleading.

### Causes of isolated recurrent ipsilateral sixth nerve palsies in older adults: a case series and review of the literature [^115q98LR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sixth nerve palsies are attributed to the following causes: 8%–30% idiopathic, 10%–30% miscellaneous, 3%–30% trauma, 0%–6% aneurysm, and 0%–36% ischemic. The sixth cranial nerve is the most commonly affected of the ocular motor nerves because of its long intracranial course after emerging at the pontomedullary sulcus and then into the orbits, where it innervates the lateral rectus muscle. The points of fixation along its course, its tortuosity, and its attachment to the skull base all contribute to its vulnerability to compression. Although the presence of vasculopathic risk factors in patients at least 50 years of age is a significant predictor for a presumed microvascular cause for an acute isolated ocular motor mononeuropathy, a previous multicenter study showed that 16.5% of 109 patients had a non-microvascular cause, such as a neoplasm or infarct. Sixth nerve palsies were the most common in this study cohort and they were acute and non-recurrent. The current study focuses on a subpopulation of isolated relapsing-remitting sixth nerve palsies in which we present evidence that mass lesions in the parasellar or petrous apex cavernous sinus regions represent an important etiology that can increase morbidity and mortality in adults > 50 years of age.

Longitudinally extensive lesions

Longitudinally extensive optic neuritis is defined as ON involving more than 50% of the pre-chiasmal optic nerve length. This is characteristic of MOG-ON, occurring in 23–88% of patients, whereas it is rare in MS-ON. Whilst longitudinally extensive optic neuritis is also observed in AQP4-ON, in the range of 50–79%, longer segments are more frequently involved in MOG-ON.

An ophthalmological examination was conducted at a primary clinic 10 h prior to her admission to the emergency room due to orbital pain, but no significant findings were observed. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in the right eye and light perception positive in the left eye. Notably, a prominent relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was observed in the left eye, accompanied by periocular pain. The slit-lamp examination revealed no remarkable findings, except for injection of the left nasal conjunctiva. Computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated a heterogeneous oval-shaped mass located within the posterior ethmoid cell, extending towards the optic nerve at the infero-medial side of the optic canal, where bony dehiscence was observed (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed compression of the left optic nerve within the canal by an oval-shaped lesion originating from the posterior ethmoidal sinus, displaying low signal intensity on T1 and T2-weighted images (Fig. 1).

### Repeat resection of a cavernous malformation of the optic nerve / chiasm via a frontotemporal approach: 2-dimensional operative video [^1176Gjvo]. Operative Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Cavernous malformations are benign vascular lesions that can arise throughout the central nervous system. The occurrence of a cavernous malformation within the optic nerve or chiasm, however, is extremely uncommon. The case described in this video involved a 36-yr-old woman who presented 3 mo after undergoing a left frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of an optic nerve cavernous malformation. She had initially presented to an outside hospital with vision loss, and the left optic nerve lesion was identified and resected. Although her vision had reportedly improved slightly postoperatively, she awoke 3 mo later with bilateral subjective blurriness and new visual field deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed enlargement of the left optic apparatus hemorrhagic lesion, corresponding to residual cavernous malformation. Given the recurrence of hemorrhage and the associated visual symptoms, the patient underwent a redo left frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of the optic nerve and chiasmal lesion. Histopathologic evaluation revealed thick-walled vessels with focal intervening glial tissue, an absence of neoplastic cells, and hemorrhage, consistent with a cavernous malformation. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Postoperatively, she experienced immediate amelioration in her visual symptoms. She was discharged home on postoperative day 3, and her bitemporal visual field deficit continued to progressively improve through her last ophthalmologic appointment 14 mo after surgery. Postoperative and subsequent surveillance neuroimaging demonstrated complete resection of the cavernous malformation without evidence of recurrence. This case demonstrates the techniques utilized to ensure complete resection of the malformation in this very eloquent region. The patient provided consent for publication.

### Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy following unilateral painful optic neuritis: a case report [^1163HMT6]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 40-year-old, healthy man was referred to our clinic with acute painful visual loss in the right eye for 2 weeks. He suddenly developed acute blurriness in the right eye 2 weeks prior. He developed retrobulbar pain at the same time, which worsened on ocular movement. Over the course of 2 weeks, the blurriness in the right eye worsened. He did not experience any visual discomfort before the recent onset of unilateral vision loss. The patient had no significant social, past medical, past surgical, or trauma history. There was no current medication. He had one maternal uncle who was nearly blind in both eyes (unknown cause) and passed away. He also had a nephew (son of his younger brother) who had strabismus and decreased vision in one eye. A review of systems revealed no other symptoms except progressive visual loss with ocular pain. Upon ocular examination, visual acuity registered 20/40 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. The Ishihara colour test score was 8/14 in the right eye and 12/14 in the left eye. The right pupil reacted slowly and weakly and the left pupil reacted normally to direct light. There was a relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. The ocular motility examination was normal. The anterior segments were normal. On fundus examination, there was optic disc swelling in the right eye with no abnormality in the left eye (Fig. 1 -a). A visual field test showed there was a generalized visual field defect in the right eye and superotemporal visual field defect in the left eye (Fig. 2 -a). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed definite enhancement of the right optic nerve, consistent with optic neuritis. The optic nerve of the left eye showed normal MRI findings from the optic nerve head to the chiasm. No periventricular white matter lesion or brain parenchymal lesion was found (Fig. 3). He was given 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone daily for three days. His ocular pain resolved, and visual acuity improved to 20/20 within 2 weeks after the steroid pulse treatment (Fig. 2 -b).

### Neuromuscular choristoma of the oculomotor nerve: case report [^114bqS8r]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Neuromuscular choristomas (NMC) are rare benign tumors of the peripheral nerves. We report an NMC affecting the oculomotor nerve.

Clinical Presentation

An 18-year-old girl presented with long-standing intermittent retro-orbital pain and oculomotor paresis. Magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated a small nodular lesion on the left oculomotor nerve, similar to the findings for a schwannoma.

Intervention

The tumor was resected with the parental oculomotor nerve, which was reconstructed using a peroneal nerve graft. Postoperatively, the patient became pain-free, and her oculomotor function partially recovered. Histologically, the lesion consisted of well-differentiated smooth muscle fibers intermingled with mature nerve elements consistent with the diagnosis of an NMC, although the possibility of leiomyoma in this rare location was not excluded completely.

Conclusion

NMC may need histological confirmation for diagnosis if they occur in the intracranial space. The resection is feasible, and the function of the affected nerve can be at least partially restored with the nerve reconstruction.

### Schilder's disease: case study with serial neuroimaging [^1166e2wu]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Schilder's myelinoclastic diffuse sclerosis is a rare sporadic demyelinating disease that usually affects children between 5 and 14 years old. The disease often mimics intracranial neoplasm or abscess. We report a 9-year-old girl with Schilder's disease who presented with left hemiparesis. Cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed large lesions in the subcortical white matter of the occipital and parietal lobes of both hemispheres that were indistinguishable from an abscess. A cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal band test was found positive. A diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was then suspected. Serial MRI examinations revealed regression of parenchymal lesions, but there were new developing corpus callosum lesions. After 2 months, the patient presented with right-sided visual loss. MRI examination revealed a right optic nerve lesion. The patient had a dramatic clinical response to corticosteroid therapy. Subsequent control MRI examination revealed regression of both lesions. At 24 months of observation, the patient continued to do well without any complaints or neurologic sequelae.

We report a case of a 28-year-old man who presented with 1-day history of sudden diminution of vision in the right eye. Examination showed unilateral exophthalmos with restricted eyeball movement on upward gaze in the right eye. MRI of the orbit showed no evidence of compression of the optic nerve on the right side. Visual-evoked potential showed prolonged P100 in the right eye. Fundus examination revealed swollen optic disc and para papillary nerve fibre layer splinter haemorrhages with corresponding altitudinal field defect on perimetry suggestive of anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy.

### HaNDL with bilateral central venous occlusions [^112sDSys]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Lumbar puncture demonstrated mildly elevated opening pressure of 28 cm of water, 98 lymphocytes and an elevated protein of 0.83. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose was normal and there were no polymorphs. Fundus photography showed a single, small flame haemorrhage nasal to the left optic disc (figure 1B) and optical coherence tomographic (OCT) scanning showed very subtle disc oedema (figure 1C, D). She was presumed to have a possible viral meningitis and elected to self-discharge against medical advice due to a desire to rest at home. The CSF viral panel, gram stain and culture were subsequently negative. She was treated with low-dose amitriptyline for headaches.

At presentation 01 November 2018 colour fundus photographs of the right (A) and left (B) eyes show clinically normal discs and a single retinal nerve fibre layer haemorrhage in the left eye (arrow). Optical coherence tomographic (OCT) scanning of the right (C) and left (D) optic nerves shows subtle oedema, with OCT scanning of the retinal nerve fibre layer of the right (E) and left (F) eyes within normal limits. Three weeks later (23 November 2018) colour fundus photographs of the right (G) and left (H) eyes show optic disc margins are slightly blurred, central retinal veins are dilated and disc and retinal nerve fibre haemorrhages have developed in both eyes, with a deeper intraretinal haemorrhage (arrow) in the right eye. OCT scanning confirms more prominent disc oedema in the right (I) and left (J) eyes. Automated visual field testing is normal in the left eye (K) and shows an increased blind spot in the right eye (L). On review 2 months later colour fundus photography (M right eye, N left eye) shows residual intraretinal haemorrhage in the right eye, but is otherwise normal. OCT scanning shows resolution of oedema in the right eye (O) and a small amount of residual oedema in the left eye (P). Visual fields (Q left eye, R right eye) are normal. Fluorescein angiography demonstrates the right retinal haemorrhage (S) and is normal in the left eye (T). Fundus autofluorescence demonstrates increased hypoautofluorescence around the right optic disc (U) and to a lesser extent the left optic disc (V). OCT scanning of the retinal nerve fibre layer (W right eye, X left eye) is within normal limits.

The purpose of this article is to understand the complex pathologic spectrum of oculomotor nerve palsy. We review the detailed anatomy and function of the oculomotor nerve and demonstrate how the location of a lesion can drive the differential diagnosis. Lastly, we review atypical presentations of oculomotor nerve palsy to include oculomotor synkinesis and oculomotor nerve hyperactivity. Radiologists must be aware of the typical and atypical presentations of CN III palsy to accurately localize lesions as well as avoid premature exclusion of CN III pathology.

### Optic pathway abscess caused byEndophthalmitis from colon adenocarcinoma requiring incision and drainage of optic nerve and chiasm [^112rvvUL]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

A 62-year-old woman with uncontrolled diabetes presented to emergency department with lethargy, elevated blood sugar, and acute vision loss in right eye over 3 days. Initial visual examination revealed no light perception (NLP) with afferent pupillary defect in right eye and 20/70 visual acuity in left eye. She had acutely elevated right intraocular pressure, proptosis, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia requiring emergent canthotomy and cantholysis by ophthalmology. She was admitted for workup of mucormycosis vs cavernous sinus pathology.

The initial MRI of her brain/orbits with and without contrast demonstrated enhancement of right optic pathway; leptomeningeal enhancement concerning for meningitis; and diffusion restriction of right posterior sclera and choroid concerning for panophthalmitis (Figure 1). She was febrile and started on empiric intravenous antibiotics. She remained encephalopathic and left eye vision worsened to NLP, prompting vitreous tap and injection of intravitreal antibiotics by ophthalmology followed by evisceration of right eye. Cultures from both procedures grew C. septicum, and antibiotics were narrowed to ertapenem. Given association of C. septicum with gastrointestinal malignancy, endoscopic workup revealed multiple cecal masses (ultimately confirmed to be moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma). Colorectal surgery team recommended resection of the cecal masses as there was no evidence of metastasis.

FIGURE 1.
Initial MRI brain with and without contrast showing enhancement of right optic pathway A, leptomeningeal enhancement and right globe panophthalmitis B.

After completion of 2-week antibiotic course, she remained encephalopathic and febrile. Given her continued poor clinical status, she was restarted on ertapenem along with penicillin and metronidazole. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion suggestive of optic nerve/chiasm abscess, along with new third ventricular enhancement concerning for ventriculitis (Figure 2). The neurosurgery team was consulted, and given progression of infection with lack of clinical improvement on antibiotics, she was taken for drainage of optic nerve/chiasm abscess with concurrent right orbital washout by ophthalmology team. A standard right-sided pterional craniotomy was performed to access the optic nerve/chiasm. Intraoperatively, the right optic nerve appeared swollen and indurated, and after incision into the right optic nerve/chiasm, purulent material was drained (Video 1). As the imaging showed extensive abscess within optic nerve/chiasm, additional dissection within the chiasm was performed to maximize source control.

### Pathological findings in enucleated eyes of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1: report of a case with 15-year follow-up and review of 14 patients in the literature [^112FoZQX]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Iris nodules are frequently noted as clinical manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 but the other intraocular manifestations are rare. The purpose of this study is to present a patient with a phthisic eye who underwent enucleation for a cosmetic reason after 15-year follow-up and also to review 14 patients with enucleation described in the literature.

Case Presentation

A 17-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 from infancy underwent the enucleation of phthisic left eye and also had the resection of eyelid subcutaneous mass lesions on the left side for a cosmetic reason. He had undergone four-time preceding surgeries for eyelid and orbital mass reduction on the left side in childhood and had developed total retinal detachment 10 years previously. Pathologically, the enucleated eye showed massive retinal gliosis positive for both S-100 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the area with involvement of the detached retinal neuronal layer, together with a more fibrotic lesion along the choroid which were, in contrast, negative for both S-100 and GFAP. The choroid, ciliary body, and iris did not show apparent neurofibroma while episcleral neurofibroma was present.

Literature Review

In review of enucleated eyes of 14 patients in the literature, buphthalmic eyes with early-onset glaucoma on the unilateral side was clinically diagnosed in 9 patients who frequently showed varying extent of hemifacial neurofibromatosis which involved the eyelid and orbit on the same side. Pathologically, neurofibromas in varying extent were found in the choroid of 12 patients. One patient showed choroidal malignant melanoma on the left side and fusiform enlargement of the optic nerve on the right side suspected of optic nerve glioma. The phthisic eye in another patient showed massive retinal gliosis similar to the present patient.

Conclusions

In summary of the 15 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, including the present patient, buphthalmic or phthisic eyes with no vision were enucleated for cosmetic reasons and showed choroidal neurofibroma in most patients and massive retinal gliosis in two patients including the present patient.

### Pseudoduplication of the optic disc initially resembling a bifurcated optic nerve in a strabismus child: a case report [^1138i8oT]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudoduplication of the optic disc is a rare clinical condition that is characterized by a circumscribed, disc-like lesion with radiating vessels but only one normal optic nerve. We report a rare case that initially resembled a bifurcated optic nerve in a strabismus child.

Case Presentation

A 6-year-old female child was initially referred to our hospital due to perceptual exotropia of 15 degrees with poor fixation of the left eye. The visual acuity of the left eye was 3/100 with a refraction of +1.75/-1.25×175. Fundus images of her left eye revealed a circumscribed and disc-like lesion located one disc diameter (DD) below the true optic disc that showed profound central cupping resembling a second optic disc with a vascular supply. B scan ultrasonography showed an optic nerve with a bifurcated weak-echo region, suggesting that two strands originated from the optic nerve. Optic coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated a large crater-like depression of the lesion, indicating a colobomatous defect covered by a mysterious membranous structure, a disturbed nerve fibre layer and the absence of regular outer retinal layers. A perimetric examination revealed a relatively superior defect. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the left eye globe showed an abnormal morphology and that the optic nerve was abnormally shaped and shifted nasally in the left eye. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) of the left eye revealed the absence of independent vascular vessels in the disc-like lesion. Hyperfluorescence with patchy fluorescence was evident in the inferotemporal area of the disc. Vascular loops surrounding the temporal region were evident in both eyes. Her right eye was normal except for the vascular loop. We proposed that this represented a case of pseudoduplication of the optic disc. The patient did not undergo any treatment, and her visual acuity remained stable during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

Our patient presented with a deep and ectatic coloboma below the optic disc that communicated with the true optic nerve and was originally thought to indicate a bifurcated optic nerve. This case suggests that atypical ectatic colobomas should be considered before diagnosing malformations related to the optic nerve in double optic disc cases.

### Sarcoid optic neuropathy [^115KExeg]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

A 45-year-old woman presented with sudden complete vision loss in her left eye and retroorbital pain worsened by eye movements. A previous milder episode of vision loss had occurred in the same eye 1 year before, with complete recovery after high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone. She had no light perception in the left eye with a swollen optic disc, but with a normal right optic disc. There were no systemic manifestations or infections. MR scan of the brain showed extensive enlargement and enhancement of the left optic nerve and optic chiasm. After excluding infections and autoimmune markers, a left optic nerve biopsy confirmed non-caseating granulomas, leading to a diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis.

### Rare presentation of sarcoidosis with optic neuropathy and third nerve palsy [^114YUQtJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic, idiopathic and granulomatous disease, which most commonly affects the skin, lungs and lymph nodes but can affect virtually any organ. Neurosarcoidosis can be the presenting or the only clinical manifestation accounting for 5%-15% of sarcoid diagnoses. In contrast to uveitis which is the most common ophthalmic manifestation, neuro-ophthalmic signs are uncommon in sarcoidosis. Optic neuropathy is the most common neuro-ophthalmic sign (70% in one series). Sarcoid-related optic neuropathy commonly presents with a picture similar to optic neuritis. Less commonly, optic nerve involvement occurs secondary to compressive lesions, or from direct granulomatous infiltration. Neuroimaging is crucial to identify the location of the lesion. We describe a case of sarcoid-related compressive optic neuropathy and third nerve palsy and highlight the challenging nature of neurosarcoidosis in a patient without a prior diagnosis of the disease.

### Assessment of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis: practical guidelines [^113beTMe]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Optic nerve lesions

Although optic nerve imaging is not required in the current multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria to demonstrate dissemination in space, it can be helpful in confirming optic nerve involvement in multiple sclerosis and can exclude alternative diagnoses for atypical optic neuropathies.

Optic nerve imaging for lesion identification should include coronal fat-suppressed T 2 -weighted sequences with submillimetre in-plane resolution (ideally 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm or better) and slice thickness of ≤ 3 mm. 2D coronal STIR and 2D coronal fast spin-echo with fat suppression are typically used. Alternatively, 3D DIR and 2D/3D fat-suppressed T 2 -FLAIR offer good contrast, fat and fluid suppression, but slightly lower spatial resolution.

For the detection of acute lesions, a post-contrast fat-suppressed T 1 -weighted spin-echo or gradient-echo sequence is recommended. A pre-contrast non-fat-suppressed T 1 -weighted sequence is usually acquired, which can help to rule out possible alternative diagnoses such as intraconal masses or extraocular muscle abnormalities. Slices should be ≤ 3-mm thick and should cover the whole length of the optic nerve from globe to the optic chiasm.

Typical acute optic nerve lesions are characterized by T 2 hyperintensity, associated optic nerve swelling and contrast-enhancement. However, these findings are not multiple sclerosis-specific, since they can occur in other inflammatory conditions, including neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, ischaemic or infectious diseases. Post-acute or chronic lesions exhibit atrophy and T 2 hyperintensity. Red flags for the optic nerve include: posterior optic nerve involvement also including the chiasm, suggestive of anti-AQP4-IgG-seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, simultaneous bilateral optic nerve involvement and a long optic nerve lesion, suggestive of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and especially anti-MOG-IgG disease. A T 2 -hyperintense lesion in the nerve can differentiate multiple sclerosis from ischaemic and toxic optic neuropathies or Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy that do not show acute T 2 -hyperintense lesions in the optic nerve.

Perioptic nerve sheath enhancement is a recognized phenomenon in optic neuritis although soft tissue enhancement extrinsic to the nerve, affecting the orbit, orbital apex or cavernous sinus signifies a non-multiple sclerosis aetiology [e.g. granulomatous disease, tumour, infection, anti-MOG-IgG disease].

### A 28-year-old woman with left-sided weakness and atypical MRI lesions: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^113YpK59]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

Our patient presented with left-sided weakness and right-sided paresthesias that initially spontaneously resolved within 2 months and then recurred several months later and thereafter continued to gradually worsen. Her symptoms coincided with a preceding viral infection each time. Her MRI of the spine demonstrated an enhancing, expansile T2-hyperintense lesion from C3–6 and a nonenhancing lesion in the left aspect of the thoracic cord at T2-T4. The differential diagnosis for her clinical presentation was broad.

The initial etiology was considered to be inflammatory/autoimmune. The presence of 2 spinal cord lesions may suggest a relapsing inflammatory/autoimmune disease, especially when there were both enhancing and nonenhancing lesions present. Moreover, her partial response to several immunomodulatory therapies lent credence to a possible inflammatory/autoimmune cause. Her enhancing cervical cord lesion was left-sided and eccentric (causing a hemicord lesion) that led her to present with a Brown-Séquard syndrome, which could be seen in inflammatory/autoimmune conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), although it should be noted that neoplastic lesions could also rarely cause a Brown-Séquard syndrome. The absence of brain lesions and the longitudinally extensive nature of her cervical cord lesion argued against MS, which tended to favor multiple discontinuous short-segment lesions in the spinal cord. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and MOG antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) could both cause longitudinally extensive myelopathies (≥ 3 vertebral segments). The enhancement pattern and expansile, edematous nature of the patient's cervical cord lesion could be seen in acute phases of NMOSD or MOGAD. However, the patient had negative serum AQP4 and MOG antibody testing on multiple cell-based assays. Although seronegative NMOSD could account for her presentation, she did not have any other core clinical characteristic of NMOSD that would fulfill the 2015 NMOSD diagnostic criteria. The criteria for diagnosing NMOSD without AQP4 antibodies required at least 2 core clinical characteristics (acute myelitis, optic neuritis, area postrema syndrome, acute brainstem syndrome, symptomatic narcolepsy or acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions, or symptomatic cerebral syndrome with NMOSD-typical brain lesions) resulting from one or more clinical attacks. At least one of the core clinical characteristics must be optic neuritis, acute myelitis with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, or area postrema syndrome. The patient only had acute myelitis with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and no other core clinical characteristic, so she did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for seronegative NMOSD. Finally, hypointense lesions on T1-weighted sequences ("T1 dark spots") could be found in inflammatory/autoimmune conditions, including NMOSD and MS, although our patient's cervical cord lesion was isointense on T1-weighted sequence (Figure 2).

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^114ypqtm]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Examination — 3rd nerve palsy assessment specifies that a comprehensive eye examination should be performed paying particular attention to the sensorimotor examination, evidence of ptosis and anisocoria, and pupillary responses in bright and dim illumination. It should also include a fundus examination to evaluate for the presence of papilledema or optic atrophy. Evaluation of the 3rd nerve palsy depends on the presumed location of the lesion and is based on other accompanying neurologic findings, and isolated 3rd nerve palsy, however, is what most clinicians encounter. The important characteristics are whether the pupil is involved and the extent of the motility disorder and ptosis; a classic pupil-sparing 3rd nerve palsy has normal pupillary function, complete ptosis, and complete (related) motility dysfunction, and in this situation, the etiology is almost always secondary to microvascular.

### Surgical outcomes of intraconal cavernous venous malformation according to their location in four right-angled sectors [^111W63B1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography and MRI are 2 frequently used imaging studies for the diagnosis of the lesions, and ultrasound and nuclear imaging are also occasionally used. In the present study, CT or MRI was performed before and after surgery for diagnosis and evaluation of the surgical outcomes, respectively.

Cavernous venous malformations are reported to occur more frequently on the left side and within the intraconal space of the eye socket. Different studies have used different methods for defining the locations of these lesions as there is currently no standard method. However, the most frequent site of origin for CVMs is the lateral part of the optic nerve, and the inferior quadrant. Although it remains unclear why the lesion frequently occurs on the left side, the reason for the frequent onset at the lateral part of the optic nerve within the intraconal space is that this region is thought to be the arterial side of the circulation, with extensive distribution of small arteries. Similarly, there were more lesions on the left side (n = 10) than on the right side (n = 8) in the present study. In addition, the lower-outer quadrant of the intraconal space was the most common location (44.4%), followed by the lower-inner (22.2%), upper-outer (16.7%), and upper-inner (3 patients, 16.7%) quadrants; these findings were in agreement with those of previous studies reporting a greater frequency in the lower-outer quadrant of the optic nerve.

### Acute peripheral unilateral vestibulopathy of the whole nerve causes increased impairment of spatial orientation and poorer long-term outcome [^115BuqFt]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Demographic data and clinical findings in the acute phase:

96 patients with acute UVP were prospectively enrolled in the study (47 female, 49 male; mean age 58 ± 14 years). Distribution of age did not differ between the patient groups (sUVP vs. s+iUVP), the proportion of female patients, however, was larger in the s+iUVP group (F = 4.363, p = 0.039). No significant differences were found concerning the unilateral caloric hyporesponsiveness in the context of the underlying UVP. Of those 96 patients, a total of n = 35 (36%) presented with a combined involvement of the superior and the inferior part of the vestibular nerve resulting in s+iUVP. In 61 patients (64%), an isolated lesion of the superior part was detected. We did not identify patients with an isolated lesion of the inferior part of the vestibular nerve. In the acute phase of UVP, patients with s+iUVP showed a significantly greater tilt of the SVV and a significantly increased OT (for details, see Fig. 1). Overall, measurements of spatial orientation and vestibular roll plane function (SVV tilt and OT) were significantly more impaired in the s+iUVP patients.

### Detecting optic nerve lesions in clinically isolated syndrome and multiple sclerosis: double-inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging in comparison with visually evoked potentials [^114s3qyV]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

Optic neuritis (ON) is a frequent manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS), traditionally diagnosed clinically and by visually evoked potentials (VEP). However, ON can also be assessed by MRI. Here we compare the diagnostic performance of 3D-double inversion recovery-MRI (3D-DIR) and VEPs in patients with definite MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).

Methods

39 patients and 17 healthy controls were studied. Whole-brain-3D-DIR images (3T) were independently assessed for DIR-hyperintense optic nerve lesions (DHLs) by two neuroradiologists, and results related to quantitative VEP-parameters.

Results

Interrater concordance for DHLs was high (κ = 0.82). No DHLs were observed in controls. In patients, abnormal VEPs, i.e. prolonged latencies, diminished amplitudes or abnormal latency or amplitude differences (re contralateral nerve) of the P100-component, were observed in 22, and DHLs in 32 of 78 optic nerves, the latter including 11 nerves with normal VEPs, 10 without clinical signs or history of ON, and 6 with both normal VEPs and no clinical evidence for ON. Using either abnormal VEPs and/or presence of DHLs and/or clinical evidence for ON as a compound reference criterion of optic nerve affection, sensitivity was significantly higher for 3D-DIR than for VEPs (91%, 95%-CI 77–98% vs. 63%, 95%-CI 45–79%, respectively, p = 0.006).

Conclusion

DHLs are highly specific for optic nerve pathology. In the context of MS, 3D-DIR-MRI is a suitable tool to reveal acute or chronic optic nerve lesions and more sensitive than VEPs. The significance of optic nerve involvement in the diagnostic classification of CIS vs. definite MS requires further study.

### Optic nerve lesion length at the acute phase of optic neuritis is predictive of retinal neuronal loss [^115HoFV7]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute optic neuritis (ON) is a classical presenting symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), and anti-MOG-associated disorders. The resulting visual impairment is variable and can be severe. Clinicians are in need of predictive biomarkers to optimize the management of acute ON. In this longitudinal study (IRMANO, NCT03651662), we evaluated the ability of optic nerve lesion length measured on MRI at the acute phase of ON to predict retinal neuro-axonal loss and visual impairment at a chronic stage.

Methods

We conducted a longitudinal study (IRMANO, NCT03651662) of patients who presented a clinical episode of ON (≤ 8 weeks). All patients underwent a retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and a brain/optic nerve MRI, including 3D double-inversion recovery (DIR) sequence at the acute phase of ON and 12 months later. Primary outcomes were optic nerve DIR hypersignal lesion length, macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) volume measured on OCT, and low-contrast monocular visual acuity (LCMVA).

Results

The study group included 51 patients (33 women, mean age of 32.4 years ± 7.9). We recruited patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (n = 20), a relapsing-remitting MS (n = 23), an isolated ON (n = 6), and a first clinical episode of NMOSD (n = 2). Optic nerve DIR hypersignal was observed in all but 1 symptomatic optic nerves. At inclusion, the mean optic nerve lesion length (in mm) was 12.35 ± 5.98. The mean GCIPL volume (in mm³) significantly decreased between inclusion (1.90 ± 0.18) and M 12 (1.67 ± 0.21; p < 0.0001). Optic nerve lesion length at inclusion was significantly associated with GCIPL thinning (estimate ± SD; -0.012 ± 0.004; p = 0.0016) and LCMVA at M 12 (0.016 ± 0.003; p < 0.001). Optic nerve lesion length significantly increased at M 12 (15.76 ± 8.70; p = 0.0007). The increase in optic nerve lesion length was significantly associated with the GCIPL thinning between inclusion and M 12 (-0.012 ± 0.003; p = 0.0011).

Discussion

At the acute phase of ON, optic nerve lesion length is an imaging biomarker predictive of retinal neuro-axonal loss and chronic visual impairment, which can help to stratify future therapeutic strategies in acute ON.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class I evidence that optic nerve lesion length measured on MRI during the acute phase of a first episode of ON is associated with long-term retinal neuro-axonal loss and visual impairment.

Combining an understanding of neuro-ophthalmologic anatomy with proper imaging techniques provides a powerful method to detect lesions involving the afferent and efferent visual pathways. Precise documentation of the extent of injury within the nervous system is becoming increasingly important to assess and monitor the effect of neurologic therapies. This review will focus on those common neuro-ophthalmologic problems that have exquisite localizing value on neuro-imaging.

### A clinicoradiologic analysis of symptomatic craniofacial fibro-osseous lesions [^111rzUZY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To outline the clinical and radiologic aspects of symptomatic craniofacial fibro-osseous lesions and to study the appropriate surgical management with follow-up results.

Study Design and Setting

A retrospective review of 11 patients who underwent surgical treatment during 1985 to 2004 in a tertiary health care center.

Results

Most (72.7%) cases were of fibrous dysplasia and were under 25 years of age (72%). Maxilla was the most common bone involved (81%). Lateral rhinotomy was the main approach for surgical resection. One patient underwent bilateral optic nerve decompression (left side therapeutic and on right side prophylactic). Six (54.5%) cases had recurrences that were managed by either radical surgery (total maxillectomy) or by further shaving off the lesion.

Conclusion

Treatment of craniofacial fibro-osseous lesions is highly individualized. A conservative approach may not be able to treat all cases of craniofacial fibro-osseous lesions. A more radical approach that includes a craniofacial resection or a total maxillectomy may be warranted in few cases.

Indications for surgical therapy of the pituitary incidentaloma — We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma be referred for surgery if they have the following: a VF deficit due to the lesion, other visual abnormalities such as ophthalmoplegia or neurological compromise due to compression by the lesion, lesion abutting or compressing the optic nerves or chiasm on MRI, pituitary apoplexy with visual disturbance, or hypersecreting tumors other than prolactinomas as recommended by other guidelines of The Endocrine Society and The Pituitary Society. We suggest that surgery be considered for patients with a pituitary incidentaloma if they have the following: clinically significant growth of the pituitary incidentaloma, loss of endocrinological function, a lesion close to the optic chiasm and a plan to become pregnant, or unremitting headache.

### The swollen optic nerve: an approach to diagnosis and management [^112xaNFv]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of swollen optic nerves differs according to whether the swelling is unilateral or bilateral, or whether visual function is normal or affected. Patients with a unilaterally swollen optic nerve and normal visual function most likely have optic nerve head drusen. Patients with abnormal visual function most likely have demyelinating optic neuritis or non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy. Patients with bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads and normal visual function most likely have papilloedema, and require neuroimaging followed by lumbar puncture. However, if their visual function is affected, the most likely causes are bilateral demyelinating optic neuritis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein optic neuritis: these patients require investigating with contrast-enhanced MRI of the orbits.

### Unilateral pharmacologic mydriasis in a patient with respiratory compromise… [^114jaPcR]. JAMA Network (1997). Excellent credibility.

Acute unilateral mydriasis can be the heralding sign of a neuro-ophthalmologic emergency. Textbooks often assert that pupillary dilation may be the first and only sign of third nerve dysfunction from aneurysmal or tumoral compression, tentorial herniation, or meningeal inflammation or infiltration. Evaluation for these entities frequently involves extensive, costly, and invasive testing. Less harmful causes of an acutely dilated pupil — specifically, pharmacologic dilation — must also be considered. We describe a patient in whom an aerosolized anticholinergic solution caused unilateral mydriasis. Report of a Case. A 17-year-old white male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome was hospitalized with complications following a bone marrow transplant and was, subsequently, intubated for respiratory compromise. Two days after extubation, the patient had a dilated left pupil as well as new onset seizure activity.

Neurologic consultation revealed that the left pupil was dilated 7 mm, with normal visual acuity and normal eye movements. Given the patient's immunocompromised. Goldstein JB, Biousse V, Newman NJ. Unilateral Pharmacologic Mydriasis in a Patient With Respiratory Compromise. Arch Ophthalmol. 1997;

### Comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination [^116bSmvT]. AOA (2017). Medium credibility.

Optic nerve hypoplasia — Optic nerve hypoplasia is one of the most prevalent causes of visual impairment among young children, with the Babies Count Registry reporting it as the third most prevalent cause of vision impairment in children age 3 years or younger in the United States; although causes may include prenatal exposures and complications, Seventy percent of the cases identified have no known risk factors, and the mother's young age (≤ 20 years) and primiparity are described as predominant background characteristics; evidence also suggests it infrequently occurs in isolation and is more appropriately designated as the syndrome of optic nerve hypoplasia, in which most children have hypothalamic dysfunction and/or neurodevelopmental impairment, such as cerebral palsy or growth problems.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116qDYVx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Pituitary incidentaloma — follow-up and indications for surgery: We recommend that patients with incidentalomas not meeting criteria for surgical removal be followed with clinical assessments, neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months for macroincidentalomas, 1 yr for a microincidentaloma, and thereafter progressively less frequently if unchanged in size), visual field examinations for incidentalomas that abut or compress the optic nerve and chiasm (6 months and yearly), and endocrine testing for macroincidentalomas (6 months and yearly) after the initial evaluations. We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma be referred for surgery if they have a visual field deficit; signs of compression by the tumor leading to other visual abnormalities, such as ophthalmoplegia, or neurological compromise due to compression by the lesion; a lesion abutting the optic nerves or chiasm; pituitary apoplexy with visual disturbance; or if the incidentaloma is a hypersecreting tumor other than a prolactinoma.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^111i8hAr]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult Strabismus PPP — 6th nerve lesion localization describes that understanding the path of the 6th nerve aids localization of the lesion as well as the cause; the 6th nerve originates in the abducens nucleus of the pons and lesions involving the 6th nerve nucleus often are accompanied by an ipsilateral facial paralysis or a complete horizontal gaze deficit; within the pons it courses through the corticospinal tracts, and lesions in this region can lead to a contralateral hemiparesis; the nerve then ascends in the subarachnoid space and passes underneath the petroclinoid ligament to enter into the cavernous sinus; and tethering along this pathway make it susceptible to stretching from increased intracranial pressure, cerebrospinal fluid inflammation, infection, infiltration, or compression from clival tumors.

Fig. 2
Saccadic eye movements from a patient with right INO. Saccadic eye movements and summary results of a patient with right INO. A 10° rightward saccade, with peak velocities around 350°/s. C Both eyes show a similar velocity profile for this saccade. B 10° leftward saccade, with velocity shown in (D). The left abducting eye (black) moves faster and reaches the target earlier than the right adducting eye (red), indicating a right INO. E Peak eye velocity is plotted against saccade size for all trials. For rightward (positively directed) saccades, both eyes have approximately the same peak velocity, but for leftward saccades, the right adducting eye (red) moves with a peak velocity of less than half that of the left abducting eye (black). We defined the versional disconjugacy index (VDI) as the ratio of the peak velocity of abducting to adducting eyes, for 20° saccades based on exponential fits, resulting in an increased VDI of 2.56 for saccades to the left (indicating a right INO) and a normal VDI of 0.9 to the right. The inset shows the corresponding MR image from this patient, where all three of our raters diagnosed a lesion of the right MLF in the brainstem

Figure 3 shows additional patient examples, highlighting incongruent findings between the VOG and MR results. Figure 3 A shows a patient with bilateral INO, where the MR raters largely concurred, with two finding bilateral lesions and the third a unilateral left lesion. Figure 3 B illustrates a patient where all three MR raters diagnosed a right lesion, but no INO was detected with the VOG measures. Figure 3 C shows a patient with bilateral INO, particularly on the left, where the patient had severely slowed saccades with the left eye, yet no lesion was identified by any MR rater. In contrast, no INO was detected in the patient shown in Fig. 3 D, where all MR raters reported a right-sided lesion. Note that in this patient, though, all saccades were unusually slowed, with maximum velocities of about 260°/s, compared to our average of 465°/s for the healthy controls, suggesting this patient does indeed have an underlying saccade pathology that affects both adducting and abducting saccades to either side, which may mask the typical pattern observed in INO.

MRI images revealed that the morphology of the globe in the left eye was abnormal and that the abnormally shaped optic nerve in the left eye was partially shifted toward the nasal side. The right eye showed a single optic nerve

According to the FFA examination of the right eye, there was a vascular loop without exudation in the surrounding temporal region (Fig. 4 a), and the rest of the region was normal (Fig. 4 b). In the left eye, the vessels entering the upper retinal quadrants were normal. A descending venule drained into the optic disc and divided into 2 branches when it reached the disc-like lesion. A vessel from the true disc arched across the disc-like lesion. Approximately 5 small arterioles and 3 venules departed from the central cupping area (Fig. 4 c). Hyperfluorescence with patchy fluorescence was evident in the inferotemporal area of the disc (Fig. 4 e). A vascular loop without exudation was also found in the surrounding temporal region of the left eye (Fig. 4 e). The inferior disc-like lesions showed marked hypofluorescence, and the area located between the optic disc and the lesion showed late hyperfluorescence (Fig. 4 f). The fluorescein that filled the arteries of the presumed pseudoduplicate of the optic disc descended from the optic disc instead of from the inferior disc-like lesion. The second disc was also a colobomatous-type disc, but it had an abnormal supply of vessels. The macular area was displaced in the subtemporal region (Fig. 4 c and f).

### Emergency surgery in a severe penetrating skull base injury by a screwdriver: case report and literature review [^115fHXhM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Despite the need for emergency brain decompression, non-surgical extraction of the screwdriver was promptly rejected by the authors due to the high risk of a middle cerebral artery and/or optic nerve lesion.

Hence, an emergency surgical removal of the screwdriver was selected to preserve both the middle cerebral artery and the function of the left optic nerve. Moreover, surgery allowed to repair the dura, stop the leaking and avoid possible risks of CSF infection.

The pterional approach was selected against other cranio-facial approaches, and, in particular, sub-cranial approaches, considering the position of the screwdriver tip in relation to the involved neurovascular structures. Furthermore, although the screwdriver tip had pierced through the right maxilla, a left pterional approach was deemed most suitable as it allowed to obtain a direct view of the left optic nerve injury, to explore the middle fossa and to repair the dura laceration.

A right-side pterional approach was discarded as it would not have ensured a full view of the intracranial area where the screwdriver was lodged nor the neurovascular structures by it affected.

Although a left frontal approach allows to easily reach the left orbital roof and optic nerve, it could have resulted dangerous for a frontal pole retraction and possibly caused damage to both parenchyma and arteries.

A left sub-frontal approach to the orbit might have been suitable if the tip of the screwdriver had caused a fracture of the left orbital roof and/or the left ethmoidal plane with or without optic nerve involvement. Furthermore, as the reported case required exploration of both the frontal pole and the Sylvian fossa, this approach was not deemed suitable.

An extra-cranial approach to the orbit, such as the anterior superior approach, anterior median approach and Krönlein approach, would have been appropriate if the screwdriver had involved the left orbit with no anterior skull base fractures.

### Glaucomatous optic nerve damage in the contralateral eye of a patient with peripapillary retinoschisis: a case report [^116Dfqfv]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripapillary retinoschisis (PPRS) is often associated with glaucomatous eyes. It usually occurs in eyes with a more advanced stage of glaucoma with obvious optic nerve damage. We report a patient who was found to have PPRS in one eye during a routine physical examination without obvious glaucoma symptoms. Further examination revealed glaucomatous visual field loss and retinal nerve fiber layer defects in the contralateral eye.

Case presentation

A 55-year-old man presented for a routine physical examination. The anterior segment was normal in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed an elevated and red optic disc in the right eye. In addition, scattered patchy red lesions were seen on the retina on the temporal side of the optic disc. The color and boundary of the left optic disc were normal, and the cup-to-disc ratio was 0.6. Optical coherence tomography showed retinoschisis on the optic nerve head of the right eye throughout the entire circumference, extending to the retina on the temporal side of the optic disc. The intraocular pressure was 18 mmHg OD and 19 mmHg OS. The patient was diagnosed with PPRS (OD). However, no optic disc pit or optic disc coloboma was found. Further examination showed that the visual field of the patient's right eye was generally normal, while a glaucomatous visual field defect was found in the left eye, which manifested as a nasal step visual field defect. Moreover, stereophotography and a red-free fundus image revealed two retinal nerve fiber layer defects in the supratemporal and infratemporal regions of the retina of the left eye. Continuous intraocular pressure measurement found that the intraocular pressure fluctuated between 18 and 22 mmHg OD and 19–26 mmHg OS during the daytime. Primary open-angle glaucoma was then diagnosed.

Conclusions

In this case, we found that PPRS was associated with glaucomatous optic nerve changes and visual field defects in the fellow eye.

### Concomitant primary CNS lymphoma and FSH-pituitary adenoma arising within the sella. entirely coincidental? [^112pxGY8]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

A 74-year-old Caucasian man presented to the neurosurgical department with a 10-day history of acute onset bilateral retro-orbital pain, headaches, and nausea. Four days after the onset of headaches, he developed left-sided ptosis. On the following day, he also noticed some double vision. He had no features of endocrinopathy.

On examination, his visual acuity and visual fields were normal. He had a partial left third nerve palsy with ptosis and partial mydriasis of the left pupil, which sluggishly reacted to light. He reported diplopia on right lateral gaze, with a left medial rectus dysfunction. Systemic examination was unremarkable, with no palpable lymphadenopathy or intra-abdominal masses.

Imaging

Computed tomography (CT) and, subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the head revealed a 27 × 25 × 20 mm soft tissue mass in the pituitary fossa with suprasellar extension, which just abutted the inferior surface of the optic chiasm (Figure 1). There was an extension into the sphenoid sinuses and the left cavernous sinus. On the unenhanced scan, there were no areas of significant hemorrhage to radiologically suggest a major apoplexy. The diagnosis was that of a pituitary macroadenoma.

FIGURE 1.
Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the sellar region at presentation. A, Sagittal T1 with contrast. B, Coronal T1 with contrast.

The history, however, was suggestive of a pituitary apoplexy (the MRI was performed 10 days after the acute event), and although it was explained to the patient that he may improve with conservative treatment, the plan was to proceed with elective surgical resection of the pituitary lesion in a few weeks' time, during which his progress would be monitored.

(c) Axial T2‐weighted MRI sequence of a 12‐year‐old female patient with MOG‐immunoglobulin (Ig)G‐positive ADEM and bilateral optic neuritis (ON) showing optic nerve swelling and hyperintensity

MRI findings in ON can include T2 hyperintense lesions, nerve swelling and gadolinium enhancement of the affected optic nerve on T1‐weighted imaging. In MOG‐ON, optic nerve lesions are usually extensive, also termed longitudinally extensive ON (LEON), affecting more than half of the pre‐chiasmatic optic nerve length. MOG‐ON also predominantly affects the anterior part of the optic nerve. This can help with differentiating MOG‐ON from AQP4‐ON, which is also often extensive, but predominantly affecting the posterior part of the optic pathway (including the optic chiasm). Although MS‐ON typically involves shorter segments of the optic nerve compared to both MOG‐ON and AQP4‐ON, bilateral ON, with bilateral radiological optic nerve involvement, is found in more than 80% of MOG‐ON and AQP4‐ON patients compared to only 20% in MS‐ON. Additionally, in paediatric patients, bilateral ON has been associated with higher MOG‐IgG titres. Another characteristic feature described in MOG‐ON is perineuritis with perineural or periorbital gadolinium enhancement in the orbital soft tissue that is not typically found in MS‐ON (Figure 2).

### Update on the diagnosis and treatment of neuromyelits optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD)-revised recommendations of the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS). Part I: diagnosis and differential diagnosis [^1118fGsz]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Practical recommendations on imaging — MRI

MRI examinations are an essential part of the clinical workup for diagnosis and monitoring of NMOSD. The initial MRI serves as an important baseline examination and shall cover both the brain and the spinal cord. MRI is also essential for distinguishing NMOSD from other CNS conditions.

If available, (fat-suppressed) MRI of the orbits is highly recommended, since it allows more precise depiction of the optic nerve than routine brain MR imaging. It may be required in patients with negative or unknown serostatus if making a diagnosis of NMOSD depends on the presence of longitudinally extensive optic neuritis (LEON) or an optic nerve lesion involving the optic chiasm (see Box 2) and conventional brain MRI does not allow reliable assessment of lesion extension. Particular notice should be paid to lesion location and extension, the presence or absence of optic head swelling, perineural gadolinium (Gd) enhancement, chiasmal lesions, and lesions of the optic tracts. While NMOSD more often affects the posterior (intracranial) part of the optic nerve, lesions in MS and MOG-EM/MOGAD are more frequently located in the anterior portion. Swelling of the optic nerve disk/head on orbital MRI is typically seen in MOG-EM/MOGAD, may infrequently occur in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, and is very rare in MS, which typically manifests with retrobulbar ON. LEON is frequent in both NMOSD and MOG-EM/MOGAD but typically absent in MS. The optic chiasm and, more rarely, the optic tracts (often bilaterally) may be affected as well in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, whereas these structures are mostly spared in MS; according to recent data, chiasmal lesions are also not uncommon in MOG-EM/MOGAD and then often extend from the anterior part of the optic nerve to the chiasm. Simultaneous bilateral optic nerve involvement is rather infrequent at onset in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD (~ 15% in a European cohort) but may occur later in the disease course. It is more common in seronegative NMOSD and in MOG-EM/MOGAD and relatively rare in MS. Gd-enhanced imaging of the optic nerve is recommended for differential diagnostic purposes. Enhancement of the perineural optic nerve sheath strongly favors a diagnosis of MOG-EM/MOGAD over NMOSD or MS. Demonstration of optic nerve Gd enhancement may also facilitate the discrimination between true relapses and pseudorelapses (defined as worsening or re-occurrence of pre-existing neurological symptoms caused by systemic metabolic changes rather than immune-mediated mechanisms) by providing supportive information. Of note, recent studies found Gd-enhancing lesions of the optic nerve in 20–50% of inter-attack MRI scans, i.e. in asymptomatic patients. In one study, these lesions were mainly located to sites of previous ON attacks, whereas new asymptomatic lesions as detected by Gd-enhanced imaging at sites not previously affected were very rare. Asymptomatic lesions were significantly shorter in length (in mm) than attack-related lesions and were not associated with an increased risk for site-specific attacks in the following year in another study.

### Lens subluxation combined with Parry-Romberg syndrome: case report [^112Wg9hz]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 60-year-old woman, who complained of "right visual blur for 2 years", came to our clinics of Eye and ENT hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai on 4 Apr. 2020. The patient had undergone combined cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOLs) implantation surgery in her left eye in local hospital in 2012, and the IOL was removed in 2015 due to IOL dislocation. She had a history of uterine fibroids surgery in 2012. At the age of 12, she had persistent right facial paralysis of unknown etiology and received facial neurotrophic drug injections (specifically unknown) in local hospital. Then the right side of her face showed progressive atrophy. She did not have history of ocular trauma, infection and local or systemic allergy. Neither did she have myopia, diabetes, hypertension or other diseases. The patient had no family history of genetic diseases.

The patient was examined comprehensively. She had an obvious right facial muscle atrophy with right facial paralysis. Her mouth and nose were deviated toward the right side of hemifacial atrophy (Fig. 1 A). Her best corrected visual acuity was counting fingers in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was normal in her both eyes. She had pseudoptosis eyelid and enophthalmos in the right eye. No vertical and horizontal motility restriction were found in both eye. The pupils were dilated about 10 mm diameters with iris atrophy in both eyes. The right lens was opaque with Lens Opacity Classification System III grading cortical grade 3 nuclear grade 3 and postcapsular grade 4. The zonular fiber was loosened and elongated by nearly 220° (lens subluxation) in the right eye (Fig. 1 B). The fundus examination was normal in the right eye. Her left eye was aphakic with obvious optic nerve atrophy (C/D 1.0) and disorganized macula area. Fundus OCT indicated that the macular structure was normal in the right eye (Fig. 1 C). Her head MRI report showed several ischemic foci in the brain, empty sella and cerebral arteriosclerosis changes. Based on the above examination, the diagnosis was age-related cataract combined with lens subluxation in the right eye, aphakic eye and optic nerve atrophy in the left eye, and progressive hemifacial atrophy (Parry-Romberg syndrome).

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^111gwKzX]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis — 3rd nerve pathway and lesion localization notes that the 3rd nerve follows a course from its origin in the midbrain to the orbit. If complete 3rd nerve palsy is accompanied by contralateral superior rectus weakness, the lesion is nuclear. Within the subarachnoid space, the 3rd nerve passes close to the tentorial edge and lateral to the posterior communicating artery; aneurysms in this location cause a pupil-involving 3rd nerve palsy, although the pupil may appear normal at presentation, and mass lesions or intracranial bleeding can force the uncus through the tentorial notch, causing compression. The nerve then enters the cavernous sinus, where pathology may be accompanied by 6th nerve and 4th nerve paralysis; within the cavernous sinus, the 3rd nerve separates into superior and inferior divisions that enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure, and divisional palsy typically localizes the lesion to the orbit; if the lesion involves the orbital apex or orbit, there may be associated optic neuropathy and proptosis.

A wide range of orbital disorders, including an orbital mass, infection, inflammation, systemic disease, or intracranial lesions, may be encountered with imaging. Evaluation of orbital disorders requires the combination of accurate and relevant clinical information with an understanding of anatomy and pathologic processes. An imaging approach to an orbital differential diagnosis includes assessment for alteration of a normal orbital structure, a lesion that does not belong in the orbit, or alteration of the orbit from bone or periorbital disorders. This approach, combined with key elements of clinical history, leads to a narrower differential diagnosis and improved patient care.

### Valsalva retinopathy induced by handstand: a case report [^113oLYsH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Valsalva retinopathy is known to occur as a sudden preretinal or sub-internal limiting membrane hemorrhage induced by a rapid rise in venous pressure following increased intrathoracic or intraabdominal pressure. Here we report a case of Valsalva retinopathy that was probably induced by straining that occurred due to following a handstand.

Case Presentation

A 15-year-old boy became aware of decreased visual acuity in his left eye immediately after doing a handstand for approximately 10s during physical education class, and subsequently visited a local clinic on the same day. Upon examination, a vitreous hemorrhage (VH) in the posterior pole of the fundus was found in his left eye, and he was subsequently referred to our department 7days later. Upon examination, the VH around the optic nerve head of the left eye appeared to be resolved, and an oval-shaped sub-internal limiting membrane (sub-ILM) hemorrhage was found in the superonasal side of the optic nerve head. No abnormalities were observed in the macular area. Four months later, the sub-ILM hemorrhage was found to have spontaneously resolved. Subsequent fluorescein angiography examinations revealed no abnormal findings at the lesion site.

Conclusions

In this patient, we hypothesize that the Valsalva retinopathy was induced by straining that occurred due to a handstand, and that the resultant sub-ILM hemorrhage progressed to VH.

### Relapsing white matter disease and subclinical optic neuropathy: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^114BvJ9C]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The etiology of LHON-MS is debated. Some argue that MS is occurring in those with LHON solely by chance because homoplasmic LHON mtDNA variants are not uncommon, seen in approximately 1 in 1,000 in Northern European populations. Others believe MS-like brain lesions in LHON-MS represent neuroinflammatory or ischemic manifestation of mitochondrial disease.

Our patient with MS-like illness, biopsied brain lesion, and a LHON-causing homoplasmic pathogenic variant in MT-ND6 affords an interesting opportunity to reflect on the entity of LHON-MS. The patient's neuro-ophthalmologic finding of mild optic neuropathy may reflect early involvement of the optic nerves in LHON because male patients with the m.14484-T > C variant most commonly lose vision at a later age, around 20 years. The severity of his brain disease relative to optic neuropathy would be atypical for LHON, but in a large cohort of LHON-MS, 26% of individuals (12/46) initially presented with MS-like symptoms and developed visual loss around 7 years later. Brain findings in our patient showed intact myelin and preserved axons, which is not consistent with MS. These results are in contrast to a brain autopsy reported in a woman with the m.14484-T > C variant, bilateral optic neuropathy, widespread MS-like lesions, and seizures who had evidence of demyelinating plaques, axonal damage, cystic necrosis with CD8-positive T cells, and vacuolation of the white matter (e1). It is possible that previously reported cases represent a coincident MS in patients with LHON. In our patient, the absence of demyelination made MS unlikely and the brain lesions could represent LHON brain involvement. The type I interferon staining is of interest and could reflect triggering of a type I interferon response. The interferon response could be a by-product of increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and the release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol of the cell, leading to a mitochondrial-based proapoptotic microenvironment (e2).

### International consensus diagnostic criteria for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders [^117BvV6z]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

During optic neuritis attacks, increased signal within the optic nerve may be detected with fat-suppressed T2-weighted orbital MRI sequences, typically with gadolinium enhancement seen on T1-weighted sequences (figure 1). Bilateral optic nerve involvement, posterior nerve predominance (especially with extension into the optic chiasm), or extensive lesions of the optic nerve (more than half of its length) are all suggestive of NMOSD (table 3). e51, e73, e74

According to the 2006 diagnostic scheme, a normal brain MRI or detection of only nonspecific white matter lesions was a key supportive criterion. Sixty percent of patients with NMOSD accumulate asymptomatic white matter lesions on longitudinal study and as many as 16% fulfill Barkhof MS MRI criteria., e75–e76 Detection of brain MRI white matter lesions compatible with MS does not exclude the diagnosis of NMOSD but is considered a red flag, indicating that additional evidence may be required to confidently distinguish NMOSD from MS in individual cases.e64, e76, e77 Analysis of qualitative features of lesions assists in distinguishing NMOSD from MS. First, at least 7% of patients have NMOSD-typical patterns that, although not pathognomonic for NMOSD, are considered exceptional for MS (table 3), including lesions of the dorsal medulla/area postrema (figure 2), e36, e73, e78 and periependymal regions in the brainstem (figure 2), e36, e73 and diencephalic structures, e79 or cerebral hemispheres e80 (figure 3), or long lesions spanning much of the length of the corpus callosum, or corticospinal tracts (figure 3). Large, confluent, or tumefactive cerebral lesions may suggest NMOSD but in isolation may not be discernable from atypical MS lesions, especially in AQP4-IgG-seronegative patients., e46, e81−e83 Second, some MRI lesion patterns considered typical of MS are rarely seen in NMOSD, including perpendicular orientation of periventricular lesions (Dawson fingers), periventricular lesions located in the inferior temporal lobe, and cortical lesions., e64 Recent 7T MRI studies revealed differences between NMOSD and MS specifically regarding cortical lesions (frequent in MS but absent in NMOSD) and white matter lesions (MS plaques are periventricular and traversed by a central venule whereas NMOSD lesions are subcortical and lack a central venule). e84, e85 However, this technology is not widely available and further validation is needed.

### Clinical reasoning: a 22-year-old man with multifocal brain and osseous lesions [^111rcWsV]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The evaluation of patients with disseminated processes with CNS and osseous involvement is often challenging. A 22-year-old healthy man developed left-sided weakness, paresthesias, and neck pain over several weeks. On clinical examination, he was noted to have decreased right eye visual acuity, left-sided pyramidal weakness and numbness, and bilateral hyperreflexia. MRI revealed multifocal widespread abnormalities: nonenhancing lesions throughout the infratentorial brain, pituitary gland, right frontal lobe, and optic nerves, in addition to an enhancing intramedullary cervical spinal cord lesion, extensive nodular leptomeningeal enhancement of the spine, and numerous enhancing bony lesions throughout the vertebrae and iliac bones. CSF analysis was notable for normal opening pressure, protein 465 mg/dL, glucose 21 mg/dL, and normal cell count. Extensive serum and CSF analysis for infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic etiologies was unrevealing, and the diagnosis was ultimately revealed after additional staining of tissue biopsy specimen from sacral and cerebellar biopsies. This case highlights the differential diagnoses for widely disseminated disease affecting the CNS and bones and informs pediatric and adult clinicians of important recent developments regarding this diagnostic entity.

### Differentiation between acute macular neuroretinopathy and paracentral acute middle maculopathy in elderly persons: two case reports [^1167m9bW]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case 2

The second patient was a 50-year-old female. She came to our department on 17 June 2020 because of the loss of binocular vision for a month. She had had diabetes for 6 years and hypertension for 2 years. Her blood sugar levels and BP were stable under treatment with hypoglycaemic and antihypertensive drugs. No other history of systemic disease or family history was apparent. The BCVA was 0.5 OD and 0.4 OS. The IOP was 18 mmHg OD and 17 mmHg OS. There was only mild opacity in the lens cortex in both eyes in the anterior segment.

Fundus examination revealed a normal optic disc with microaneurysm and haemorrhage scattered in the posterior pole retina in the left eye. Cotton-wool spots seen around the optic disc, and a wedge-shaped grey-white lesion was observed below the macula (Fig. 2 B). The fundus of the right eye was similar to that of the left eye, besides there was no grey-white lesion below the macula in the right eye (Fig. 2 A). Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) revealed multiple hyperfluorescence spots in the posterior pole and hypofluorescence lesion in the cotton wool (Fig. 2 C), as well as late-stage leakage in the macular (Fig. 2 D) in the left eye. The FFA of the right eye was similar to that of the left eye. OCT examination in the left eye showed the high reflex bands in the inner plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer, which did not involve the outer retina (Fig. 2 E).

### Sagittal bending of the optic nerve at the entrance from the intracranial to the optic canal and ipsilateral visual acuity in patients with sellar and suprasellar lesions [^114ptGwK]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Visual acuity impairment due to sellar and suprasellar tumors is not fully understood. The relationship between these tumors and disturbance of visual function was examined using preoperative MRI.

Methods

This study reviewed 93 consecutive patients with sellar and suprasellar tumors. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and visual impairment score (VIS) were used for estimation of visual impairments. Preoperative MR images were examined to obtain several values for estimation of chiasmatic compression. Additionally, the optic nerve-canal bending angle (ONCBA) was newly defined as the external angle formed by the optic nerve in the optic canal and the optic nerve in the intracranial subarachnoid space at the junction, using preoperative sagittal T2-weighted MR images.

Results

The mean ONCBA was about the same on the right (44° ± 25°) and the left (44° ± 24°). Sagittal ONCBA was defined as large (> 45°) and moderate (≤ 45°) on each side. Preoperative VIS was found to be significantly worse if the right or left ONCBA (or both) was large (right side: ONCBA large [median 20, IQR 8–30] > ONCBA moderate [median 10, IQR 3–17], p = 0.003, Mann-Whitney U-test; left side: ONCBA large [median 22, IQR 9–30] > ONCBA moderate [median 10, IQR 2–16], p = 0.001). A large ONCBA showed a significant relationship with unfavorable ipsilateral BCVA (> logMAR, 0; right side, p = 0.001, left side, p = 0.001, chi-square test). The ONCBA had a positive correlation with ipsilateral BCVA (right: r = 0.297, p = 0.031; left: r = 0.451, p = 0.000, Pearson's correlation coefficient). Preoperative BCVA was significantly lower on the same side in the large ONCBA group compared with the moderate ONCBA group (right side: large ONCBA 0.169 ± 0.333 [logMAR, mean ± standard deviation] vs moderate ONCBA 0.045 ± 0.359, p = 0.026, Student t-test; left side: large ONCBA 0.245 ± 0.346 vs moderate ONCBA 0.025 ± 0.333, p = 0.000). This visual acuity impairment improved after resection of the tumors.

Conclusions

Sagittal bending of the optic nerve at the entrance from the intracranial subarachnoid space to the optic canal may be related to ipsilateral deterioration of visual acuity in sellar and suprasellar lesions. Sagittal T2-weighted MRI is recommended for preoperative estimation of the optic nerve bending.

### Ocular manifestations in pediatric tumor suppressor gene mutations: a case series and literature review of RB1, NF1, NF2, VHL, and TSC [^113mAatL]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, we included a 13-year-8-month-old female patient with a confirmed TSC1 mutation. She initially presented to the neurosurgery department with nausea and headache and was subsequently diagnosed with a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma with thickening bilateral orbital nerves, requiring neurosurgical intervention (Fig. 4 A, B). Since the onset of systemic symptoms, her vision has been severely impaired, and limited to light perception. Preoperative evaluation in our department revealed bilateral pupil dilation, pale optic discs, and blurred disc margins (Fig. 4 C-E). Postoperative examination showed no improvement in BCVA. While optic nerve edema had subsided, the optic discs remained pale (Fig. 4 F). OCT revealed the disorganization of outer photoreceptor segments in both eyes, with a suspected hamartoma in the right eye (Fig. 4 G-H). This case highlights the significant ocular complications associated with TSC1 mutations, particularly in the context of systemic manifestations and neurosurgical interventions.

Fig. 4
Ocular clinical manifestations caused by TSC1 gene mutation. (A, B) The MRI scan during the T2 phase showed thickening bilateral optic nerves (black arrows) and high signal intensity in the ependyma (red arrow). (C, D) The pupil of the child with TSC1 gene mutation was dilated and fixed without light reflection. (E) Fundus photography revealed pale optic discs with blurred edges in the right eye before the neurosurgery operation. (F) Postoperative fundus images showed that the patient's optic disc edema improved, but the color of the optic disc was still pale. (G, H) OCT showed structural disorganization in the outer photoreceptor segment in both eyes. In G, foveal deformation and suspected hamartoma can be detected (yellow arrow)

Additionally, we included a TSC2 patient, a 5-year and 10-month-old male, who presented with vision decline. Whole-exome sequencing confirmed a TSC2 mutation, and upon examination, bilateral retinal hamartomas were identified (Fig. 5 A-C). He underwent bilateral retinal laser photocoagulation, resulting in stable vision, with corrected visual acuity of 30/50 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left. Some TSC patients also exhibit choroidal depigmentation or other abnormalities, which can be observed during comprehensive ophthalmic exams. The clinical significance of these findings remains under investigation.

### The optic nerve head in acquired optic neuropathies [^1114NbGV]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Acquired optic neuropathies are a common cause of blindness in adults, and are associated with characteristic morphological changes at the optic nerve head. Accurate and prompt clinical diagnosis, supplemented with imaging where appropriate, is essential to optimize management of the optic neuropathy and to counsel the patient appropriately on its natural history. History taking, optic disc findings, visual field assessment and imaging of the nerve head and surrounding retinal nerve fiber layer are all paramount to achieving the correct diagnosis. This Review highlights the optic nerve head features that are common to the acquired optic neuropathies, and describes the features that can be used to differentiate these various conditions.

### Coexistence of open-angle glaucoma and sarcoidosis-associated optic neuropathy [^114bBHES]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 53-year-old man presented with gradually deteriorating vision in his left eye that began one year prior and accelerated over the last three months. At the time vision deterioration three months ago, the patient complained of periorbital pressure on his left upper eyelid. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the right eye was 20/20, and counting fingers in the left. Intraocular pressures (IOP) measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry in the right and left eyes were 12 and 34 mmHg, respectively. Anterior segment examinations showed no abnormalities other than mild nuclear cataract in both eyes, and the gonioscopic examination using four-mirror gonioscopy lens showed an open angle with clearly visible angular structures. The right optic disc had an intact neuroretinal rim (Fig. 1 A and B); however, the left optic disc had advanced glaucomatous cupping with a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.9 (Fig. 1 C and 1 D). Humphrey 30−2 visual field (HVF) showed normal results in the right eye (Fig. 1 E) but complete field loss with a mean deviation of -32.35 dB in the left eye (Fig. 1 F). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography demonstrated an increased depth of lamina cribrosa in the left eye compared to that in the right eye (Fig. 2 A and B), normal retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) in the right eye (Fig. 2 C) and diffuse RNFL loss in the left eye (Fig. 2 D). There was a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in the left eye, without ocular pain or pain on extraocular movement. Pupillary light reflex in the right eye was normal. The patient was diagnosed with advanced open-angle glaucoma in the left eye and was treated with a combination of 2% dorzolamide and 0.5% timolol, 0.2% brimonidine, and 0.005% latanoprost, which lowered the IOP to 10 mmHg.
