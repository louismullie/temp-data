## Question

Necrotizing pneumonia ct scan findings

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the CT scan findings in necrotizing pneumonia, including how to distinguish it from lung abscess, what complications to look for, and how CT alters management and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology that drives the imaging features. Then, I should verify the core CT diagnostic criteria and the role of contrast. Next, I will differentiate necrotizing pneumonia from lung abscess on CT. After that, I should review associated complications and pleural findings. Then, I will consider special populations and mimics. Finally, I will integrate how CT findings influence management decisions and long-term outcomes, and close with practical takeaways and caveats about radiation and timing of imaging.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic basis that explains the CT appearance. Necrotizing pneumonia reflects ischemic necrosis of lung parenchyma due to thrombosis of intrapulmonary vessels, leading to tissue destruction, liquefaction, and cavitation; this vascular occlusion explains the characteristic lack of enhancement in necrotic zones and the propensity for multilobar involvement and complications such as bronchopleural fistula and empyema, which we should actively seek on imaging [^114iaMja] [^1113Z5cY].

> I need to check the core CT diagnostic criteria. On contrast-enhanced CT, necrotizing pneumonia shows areas of consolidation with diffuse or patchy low attenuation and decreased or absent enhancement, reflecting nonviable tissue. Multiple thin-walled cavities (often less than 2 mm) develop within the consolidated lung, filled variably with air or fluid, and there is loss of normal pulmonary architecture in the involved segments or lobes. These features align with the radiologic-pathologic correlation of necrosis and cavitation within consolidated lung [^1113Z5cY] [^1178HA7x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any cavity being an abscess. I should confirm how to distinguish necrotizing pneumonia from lung abscess on CT. Lung abscess presents as a cavity with a well-defined, thick, enhancing rim and no central enhancement, whereas necrotizing pneumonia lacks a discrete enhancing abscess wall and instead shows multiple thin-walled cavities embedded within nonenhancing necrotic parenchyma. Confusing these entities risks harmful interventions, as abscess may benefit from drainage while necrotizing pneumonia generally does not and may be harmed by overly aggressive procedures [^1113Z5cY] [^115wegVb].

> Next, I should review associated complications that CT can uncover early. Pleural effusions and empyema are common and often loculated; CT can depict complex septations and guide procedural planning, though ultrasound remains superior for characterizing pleural fluid and guiding drains; bronchopleural fistula is definitively diagnosed on CT when a direct communication from airway to pleural space is visualized, often with persistent air leak or tension collections; pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum may accompany BPF; in severe cases, pulmonary gangrene may be seen as large nonenhancing segments with gas, signaling irreversible tissue death and often prompting surgical consultation [^112nW6Nm] [^1113Z5cY] [^115b4b3L].

> Let me consider special populations and mimics so I do not misattribute findings. In children, necrotizing pneumonia is increasingly recognized and may be underappreciated on radiographs. CT detects necrosis earlier and more comprehensively than chest radiography, and pediatric series show high rates of pleural complications and air leaks, with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus as common pathogens. In immunocompromised hosts, CT is often required to detect pneumonia when radiographs are nondiagnostic, and invasive fungal infections can mimic or complicate necrotizing pneumonia, so I should correlate with host factors and consider targeted microbiology. Conversely, organizing pneumonia and vasculitides such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis can produce cavitary or reverse halo patterns that mimic infection, requiring clinical integration and, at times, tissue diagnosis [^1113Z5cY] [^1112GDfv] [^111sVBpg] [^112S4NAt].

> I should double-check how CT findings change management. High-resolution contrast-enhanced CT is recommended when necrotizing pneumonia is suspected or when patients fail to respond to appropriate therapy, because it delineates the extent of necrosis, detects occult complications, and guides interventions; CT-directed percutaneous sampling can identify pathogens in a meaningful subset, informing antibiotic optimization; surgical teams rely on CT to plan debridement or resection when medical therapy fails or when life-threatening complications such as massive hemoptysis, gangrene, or refractory BPF are present; importantly, CT helps avoid unnecessary abscess-style drainage in true necrotizing pneumonia where such procedures may be harmful [^111QHao5] [^1113Z5cY] [^115b4b3L].

> Now, I will examine prognostic implications and long-term sequelae. CT-documented necrotizing pneumonia correlates with prolonged fever, longer hospitalization, and higher risks of pleural complications and air leaks. However, most children experience complete clinical and radiologic recovery over months, with studies showing resolution of cavities and consolidation within roughly 4–6 months in many cases, though a subset develop bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, or persistent BPF. In adults, necrotizing changes are less common but carry substantial morbidity, and CT severity can assist in risk stratification and follow-up planning [^112Wb5pZ] [^1178HA7x] [^115b4b3L].

> Wait, let me verify the role and timing of CT relative to chest radiography and ultrasound so I do not overuse radiation. Chest radiography may show consolidation and occasionally small cavities but underestimates necrosis and misses complications; CT detects necrosis earlier and more accurately, sometimes by several days, and is particularly valuable when the clinical course is atypical or deteriorating; ultrasound excels for pleural characterization and procedural guidance, but CT remains indispensable for parenchymal necrosis and complex air-leak anatomy; in children, CT should be reserved for suspected complications or nonresponse, with dose-optimized protocols to mitigate radiation risk [^115ihVTq] [^112nW6Nm] [^1128Z9ru].

> Let me reconsider the key differentiators and pitfalls so I do not misclassify disease. Multiple thin-walled cavities within nonenhancing consolidated lung favor necrotizing pneumonia, whereas a solitary thick-walled cavity with a robust enhancing rim favors abscess; absence of a discrete enhancing abscess wall and the presence of widespread architectural loss support necrosis; direct visualization of an airway–pleural communication confirms BPF; recognizing these distinctions prevents mismanagement and aligns therapy with the underlying pathology [^1113Z5cY] [^115wegVb].

> In summary, I need to ensure that when necrotizing pneumonia is suspected clinically, contrast-enhanced CT is obtained to confirm low-attenuation nonenhancing consolidation with multiple thin-walled cavities, assess for pleural complications and BPF, and guide sampling or surgical planning. Distinguishing from abscess avoids harmful interventions, and serial imaging can document the typically favorable evolution in children while identifying those rare adults or severely affected patients who may require operative management. Throughout, findings must be integrated with microbiology and host factors to optimize outcomes [^1113Z5cY] [^117DPrcj] [^112Wb5pZ].

Necrotizing pneumonia on CT shows **parenchymal necrosis with low-attenuation, non-enhancing areas** [^1113Z5cY] within consolidation, often with multiple thin-walled cavities and loss of normal architecture [^1178HA7x]. Key findings include **cavitation with air-fluid levels**, **absence of a enhancing rim** (unlike abscess), and **bronchopleural fistula** as a common complication [^1113Z5cY] [^112nW6Nm]. CT is the **gold standard** for detection and characterization, guiding management and intervention [^117DPrcj] [^115b4b3L].

---

## Primary CT findings

- **Parenchymal necrosis**: Areas of low attenuation within consolidated lung, showing poor or no enhancement after contrast, indicating tissue death [^1113Z5cY] [^1178HA7x].

- **Cavitation**: Multiple thin-walled cavities (usually < 2 mm) [^1178HA7x] within consolidated lung, often containing air or fluid, reflecting liquefaction of necrotic tissue [^1113Z5cY].

- **Loss of normal pulmonary architecture**: Destruction of normal lung structure within areas of consolidation [^1113Z5cY] [^1178HA7x].

- **Air-fluid levels**: Cavities may contain air-fluid levels, indicating communication with airways and fluid accumulation [^111QHao5].

---

## Differentiation from lung abscess

Necrotizing pneumonia must be **differentiated from lung abscess**, as management differs:

| **Feature** | **Necrotizing pneumonia** | **Lung abscess** |
|-|-|-|
| Wall thickness | Thin (< 2 mm) [^1178HA7x] | Thick (> 2 mm) [^notfound] |
| Wall enhancement | Absent or minimal [^1113Z5cY] | Well-defined enhancing rim [^1113Z5cY] |
| Number of cavities | Multiple [^1113Z5cY] | Usually single [^notfound] |
| Surrounding lung | Extensive consolidation [^1113Z5cY] | Localized consolidation [^notfound] |

---

## Complications identified on CT

CT is **essential for detecting complications** of necrotizing pneumonia:

- **Bronchopleural fistula (BPF)**: Direct communication between lung and pleural space, often with persistent air leak [^1113Z5cY] [^112nW6Nm].

- **Empyema**: Pleural effusion with septations and enhancing pleural surfaces, indicating infection of the pleural space [^112nW6Nm].

- **Pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum**: Air leaks from necrotic lung or BPF [^1113Z5cY] [^114QHGQp].

- **Pulmonary gangrene**: Extensive necrosis with complete loss of pulmonary architecture, often requiring surgical intervention [^115b4b3L] [^116VRtr8].

---

## Clinical significance of CT findings

CT findings are **critical for diagnosis and management**:

- **Early detection**: CT identifies necrotizing changes earlier than chest radiography, enabling timely intervention [^111QHao5] [^115ihVTq].

- **Guiding therapy**: CT findings guide antibiotic selection, duration, and need for surgical intervention [^117DPrcj] [^112nW6Nm].

- **Prognostic value**: Extent of necrosis, presence of complications, and bilateral involvement indicate worse prognosis and longer recovery [^114NAqWm].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Radiation exposure is a concern, particularly in children; **use the lowest effective dose** [^1128Z9ru] [^116XiLX3]. Early necrotizing changes can be subtle and may be missed on initial CT; **repeat imaging may be needed** if clinical suspicion persists [^1113Z5cY] [^111Ewmrk]. CT findings are not specific and must be interpreted in clinical context to distinguish from other cavitary lung diseases [^112yhoZd] [^111UkBBj].

---

Necrotizing pneumonia on CT is characterized by **parenchymal necrosis, cavitation, and loss of normal architecture**, with complications such as bronchopleural fistula and empyema. CT is the **gold standard** for diagnosis and management, but findings must be interpreted in clinical context.

Pleural complications of pneumonia

Pneumonia can also be complicated by pleural effusions that do not resolve with antibiotic therapy and may require surgical drainage or thoracoscopy. It is estimated that while 1% of children with community-acquired pneumonia develop pleural effusions, effusions are seen much more frequently in hospitalized children (up to 40%). According to the British Thoracic Society guidelines, when there is persisting fever despite adequate antibiotic treatment, clinicians should suspect the development of an empyema. Lai et al. also report an incidence of 12% to 66% of bronchopleural fistula developing as a complication of necrotizing pneumonia.

Even though pleural effusion is visible on chest radiographs, ultrasound (US) is the recommended method for estimating the amount of fluid (Fig. 6). The size of the effusion is significant when deciding on management. Chest US is also considered superior to chest CT in its ability to demonstrate internal components of an effusion such as loculations and fibrin strands (Fig. 7). The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend chest US for detecting pleural effusion and guiding drain placement, but indicate that CT with intravenous contrast "is useful for evaluation of advanced parenchymal disease" associated with effusions (Figs. 8 and 9). The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America note that even though history and physical examination can suggest the possibility of an accompanying effusion in children with community-acquired pneumonia, chest radiographs should be used for confirmation while chest US or CT should only be performed when chest radiography is inconclusive (Fig. 10). Identifying any parenchymal complication such as necrotizing pneumonia or abscess coexisting with an effusion is important because these findings will ensure treatment with a prolonged course of antibiotics.

### Role of systemic immune-inflammatory index and systemic inflammatory response index in predicting the diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia in children [^116GnikZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A rare form of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is necrotizing pneumonia (NP), which is marked by severe sickness, a protracted hospital stay, and a protracted course of the disease. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are the most prevalent bacteria that cause NP, which exhibits lung necrosis, liquefaction, and loss of the typical pulmonary parenchymal architecture.

A growing number of NP cases in previously healthy children have been documented over the past 20 years. The risk of complications from NP is also increased, including parapneumonic effusion, pneumothorax, pyopneumothorax, bronchopleural fistula, respiratory failure, septic shock, and death.

The most sensitive form of chest imaging for diagnosing NP is a CT scan, which can reveal multiple thin-walled cavities, decreased parenchymal enhancement, and loss of normal pulmonary architecture. Blood, pleural, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures can also be used for microbiological diagnosis.

Recent studies have shown that various combined ratios of complete blood count parameters, including NLR, PLR, MLR, SII, and SIRI, may serve as helpful diagnostic and prognostic indicators for various inflammatory conditions, including cancer, coronary artery disease, sepsis, and COVID-19 infection.

This study aimed to assess the role of systemic immune-inflammatory index and systemic inflammatory response index in predicting early lung necrotization in children with CAP to improve treatment and prognosis.

### 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia: CT manifestations and pattern of evolution in 110 patients in jiangxi, China [^112Q3jPc]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To elucidate the CT manifestations and patterns of evolution in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of CT scans of 110 patients. All 110 patients had initial and second CT scans, 60 of 110 patients had three serial CT scans, and 17 of 60 patients had four serial CT scans. Numerous characteristics of pulmonary and extrapulmonary abnormalities and recognizable patterns of evolution were evaluated.

Results

Of the 110 initial CT scans, ground-glass opacities without consolidation (65.4%) were more common than a consolidation or mixed pattern. The most common findings were subpleural involvement (77.2%), multifocal involvement (80.7%), and bilateral involvement (67.3%). Three serial CT scans of 60 patients showed four patterns of CT evolution: type 1 showing relatively high CT scores on initial CT (averaged 4 days after symptom onset), with mild progression and improvement on follow-up CT scans (25%); type 2 with progression of CT findings from initial CT to first follow-up CT (averaged 9 days after symptom onset) with subsequent improvement on second follow-up CT (averaged 13 days after symptom onset, 61.7%); type 3 with no CT changes (5.0%); and type 4 pattern was similar to type 2 but with a more prolonged course and more severe CT findings (8.3%).

Conclusions

Predominant findings at initial CT scans were bilateral multifocal subpleural GGO. The most commonly shown evolution pattern was type 2: progression of disease with increased extent and density of opacities on first follow-up CT followed by improvement on second follow-up CT.

Key Points

- Predominant findings at initial CT in patients with COVID-19 infection are bilateral multifocal subpleural ground-glass opacities.
- Ill-defined patchy or nodular opacities were most commonly observed on CT scans with the right lower lobe most commonly involved.
- The most commonly shown evolution pattern on chest CT was type 2: progression of CT findings from initial CT to first follow-up CT with subsequent improvement on second follow-up CT.

In this study involving 100 severe ICU NSTI patients, we found that even if CT is not a diagnostic tool, it can nevertheless provide some information on the patient's outcome. It is well established that the contribution of CT for an NSTI diagnosis is not only unreliable but can also delay the management of the patient, which is why in most cases, the diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical examinations and operative findings. Our work partly confirms these elements since, when comparing patients who had a CT-scan versus those who did not, no difference according to the initial severity was found.

There are many diagnostic studies in which changes in the fascia (thickness, presence of edema, nonenhancement) can help in the diagnosis, but to our knowledge, our study is the first to evidence a link between fascia imaging and prognosis. Nevertheless, as the fascia is a key structure in the spread of infection, our findings seem quite consistent.

Our study has limitations, including its monocentric design with only 100 NSTI patients and a long cohort period. Of course, almost half of the patients in the cohort did not have a CT-scan, which is an undeniable source of bias. A multicenter prospective larger cohort study has to be performed to confirm these results.

### Computed tomography scan contribution to the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia [^1124GHuj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia is a frequent disease mainly affecting older and multimorbid patients. Symptoms and signs lack sensitivity and specificity, and chest X-ray has poor accuracy. Hence, an initial diagnosis of pneumonia has limited predictive value for the presence of pneumonia. Overdiagnosis of pneumonia leads to inappropriate antibiotic use and may delay the appropriate management of mimicking diseases. Alternative imaging strategies including computed tomography (CT)-scan or lung ultrasonography may improve the diagnosis of pneumonia. We review the recent evidence and perspectives regarding their contribution to the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected pneumonia.

Recent Findings

Two studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CT-scan in emergency department or hospitalized patients suspected of pneumonia. CT-scan led to a net reclassification improvement of 8 and 18% of patients, and was particularly helpful to rule out the diagnosis, allowing a lowering of the number of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions.

Summary

CT-scan reduces overdiagnosis of pneumonia and allows a better identification of alternative diagnoses. The impact on clinical outcomes of a strategy incorporating CT-scan for patients suspected of pneumonia should be evaluated, along with its cost-effectiveness.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111Q3Fz9]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Panel discussion — diagnostic utility of CT pattern/distribution features for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is characterized as very low quality, and while a high-probability scan can be virtually diagnostic with compelling exposure history, in patients with an indeterminate or unidentified environmental exposure differentiating fibrotic HP from IPF can be challenging; the guideline panel's confidence in CT performance characteristics was low for three reasons, and despite high specificity of features such as the three-density sign, the panel suggests a clinical diagnosis of fibrotic HP not be made based on HRCT findings alone and that consulting with an expert ILD center may help increase confidence.

### Pictorial review of fibrotic interstitial lung disease on high-resolution CT scan and updated classification [^116QW4sd]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Topic Importance

Given the recently expanded approval of antifibrotics for various fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), early and correct recognition of these diseases is imperative for physicians. Because high-resolution chest CT scan forms the backbone of diagnosis for ILD, this review will discuss evidence-based imaging findings of key fibrotic ILDs and an approach for differentiating these diseases.

Review Findings

(1) Imaging findings of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia may evolve over time and become indistinguishable from usual interstitial pneumonia. Therefore, if remote imaging can be reviewed, this would increase the likelihood of an accurate imaging diagnosis, particularly if findings appear to represent a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on the recent examination. (2) Given the difficulty and lack of objectivity in classifying patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis into acute, subacute, and chronic categories and that prognosis depends primarily on presence or absence of fibrosis, the new set of guidelines released in 2020 categorizes patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis as either nonfibrotic (purely inflammatory) or fibrotic (either purely fibrotic or mixed fibrotic/inflammatory) based on imaging and/or histologic findings, and the prior temporal terms are no longer used. (3) Interstitial lung abnormalities are incidental CT scan findings that may suggest early ILD in patients without clinical suspicion for ILD. Patients with high-risk features should undergo clinical evaluation for ILD and be actively monitored for disease progression.

Summary

Fibrotic ILD on high-resolution chest CT scan is a complex topic, but with use of an evidence-based analysis and algorithm as provided in this article, the probability of a correct imaging diagnosis increases.

### Distinguishing wegener's granulomatosis from necrotizing community acquired pneumonia: a case report and comparison of radiographic findings [^116sjgwR]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2009). Low credibility.

Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis, affecting medium to small vessels in the respiratory and renal vasculature. Patients with WG may present with clinical and radiographic features similar to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which may delay life-saving immunosuppressive therapy. We report a 14-year-old female originally diagnosed with recalcitrant, necrotizing CAP complicated by massive pulmonary cavitations eventually proven to be WG. We also compare the radiographic features of WG and necrotizing CAP.

### Thoracic trauma WSES-AAST guidelines [^117DPrcj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing lung infections

High-resolution CT scan is indicated for detailed assessment (LoE strong, GoR strong).
Blood, sputum, and, if accessible, pleural samples should be obtained to identify causative organisms (LoE strong, GoR strong).
Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started as soon as possible and refined based on culture results (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
Surgical debridement is indicated in case of medical management failure, to remove necrotic tissue and to control infection source (LoE moderate, GoR strong).

Initial management: high-resolution CT scans are crucial for diagnosing necrotizing pneumonia, revealing key signs such as pleural effusions, necrosis, and detecting complications like bronchopleural fistulae. Cultures from blood, sputum, and pleural fluid, along with CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsies (PTNBs), identify the causative pathogens in 30–40% of cases, guiding treatment. Despite lung ultrasound's usefulness, CT is indispensable for spotting complex issues PTNBs have a low complication rate and are crucial for diagnosis and treatment, with bronchoscopy used for further clarification in uncertain cases.

Antibiotic therapy: pathogens like Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and multidrug resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are common culprits of post-traumatic necrotizing lung infections. Early administration of adequate antibiotics is generally effective in resolving the disease. Culture-based treatment approaches may match the efficacy of immediate treatments with targeted use of culture results enhancing treatment accuracy and combating antibiotic resistance. Nebulized antibiotics may offer benefits without increased renal toxicity in severe cases.

Surgical management: recent findings highlight that optimal medical management may suffice for severe necrotizing pneumonia, with surgical debridement reserved only for specific cases whenever the infection evolves into abscesses/extended tissue necrosis or empyema not amenable of conservative treatment. Post-surgery antibiotic therapy duration of at least three to seven days is recommended according to clinical, laboratory and radiological evaluation.

### Round pneumonia: imaging findings in a large series of children [^112wq4qw]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although round pneumonia is a well-known clinical entity, there have been no large case reviews, with most knowledge based on case reports and small series from the 1960s and 1970s.

Objective

To review the imaging findings of a large series of children with round pneumonia.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of radiographic and CT findings in all children reported to have round pneumonia at a large children's hospital from 2000 to 2006 was performed. Children with underlying medical conditions were excluded. Epidemiologic characteristics, radiographic and CT findings, and follow-up imaging were reviewed.

Results

The review identified 109 children (mean age 5 years, range 4 months to 19 years). Round pneumonias tended to be solitary 98% (107/109), have well-defined borders 70% (77/109), and be posteriorly located 83% (91/109), with the following lobar distribution: left lower lobe (36), right lower lobe (33), right upper lobe (28), left upper lobe (7), right middle lobe (4), and lingula (2). Round pneumonia tended to resolve on follow-up imaging (95%, 41/43) as compared to progression to lobar pneumonia (4.6%, 2/43). Three patients (2.6%, 3/112) originally suspected to have round pneumonia were later shown to have other diagnoses: cavitary necrosis in pneumonia (two) or pleural pseudocyst (one).

Conclusion

Round pneumonia occurs in young children (mean age 5 years), tends to be a solitary lesion, and is most commonly posteriorly located. Misdiagnosis of other pathology as round pneumonia is uncommon.

### Clinical overview of nocardiosis… [^117PGq4Q]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Most patients with nocardiosis present with invasive lung infection, disseminated infection, or brain abscess.
- It can take extended incubation time to isolate Nocardia from primary clinical specimens. Routine cultures must be held for at least 14 days.
- Healthcare providers who suspect nocardiosis should contact their health department, which will consult CDC for confirmatory testing. Etiology More than 40 Nocardia species are considered clinically relevant. The most commonly reported species from clinical sources are: Nocardia nova Nocardia farcinica Nocardia cyriacigeorgica Nocardia brasiliensis Nocardia abscessus. Clinical features Pulmonary infection commonly presents with fever, cough, or chest pain, pneumonia, lung abscesses, or cavitary lesions. Central nervous system symptoms include:

- Headache
- Lethargy
- Confusion
- Seizures
- Sudden onset of neurologic deficit.

Contiguous spread within the thoracic cavity and hematogenous dissemination, particularly to the CNS, are possible. Overall, 80% of nocardiosis cases present as invasive lung infection, disseminated infection, or brain abscess; 20% present as cellulitis. About 10% of cases with uncomplicated pneumonia are fatal. Fatality rates are even higher
- up to 80 percent- for brain or central nervous system infections. Testing and diagnosis Nocardiosis confirmation must be accomplished by laboratory testing. Because it can take extended incubation time to isolate Nocardia from primary clinical specimens, infections are often overlooked. Routine cultures must be held for at least 14 days. Accurate identification of Nocardia species requires molecular methods. Referral of isolates to a reference laboratory, such as CDC's Special Bacteriology Reference Laboratory, may be needed for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

Treatment and recovery Nocardiosis is treatment with commonly available antibiotics. Surgical intervention is not usually indicated. However, it may be necessary for cerebral and soft tissue abscesses that do not respond to antibiotic treatment. In addition, empyema, mediastinal, and pericardial fluid collection drainage is often needed.

### Imaging pulmonary infection: classic signs and patterns [^112Rv5aQ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purposes of this article are to describe common and uncommon imaging signs and patterns of pulmonary infections and to discuss their underlying anatomic and pathophysiologic basis.

Conclusion

Imaging plays an integral role in the diagnosis and management of suspected pulmonary infections and may reveal useful signs on chest radiographs and CT scans. Detected early, these signs can often be used to predict the causative agent and pathophysiologic mechanism and possibly to optimize patient care.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117EY93V]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

CT terms used in the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) define characteristic high-resolution CT patterns: centrilobular nodules are profuse, poorly defined, and measure < 3 mm with ground-glass attenuation; ground-glass opacification is increased lung attenuation through which normal pulmonary structures can still be identified; mosaic attenuation is a sharply defined geographic patchwork on full inspiratory images and the term is reserved for findings on inspiratory CT imaging; within mosaic attenuation, the three-density sign is most specific for HP and the lobules of decreased attenuation are accentuated on expiration; a second common pattern is lobular decreased attenuation interspersed with normal lung and associated with lobular air-trapping on expiratory images that is probably less specific than the three-density sign; lobular air trapping is identified by sharply demarcated areas that fail to increase in density with expiration and this term is reserved for expiratory CT imaging; fibrosis is identified by reticular pattern or ground-glass opacification with traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis, lobar volume loss, and honeycombing, and the diagnosis of fibrosis should not be made when reticular abnormality is present without other confirmatory signs.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^116tHVyA]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging plays a significant role in both the diagnosis and treatment of complications of pneumonia in children. Plain chest radiography represents the imaging modality of choice for several lung diseases, including community-acquired pneumonia. Computed tomography (CT) on the other hand is not a first-line imaging tool for children with suspected uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia. It is largely reserved for when complications are suspected or where there is difficulty in differentiating community-acquired pneumonia from other pathology. This review will outline the situations where CT needs to be considered in community-acquired pneumonia, describe the imaging features of the parenchymal and pleural complications, discuss how CT may have a larger role to play in developing countries where HIV and tuberculosis are prevalent, note the role of CT scanning when there is a possibility of foreign body aspiration and address radiation concerns.

### Pathology-radiology correlation of common and uncommon computed tomographic patterns of organizing pneumonia [^112cnSuL]. Human Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a common pattern of lung injury that can be associated with a wide range of etiologies. Typical and not-so-typical imaging features of OP occur, as both common and rare lung pathologies can mimic the same imaging pattern as that of OP. This article will attempt to describe the difference between confusing terminologies that have been used in the past for OP and existence of primary versus secondary OP. The role of a multidisciplinary approach as an essential component to correctly diagnose and effectively manage challenging cases of OP will be highlighted. Additionally, we will discuss the limitation of transbronchial and importance of open lung biopsy to make the correct diagnosis. One example of an emerging diagnosis in the spectrum of OP and diffuse alveolar damage is acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. Ultimately, the reader should feel comfortable recognizing the many variable presentations of OP and be able to participate knowledgeably in a multidisciplinary team after reading this article. OP is a disease entity with variable radiographic and distinct histological characteristics that requires a multidisciplinary approach to correctly diagnose cryptogenic OP. Classic radiologic findings of OP occur in as low as 60% of cases. Secondary causes include infections, neoplasms, inflammatory disorders, and iatrogenic. Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia can appear similarly, but miliary nodules are a clue to diagnosis.

### Imaging findings of thoracic manifestations of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [^112UN3to]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Necrobiotic nodules and non-caseating granulomatous nodules

Necrobiotic nodules associated with IBD were first described in 2000 by Faller et al. They account for around 5% of pulmonary manifestations encountered in IBD. They can be observed in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, but recent data suggest a greater prevalence in Crohn's disease. In 2012, Barbosa et al reported 15 published cases of necrobiotic nodules, 10 of which were observed in patients with Crohn's disease. The majority of cases were associated with active intestinal disease and observed in young patients (< 30-year-old). More rarely, true granulomatous pulmonary nodules without caseous necrosis have been reported and almost exclusively in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease. In a case report by Roblin et al the patient was 13-year-old and the pulmonary granulomatous involvement preceded the digestive disease, which occurred a few weeks later.

Histologically, necrobiotic nodules combine sterile aggregates of neutrophils with areas of central necrosis, and are closely related to pulmonary nodules in rheumatoid arthritis and cutaneous nodules in pyoderma gangrenosum. They may display a pseudo-granulomatous appearance when epithelioid histiocytes are associated with aggregates of plasma cells. Differentiation between necrobiotic nodules, caseous granulomas and nodular organizing pneumonia requires histological sampling, which is often not performed as it is not necessary for patient management.

The clinical presentation of necrobiotic nodules and non-caseating granulomatous nodules is nonspecific. The most frequent symptoms are dyspnea, cough and sometimes chest pain in the case of subpleural localization; fever is less frequent compared to organizing pneumonia.

On imaging, necrobiotic nodules and granulomatous nodules have a similar presentation. On CT, they are solid nodules or masses generally measuring less than 3 cm, are predominantly located in subpleural areas, and may subsequently cavitate (Fig. 6). Due to their nonspecific appearance, there is no criterion for differentiating these two types of lesions. Granulomatous nodules may also present as consolidations, mimicking organizing pneumonia.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115Xgc1T]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

CHEST HP diagnostic recommendation — For patients with suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), we suggest integrating biopsy findings with clinical and radiological findings to support the diagnosis of HP in the context of the MDD (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). Pathologic findings characteristic of HP typically include a combination of cellular and/or fibrosing interstitial pneumonia with bronchiolocentric accentuation, poorly formed non-necrotizing granulomas with or without giant cells, with or without peribronchiolar metaplasia, and/or small foci of organizing pneumonia; isolated histopathological findings such as non-necrotizing granulomas or inconspicuous foci of organizing pneumonia can occasionally be seen in other ILDs and are not specific enough for a diagnosis of HP; potential limitations of lung biopsy include interobserver variation in the pathologic interpretation, biopsy size and number of specimens affecting the diagnostic yield of the biopsy procedure, sampling error, and atypical findings such as NSIP or UIP-like patterns; biopsy findings of HP or occasional isolated atypical patterns produced by HP require MDD to confirm the diagnosis.

### Necrotizing pneumonia in children: a review [^112Wb5pZ]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The objective of the review was to determine the long-term outcomes of necrotising pneumonia (NP). Studies published since 1990 in English, Portuguese, or Spanish, published on PubMed and Scielo were evaluated. Our findings showed ultrasound scanning is the diagnostic modality of choice. Despite prolonged hospitalisation (median 13–27 days) and fever (median 9–16 days), most patients recover completely. Empyema and bronchopleural fistulae are frequent in bacterial NP. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most prevalent cause. Seventeen studies with 497 patients followed for 30 days to 8.75 years showed that most patients were clinically asymptomatic and had normal lung function. X-ray or CT chest imaging demonstrated that almost all lung lesions recovered within 4–6 months. We suggest that it is not necessary to request frequent chest X-rays during the treatment and recovery process. Chest CT scans should be reserved for specific cases not following the expected clinical course.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^1113Z5cY]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

CT findings in complicated pneumonia

Necrotizing pneumonia is diagnosed on CT when a significant portion of consolidated lung shows diffuse or patchy low attenuation and decreased or no enhancement after intravenous contrast medium administration (Fig. 2). Cavitary necrosis is identified as a dominant area of necrosis with a combination of loss of normal parenchymal lung architecture, decreased parenchymal enhancement and development of multiple thin-walled cavities filled with fluid or air and lacking an enhancing border (Fig. 3). Lung abscess is diagnosed on CT when there is a lung cavity surrounded by a well-defined enhancing wall, no central enhancement and either fluid- or air-filled within (Fig. 4). The distinction between necrotizing pneumonia and lung abscess is based on the visualisation of contrast-enhancing walls of an abscess and is important when entertaining aggressive interventional therapy because this can be therapeutic for lung abscess and harmful for necrotizing pneumonia. A bronchopleural fistula can only definitively diagnosed on CT when a communication between the lung and pleural space is visualized directly (Fig. 5). Donnelly et al. reported that of the 56 CT scans performed in children with community-acquired pneumonia failing to respond to treatment, there were 40 with parenchymal complications (28 with decreased parenchymal enhancement or cavitary necrosis, 5 with abscess and 5 with bronchopleural fistula), 37 with pleural complications and 13 with pericardial effusion.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia presentations in chest computed tomography: a pictorial review [^114kTMf6]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite imaging not being a tool for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis, there has been an increased number of chest computed tomography (CT) scans done worldwide. There are no pathognomonic CT features for COVID-19 pneumonia, as findings are also common in other infectious diseases and noninfectious aetiologies. Nonetheless, point-of-care physicians should be familiarized with the most common imaging presentations of the COVID-19. In this pictorial review, we have summarized the most reported imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia, including possible differential diagnosis according to the CT finding.

Main text

COVID-19 pneumonia

COVID-19 pneumonia is a virulent pulmonary pathology, with high person-to-person transmission through the inhalation of virus which infects alveolar and endothelium cells by linking to the receptor for ACE II.

Chest radiography has been defined as insensitive in mild or early COVID-19 infection; therefore, it does not represent an efficient radiological tool to reach an early and correct diagnosis. Its main role, especially as portable chest radiography and in relation to COVID-19 pneumonia, is pneumonia monitoring after diagnosis or alternative diagnosis assessment, because it is time-effective and cost-effective and the equipment decontamination is easier and quicker compared to CT scan. These characteristics make chest radiography a useful technique to minimise the risk of cross-infection and to avoid radiological service availability disruption, which happens during CT scan decontamination.

CT is more sensitive for early COVID-19 pneumonia detection, disease progression monitoring and alternative diagnosis assessment. In the setting of COVID-19 pandemic, the greater sensitivity of CT is pivotal to guarantee an early diagnosis and isolation of infected patients.

Feng Pan identified four stages of lung involvement on chest CT, even if semiological findings may coexist in phase transitions (Table 1):
Early phase (0–4 days) or stage 1: ground-glass opacities (Fig. 1 a);
Progressive phase (5–8 days) or stage 2: crazy paving pattern, extensive ground-glass opacities and small consolidations (Fig. 1 b–d);
Peak phase (9–13 days) or stage 3: consolidative foci, sometimes surrounded by an halo of ground-glass (halo sign) (Fig. 1 e). Atoll sign or reversed halo sign has been described;
Absorption phase or stage 4 (≥ 14 days): ground-glass opacities and linear consolidation that may be interpreted as a process of repair and reorganisation, partially mediated by an organisational pneumonia, which is a stereotypical response to lung injury (Fig. 1 f). Further characteristic and mostly constant findings in COVID-19 pneumonia are (Table 1):
subpleural, bilateral or less frequently unilateral, opacities, which are commonly located in the inferior lobes;
possible evidence of peripheral pulmonary vessel widening;
rarity of pleural effusions, pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathies.

### CT findings of pulmonary nocardiosis [^115vKTPp]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Nocardiosis is an opportunistic infection that primarily affects the lungs. Most infected patients have deficits in cell-mediated immunity such as those with AIDS, transplant recipients, and those receiving corticosteroid therapy. We review the various CT appearances of pulmonary nocardiosis and discuss the differential diagnosis.

Conclusion

Common CT findings include lung consolidation and nodules and masses. Cavitation may occur. Chest wall involvement develops in a small number of patients.

### ESR essentials: imaging of common paediatric pulmonary diseases-practice recommendations by the European society of paediatric radiology [^1121GUgw]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chest imaging in children presents unique challenges due to varying requirements across age groups. For chest radiographs, achieving optimal images often involves careful positioning and immobilisation techniques. Antero-posterior projections are easier to obtain in younger children, while lateral decubitus radiographs are sometimes used when expiratory images are difficult to obtain and for free air exclusion. Chest CT protocols should be age-dependent to minimise radiation exposure and motion artefacts. MRI is primarily used in specialised centres to reduce radiation exposure, requiring specific expertise and sedation in younger children. Respiratory distress syndrome is a leading cause of morbidity in preterm neonates, diagnosed through characteristic radiographic findings and a history of prematurity. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is the most common complication of extreme preterm birth and chronic oxygen therapy; imaging is used for predicting outcomes for the assessment of severe cases. Transient tachypnoea of the newborn and meconium aspiration syndrome are common in term infants, with specific imaging characteristics aiding in their differentiation. Congenital lung malformations present diagnostic and management challenges, with imaging playing a crucial role in diagnosis and surgical planning. Finally, imaging is essential in detecting complications from pneumonia in children, such as empyema and necrotic pneumonia, or in identifying foreign object aspiration. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This review summarises current radiology practice of paediatric chest pathologies, aiding in the accurate diagnosis and management of neonatal and congenital pulmonary conditions and pneumonia complications, ultimately improving patient outcomes through precise imaging interpretation and targeted clinical intervention. KEY POINTS: Chest radiographs should be systematically assessed for pathology. Ensure accurate differential diagnosis of neonatal lung diseases by collecting information on gestational age, method of delivery, presenting symptoms, ventilation type, and fetal ultrasound findings. Radiographs and ultrasound are initial diagnostic tools for paediatric pulmonary disease; CT should be reserved for complex cases. Referral to paediatric hospital should be considered when the use of chest MRI is indicated.

### Surgical management of a COVID-19-associated necrotic pneumonia [^116VRtr8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Necrotising pneumonia is a relatively rare complication of community-acquired pneumonia. Necrosis is defined as cellular/tissue death typically in the context of poor parenchymal oxygenation. Pathogenesis may relate to either (1) organism-associated toxin production or (2) parenchymal ischaemia secondary to vasculitis/microthrombosis. Liquefaction and cavitation represent the primary pathological and radiological features. Subsequent severe sepsis and respiratory failure are associated with high mortality. Unfortunately, medical management in the form of intravenous antibiotics is limited secondary to reduced lung parenchymal vascularity. CT-guided percutaneous drainage is important in management of cavitating disease. However, surgery forms the primary treatment modality in the setting of failed medical management. In particular, surgery is indicated in the context of empyema, massive haemoptysis, gangrene and non-resolving abscess.

Surgical management of necrotising pneumonia takes many forms including lobectomy, pneumonectomy, sublobar and wedge resection. Mortality is high (up to 30%) and so surgery is undertaken in tertiary referral centres under the care of thoracic surgeons (with reported mortality as low as 8%). Few reports describe the outcomes of surgical resections of necrotic lungs in established COVID-19-positive patients.

The pathological association between COVID-19 and necrotic lung is yet to be established. However, there are striking similarities in the underlying pathology of the two. As stated above, microthrombi-induced and vasculitis-induced parenchymal hypoxia is central in the aetiology of lung necrosis. Autopsy reports of COVID-19 victims, demonstrate significant capillary congestion and associated microthrombi. Both small and large pulmonary vessel thrombosis have been widely reported. These similarities are interesting.

Throughout the pandemic, surgeries were cancelled in an endeavour to both redirect services and avoid increased morbidity/mortality associated with COVID-19 infection, in patients undergoing elective and emergency surgery. COVID-19-positive patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery were thought to have poor outcomes. COVID-19-induced necrotic lung represents a particular case. The authors demonstrate the safe and efficacious management of a necrotic lung secondary to COVID-19.

### Community-acquired pneumonia visualized on CT scans but not chest radiographs: pathogens, severity, and clinical outcomes [^113hN54e]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical significance of pneumonia visualized on CT scan in the setting of a normal chest radiograph is uncertain.

Methods

In a multicenter prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we compared the presenting clinical features, pathogens present, and outcomes of patients with pneumonia visualized on a CT scan but not on a concurrent chest radiograph (CT-only pneumonia) and those with pneumonia visualized on a chest radiograph. All patients underwent chest radiography; the decision to obtain CT imaging was determined by the treating clinicians. Chest radiographs and CT images were interpreted by study-dedicated thoracic radiologists blinded to the clinical data.

Results

The study population included 2,251 adults with CAP; 2,185 patients (97%) had pneumonia visualized on chest radiography, whereas 66 patients (3%) had pneumonia visualized on CT scan but not on concurrent chest radiography. Overall, these patients with CT-only pneumonia had a clinical profile similar to those with pneumonia visualized on chest radiography, including comorbidities, vital signs, hospital length of stay, prevalence of viral (30% vs 26%) and bacterial (12% vs 14%) pathogens, ICU admission (23% vs 21%), use of mechanical ventilation (6% vs 5%), septic shock (5% vs 4%), and inhospital mortality (0 vs 2%).

Conclusions

Adults hospitalized with CAP who had radiological evidence of pneumonia on CT scan but not on concurrent chest radiograph had pathogens, disease severity, and outcomes similar to patients who had signs of pneumonia on chest radiography. These findings support using the same management principles for patients with CT-only pneumonia and those with pneumonia seen on chest radiography.

### Role of systemic immune-inflammatory index and systemic inflammatory response index in predicting the diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia in children [^116Rxsqh]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This prospective cohort study included children admitted to the Pediatric Pulmonology Unit, Tanta University Hospital, Egypt, between September 2022 and August 2023 with a diagnosis of CAP. This study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the research ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University (approval number 35,694/9/22). Written informed consent was obtained from the guardians of all patients.

All children aged between two months and 18 years who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CAP were included in this study. CAP was defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child who acquired an infection outside the hospital and radiological findings of lung consolidation. Children were diagnosed with parapneumonic effusion based on clinical examination and radiographic findings, whereas NP was diagnosed clinically based on the presence of progressive pneumonia in previously healthy children despite appropriate antibiotic therapy with a protracted course plus CT chest scans that revealed multiple necrotic foci in the consolidated area.

Children with the following criteria were excluded from the study: (1) Other causes of lung cavitation in radiological findings, such as solitary lung cavitation with defined rim of enhancement (lung abscess), congenital lung abnormalities, septic pulmonary embolism, or traumatic pseudocyst. (2) Chronic lung disorders, malignancy, underlying immunodeficiency, or neuromuscular illnesses. (3) Hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1 included patients with NP, Group 2 included patients with parapneumonic effusion (PPE), and Group 3 included patients with non-complicated pneumonia (CAP).

Demographic information was collected, including sex, age, characteristics of the initial clinical manifestations, length of hospitalization, duration of fever, occurrence of complications, and requirement for surgical intervention.

The duration of fever, the length of hospitalization, improvement in inflammatory markers, and the continuation of the same empirical antibiotics were objective measures to assess the recovery and the effectiveness of utilized antibiotics.

### Outcome of anatomical versus non-anatomical lung resection for necrotizing pneumonia in children [^115Z8FbX]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this retrospective study evaluated the largest sample of children undergoing surgery for the treatment of NP. We found that AR was necessary for the majority of patients who underwent surgical treatment, accounting for 56.0% of cases. Additionally, we observed that the type of surgical approach did not have an impact on the incidence of complications, blood transfusion requirements and length of hospital stay. Moreover, the majority of complications were graded as minor complications.

Our findings align with previous studies only evaluating surgical resection for necrotizing lung infection, which indicated that patients were typically young, ranging in age from 3 months to 32 months. The overall preoperative morbidities included pleural empyema (75.7%), preoperative endotracheal intubation for respiratory distress (28.7%), pneumothorax (21.0%) and sepsis (42.0%), highlighting the severity of this disease.

While S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children, we found that S. aureus was the most common organism isolated in our study. This finding is consistent with that of other studies. We speculate that the use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for prophylaxis in our population, or even the prior use of antibiotics, may help explain this finding.

Some authors suggest that surgery should be the last option for treating NP. However, others argue that once a necrotic process is diagnosed, the affected segment or lobe should be promptly removed, especially in cases with high-output bronchopleural fistula and respiratory distress. In our study, the main reasons for thoracotomy were therapeutic failure, sepsis, acute respiratory failure and bronchopleural fistula.

Our data regarding the median preoperative length of stay for both approaches (median 12.5 days) are similar to other studies reporting an average time between 10 and 15 days. The optimal timing for surgery remains uncertain. Reimel et al. recommend for postponing surgery until patients are medically stabilized, which has been associated with improved surgical outcomes. Conversely, Chatha et al.express concerns that delaying surgical intervention may lead to deterioration in the patient's condition during the interim period. At our institution, we adopt an early surgical approach, initiating it as soon as there is no improvement in the clinical course and the NP is confirmed by a CT scan.

High-resolution computed tomography (CT) patterns in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) are delineated as follows: the nonfibrotic typical HP pattern is characterized by centrilobular nodules, mosaic attenuation on an inspiratory scan, and air trapping on an expiratory scan; the nonfibrotic compatible-with-HP pattern is exemplified by uniform and subtle ground-glass opacity and cysts; the fibrotic typical HP pattern consists of coarse reticulation and minimal honeycombing in a random axial distribution with no zonal predominance in association with small airway disease; the fibrotic compatible-with-HP pattern varies by basal and subpleural, upper-lung-zone, or central (or peribronchovascular) predominance, or fibrotic ground-glass attenuation seen alone or in association with small airway disease; and the fibrotic indeterminate-for-HP pattern includes the usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia pattern, organizing pneumonia–like pattern, or truly indeterminate findings.

### Changes in computed tomography findings of COVID-19 pneumonia: less extensive lung involvement with decreasing disease prevalence [^113o1tRM]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

It has been observed that the degree of pulmonary involvement shown in chest computed tomography (CT) scans tended to decrease as the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection decreased in the Turkish population. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the disease severity based on chest CT scans and the temporal evolution of the epidemic. This study recruited 179 patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease who had received a chest CT scan between March 14 and April 28, 2020. The participants were divided into three successive temporal groups based on their date of CT examination. The early (March 14–29), mid (March 30-April 13), and late (April 14–28) groups were compared regarding the presence and extent of pulmonary involvement and CT characteristics of lesions. COVID-19 pneumonia was less extensive in participants under 45 years of age and patients presenting late in the course of epidemic (i.e., the late group) compared those presenting earlier. When each group was subcategorized on the basis of age, older patients in the late group had less extensive lung involvement than older patients in the early group. However, there was no significant difference in the extent of lung involvement in younger patients between the late and early groups. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia appears to be variable at different temporal windows of the epidemic curve and decreases in patients presenting in the later weeks compared to the earlier weeks, particularly in older patients.

### A rare case of aggressive metastatic laryngeal chondrosarcoma presenting as bilateral necrotizing pneumonia [^116U9iMc]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Laryngeal chondrosarcomas are rare tumors that account for only 0.2% of malignant tumors of the larynx. Approximately 80% of these tumors are low grade and well differentiated and are associated with a good long-term prognosis. Herein, we report a case of a 77-year-old male presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure that required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Chest CT showed multiple pulmonary nodules and cavities. He then required a tracheostomy, and a soft tissue mass in the subglottic mass was discovered. A laryngoscopy-guided excisional biopsy of the mass was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of laryngeal chondrosarcoma. Clinicians should consider metastatic laryngeal chondrosarcoma as a differential diagnosis for lung cavities. Overall, we believe this to be the first case of aggressive laryngeal chondrosarcoma with mediastinal and pulmonary metastasis mimicking necrotizing pneumonia.

### Pulmonary involvement of ANCA-associated vasculitis in adult Chinese patients [^111JkrXY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a group of disorders characterized by necrotizing inflammation of small- and medium-sized blood vessels and the presence of circulating ANCA. Clinical disease phenotypes include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Pauci-immune glomerulonephritis is a seldom type of circulating ANCA-negative AAV. Ethnicity difference was known as MPO-ANCA is predominantly among Asian patients with both GPA and MPA.

Pulmonary involvement is frequent and prominent among various manifestations of AAV. Radiologic finding, mainly computed tomography (CT), is key for the identification of pulmonary involvement. Previous studies showed that 52–80% of patients with AAV had pulmonary abnormalities on chest CT, mainly including interstitial lung disease (ILD), granuloma (nodules, masses, with or without cavitation), alveolar hemorrhage (AH). In most publications, ILD was defined as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) according to radiologic patterns. MPA is the main AAV subtype associated with ILD. Granuloma is more prevalent in GPA. The incidence of AH is 7–45% in GPA and 10–30% in MPA but is rare in EGPA. Airway involvement (AI) has been reported by some small size of cohorts. However, there is still limited information focusing attention on the association between different radiologic patterns and long-term outcomes among AAV patients with pulmonary involvement.

On this ground, the aim of this study was to further characterize the relationship between the clinical features and long-term outcomes according to the pulmonary radiologic patterns in a retrospective cohort spanning 10 years with 366 adult Chinese AAV patients with pulmonary involvement. Furthermore, we counted the relapses and infectious events based on different radiologic patterns and identified their predictors.

### Chest-CT mimics of COVID-19 pneumonia-a review article [^113RLcpF]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in early December 2019 in China, as an acute lower respiratory tract infection and spread rapidly worldwide being declared a pandemic in March 2020. Chest-computed tomography (CT) has been utilized in different clinical settings of COVID-19 patients; however, COVID-19 imaging appearance is highly variable and nonspecific. Indeed, many pulmonary infections and non-infectious diseases can show similar CT findings and mimic COVID-19 pneumonia. In this review, we discuss clinical conditions that share a similar imaging appearance with COVID-19 pneumonia, in order to identify imaging and clinical characteristics useful in the differential diagnosis.

Pneumonia and complicated pneumonia

Pneumonia is the main cause of death in children under 5 years worldwide. Pathogens include bacterial, viral, or fungal microorganisms. A presumptive diagnosis of the pathogens can be made based on the child's age and whether it was a community or nosocomial pneumonia (Table 3). Clinical symptoms include cough, fever, and shortness of breath, while neonates may present with symptoms resembling other conditions like TTN, RDS, or MAS. In community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), imaging is not required for the diagnosis, unless there is no response to outpatient treatment, which requires hospital admission due to suspected complications.

Table 3
Association between age and pathogen causing pneumonia in children

* Higher incidence of necrosis and empyema

Radiography helps in detecting nosocomial pneumonia and identifying radiological patterns. Typical CR and CT findings of lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia are shown in detail in Table 4. However, these patterns lack sensitivity and specificity for determining aetiology. A unique type of pneumonia seen only in children is round pneumonia, which presents as a round opacity on CR, typically in contact with the pleura, hilum, or pulmonary fissure. This form of pneumonia is most commonly caused by bacteria, with Streptococcus pneumoniae responsible for about 90% of cases. Round pneumonia predominantly affects children between the ages of 5 and 12 years, as the incomplete development of collateral ventilation predisposes this age group to the condition (Fig. 8).

### Surgical management of a COVID-19-associated necrotic pneumonia [^111kPPcE]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

At the outset of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was thought to present simply as persistent cough and fever. However, with time, the medical community noted a myriad of associated symptoms well-described in the literature. Medical complications were particularly common in elderly populations and many early publications described pneumonia, organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability/microthrombosis and superimposed bacterial/viral infections. There is, however, a lack of literature describing surgical complications of COVID-19 and as such little knowledge regarding safe surgical interventions. This case describes the presentation/management of a patient who developed COVID-19-associated necrotising pneumonia. Video-assisted thoracoscopy lobectomy was performed following CT demonstration of necrotising pneumonia. Pathological evaluation of the surgical resection specimen demonstrated the microarchitecture of a severely diseased COVID-19 lung-fibrosis. This case demonstrates the safe management of a necrotic lung using a minimal access approach in the context of COVID-19 infection.

### Diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections by computed tomography… [^113mGPo6]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions A negative CT result reliably excludes the diagnosis of NSTI. A positive CT result correctly identifies the disease with a high likelihood. Scanning was performed following thin-section protocols. Axial images were reviewed on 2. 5-mm sections. Routine coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained. Soft tissue and bone window images were reviewed and interpreted on picture archiving and communications systems workstations. Four elements consistent with NSTI were sought in particular: asymmetrical and diffuse areas of soft tissue inflammation and ischemia, muscle necrosis, gas across tissue planes, and fluid collections. All patients had their NSTIs correctly diagnosed by CT scanning, and there were no false-negative test results.

All 25 had abnormally enhanced soft tissues, indicative of inflammation and necrosis; 9 also had gas across tissue planes, and 7 had fluid collections. One patient had an initially equivocal scan result; therefore, another scan was performed 12 hours later and showed signs of NSTI. Our findings suggest that a negative CT result can reliably exclude NSTI in patients with soft tissue infections and thus prevent unnecessary surgical explorations with their associated complications. When the CT result is positive, it correctly identifies the disease with a likelihood of 76%. Computed tomography with a 16- or 64-section scanner is the most rapid and reliable test that can be performed in patients with suspected NSTI. Distinguishing between cellulitis and NSTI is often hard on the basis of clinical signs. Early detection is crucial to achieve optimal outcomes.

Findings from CT, such as asymmetrical thickening of the fascia and muscle, nonenhancing tissues indicating necrosis, fluid collections, and gas across tissue planes, can be detected in all patients with NSTI according to our study. None of the examined factors in our study was able to distinguish between patients with true- and false-positive CT results. It seems that the presence of necrotic tissue or gas on CT unequivocally indicates NSTI. However, the other 2 criteria that we used in our study are subject to interpretation and could lead to a negative surgical exploration result. Correlation with clinical symptoms is of the utmost importance for the decision to perform a surgical exploration.

### Two in one: overlapping CT findings of COVID-19 and underlying lung diseases [^117XmmBk]. Clinical Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with pneumonia and has various pulmonary manifestations on computed tomography (CT). Although COVID-19 pneumonia is usually seen as bilateral predominantly peripheral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation, it can present with atypical radiological findings and resemble the imaging findings of other lung diseases. Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia is much more challenging for both clinicians and radiologists in the presence of pre-existing lung disease. The imaging features of COVID-19 and underlying lung disease can overlap and obscure the findings of each other. Knowledge of the radiological findings of both diseases and possible complications, correct diagnosis, and multidisciplinary consensus play key roles in the appropriate management of diseases. In this pictorial review, the chest CT findings are presented of patients with underlying lung diseases and overlapping COVID-19 pneumonia and the various reasons for radiological lung abnormalities in these patients are discussed.

### Radiographic and chest CT imaging presentation and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia: a multicenter experience from an endemic area [^116DstMc]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 has infected more than 2 million people in the world in less than 5 months outbreak. Chest imaging is recommended for triage of suspected cases of COVID-19 with moderate-severe clinical features and high pre-test probability of disease, and may help for patient follow-up and to identify patients at higher risk of disease worsening. This pictorial essay illustrates typical and uncommon imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and the role of imaging for patient management.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^111Ewmrk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48–72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs — such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities — with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g. empyema) or not (e.g. acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g. pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.

### Chest CT diagnosis and clinical management of drug-related pneumonitis in patients receiving molecular targeting agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors: a position paper from the Fleischner society [^112ggByU]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Drug-related pneumonitis (DRP) — computed tomography (CT) imaging approach and descriptive features: most DRP is diagnosed on routine follow-up CT scans rather than DRP-targeted protocols; thin-section (2.0–2.5 mm or less in section thickness) and contiguous CT scans are recommended usually with intravenous (IV) contrast agent injection, and for thorough image analysis both transverse and coronal reformatted images are needed; follow-up chest CT imaging is useful to assess the changes of DRP findings and response to DRP treatment; the CT features of DRP should be systematically described, including distribution and patterns of parenchymal abnormalities and individual features such as ground-glass opacities, airspace consolidation, reticular opacities, centrilobular nodules, interlobular septal thickening, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis; each drug can be associated with multiple, typically not specific, injury patterns, so clinicians rely on temporal relationships between drug administration and symptom onset and on exclusion of other causes such as infections and metastatic diseases.

### Predictors of fatality including radiographic findings in adults with COVID-19 [^1154oM37]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This report suggests that older age, elevated LDH on admission, and extensive lung lesions in early CT images are potential predictors of fatal outcome in adults with COVID-19. These predictors may help clinicians identify patients with a poor prognosis at an early stage.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^113SDWm9]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging plays a significant role in both the diagnosis and treatment of complications of pneumonia in children and chest radiography is the imaging modality of choice. Computed tomography (CT) on the other hand, is not currently a first-line imaging tool for children with suspected uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia and is largely reserved for when complications of pneumonia are suspected or there is difficulty in differentiating pneumonia from other pathology. This review outlines the situations where CT needs to be considered in children with pneumonia, describes the imaging features of the parenchymal and pleural complications of pneumonia, discusses how CT may have a wider role in developing countries where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis are prevalent, makes note of the role of CT scanning for identifying missed foreign body aspiration and, lastly, addresses radiation concerns.

### Long-term outcomes of necrotizing pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion in children [^114QHGQp]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the literature, PPE/empyema accompanies NP in 63%–100% of cases. In our study, PPE/empyema was observed in 78.20% of the patients in the NP group. Other frequently observed complications include pneumothorax, detected in 16–25% of cases on radiographic imaging, and BPF, identified in 16%–30% of cases based on persistent (> 24 h) air leakage on CT. Air leak complications were present in 20% of the NP group (17 cases of pneumothorax, four cases of pneumomediastinum, and three cases of BPF). In the PPE group, air leak complications were observed in 15% of cases, consisting of seven cases of pneumothorax and one case of pneumomediastinum.

In the last 6–9 months of follow‐up, radiological sequelae were observed in 56% of the NP and 40% of the PPE groups. In the NP group, atelectasis, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and BPF were detected with rates of 27%, 4%, 41%, and 2.5%, respectively. In the PPE group, atelectasis, bronchiectasis, and pleural thickening were detected with rates of 29%, 6%, and 22%, respectively. Atelectasis and bronchiectasis were similar between the groups, whereas pleural thickening was more common in the NP group. Krenke et al. demonstrated that all NP patients experienced complete or near‐complete resolution of residual pulmonary and pleural lesions within 5 months. Satish et al. demonstrated that all radiological findings resolved within 2–16 months following empyema and found no association between long‐term radiological sequelae and LFTs results. deBenedict et al. observed that radiological findings such as consolidation, atelectasis, pneumatocele, pneumothorax, and pleural thickening persisted in patients at discharge, most of them resolved within 2–13 months, and only 10.25% of the patients had long‐term sequelae. Most studies have evaluated radiological sequelae at 12 months or longer. The high rate of radiological sequelae observed in our study in the 6–9 month period may be due to early evaluation. Chest X‐rays may often be insufficient for follow‐up; therefore, it is essential to use more sensitive methods such as ultrasound and, when necessary, CT. Additionally, it is essential to note that the rate of use of better diagnostic procedures such as USG and CT may be lower in reports in the past decade. Various studies have reported a higher tendency for pleural thickening in patients with empyema.

### Do you really know precise radiologic-pathologic correlation of usual interstitial pneumonia? [^112TSmzS]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is the most common chronic interstitial pneumonia, understanding of pathologic backgrounds of CT findings has still not been enough. Since honeycombing on either scanning microgram or CT is essential for diagnosis of UIP in 2010 ATS-ERS-JRS-ALAT guide line, the role of radiologists has become much more important. We will summarize common and uncommon CT findings with radiologic-pathological correlation.

### Giant lung cysts following necrotizing pneumonia: resolution with conservative treatment [^112DK4VW]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Necrotizing pneumonia is characterized by destruction and liquefaction of the lung tissue and loss of the normal pulmonary parenchymal architecture. During the course of resolution areas of hyperlucency are formed, sometimes with the development of giant lung cysts that can be a field with fluid resembling lung abscess. There is no consensus on the management of these abnormalities.

Objective

To assess the prevalence of giant lung cysts as a complication of necrotizing pneumonia and to report our experience with conservative treatment that achieved complete resolution.

Methods

Medical chart reviews of all children aged 0 to 18 years hospitalized with necrotizing pneumonia in a single tertiary center from 2015 to 2017, demographic data, and clinical course during and after hospitalization as well as serial chest imaging were collected.

Results

During the study period, 761 children were diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, 16 of 761 (2.3%) had necrotizing pneumonia and 6 of 16 (37.5%) with necrotizing pneumonia complicated by a giant lung cyst or lung abscess. All were closely observed and showed complete clinical and radiographic resolution with antibiotic treatment.

Conclusions

Treatment of giant lung cyst formation following necrotizing pneumonia by a conservative approach with prolonged antibiotics results in complete recovery with no need for invasive procedures.

### Necrotising pneumonia caused by non-PVLwith 2-year follow-up [^115yNbHY]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Necrotising pneumonia (NP) is a rare but life-threatening complication of pulmonary infection. It is characterised by progressive necrosis of lung parenchyma with cavitating foci evident upon radiological investigation. This article reports the case of a 52-year-old woman, immunocompetent healthcare professional presenting to Accident and Emergency with NP and Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia. The cavitating lesion was not identified on initial chest X-ray leading to a delay in antimicrobial optimisation. However, the patient went on to achieve a full symptomatic recovery in 1month and complete radiological recovery at 2-year follow-up. Long-term prognosis for adult cases of NP currently remains undocumented. This case serves as the first piece of published evidence documenting full physiological and radiological recovery following appropriate treatment of NP in an immunocompetent adult patient.

### Necrotizing pneumonia (aetiology, clinical features and management) [^115b4b3L]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Necrotizing pneumonia is a severe form of community-acquired pneumonia characterized by rapid progression of consolidation to necrosis and cavitation which may lead to pulmonary gangrene. Morbidity and mortality are high and chronic sequelae are frequent. The lack of guidance supports the review of the latest recommendations in the management of these pneumonias.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic therapy alone may not be enough to alter the course of the infection, and regimens, adjunctive therapies like intravenous immunoglobulins, surgery may be required to alter the course of the disease especially with pulmonary gangrene.

Summary

The causative agents, clinical features and management of necrotizing pneumonias are discussed.

### Computed tomography findings and prognosis in older COVID-19 patients [^116tEk9h]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 qualifies as a systemic disease with a great variety of symptoms and damaged organs. However, it basically remains a respiratory disease in the vast majority of patients. Indeed, respiratory symptoms and gas exchange indexes have primary classificatory and prognostic implications. CT scan findings have also been repeatedly reported to contribute to the diagnosis and prognostic classification of COVID-19. In a noteworthy proportion of cases, CT findings could supplement microbiologic exams and correctly address the diagnosis. CT abnormalities have been frequently reported in asymptomatic patients, but completely normal CT findings have been observed in mild cases. Indeed, the earlier CT signs do not always correlate with symptom severity, and CT abnormalities, even severe, have been frequently reported to be relatively common in asymptomatic patients. However, the CT pattern of interstitial pneumonia and its typical expressions, like ground glass opacities (GGO), interlobular septal thickening, and reticular pattern, which were initially associated with COVID-19, is only one of the many CT findings. Atypical CT findings, like pleural effusions, nodules, multifocal pneumonia have been well described.

This bulk of evidence clearly states that CT scan plays a primary role in diagnosing and monitoring COVID-19. However, the possible confounding effect of conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or congestive heart failure (CHF) in the interpretation of CT findings has not been tested so far in older and multimorbid patients. Furthermore, combined and not isolated CT findings might play a major classificatory and prognostic role. Thus, assessing clustered rather than individual CT findings might improve our understanding of CT findings' clinical meaning. These two topics are the object of the present study. Based on the GeroCovid data, we will provide an estimation of the real-life CT findings' contribution to the prognostic stratification in older and multimorbid COVID-19 inpatients.

### Chest computed tomography in children undergoing extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation: a 9-year single-centre experience [^111dwzRv]. Pediatric Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

We retrospectively reviewed the imaging findings, indications, technique and clinical impact in children who had undergone chest CT while undergoing extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Radiology and ECMO databases were searched to identify all 19 children who had undergone chest CT (20 scans in total) while on ECMO at our institution between May 2003 and May 2012. We reviewed all CT scans for imaging findings. Chest CT is performed in a minority of children on ECMO (4.5% in our series). Timing of chest CT following commencement of ECMO varied among patient groups but generally it was performed earlier in the neonatal group. Clinically significant imaging findings were found in the majority of chest CT scans. Many scans contained several findings, with most cases demonstrating parenchymal or pleural abnormalities. Case examples illustrate the spectrum of imaging findings, including underlying pathology such as necrotising pneumonia and severe barotrauma, and ECMO-related complications such as tension haemothoraces and cannula migration. The results of chest CT led to a change in patient management in 16 of 19 children (84%). There were no adverse events related to patient transfer. An understanding of scan technique and awareness of potential findings is important for the radiologist to provide prompt and optimal image acquisition and interpretation in appropriate patients.

### Chest-CT mimics of COVID-19 pneumonia-a review article [^1129GHXd]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Axial HRCT scan of a patient with H1N1 pneumonia shows bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities associated with small areas of consolidation (black arrows)

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) causes approximately 4% of CAP in winter. Immunocompetent patients generally recover with no sequelae, while immunocompromised patients may develop a severe, life-threatening pneumonia. HMPV infection causes alveolar damage with mucous plugging, resulting in a CT pattern of branching centrilobular nodules and GGO.

Human coronaviruses are an important group of pathogens that cause upper and lower acute respiratory tract infections, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS and MERS viruses belong to this group.

Imaging features of SARS pneumonia resemble those observed in other CAP: most common findings are airspace consolidations with unifocal pattern being more frequent than the multifocal one. Parenchymal involvement is predominately in the lower lobes with peripheral distribution.

MERS pneumonia is a severe condition that can lead to respiratory failure more rapidly than SARS pneumonia does. CT in MERS pneumonia usually demonstrates multifocal patchy nodular consolidations with extensive GGO involving basal and subpleural regions of both lungs.

CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia can widely overlap with those observed in other viral pneumonias. However, some findings have been reported to be more indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia rather than other etiology and can help to differentiate this entity.

Pure GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation patterns are the most typical in COVID-19 pneumonia, while pure consolidations are rarely seen and more common in other viral pneumonia such as influenza pneumonia.

COVID-19 infection generally causes bilateral large parenchymal lesions (> 5–10 cm), often round-shaped, involving multiple lobes, with a characteristic peripheral distribution.

### Radiographic and CT features of viral pneumonia [^112j9wGP]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Viruses are the most common causes of respiratory infection. The imaging findings of viral pneumonia are diverse and overlap with those of other nonviral infectious and inflammatory conditions. However, identification of the underlying viral pathogens may not always be easy. There are a number of indicators for identifying viral pathogens on the basis of imaging patterns, which are associated with the pathogenesis of viral infections. Viruses in the same viral family share a similar pathogenesis of pneumonia, and the imaging patterns have distinguishable characteristics. Although not all cases manifest with typical patterns, most typical imaging patterns of viral pneumonia can be classified according to viral families. Although a definite diagnosis cannot be achieved on the basis of imaging features alone, recognition of viral pneumonia patterns may aid in differentiating viral pathogens, thus reducing the use of antibiotics. Recently, new viruses associated with recent outbreaks including human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus have been discovered. The imaging findings of these emerging pathogens have been described in a few recent studies. This review focuses on the radiographic and computed tomographic patterns of viral pneumonia caused by different pathogens, including new pathogens. Clinical characteristics that could affect imaging, such as patient age and immune status, seasonal variation and community outbreaks, and pathogenesis, are also discussed. The first goal of this review is to indicate that there are imaging features that should raise the possibility of viral infections. Second, to help radiologists differentiate viral infections, viruses in the same viridae that have similar pathogenesis and can have similar imaging characteristics are shown. By considering both the clinical and radiologic characteristics, radiologists can suggest the diagnosis of viral pneumonia. © RSNA, 2018.

### ESR essentials: imaging of common paediatric pulmonary diseases-practice recommendations by the European society of paediatric radiology [^116XiLX3]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Chest imaging in children presents unique challenges due to varying requirements across age groups. For chest radiographs, achieving optimal images often involves careful positioning and immobilisation techniques. Antero-posterior projections are easier to obtain in younger children, while lateral decubitus radiographs are sometimes used when expiratory images are difficult to obtain and for free air exclusion. Chest CT protocols should be age-dependent to minimise radiation exposure and motion artefacts. MRI is primarily used in specialised centres to reduce radiation exposure, requiring specific expertise and sedation in younger children. Respiratory distress syndrome is a leading cause of morbidity in preterm neonates, diagnosed through characteristic radiographic findings and a history of prematurity. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is the most common complication of extreme preterm birth and chronic oxygen therapy; imaging is used for predicting outcomes for the assessment of severe cases. Transient tachypnoea of the newborn and meconium aspiration syndrome are common in term infants, with specific imaging characteristics aiding in their differentiation. Congenital lung malformations present diagnostic and management challenges, with imaging playing a crucial role in diagnosis and surgical planning. Finally, imaging is essential in detecting complications from pneumonia in children, such as empyema and necrotic pneumonia, or in identifying foreign object aspiration.

Clinical relevance statement

This review summarises current radiology practice of paediatric chest pathologies, aiding in the accurate diagnosis and management of neonatal and congenital pulmonary conditions and pneumonia complications, ultimately improving patient outcomes through precise imaging interpretation and targeted clinical intervention.

Key Points

Chest radiographs should be systematically assessed for pathology.
Ensure accurate differential diagnosis of neonatal lung diseases by collecting information on gestational age, method of delivery, presenting symptoms, ventilation type, and fetal ultrasound findings.
Radiographs and ultrasound are initial diagnostic tools for paediatric pulmonary disease; CT should be reserved for complex cases. Referral to paediatric hospital should be considered when the use of chest MRI is indicated.

### Pediatric necrotizing pneumonia: a case report and review of the literature [^112oTWgp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Necrotizing pneumonias occur infrequently in children but may be associated with significant morbidity. If not adequately treated, necrotizing pneumonia may lead to complications including bronchopleural fistula, empyema, respiratory failure, and septic shock. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly implicated agent, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antimicrobial treatment is the cornerstone of management, although surgical drainage may be required in some cases. We present the case of a 14-month-old child with fever and cough that persisted despite treatment with typical first-line oral antimicrobial therapy. An initial plain radiograph of the chest demonstrated lobar pneumonia. Ultimately, computed tomography of the chest revealed a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung. We review the literature and describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, microbiological etiology, and management of necrotizing pneumonia in children.

### Cavitary lung diseases: a clinical-radiologic algorithmic approach [^112yhoZd]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Cavities occasionally are encountered on thoracic images. Their differential diagnosis is large and includes, among others, various infections, autoimmune conditions, and primary and metastatic malignancies. We offer an algorithmic approach to their evaluation by initially excluding mimics of cavities and then broadly classifying them according to the duration of clinical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities. An acute or subacute process (< 12 weeks) suggests common bacterial and uncommon nocardial and fungal causes of pulmonary abscesses, necrotizing pneumonias, and septic emboli. A chronic process (≥ 12 weeks) suggests mycobacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic infections; malignancy (primary lung cancer or metastases); or autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Although a number of radiographic features can suggest a diagnosis, their lack of specificity requires that imaging findings be combined with the clinical context to make a confident diagnosis.

### Characteristic CT findings distinguishing 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from influenza pneumonia [^114SJSNK]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the different CT characteristics which may distinguish influenza from 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Methods

A total of 13 confirmed patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from January 16, 2020, to February 25, 2020. Furthermore, 92 CT scans of confirmed patients with influenza pneumonia, including 76 with influenza A and 16 with influenza B, scanned between January 1, 2019, to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Pulmonary lesion distributions, number, attenuation, lobe predomination, margin, contour, ground-glass opacity involvement pattern, bronchial wall thickening, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, intralobular septal thickening, and pleural effusion were evaluated in COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia cohorts.

Results

Peripheral and non-specific distributions in COVID-19 showed a markedly higher frequency compared with the influenza group (p < 0.05). Most lesions in COVID-19 showed balanced lobe localization, while in influenza pneumonia they were predominantly located in the inferior lobe (p < 0.05). COVID-19 presented a clear lesion margin and a shrinking contour compared with influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05). COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities, while a cluster-like pattern and bronchial wall thickening were more frequently seen in influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05). The lesion number and attenuation, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, and intralobular septal thickening were not significantly different between the two groups (all p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Though viral pneumonias generally show similar imaging features, there are some characteristic CT findings which may help differentiating COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia.

Key Points

- CT can play an early warning role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the case of no epidemic exposure.
- CT could be used for the differential diagnosis of influenza and COVID-19 with satisfactory accuracy.
- COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities with peripheral distribution and balanced lobe predomination.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^113ZDcLK]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19 radiographic patterns — implications for antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Chest radiographs and computed tomography scans play an important diagnostic role, but a chest radiograph can be negative early and does not rule out COVID-19; typical bacterial pneumonia more often shows lobar consolidation, yet antibiotics were frequently prescribed for CAP despite lack of characteristic bacterial findings, likely reflecting COVID-19's varied presentations.

### The characteristics and clinical value of chest CT images of novel coronavirus pneumonia [^111N8wqw]. Clinical Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the characteristics and clinical value of chest computed tomography (CT) images of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).

Materials and Methods

Clinical data and CT images of 80 cases of NCP were collected. The clinical manifestations and laboratory test results of the patients were analysed. The lesions in each lung segment of the patient's chest CT images were characterised. Lesions were scored according to length and diffusivity.

Results

The main clinical manifestations were fever, dry cough, fatigue, a little white sputum, or diarrhoea. A total of 1,702 scored lesions were found in the first chest CT images of 80 patients. The lesions were located mainly in the subpleural area of the lungs (92.4%). Most of the lesions were ground-glass opacity, and subsequent fusions could increase in range and spread mainly in the subpleural area. Pulmonary consolidation accounted for 44.1% of all of the lesions. Of the 80 cases, 76 patients (95%) had bilateral lung disease, four (5%) patients had unilateral lung disease, and eight (10%) patients had cord shadow.

Conclusion

The chest CT of NCP patients is characterised by the onset of bilateral ground-glass lesions located in the subpleural area of the lung, and progressive lesions that result in consolidation with no migratory lesions. Pleural effusions and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are rare. As patients can have inflammatory changes in the lungs alongside a negative early nucleic acid test, chest CT, in combination with epidemiological and laboratory tests, is a useful examination to evaluate the disease and curative effect.

### A challenging high-risk surgery for necrotizing pneumonia in a right bilobed lung [^114iaMja]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia is a clinical condition where the lower respiratory tract epithelium below the larynx is invaded through inhalation, or hematogenous spread. The annual estimation of pneumonia reaches 120 million cases worldwide, with the consequent 1.3-million deaths. In developing nations, children under 2-years of age account for nearly 80% of pneumonia related deaths. Necrotizing pneumonia is one of the severe complications of pneumonia and is characterized by continuing pneumonic illness in a previously healthy child despite proper antibiotic therapy. Diagnosis is made by imaging and pathological analysis. Chest radiographs show pulmonary consolidation with one or more small, thin-walled cavities, whereas pathologic examination shows pulmonary inflammation, alveolar consolidation, and thrombosis of intrapulmonary vessels, and consequent necrosis with multiple small cavities. Reduced blood flow due to thrombotic vessels is thought to be the cause of pulmonary tissue destruction.

### Computed tomography scan contribution to the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia [^114QD7Q4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

HOW TO USE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY-SCAN DATA

Although an imperfect confirmation test, CXR has been central to the diagnosis of CAP in most studies on which our knowledge on this disease, including microbiology, severity assessment, efficacy of antibiotic treatment and prognosis, is based. Before current management recommendations can be extended to patients with CT-proven pneumonia, some questions warrant clarification.

The main uncertainty is whether patients with lung infiltrates on CT-scan but a negative CXR (so-called 'CT-scan only' patients) have the same disease as patients with a pneumonic infiltrate on CXR. In the Claessens' study, 40 patients (18% of those with a final diagnosis of pneumonia) had CT-scan only pneumonia. Compared with 132 patients who had pneumonia visible both on CXR and CT-scan, they had a lower mean PCT and CRP. Data on cause or prognosis were not available. In a secondary analysis of the Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) cohort, in which CT-scan was not mandatory but realized in 30% of patients mainly to exclude pulmonary embolism, 66 patients (3% of the original cohort) had CT-scan only pneumonia and were compared with 2185 patients with an infiltrate visible on CXR. Patients with CT-scan only pneumonia were younger, more frequently obese, had a lower PCT, and a lower severity of disease. Though there was no overall difference in the proportions of patients with one bacterial or viral pathogen detected, there were more Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Haemophilus influenzae isolated in the CXR group, and more rhinovirus in the CT-scan only group. Length of stay in the hospital and admission in the intensive care unit were similar in both groups, but there was no death in the CT-scan only group, compared with 49 (2.2%) in the CXR group. These findings suggest that CT-scan only pneumonia might be a more benign disease. They should be confirmed in other settings, as patients included in EPIC were young (median age was 58 years) and had mainly nonsevere pneumonia. Patients with CT-scan only pneumonia are probably a heterogeneous population, with some patients having faint infiltrates invisible on CXR, but others having marked pneumonia unidentified on a low-quality CXR (Prendki, unpublished data) (Fig. 2). More data regarding patients' characteristics, cause and prognosis of CT-scan-only pneumonia are needed. In the meantime, CT-scan only pneumonia should be managed following the same recommendations as disease visible on CXR.

### On the nature of pleural involvement in necrotizing pneumonia: a report of two cases of life threatening late complications [^115eWN4k]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2014). Low credibility.

Suppurative complications of pneumonia such as empyema, lung abscess, pyopneumothorax, and necrotizing pneumonia (NP) are uncommon in children. Over the last decade an increasing incidence of NP has been reported. Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be the predominant causative organism of NP, and while sporadic cases were reported prior to routine administration of heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine, a marked increase in NP appears to relate to replacement pneumococcal strains. Pleural involvement is almost universal in NP, and the course of pleural disease often determines its duration and outcome, particularly as it relates to complication of bronchopleural fistula. Cavities are formed in NP within the lung parenchyma and in the pleural space as the fibrosing pleural process organizes. The similarity of the radiologic appearance of parenchymal and pleural space cavities often makes the differentiation of pneumatocele versus residua of loculated pneumothorax challenging. The prevailing perception from most reports on childhood NP is of a favorable outcome with conservative approach. We report two pediatric cases with pneumonia who presented with prolonged fever despite antibiotic treatment, eventually diagnosed with NP. After stabilization on prolonged IV antibiotics, and weeks after discharge, they presented with unexpected acute respiratory failure due to a life-threatening tension air collection. In this article we discuss the nature of NP, its typical presentation, benign course and outcome, albeit its potential to cause serious late complications in the light of our recent experiences. Increasing awareness of such complications will result in more careful follow-up and in providing appropriate recommendations to parents of patients recovering from NP.

### Imaging of cavitary necrosis in complicated childhood pneumonia [^115ihVTq]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to illustrate the chest radiographs (CR) and CT imaging features and sequential findings of cavitary necrosis in complicated childhood pneumonia. Among 30 children admitted in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for persistent or progressive pneumonia, respiratory distress or sepsis despite adequate antibiotic therapy, a study group of 9 children (5 girls and 4 boys; mean age 4 years) who had the radiographic features and CT criteria for cavitary necrosis complicated pneumonia was identified. The pathogens identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae(n = 4), Aspergillus(n = 2), Legionella(n = 1), and Staphylococcus aureus(n = 1). Sequential CR and CT scans were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up CR and CT were evaluated for persistent abnormalities. Chest radiographs showed consolidations in 8 of the 9 patients. On CT examination, cavitary necrosis was localized to 1 lobe in 2 patients and 7 patients showed multilobar or bilateral areas of cavitary necrosis. In 3 patients of 9, the cavitary necrosis was initially shown on CT and visualization by CR was delayed by a time span varying from 5 to 9 days. In all patients with cavities, a mean number of five cavities were seen on antero-posterior CR, contrasting with the multiple cavities seen on CT. Parapneumonic effusions were shown by CR in 3 patients and in 5 patients by CT. Bronchopleural fistulae were demonstrated by CT alone (n = 3). No purulent pericarditis was demonstrated. The CT scan displayed persistent residual pneumatoceles of the left lower lobe in 2 patients. Computed tomography is able to define a more specific pattern of abnormalities than conventional CR in children with necrotizing pneumonia and allows an earlier diagnosis of this rapidly progressing condition. Lung necrosis and cavitation may also be associated with Aspergillus or Legionella pneumonia in the pediatric population.

### Application of clinical and CT imaging features in the evaluation of disease progression in patients with COVID-19 [^117PHnvT]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Classification criteria

(1) Mild: Mild clinical symptoms with no radiographic evidence of pneumonia. (2) Moderate: Presence of fever and respiratory symptoms with radiographic evidence of pneumonia. (3) Severe: Adults meeting any of the following criteria:1) dyspnea with a respiratory rate (RR) ≥ 30 breaths/min; 2) oxygen saturation (SpO₂) ≤ 93% at rest while breathing ambient air; 3) arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) ratio ≤ 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); and 4) progressive worsening of clinical symptoms, with radiographic evidence of lesion progression > 50% within 24–48 h. (4) Critical: Meeting any of the following conditions:1) respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; 2) shock; and 3) multiple organ failure necessitating intensive care unit (ICU) management. Based on these criteria, this study classified 30 mild and 26 moderate cases into the non-severe group (n = 56), and 28 severe and 6 critical cases into the severe group (n = 34).

CT image analysis

Two experienced radiologists, specializing in chest imaging, independently and blindly reviewed the patients' initial CT scans upon admission. The main evaluation criteria were as follows: (1) duration between the onset of symptoms and the CT scan; (2) number of lesions: no lesions, solitary lesions, or multiple lesions (≥ 2); (3) involvement of lung lobes: recording the lesion locations according to lung lobes and calculating the total number of affected lobes; (4) lesion distribution: peripheral (outer 1/3 of the lung fields), central, or central/peripheral diffuse distribution; and (5) lesion density: pure ground-glass opacity (GGO), GGO with partial consolidation or interlobular septal thickening, large reticular patterns (paving stone sign), or pure consolidation/fibrotic streaks (Fig. 1).

### The incidence of necrotizing changes in adults with pneumococcal pneumonia [^116uRGzy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotizing pneumonia is generally considered a rare complication of pneumococcal infection in adults. We systematically studied the incidence of necrotizing changes in adult patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and examined the severity of infection, role of causative serotypes, and association with bacteremia.

Methods

We used a database of all pneumococcal infections identified at our medical center between 2000 and 2010. Original readings of chest X-rays (CXR) and computerized tomography (CT) were noted. Images were then independently reevaluated by 2 radiologists. The severity of disease at admission was assessed using SMART-COP and Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) scoring systems.

Results

In 351 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia, necrosis was reported in no (0%) original CXR readings and in 6 of 136 (4.4%) CTs. With rereading, 8 of 351 (2.3%) CXR and 15 of 136 (11.0%) CT had necrotizing changes. Overall, these changes were identified in 23 of 351 (6.6%) patients. The incidence of bacteremia and the admitting SMART-COP and PORT scores were similar in patients with and without necrosis (P = 1.00, P = 0.32, and P = 0.54, respectively). Type 3 pneumococcus was more commonly isolated from patients with necrosis than from patients without necrosis (P = 0.05), but 10 other serotypes were also implicated in 16 cases for which the organism was available for typing.

Conclusions

Necrotizing changes in the lungs were seen in 6.6% of a large series of adults with pneumococcal pneumonia but were often overlooked on initial readings. Patients with necrosis were not more likely to have bacteremia or more severe disease. Type 3 pneumococcus was the most commonly identified serotype.

### Early prediction of disease progression in COVID-19 pneumonia patients with chest CT and clinical characteristics [^111FJQ7q]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to become a worldwide emergency. Early identification of patients at risk of progression may facilitate more individually aligned treatment plans and optimized utilization of medical resource. Here we conducted a multicenter retrospective study involving patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia to investigate the utility of chest computed tomography (CT) and clinical characteristics to risk-stratify the patients. Our results show that CT severity score is associated with inflammatory levels and that older age, higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and CT severity score on admission are independent risk factors for short-term progression. The nomogram based on these risk factors shows good calibration and discrimination in the derivation and validation cohorts. These findings have implications for predicting the progression risk of COVID-19 pneumonia patients at the time of admission. CT examination may help risk-stratification and guide the timing of admission.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^114dbSio]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

There has been a significant increase in hospital admissions for complicated community-acquired pneumonia both in the developed world and the developing world. Contributing to this is the high incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and tuberculosis in the developing world, resulting in overlapping presentations, treatment failure and difficulty making clinical diagnoses. Children with pneumonia who do not respond appropriately to treatment should be investigated for any suppurative parenchymal complications that may have developed. According to the British Thoracic Society Guidelines, if a child remains feverish or unwell 48 h after the start of treatment, the child must be re-evaluated regarding a possible complication. There is a spectrum of suppurative parenchymal complications of pneumonia. The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America list the following complications associated with community-acquired pneumonia in children: pleural effusion or empyema, pneumothorax, lung abscess, bronchopleural fistula and necrotizing pneumonia. Such complications are reported in up to 53% of children hospitalized with pneumonia. Harris et al. [6] indicate that children are predisposed to more severe forms of lung infection resulting in suppuration and lung abscess. Among predisposing factors are underlying congenital abnormalities such as cysts and sequestrations, bronchiectasis, neurological disorders and immune deficiencies. Also noted are organisms responsible for causing necrotizing pneumonia and lung abscess more frequently — these include serotypes of pneumococcus and S. aureus. This is due, in part, to a "spectral shift of pneumococcal strains after the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccine and the emergence of methicillin-resistance S. aureus ". In addition, the role played by HIV and tuberculosis as causative agents of necrotizing pneumonia in children living in middle- and low-income countries remains to be described. Identification of patients with suppurative parenchymal and pleural complications of pneumonia is important because prolonged intravenous antibiotic treatment is needed and surgical drainage and decortication must be considered.

### Anatomic factors and time… [^117Tzhnh]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

13, 14 Another series 15 reported that 59 percent of necrotizing soft tissue infections were polymicrobial. A review 16 of necrotizing soft tissue infections in 163 patients revealed that 71 percent of the infections were polymicrobial. In some instances, fungi have been cultured from poly-microbial infections.
11. The gold standard for detecting necrotizing soft tissue infections is tissue biopsy obtained at the time of wound exploration and surgical debridement. During wound exploration, tissue integrity and depth of invasion also can be evaluated. The findings of fascial necrosis and myo-necrosis are indicative of necrotizing infection. Loss of fascial integrity along tissue planes and frank evidence of muscle involvement are also diagnostic. One investigative team 3 noted a correlation between necrotizing soft tissue infections and subcutaneous air on radiographs and white blood cell counts higher than 20,000 per mm³.

However, an absence of soft tissue gas on radiographs does not exclude these infections. 17 Furthermore, neither the presence nor absence of gas on radiographs of infected sites correlates with the presence of specific pathogens.
4. Elevated polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts may reflect systemic infection. One team of investigators 1 reported that white blood cell counts higher than 16,300 per mm³, anemia, hypocalcemia, acidosis, crepitus, or the presence of soft tissue gas may alert physicians to the presence of necrotizing soft tissue infections. Another investigative team 23 found that 76 percent of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections had platelet counts below 150×10³ per mm³ or pro-thrombin and partial thromboplastin times more than 1.

5 times higher than normal control values. Prolonged prothrombin times were associated with a higher mortality rate. If findings such as tense skin edema, crepitus, bullae, and radiologic and laboratory abnormalities are present, they provide additional impetus to obtain urgent surgical consultation for wound exploration. 24.

### Imaging studies for diagnosing invasive fungal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients [^112VxisV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to review imaging advances in invasive fungal pneumonia in cancer and transplant recipients and how their use can help guide treatment.

Recent Findings

Early chest computed tomographic (CT) imaging of immunocompromised patients with neutropenic fever leads to improved survival. Some of the typical CT findings of invasive fungal pneumonia are transitory and are most common during the first week of symptoms. The reversed halo sign, an early sign of disease, is more common in mucormycosis. During the first 10 days of infection, invasive fungal pneumonia nodules may grow on follow-up CT scans, but this does not necessarily equate to worsening disease. Because of the excessive radiation of chest CT and because pulmonary nodule size typically expands during the first few weeks of treatment, follow-up CT scans should be ordered only when therapy changes are dependent on imaging findings.

Summary

Early chest CT imaging in immunocompromised patients suspected of having invasive fungal pneumonia can help identify disease early, leading to improved outcome.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) — diagnostic criteria and imaging: Clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, and hypoxemia should prompt evaluation with chest imaging, but these signs are not always present in immunocompromised hosts. Radiographic abnormalities are required for a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia, and given multiple nonpulmonary causes in this population, findings consistent with an infection on imaging must be present for ICHP diagnosis. In immunocompromised hosts, lung infiltrates may not be evident by chest X-ray and may require a computed tomography scan for detection, and noninfectious pulmonary conditions must be distinguished from infection; immunocompromised hosts may have concurrent infectious and noninfectious etiologies of lung infiltrates.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^1128Z9ru]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

CT needs to be performed at acceptable radiation doses in children and is indicated for diagnosing complications associated with pneumonia, when patients fail to respond to treatment, when chest radiographs are suggestive, when empyema is diagnosed on US and in environments where HIV and tuberculosis are likely coinfections. Even though US is adequate for demonstrating and evaluating effusions, CT is important for demonstrating the underlying lung in search of associated necrosis or abscess formation. CT is superior to chest radiographs and the relatively low theoretical cancer risks need to be appropriately considered against the many advantages it affords the clinician, so as not to deny children the benefits of rapid and accurate diagnosis.

### Necrotizing pneumonia in critically ill infants and children: predictive factors for critical care requirement [^114NAqWm]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing pneumonia (NP) represents a severe and potentially life-threatening complication of community-acquired pneumonia in children, characterized by progressive lung parenchymal necrosis, cavity formation and significant respiratory compromise. Despite advances in pediatric critical care, NP continue to pose substantial challenges in terms of early recognition, optimal management strategies and prediction of intensive care requirements.

Objectives

This multicenter observational study aimed to comprehensively analyze the clinical characteristics, microbiological patterns, radiological features and management strategies of pediatric NP requiring intensive care admission, with particular focus on identifying predictive factors for disease severity and resource utilization.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of all children admitted with radiologically confirmed NP to Italian pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) between January 2018 and December 2022. Comprehensive data collection included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, microbiological results, radiological patterns, therapeutic interventions, complications and outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed to identify associations between clinical variables and outcomes.

Results

Among 76 children (median age 45 months, interquartile range: 19–84), Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 38 patients (52.8%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus in 18 (23.7%), including 12 Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive strains (16.7%). Mechanical ventilation was required in 44 patients (57.9%), chest drainage in 58 (76.3%) and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in 11 (14.5%). Comorbidities were present in 23 patients (30.3%). Mean PICU stay was 8.9 ± 8.8 days with zero mortality. Independent predictors of prolonged PICU stay included age < 24 months [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2–6.5], comorbidities (OR 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4–7.3) and bilateral involvement (OR 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5–9.6).

Conclusions

Pediatric NP remains a challenging clinical entity requiring multidisciplinary management and significant intensive care resources. Early recognition of severity predictors, prompt microbiological diagnosis and individualized therapeutic approaches are essential for optimizing outcomes. Our findings support the need for standardized protocols and further prospective studies to refine management strategies for this severe condition.

### Chest-CT mimics of COVID-19 pneumonia-a review article [^1154kQqE]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary infections

Bacterial pneumonia

Lung infections are common in clinical practice and bacterial pneumonia is one of the most frequent causes. It is classified as community acquired pneumonia (CAP), aspiration pneumonia or nosocomial pneumonia (NP) based on clinical scenario.

CAP is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative (Enterobacteriae or E. coli) often cause NP, while aspiration pneumonia is due to microorganisms found in oropharynx such as Gram-negative cocci.

Clinical manifestations are fever, chills, cough, and sometimes chest pain; symptoms can be milder or absent in immunocompromised patients.

When pneumonia is suspected, diagnosis is confirmed by imaging evaluation, with chest X-ray (CXR) being the most used tool. CT is more sensitive but usually performed in unclear cases or when complications are suspected.

Imaging findings are variable: in CAP, CT images classically show airspace consolidation and can also evidence GGO, centrilobular nodules and bronchial walls thickening, with or without pleural effusion. Rarer presentations are round and multi-lobar pneumonia. The first, mainly seen in children, is typically characterized by a focal, round-shaped consolidation at imaging. Round pneumonia should be suspected in case of a rapid growing pulmonary nodule/mass, which disappears after antibiotic therapy.

Multi-lobar or bilateral pneumonia are non-focal patterns of CAP, with greater extent, often seen in patient with an underlying lung disease causing parenchymal distortion.

Aspiration pneumonia is secondary to inhalation of oropharyngeal or gastric secretions into the lower respiratory tract. Imaging generally shows bilateral and peri-hilar air-space consolidations, involving lower lobes, especially in the right lung.

NP is a complication of hospitalized patients defined as a pneumonia occurring 48 h after the admission or 48 h after hospital discharge. Imaging findings are bilateral, diffuse, or multiple foci of consolidation involving more than one lobe, frequently associated with pleural effusion.

Complications may occur in any pneumonia but are more frequent in CAP and NP, especially in immunocompromised patients, and are usually detected by CT. Lung cavitation suggests bacterial etiology, with S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria being the most frequent agents in immunocompetent patients, and Aspergillus in immunocompromised ones. Pleural effusions are frequent during uncomplicated CAP and are reactive in nature, resolving after antibiotic therapy, 5–10% of these might complicate and progress to empyema.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for COVID-19-associated pulmonary mucormycosis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, APS/FISF 2022 guidelines recommend to consider viewing the following imaging features as highly suggestive of COVID-19-associated pulmonary mucormycosis in the appropriate clinical setting:

- reversed halo sign

- thick-walled cavity

- bird's nest sign

- mycotic aneurysm

- large consolidation

- necrotizing pneumonia

- multiple large nodules (nodules > 1 cm)

- serial imaging showing cavity with an air-fluid level.

### Computed tomography scan contribution to the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia [^116uZDSe]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

Pneumonia is a frequent disease mainly affecting older and multimorbid patients. Symptoms and signs lack sensitivity and specificity, and chest X-ray has poor accuracy. Hence, an initial diagnosis of pneumonia has limited predictive value for the presence of pneumonia. Overdiagnosis of pneumonia leads to inappropriate antibiotic use and may delay the appropriate management of mimicking diseases. Alternative imaging strategies including computed tomography (CT)-scan or lung ultrasonography may improve the diagnosis of pneumonia. We review the recent evidence and perspectives regarding their contribution to the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected pneumonia.

Recent findings

Two studies assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CT-scan in emergency department or hospitalized patients suspected of pneumonia. CT-scan led to a net reclassification improvement of 8 and 18% of patients, and was particularly helpful to rule out the diagnosis, allowing a lowering of the number of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions.

Summary

CT-scan reduces overdiagnosis of pneumonia and allows a better identification of alternative diagnoses. The impact on clinical outcomes of a strategy incorporating CT-scan for patients suspected of pneumonia should be evaluated, along with its cost-effectiveness.

High-resolution CT findings characteristic of HP include profuse centrilobular nodules of ground-glass attenuation, inspiratory mosaic attenuation and air-trapping, and the three-density sign. Assessment of the overall probability of HP should consider the prevalence of the disease in the particular setting, the clinical context, the exposure history, and the information contributed by the HRCT.

2.2 Radiology Imaging

Radiological data were evaluated through chest X‐rays, ultrasound (US), and chest CT scans to detect possible PPE, NP, air leak, or radiological sequelae. Patients with effusions < 10 mm were excluded, and loculations were recorded. Radiographic findings of NP include destruction of the lung parenchyma, loss of contrast enhancement, and the development of multiple thin‐walled (< 2 mm) fluid‐ or air‐filled cavities. Repeat radiological imaging, follow‐up chest X‐rays, US, or CT scans were performed if other radiographic abnormalities persisted. Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and bronchopulmonary fistula (BPF) were defined as air leak complications. As the patients were to be observed until their recovery was completed and chest radiographs returned to normal, radiological imaging conducted at 6–9 month follow‐up was reviewed. Atelectasis, BPF, bronchiectasis, and pleural thickening identified during the 6‐9‐month period were categorized as radiological sequelae.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^111QHao5]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

CT diagnosis of the suppurative parenchymal complications of pneumonia

Expansile pneumonia refers to an increased volume of an involved lobe or segment, with a chest radiograph appearance of dense consolidation causing bulging fissures. Even though expansile pneumonia is not commonly seen in children, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are known to cause this, with Klebsiella pneumoniae mostly affecting the upper lobes (Fig. 1). Aspergillus fumigatus in immunocompromised and neutropenic children as well as Mycobacteriun tuberculosis can also cause expansile pneumonia. When there is expansile pneumonia but no visible cavitation containing air or an air-fluid level, the variety of underlying parenchymal changes cannot be differentiated from each other on chest radiographs. These can range from exudative consolidation with fluid bronchograms to necrotizing pneumonia and eventual lung abscess and may be accompanied by a pleural effusion or empyema. These pathological changes can be distinguished on CT, allowing for different management options to be considered. In addition, CT can suggest tuberculosis as a possible cause by demonstrating typical lymphadenopathy or indicate a missed/unsuspected foreign body. Necrotizing pneumonia is a severe complication of community-acquired pneumonia resulting in liquefaction and cavitation of lung tissue. The true incidence of this complication in children with community-acquired pneumonia is unknown, but it is increasingly reported, possibly due to early detection from the increased use of chest CT. Lai et al. reported a frequency as high as 34% using chest CT. Lung necrosis is suspected on chest radiographs, but the diagnosis can only be confirmed by CT. Radiologists are clear that CT yields more detailed information concerning chest anatomy and pathology than chest radiography. In the context of diagnosing necrotizing pneumonia or the other complications of community-acquired pneumonia in children, CT has been shown to be the most sensitive and accurate modality, demonstrating pathology before it becomes evident on chest radiographs. Detection and differentiation of pulmonary parenchymal complications require contrast-enhanced CT. In a study by Donnelly et al. all CT examinations performed in children not responding to treatment for community acquired pneumonia (when a chest radiograph was non-contributory) demonstrated at least one significant finding. The suppurative parenchymal complications of pneumonia seen on CT can be considered an evolution of events from exudation, followed by necrosis of the lung, to cavitation or abscess formation and possibly the development of a bronchopleural fistula, but since CT is not performed in a sequential, temporal fashion in children (a single CT scan only represents a moment in time) and since interventions may interrupt the process, each of these complications can be considered individually.

Pneumonia — Clinical features include fever, chill, productive cough, myalgia, and headache. Relevant factors include varying disease patterns depending on patients' immune status with immunocompetent vs immunocompromised status, positive microbiology culture or polymerase chain reaction test, and improvement with antibiotic treatment. Pathology shows filling of alveolar spaces by exudate of edema fluid and neutrophil (lobar), patchy peribronchiolar inflammation (bronchopneumonia), and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate in alveolar septa and interstitial tissue (interstitial pneumonia). Radiologic patterns include lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, and interstitial pneumonia patterns, with atypical pneumonia such as septic emboli, abscess, and chronic pneumonia including actinomycosis or chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis.

### Necrotizing pneumonia and cerebral air embolism [^112DxK6o]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old man experienced acute respiratory failure due to PVL-positive Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed multiple cavernous lesions indicating necrotizing pneumonia (Fig. 1 a). The patient received mechanical ventilation and was treated with antibiotic therapy. After initial recovery, he suffered another respiratory failure due to aspiration during vomiting. His cardiopulmonary condition deteriorated rapidly, resulting in unconsciousness and additionally detected conjugate eye deviation. Emergency chest CT confirmed aspiration pneumonia, whereas brain CT revealed generalized bihemispheric cerebral air embolism (Fig. 1 b), and a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed cortical diffusion restriction (Fig. 1 c). The air embolism likely occurred because of a right-to-left shunt from a necrotic lung lesion during his cardiopulmonary depressed state. No patent foramen ovale was found, but a positive bubble test result suggested an underlying pulmonary venous shunt. Following an extended stay in the intensive care unit, the patient was discharged to rehabilitation, with improving sensorimotor function but persistent visual deficits and neuropsychological limitations.

### Organizing pneumonia: a kaleidoscope of concepts and morphologies [^1179EQW4]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The basic histopathological pattern of organizing pneumonia (OP) is well recognized, but the contexts in which it is encountered continue to increase. In parallel with an appreciation of new causes and associations of OP, an understanding of OP in the spectrum of lung injury and repair has evolved. There is an increasing array of HRCT manifestations of OP, some of which have only recently been described. This article concentrates on new concepts surrounding OP and highlights newly described imaging patterns.

Organizing pneumonia

Organizing pneumonia (OP) is the prototypical condition linked to the RHS and often presents with bilateral, peripheral lesions in patients experiencing insidious symptoms such as cough or dyspnea. In OP, the central GGO reflects acute inflammatory and fibrinous exudates filling the alveoli, while the outer rim of consolidation represents organizing fibrosis. OP typically demonstrates a smooth, uniform rim of consolidation and may exhibit a migratory pattern on serial imaging, characteristics that are less common in infectious or neoplastic processes (Fig. 8).

Vasculitis and autoimmune disorders

Autoimmune disorders such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can present with the RHS. In GPA, the central ground-glass opacity reflects necrotizing granulomas or vasculitic lesions, while in SLE, lupus pneumonitis or alveolar hemorrhage produces a similar pattern (Figs. 9 and S3) (1–4). Eosinophilic pneumonia (EP), though rare, is characterized by alveolar inflammation with eosinophilic exudates and a peripheral rim of consolidation, accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels (Fig. 10). Diagnosis is achieved by correlating imaging findings with clinical clues: for example, GPA often presents with systemic features such as sinusitis or renal involvement with positive ANCA, SLE is typically accompanied by malar rash, arthritis, and positive anti-dsDNA antibodies, and eosinophilic pneumonia usually manifests as upper lobe peripheral RHS lesions with marked eosinophilia.

### Lung CT: part 2, the interstitial pneumonias – clinical, histologic, and CT manifestations [^116nuTY9]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The interstitial pneumonias are a group of heterogeneous nonneoplastic lung diseases that may be idiopathic or associated with an underlying abnormality. Although they share some features in common, they also exhibit diverse pulmonary manifestations. Imaging plays an essential role in characterizing this group of disorders and can often suggest the diagnosis, though the final interpretation requires a coordinated effort involving the radiologist, pathologist, and clinician. The purpose of this article is to review the imaging features of the interstitial pneumonias according to their histologic patterns and to provide a brief overview of their clinical presentations.

Conclusion

This article reviews the interstitial pneumonias according to their histologic subtypes, including both idiopathic and secondary forms. On completion, the reader should have an improved understanding of the classification of the interstitial pneumonias, associated causes, characteristic imaging features, histologic descriptions, clinical manifestations, and prognoses.

### Necrotizing granuloma of the lung: imaging characteristics and imaging-guided diagnosis [^111UkBBj]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess CT findings and the sensitivities of imaging-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy and core needle biopsy in the diagnosis of necrotizing granuloma of the lung.

Conclusions

The CT characteristics of necrotizing granuloma are indistinguishable from those of malignant tumors; tissue diagnosis therefore is necessary. Core needle biopsy is a sensitive method for diagnosing necrotizing granuloma of the lung, but FNA biopsy is insufficient for diagnosis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since 1st December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology, now known as coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19), has been reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The disease has developed a severe pandemic affecting over 200 countries, areas or territories. According to the data from the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 4 May 2020, more than 3 million cases worldwide have been confirmed with over 20 thousand deaths. Here, we work to synthesize the associated literature by meta‐analysis to describe the chest computed tomography (CT) characteristics of common patients and severe patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia.
