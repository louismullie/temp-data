## Question

Cardiomiopatía dilatada

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dilated cardiomyopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and etiologies, including genetic versus acquired causes. Next, I will review the pathophysiology and natural history. After that, I need to outline a diagnostic workup and family screening strategy. Then, I should appraise risk stratification, especially for sudden cardiac death. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, including guideline-directed therapy, device indications, and special scenarios, and close with emerging directions and a concise clinical takeaway.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic criteria so I don't anchor on outdated concepts. Classically, DCM is defined by left ventricular or biventricular dilation with impaired systolic function in the absence of abnormal loading conditions or coronary artery disease sufficient to explain the phenotype, but wait, let me verify the modern expansion: contemporary statements recognize that some patients present with hypokinetic non-dilated cardiomyopathy, so LV dysfunction without overt dilation can still represent early DCM, which matters for early detection and family screening [^a83f68bb] [^eafdd160].

> I need to check the epidemiology carefully because figures vary by cohort and ascertainment. Prevalence estimates range from about 1 in 250 to 1 in 2,500 depending on definitions and screening intensity, with incidence around 3–8 per 100,000 person-years in population studies; importantly, familial aggregation is common, and I should double-check that: familial DCM accounts for roughly 30–50% of cases, with higher yield in pediatric cohorts, and recent family-based data suggest a modeled familial prevalence near 30% if all first-degree relatives are screened, with higher risk in Black families [^5f3d02ee] [^2d5c95bd] [^b86d2740].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without categorizing it properly. Genetic causes are identified in about 35–40% of nonischemic DCM, with sarcomeric, cytoskeletal, nuclear envelope, and RNA-binding genes implicated; LMNA, TTN, BAG3, FLNC, RBM20, and PLN are recurring culprits, and I should confirm that pediatric cohorts show higher genetic yield, approaching 60% in some series [^2d5c95bd] [^a83f68bb]. Acquired etiologies include myocarditis, alcohol, chemotherapy, endocrine disease, tachyarrhythmia, peripartum, autoimmune, and toxins; notably, 5–15% of "acquired" DCM harbor likely pathogenic variants, so a two-hit model is plausible in some cases [^a83f68bb] [^72ec6fe0].

> Next, I should review pathophysiology to connect mechanism to therapy. The final common pathway is myocyte injury with neurohormonal activation, adverse remodeling, fibrosis, and chamber dilation; mid-wall fibrosis on CMR tracks with arrhythmic risk and limited reverse remodeling, and I need to ensure I note that early disease may be non-dilated with subtle dysfunction, which is why CMR and strain imaging add value beyond EF [^e8cd8611] [^4bf50d16].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, and I should confirm a stepwise, etiology-driven strategy. Initial workup includes history, exam, ECG, echocardiography, labs including CBC, metabolic panel, TSH, liver function, iron studies, HIV testing when indicated, and selective coronary evaluation; a 3-generation pedigree is essential to identify familial disease, and if idiopathic DCM is suspected, I should consider comprehensive genetic testing with counseling, especially in those with conduction disease, early-onset disease, or family history of SCD [^00ff3c35] [^3b30395d] [^48414065]. But wait, what if inflammation is suspected? In that case, CMR and, in select scenarios, endomyocardial biopsy can refine diagnosis and guide therapy, though routine biopsy is not indicated without a compelling rationale [^90b2e0ca].

> Let me think about family screening next, and I should verify guideline concordance. For probands with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, cascade genetic testing is recommended for first-degree relatives, followed by longitudinal cardiac screening with ECG and echocardiography even if genotype-negative, given variable expressivity; ESC 2023 supports periodic clinical evaluation in first-degree relatives when no variant is found or testing is not done, and ESC 2022 advises ECG and echo in relatives when the index case is young or there is a suggestive family history [^c311f9fd] [^9672d2f2] [^fe263691]. I should double-check that early detection enables preemptive therapy and improves outcomes, which is a key rationale for cascade screening programs [^aa92b79f].

> Now, I need to appraise risk stratification, especially for sudden cardiac death, and I should confirm that EF alone is insufficient. Traditional primary prevention ICD indications hinge on LVEF ≤ 35% despite optimal therapy, but only a minority of ICD recipients receive appropriate shocks, so I must integrate genotype, CMR fibrosis, NSVT, LBBB, and syncope; LMNA, FLNC, and RBM20 carry elevated arrhythmic risk even with preserved EF, and ESC 2022/2023 allow consideration of ICD above 35% in high-risk genotypes with additional markers, while wearable defibrillators can bridge risk in the short term [^f2c8ec57] [^812c07a2] [^e20c975a] [^a24fd0aa] [^bc46f078]. Hold on, I should verify that mid-wall fibrosis independently predicts SCD and limited recovery, reinforcing its weight in decision-making [^4bf50d16].

> Next, I should review foundational therapy and ensure I'm aligned with contemporary heart failure guidance. Guideline-directed medical therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors reduces mortality and hospitalizations in HFrEF due to DCM, and I need to emphasize uptitration to target doses whenever tolerated; in parallel, address reversible drivers such as alcohol abstinence, tachyarrhythmia control, and treatment of endocrine or autoimmune disease to promote reverse remodeling [^1c2bbd43] [^251f6eb3] [^e2cbf487]. Let me reconsider whether any subgroup diverges from this approach; even in special etiologies, the backbone remains GDMT unless contraindicated, with etiology-specific add-ons as indicated [^e2cbf487].

> I should confirm device indications and timing. For primary prevention, ICD is indicated in nonischemic DCM with LVEF ≤ 35% and NYHA II–III symptoms on optimal therapy, with expectation of meaningful survival beyond 1 year; CRT is considered when LBBB or other electrical dyssynchrony is present and symptoms persist despite GDMT, and I need to ensure a 3-month period of optimal therapy before permanent device decisions unless there is a compelling indication to proceed earlier [^1c2bbd43] [^72ee5207]. For secondary prevention, ICD is indicated after sustained VT/VF or cardiac arrest, and I should counsel on risks, benefits, and lifestyle implications pre-implant [^5d61ac01] [^5a999379].

> But wait, what about special populations and scenarios where standard rules may not suffice? In peripartum cardiomyopathy, I should delay device decisions for at least 6 months to allow for recovery, while treating with GDMT adapted to pregnancy and lactation; in pediatrics, adult HF regimens are extrapolated with careful dosing, and genetic testing is prioritized when conduction disease or family SCD is present; in chemotherapy-related DCM, early detection with biomarkers and serial imaging guides interruption or modification of cardiotoxic therapy, and GDMT is standard; in tachyarrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy, aggressive rhythm control can normalize function and obviate device therapy if sustained [^f4282adb] [^c7fd3090] [^67b95e96] [^8d75f6c4]. I should double-check that these nuances are reflected in guideline statements to avoid overgeneralization [^e2cbf487].

> Next, I should review emerging directions and precision medicine so I don't miss actionable advances. Polygenic risk and gene–environment interactions are reshaping our understanding of susceptibility and expressivity, and early-phase trials of gene therapy, RNA-based approaches, and small molecules targeting specific pathways are underway; meanwhile, improved variant interpretation pipelines and functional assays are reducing VUS burdens and enabling genotype-guided counseling and, in select cases, preemptive therapy in genotype-positive, phenotype-negative relatives [^5f3d02ee] [^72ec6fe0] [^c50214d2]. Hold on, I should verify that current clinical use remains within evidence-based genetics frameworks and counseling standards to avoid misapplication [^62a5b22e].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical takeaway is concise and accurate. DCM is a heterogeneous myocardial disease unified by LV dilation or hypokinesis with reduced EF in the absence of abnormal loading or ischemia; a structured, etiology-driven workup with family screening, multimodality imaging, and selective genetic testing identifies reversible causes and informs prognosis; GDMT is foundational, while ICD and CRT decisions should integrate EF, symptoms, genotype, fibrosis, and arrhythmic markers; and early detection in families plus targeted management of drivers can improve outcomes and, in some cases, achieve remission, though vigilance for relapse is essential [^a83f68bb] [^48414065] [^1c2bbd43] [^0feffe41].

### Pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy: from mechanisms to precision medicine [^72ec6fe0]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a complex disease with multiple causes and various pathogenic mechanisms. Despite improvements in the prognosis of patients with DCM in the past decade, this condition remains a leading cause of heart failure and premature death. Conventional treatment for DCM is based on the foundational therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. However, increasingly, attention is being directed towards individualized treatments and precision medicine. The ability to confirm genetic causality is gradually being complemented by an increased understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations. Non-genetic factors also influence the onset of DCM, and growing evidence links genetic background with concomitant non-genetic triggers or precipitating factors, increasing the extreme complexity of the pathophysiology of DCM. This Review covers the spectrum of pathophysiological mechanisms in DCM, from monogenic causes to the coexistence of genetic abnormalities and triggering environmental factors (the 'two-hit' hypothesis). The roles of common genetic variants in the general population and of gene modifiers in disease onset and progression are also discussed. Finally, areas for future research are highlighted, particularly novel therapies, such as small molecules, RNA and gene therapy, and measures for the prevention of arrhythmic death.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^e2cbf487]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary of dilated cardiomyopathy — dilated cardiomyopathy is an important cause of heart failure with a common phenotype of ventricular dilation and depressed myocardial performance, and its pathogenesis varies significantly across metabolic, endocrine, autoimmune, rheumatologic, infiltrative, genetic, infectious, and cardiotoxin causes. Demographics and treatment also vary significantly according to the cause. Treatment should be individualized and should target the underlying cause, in addition to the standard systolic heart failure therapies. In certain cases, with elimination of the cause and the appropriate treatment, reversal of myocardial remodeling and recovery of cardiac dysfunction can occur. Future studies targeting specific cardiomyopathies will be critical for detection and treatment of specific cardiomyopathies.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy: causes, mechanisms, and current and future treatment approaches [^e8cd8611]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dilated cardiomyopathy:

- **Definition**: Dilated cardiomyopathy is a heart disease characterized by LV dilation and contractile dysfunction, leading to cardiac remodeling and ultimately HF.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy involves myocardial damage and dysfunction, leading to ventricular dilation and impaired contractility. This results in secondary neurohormonal changes that contribute to reverse remodeling and ongoing myocyte damage.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy globally is estimated at 0.00029 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for dilated cardiomyopathy include a family history of the condition, as genetic mutations account for up to 35% of cases. Other risk factors include myocarditis, exposure to alcohol, drugs and toxins, and metabolic and endocrine disturbances.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, dilated cardiomyopathy presents with symptoms related to congestive HF, such as fatigue, breathlessness, and edema. It can also cause circulatory collapse, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. Some patients may be asymptomatic, while others may present acutely with decompensated HF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of dilated cardiomyopathy varies, with the worst outcomes seen in individuals with the lowest ejection fractions or severe diastolic dysfunction.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy: causes, mechanisms, and current and future treatment approaches [^a83f68bb]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is conventionally defined as the presence of left ventricular or biventricular dilatation or systolic dysfunction in the absence of abnormal loading conditions (eg, primary valve disease) or significant coronary artery disease sufficient to cause ventricular remodelling. This definition has been recognised as overly restrictive, as left ventricular hypokinesis without dilation could be the initial presentation of dilated cardiomyopathy. The causes of dilated cardiomyopathy comprise genetic (primary dilated cardiomyopathy) or acquired factors (secondary dilated cardiomyopathy). Acquired factors include infections, toxins, cancer treatment, endocrinopathies, pregnancy, tachyarrhythmias, and immune-mediated diseases. 5–15% of patients with acquired dilated cardiomyopathy harbour a likely pathogenic or pathogenic gene variant (ie, gene mutation). Therefore, the diagnostic tests and therapeutic approach should always consider both genetic and acquired factors. This Seminar will focus on the current multidimensional diagnostic and therapeutic approach and discuss the underlying pathophysiology that could drive future treatments aiming to repair or replace the existing gene mutation, or target the specific inflammatory, metabolic, or pro-fibrotic drivers of genetic or acquired dilated cardiomyopathy.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy: the complexity of a diverse genetic architecture [^3a91eb85]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Remarkable progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Rare variants in > 30 genes, some also involved in other cardiomyopathies, muscular dystrophy, or syndromic disease, perturb a diverse set of important myocardial proteins to produce a final DCM phenotype. Large, publicly available datasets have provided the opportunity to evaluate previously identified DCM-causing mutations, and to examine the population frequency of sequence variants similar to those that have been observed to cause DCM. The frequency of these variants, whether associated with dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is greater than estimates of disease prevalence. This mismatch might be explained by one or more of the following possibilities: that the penetrance of DCM-causing mutations is lower than previously thought, that some variants are noncausal, that DCM prevalence is higher than previously estimated, or that other more-complex genomics underlie DCM. Reassessment of our assumptions about the complexity of the genomic and phenomic architecture of DCM is warranted. Much about the genomic basis of DCM remains to be investigated, which will require comprehensive genomic studies in much larger cohorts of rigorously phenotyped probands and family members than previously examined.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy: a review [^4e8ffa79]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common cardiac diagnosis that may result as a consequence of a variety of pathologies. The differential diagnosis remains quite broad since many pathologies can present as DCM, and as a result the approach to diagnosis may, at times, be quite difficult. This review article discusses genetic and acquired causes of DCM, pathophysiology of myocardial damage, pathology, and diagnostic criteria. An approach to management is also included, in the hope of informing physicians of a clinical entity that afflicts a substantial number of people worldwide.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^02e5bab5]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) diagnostic strategies — Evaluation of patients with DCM involves common diagnostic strategies recommended for patients with heart failure (HF) or cardiomyopathy and requires a thorough understanding of the complex, diverse pathophysiology that must be individualized to the patient.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies [^48414065]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dilated cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to general principles, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain systematic evaluation in all patients with suspected or established cardiomyopathy using a multiparametric approach, including clinical evaluation, pedigree analysis, ECG, Holter monitoring, laboratory tests, and multimodality imaging.

### State of the art: multimodality imaging in dilated cardiomyopathy [^68aa6474]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy represents a common phenotype expressed in individuals with a family of overlapping myocardial diseases due to acquired and/or genetic susceptibility. Disease trajectory, response to therapy and outcomes vary widely; therefore, further refinement of the diagnosis can help guide therapy and inform prognosis. Multimodality imaging plays a key role in this process, as well as excluding alternative causes which may mimic a primary myocardial disease. The following article discusses the role of different imaging modalities as well as what the future may look like in the context of recent research innovations.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^b7ad5a27]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Definition of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) — dilated cardiomyopathy refers to heterogeneous myocardial disorders characterized by ventricular dilation and depressed myocardial performance in the absence of hypertension, valvular, congenital, or ischemic heart disease. In clinical practice, the pathogenesis of heart failure is often placed into ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and the term nonischemic cardiomyopathy has been interchangeably used with DCM, but this approach fails to recognize nonischemic cardiomyopathies caused by volume or pressure overload that are not conventionally accepted under the definition of DCM. In general practice and clinical trials, ischemic cardiomyopathy is defined as cardiomyopathy caused by ischemic heart disease, and current use of this terminology implies ventricular dilation and depressed myocardial contractility caused by ischemia or infarction.

### Evolving concepts in dilated cardiomyopathy [^8e05b9e3]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents a particular aetiology of systolic heart failure that frequently has a genetic background and usually affects young patients with few co-morbidities. The prognosis of DCM has improved substantially during the last decades due to more accurate aetiological characterization, the red-flag integrated approach to the disease, early diagnosis through systematic familial screening, and the concept of DCM as a dynamic disease requiring constant optimization of medical and non-pharmacological evidence-based treatments. However, some important issues in clinical management remain unresolved, including the role of cardiac magnetic resonance for diagnosis and risk categorization and the interaction between genotype and clinical phenotype, and arrhythmic risk stratification. This review offers a comprehensive survey of these and other emerging issues in the clinical management of DCM, providing where possible practical recommendations.

### Clinical care of family members of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [^aa92b79f]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Genetic family screening following the detection of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a proband with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains one of the main applications of genetic testing. While cardiac screening is recommended for all first-degree relatives, the a priori risk among family members varies. Consequently, screening regimens should be tailored according to both genetic and clinical information at the individual and familial level. This clinical consensus statement provides tools to help with the risk assessment and follow-up of screening for family members and discusses the utility for integration of genotype-specific information, cardiac imaging, and electrocardiogram findings to personalize cardiac screening regimens, which in conjunction will likely improve individualized risk prediction. Early phenotypic detection of DCM in family members remains an active area of research and innovation. In addition, data are starting to accrue on the utility of early therapeutic intervention in family members with very mild phenotypes that may inform future management in addition to screening. A systematic strategy is proposed to determine the a priori risk of developing DCM for a family member, and the potential of integrating genotype-phenotype knowledge towards family management. Lastly, there is a focus on the current knowledge gaps and ongoing and future opportunities to improve risk prediction, early disease detection, and treatment of family members of patients with DCM.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for dilated cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to screening of family relatives, ESC 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain an ECG and echocardiography in a first-degree relative of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy if:

- the index patient was diagnosed at < 50 years of age or has clinical features suggestive of an inherited cause

- there is a family history of dilated cardiomyopathy or premature unexpected sudden death.

### Non-invasive markers for sudden cardiac death risk stratification in dilated cardiomyopathy [^cd8668d5]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common yet challenging cardiac disease. Great strides have been made in improving DCM prognosis due to heart failure but sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular arrhythmias remains significant and challenging to predict. High-risk patients can be effectively managed with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) but because identification of what is high risk is very limited, many patients unnecessarily experience the morbidity associated with an ICD implant and many others are not identified and have preventable mortality. Current guidelines recommend use of left ventricular ejection fraction and New York Heart Association class as the main markers of risk stratification to identify patients who would be at higher risk of SCD. However, when analysing the data from the trials that these recommendations are based on, the number of patients in whom an ICD delivers appropriate therapy is modest. In order to improve the effectiveness of therapy with an ICD, the patients who are most likely to benefit need to be identified. This review article presents the evidence behind current guideline-directed SCD risk markers and then explores new potential imaging, electrophysiological and genetic risk markers for SCD in DCM.

### Genome-wide association analysis provides insights into the molecular etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy [^5f3d02ee]. Nature Genetics (2024). High credibility.

Main

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) describes a spectrum of heart muscle diseases that are characterized by impaired left ventricular (LV) myocardial contractility and dilatation, in the absence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or abnormal loading conditions. DCM affects approximately one in 250 individuals and is among the primary etiologies of heart failure, as well as the leading cause of cardiac transplantation. Pathogenic variants in relevant genes can cause DCM via monogenic disease mechanisms; however, recent evidence suggests important direct and indirect effects of polygenic background on DCM risk. Characterization of the complex genetic architecture underlying DCM provides opportunities for improved clinical genetic testing and the discovery of pathways and genes to inform therapeutic development.

### Sex differences in the clinical presentation and natural history of Dilated cardiomyopathy [^3204fc4d]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Sex is understood to have a diverse impact on the cardiovascular system in both health and disease. Despite an evolving understanding of how sex may affect manifestation and progression of cardiovascular disease, its influence on the morpho-functional and clinical manifestations of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), one of the commonest causes of heart failure (HF), remains unresolved.

DCM affects up to 1 in 250 people. The etiology can be genetic, environmental, immune, or idiopathic. It is a growing medical and economic burden on health care systems. Despite therapeutic advances for DCM, outcomes are poor. There is a pressing need to understand the contributors to disease to improve prognosis. Understanding biological sex as a modifier of cardiomyopathy is a major unmet need in the field as identified by key guidelines and commissions.

In this prospective observational study of well-characterized individuals with DCM, we sought to characterize morpho-functional differences and contemporary outcomes in DCM by sex and evaluate major DCM prognostic factors of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and mid-wall myocardial fibrosis in the context of sex. Understanding sex differences in phenotype and prognosis offers potential to improve outcomes through tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Conclusions

DCM constitutes a broad clinical phenotype that arises from a final common response to a number of genetic and environmentally acquired insults. Detecting the underlying dominant cause and the ongoing downstream pathophysiological processes is the key to initiate targeted treatment strategies.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) prognosis, natural history, and mortality patterns — In the adult population, the prognosis of heart failure (HF) and DCM has improved significantly and the improvement in survival has been associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and β-blockers; compared with whites, blacks have almost a 3-fold increase in risk for developing DCM and an ≈1.5 to 2-fold higher risk of dying of DCM. Approximately 25% of DCM patients with recent onset of HF symptoms will have spontaneous improvement, but symptoms lasting > 3 months with severe clinical decompensation generally have less chance of recovery. Prognostic factors linked to a poor prognosis include peak oxygen consumption < 10 to 12 mL·kg−1·min−1, serum sodium < 137 mmol/L, advanced New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and age > 64 years, among other findings. In the United States, causes of death appear to be pump failure in approximately two thirds and sudden cardiac death in approximately one third of deaths of patients with DCM; existing clinical studies report that patients with idiopathic DCM had a lower total mortality than patients with ischemic heart disease.

### The diagnosis and evaluation of dilated cardiomyopathy [^4bf50d16]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is best understood as the final common response of myocardium to diverse genetic and environmental insults. A rigorous work-up can exclude alternative causes of left ventricular (LV) dilation and dysfunction, identify etiologies that may respond to specific treatments, and guide family screening. A significant proportion of DCM cases have an underlying genetic or inflammatory basis. Measurement of LV size and ejection fraction remain central to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment, but other aspects of cardiac remodeling inform prognosis and carry therapeutic implications. Assessment of myocardial fibrosis predicts both risk of sudden cardiac death and likelihood of LV functional recovery, and has significant potential to guide patient selection for cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Detailed mitral valve assessment is likely to assume increasing importance with the emergence of percutaneous interventions for functional mitral regurgitation. Detection of pre-clinical DCM could substantially reduce morbidity and mortality by allowing early instigation of cardioprotective therapy.

### The electrocardiogram in the diagnosis and management of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [^e8f2c6b7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The term dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) defines a heterogeneous group of cardiac disorders, which are characterized by left ventricular or biventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction in the absence of abnormal loading conditions or coronary artery disease sufficient to cause global systolic impairment. In approximately one third of cases, DCM is familial with a genetic pathogenesis and various patterns of inheritance. Although the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been considered traditionally non-specific in DCM, the recently acquired knowledge of the genotype-phenotype correlations provides novel opportunities to identify patterns and abnormalities that may point toward specific DCM subtypes. A learned ECG interpretation in combination with an appropriate use of other ECG-based techniques including ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise tolerance test and imaging modalities, such as echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance, may allow the early identification of specific genetic or acquired forms of DCM. Furthermore, ECG abnormalities may reflect the severity of the disease and provide a useful tool in risk stratification and management. In the present review, we discuss the current role of the ECG in the diagnosis and management of DCM. We describe various clinical settings where the appropriate use and interpretation of the ECG can provide invaluable clues, contributing to the important role of this basic tool as cardiovascular medicine evolves.

### Precision medicine in the management of dilated cardiomyopathy: JACC state-of-the-art review [^c50214d2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Precision medicine promises to dramatically improve patient outcomes and reduce health care costs through a shift in focus from disease treatment to prevention and individualized therapies. For families with inherited cardiomyopathies, efforts to date have been directed toward discovery and functional characterization of single disease-causing variants. With advances in sequencing, the cataloging of personal genetic variation has been expedited, providing improved insights into the key importance of the genes in which variants occur. These advances have propelled seminal opportunities for successful variant-targeted disease-reversing therapy. New challenges have also emerged-particularly interpretation of the rapidly rising numbers of "variants of unknown significance". For treatments based on patient genotype to be feasible on a wider scale, these obstacles need to be overcome. Here the authors focus on genetics of dilated cardiomyopathy and provide a roadmap for implementing genomic information into future patient management.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy: from epidemiologic to genetic phenotypes: a translational review of current literature [^17f7de1d]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by left ventricular dilatation and, consecutively, contractile dysfunction. The causes of DCM are heterogeneous. DCM often results from myocarditis, exposure to alcohol, drugs or other toxins and metabolic or endocrine disturbances. In about 35% of patients, genetic mutations can be identified that usually involve genes responsible for cytoskeletal, sarcomere and nuclear envelope proteins. Due to its heterogeneity, a detailed diagnostic work-up is necessary to identify the specific underlying cause and exclude other conditions with phenotype overlap. Patients with DCM show typical systolic heart failure symptoms, but, with progress of the disease, diastolic dysfunction is present as well. Depending on the underlying pathology, DCM patients also become apparent through arrhythmias, thromboembolic events or cardiogenic shock. Disease progression and prognosis are mostly driven by disease severity and reverse remodelling within the heart. The worst prognosis is seen in patients with lowest ejection fractions or severe diastolic dysfunction, leading to terminal heart failure with subsequent need for left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplantation. Guideline-based heart failure medication and device therapy reduces the frequency of heart failure hospitalizations and improves survival.

### Key points… [^831079d6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What it is Cardiomyopathy represents a collection of diverse conditions of the heart muscle. These diseases have many causes, symptoms, and treatments and can affect people of all ages and races. When cardiomyopathy occurs, the normal muscle in the heart can thicken, stiffen, thin out, or fill with substances the body produces that do not belong in the heart muscle. As a result, the heart muscle's ability to pump blood is reduced. This, in turn, can lead to irregular heartbeats, the backup of blood into the lungs or rest of the body, and heart failure. Cardiomyopathy can be acquired — developed because of another disease, condition, or factor — or inherited. The cause isn't always known. The main types of cardiomyopathy include the following: Dilated: meaning that one of the pumping chambers of the heart is enlarged. This is more common in males and is the most common form of cardiomyopathy in children. It can occur at any age and may or may not be inherited.

Hypertrophic: where the heart muscle is thickened. This often presents in childhood or early adulthood and can cause sudden death in adolescents and young adult athletes. It is often an inherited condition, and a person may not have any symptoms. If there is a family history of this, other family members can be tested and adjust their activities to reduce the risk of sudden death. Arrhythmogenic: where the disease causes irregular heartbeats or rhythms. This is often inherited and more common in males. Restrictive: where heart muscle is stiff or scarred, or both. It can occur with amyloidosis, or hemochromatosis, and other conditions. This is the least common type.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare form of heart failure that can occur near the end of pregnancy or up to a year after giving birth. The heart muscle becomes weak, causing a buildup of fluid in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swollen ankles or legs. Because these symptoms can also occur in a normal pregnancy, recognition and treatment for this condition can be delayed.

### State-of-the-art document on optimal contemporary management of cardiomyopathies [^17f85366]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyopathies represent significant contributors to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Over the past decades, a progress has occurred in characterization of the genetic background and major pathophysiological mechanisms, which has been incorporated into a more nuanced diagnostic approach and risk stratification. Furthermore, medications targeting core disease processes and/or their downstream adverse effects have been introduced for several cardiomyopathies. Combined with standard care and prevention of sudden cardiac death, these novel and emerging targeted therapies offer a possibility of improving the outcomes in several cardiomyopathies. Therefore, the aim of this document is to summarize practical approaches to the treatment of cardiomyopathies, which includes the evidence-based novel therapeutic concepts and established principles of care, tailored to the individual patient aetiology and clinical presentation of the cardiomyopathy. The scope of the document encompasses contemporary treatment of dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. It was based on an expert consensus reached at the Heart Failure Association online Workshop, held on 18 March 2021.

### Cardiomyopathy: an overview… [^a0a64050]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

General Overview Although they involve a variety of phenotypes and etiologies, the most common cardiomyopathies often present to primary care physicians with similar symptoms. Hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive cardiomyopathy may each present with signs and symptoms that are common in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, including peripheral edema, fatigue, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, presyncope, syncope, and cardiac ischemia. 19, 20 This process leads to thinning and ballooning of the ventricular wall, typically in the right ventricle. 21 ARVD/C most commonly presents in the fourth decade of life with symptoms such as palpitations, syncope, and, occasionally, sudden cardiac death. 19, 22 Approximately one-half of cases are familial. 1 Its exact prevalence is difficult to determine based on current data but has been estimated at less than 1% of the general population.

24 The disease is defined by significant trabeculation of the myocardium, in addition to development of intertrabecular recesses in the left ventricle. These abnormalities lead to left ventricle dysfunction and, ultimately, to heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolic disease, and sudden cardiac death. MIXED ETIOLOGIES Dilated Cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy has a prevalence of 1: 2, 500 and is the leading indication for heart transplantation. 1 DCM is defined by enlargement of ventricles, normal left ventricular wall thickness, and systolic dysfunction. 1 Approximately 25% to 35% of cases are familial, with such instances being primarily inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. 3 DCM may also result from a host of environmental, infectious, and systemic factors, as described in Table 2. 1,
3. Common echocardiography findings include left ventricular dilation, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension.

38 Treatment follows standard heart failure therapy, with appropriate considerations for patients who are still pregnant. Therefore, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be avoided in pregnant patients, and physicians should take care to avoid hypotension and reduced uterine perfusion when using diuretic therapy. 38 Most women with peripartum cardiomyopathy recover left ventricular function. Long-term mortality rates have not been well documented but range from 11% to 16% in separate studies. 38.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy [^90b2e0ca]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a clinical diagnosis characterized by left ventricular or biventricular dilation and impaired contraction that is not explained by abnormal loading conditions (for example, hypertension and valvular heart disease) or coronary artery disease. Mutations in several genes can cause DCM, including genes encoding structural components of the sarcomere and desmosome. Nongenetic forms of DCM can result from different aetiologies, including inflammation of the myocardium due to an infection (mostly viral); exposure to drugs, toxins or allergens; and systemic endocrine or autoimmune diseases. The heterogeneous aetiology and clinical presentation of DCM make a correct and timely diagnosis challenging. Echocardiography and other imaging techniques are required to assess ventricular dysfunction and adverse myocardial remodelling, and immunological and histological analyses of an endomyocardial biopsy sample are indicated when inflammation or infection is suspected. As DCM eventually leads to impaired contractility, standard approaches to prevent or treat heart failure are the first-line treatment for patients with DCM. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators may be required to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias. In addition, identifying the probable cause of DCM helps tailor specific therapies to improve prognosis. An improved aetiology-driven personalized approach to clinical care will benefit patients with DCM, as will new diagnostic tools, such as serum biomarkers, that enable early diagnosis and treatment.

### Results of comprehensive diagnostic work-up in' idiopathic' dilated cardiomyopathy [^5d82a365]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterised by left ventricular dilation and dysfunction in the absence of coronary disease, valvular disease or hypertension. Approximately 20% of admittances for decompensated heart failure are due to dilated cardiomyopathy, which probably represents the end-stage phenotype of almost any kind of global insult to the myocardium. Accordingly, the list of potential causes of dilated cardiomyopathy is long. The diagnostic work-up is usually limited to physical examination, blood tests, echocardiography and coronary angiography. More often than not, these tests fail to reveal the aetiology of the disease, and the patients are diagnosed with 'idiopathic' dilated cardiomyopathy. They then receive generic treatment for heart failure, leaving the question of causality unanswered and the potential for tailored treatment unmet in a disease with high mortality and morbidity.

Outcome in dilated cardiomyopathy depends on aetiology. Dilated cardiomyopathy caused by systemic inflammatory disease requires specific treatment, and some causes of dilated cardiomyopathy predispose to malignant arrhythmia, strengthening the indication for cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. Identification of a heritable cause allows for family screening, possibly allowing for early phenotype detection and appropriate treatment. Establishing the aetiology may thus influence the way we inform and treat patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

In a seminal paper by Felker et al, an endomyocardial biopsy identified the underlying cause in 15% of patients referred to the Johns Hopkins Hospital for diagnostic evaluation of dilated cardiomyopathy. Over the recent years, imaging techniques have improved, and techniques for detecting monogenetic and viral causes have been introduced. The value of employing each of these modalities in patients with initially unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy, and in particular the value of a comprehensive, multimodality work-up, has not been systematically investigated. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield and therapeutic consequences of a multimodality diagnostic investigation, beyond physical examination, echocardiography, coronary angiography and blood tests, in a contemporary cohort of patients with 'idiopathic' dilated cardiomyopathy. We assumed that a thorough diagnostic evaluation would yield an aetiological diagnosis in a substantial number of patients, with considerable impact on therapeutic and follow-up strategies.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) overall management — The differential treatment benefit seen in DCM compared with ischemic cardiomyopathy has been observed in randomized clinical trials, and differential patient responsiveness to digoxin or amiodarone suggests response differences between ischemic and nonischemic HF; however, similar older reports of survival difference with β-blockers and amiodarone in patients with DCM but not ischemic cardiomyopathy were not reproduced in subsequent large-scale randomized trials. Currently, it is accepted that guideline-directed medical and device therapies, including implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for HF, are beneficial in DCM.

Epidemiology and natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) — Determining the incidence and prevalence of DCMs has been challenging because of geographic variations, patient selection, and diagnostic criteria changes. In Olmsted County, MN, the incidence of idiopathic DCM, which is defined as a cardiomyopathy when the exact cause remains initially unknown, doubled from 3.9 per 100 000 person-years between 1975 and 1979 to 7.9 per 100 000 person-years between 1980 and 1984. In Sweden, the incidence of clinical and postmortem diagnoses remained 5 per 100 000 per year, where the autopsy rates were 90%. In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of DCM has been reported to be ≈36 cases per 100 000 population. In most multicenter randomized trials in heart failure (HF), ≈30% to 40% of the enrolled patients have nonischemic HF, and according to ADHERE (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry), 47% of the patients admitted to the hospital with HF had nonischemic cardiomyopathy. DCM can occur at any age but most commonly occurs in the third or fourth decade of life, and advancing age is an independent risk factor for mortality in DCM.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy: genetic determinants and mechanisms [^43c2b468]. Circulation Research (2017). Low credibility.

Nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) often has a genetic pathogenesis. Because of the large number of genes and alleles attributed to DCM, comprehensive genetic testing encompasses ever-increasing gene panels. Genetic diagnosis can help predict prognosis, especially with regard to arrhythmia risk for certain subtypes. Moreover, cascade genetic testing in family members can identify those who are at risk or with early stage disease, offering the opportunity for early intervention. This review will address diagnosis and management of DCM, including the role of genetic evaluation. We will also overview distinct genetic pathways linked to DCM and their pathogenetic mechanisms. Historically, cardiac morphology has been used to classify cardiomyopathy subtypes. Determining genetic variants is emerging as an additional adjunct to help further refine subtypes of DCM, especially where arrhythmia risk is increased, and ultimately contribute to clinical management.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy [^49050e2d]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterised by left ventricular dilation that is associated with systolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction and impaired right ventricular function can develop. Affected individuals are at risk of left or right ventricular failure, or both. Heart failure symptoms can be exercise-induced or persistent at rest. Many patients are asymptomatic. Chronically treated patients sometimes present acutely with decompensated heart failure. Other life-threatening risks are ventricular arrhythmias and atrioventricular block, syncope, and sudden death. Genetic inheritance arises in 30–48% of patients, and inflammatory disorders such as myocarditis or toxic effects from medications, alcohol, or illicit drugs also result in dilated cardiomyopathy. Genes that cause dilated cardiomyopathy generally encode cytoskeletal and sarcomeric (contractile apparatus) proteins, although disturbance of calcium homeostasis also seems to be important. In children, disrupted mitochondrial function and metabolic abnormalities have a causal role. Treatments focus on improvement of cardiac efficiency and reduction of mechanical stress. Arrhythmia therapy and prevention of sudden death continue to be mainstays of treatment. Despite progress over the past 10 years, outcomes need to be improved.

### FDA investigation into potential link between certain diets… [^c1520a40]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Many of these case reports included breeds of dogs not previously known to have a genetic predisposition to the disease. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine and the Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, a collaboration of government and veterinary diagnostic laboratories, continue to investigate this potential association. Based on the data collected and analyzed thus far, the agency believes that the potential association between diet and DCM in dogs is a complex scientific issue that may involve multiple factors. Dilated cardiomyopathy is recognized as a genetic condition in dogs, typically in large or giant breeds, such as the Doberman Pinscher, Great Dane, or the Irish Wolfhound. It is also seen in Cocker Spaniels associated with taurine deficiency. It is believed to be less common in small and medium breed dogs. Genetic forms of DCM tend to affect male large and giant breed dogs beginning in middle to older age.

DCM cases reported to FDA CVM have involved a wide range of dog breeds, ages and weights. There have been a greater proportion of males than females, consistent with what is seen in genetic forms. The significance of this is unknown, but it may be that some cases are genetic in origin or a combination of diet and genetic tendencies. CVCA will repeat collection of urine, blood, and feces at 1 to 2 months, and at 6 months after the initial diagnosis and document any treatment or dietary changes, if any, that were recommended by the cardiologist. The repeat urine and blood samples will be tested for amino acid content and the feces archived. At the 6-month recheck, CVCA will also conduct a repeat echocardiogram to assess any changes to the heart. As of April 30, 2019, CVCA and Vet-LIRN have collected initial samples from 14 dogs, and 1 to 2-month samples from 10 dogs. CVCA is currently collecting the 6-month samples.

Chesapeake Veterinary Cardiology Associates, a multi-location veterinary cardiology practice based predominantly in the Mid-Atlantic states, has provided comprehensive records for some DCM cases to the Vet-LIRN network for further testing. These case records include imaging studies of the animal's hearts, comprehensive dietary histories, diagnostic and treatment records, as well as outcomes of the cases.

### Genetics of dilated cardiomyopathy: practical implications for heart failure management [^62a5b22e]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Given the global burden of heart failure, strategies to understand the underlying cause or to provide prognostic information are critical to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this highly prevalent disease. Cardiomyopathies often have a genetic cause, and the field of heart failure genetics is progressing rapidly. Through a deliberate investigation, evaluation for a familial component of cardiomyopathy can lead to increased identification of pathogenic genetic variants. Much research has also been focused on identifying markers of risk in patients with cardiomyopathy with the use of genetic testing. Advances in our understanding of genetic variants have been slightly offset by an increased recognition of the heterogeneity of disease expression. Greater breadth of genetic testing can increase the likelihood of identifying a variant of uncertain significance, which is resolved only rarely by cellular functional validation and segregation analysis. To increase the use of genetics in heart failure clinics, increased availability of genetic counsellors and other providers with experience in genetics is necessary. Ultimately, through ongoing research and increased clinical experience in cardiomyopathy genetics, an improved understanding of the disease processes will facilitate better clinical decision-making about the therapies offered, exemplifying the implementation of precision medicine.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy [^5a8d2604]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is defined by the presence of left ventricular dilatation and contractile dysfunction. Genetic mutations involving genes that encode cytoskeletal, sarcomere, and nuclear envelope proteins, among others, account for up to 35% of cases. Acquired causes include myocarditis and exposure to alcohol, drugs and toxins, and metabolic and endocrine disturbances. The most common presenting symptoms relate to congestive heart failure, but can also include circulatory collapse, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. Secondary neurohormonal changes contribute to reverse remodelling and ongoing myocyte damage. The prognosis is worst for individuals with the lowest ejection fractions or severe diastolic dysfunction. Treatment of chronic heart failure comprises medications that improve survival and reduce hospital admission-namely, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and β blockers. Other interventions include enrolment in a multidisciplinary heart failure service, and device therapy for arrhythmia management and sudden death prevention. Patients who are refractory to medical therapy might benefit from mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation. Treatment of preclinical disease and the potential role of stem-cell therapy are being investigated.

Remission of heart failure, defined by resolution of symptoms, normalization of left ventricular ejection fraction, and plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides and by the ability to withdraw diuretic agents without recurrence of congestion is increasingly recognized among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Once remission has been achieved, it is unclear which treatments need to be continued long term. The durability of remission and likelihood of relapse are likely to be determined by intrinsic myocardial susceptibility, the persistence or recurrence of any acquired triggers, and current and future myocardial workload. Each of these should be addressed to enable personalized therapy to delay or prevent relapse. Management should be informed by evidence from randomized trials of targeted therapeutic strategies.

### Sex differences in the clinical presentation and natural history of Dilated cardiomyopathy [^c6fc1ea8]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Biological sex has a diverse impact on the cardiovascular system. Its influence on dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unresolved.

Objectives

This study aims to investigate sex-specific differences in DCM presentation, natural history, and prognostic factors.

Methods

The authors conducted a prospective observational cohort study of DCM patients assessing baseline characteristics, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, biomarkers, and genotype. The composite outcome was cardiovascular mortality or major heart failure (HF) events.

Results

Overall, 206 females and 398 males with DCM were followed for a median of 3.9 years. At baseline, female patients had higher left ventricular ejection fraction, smaller left ventricular volumes, less prevalent mid-wall myocardial fibrosis (23% vs 42%), and lower high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I than males (all P < 0.05) with no difference in time from diagnosis, age at enrollment, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide levels, pathogenic DCM genetic variants, myocardial fibrosis extent, or medications used for HF. Despite a more favorable profile, the risk of the primary outcome at 2 years was higher in females than males (8.6% vs 4.4%, adjusted HR: 3.14; 95% CI: 1.55–6.35; P = 0.001). Between 2 and 5 years, the effect of sex as a prognostic modifier attenuated. Age, mid-wall myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular ejection fraction, left atrial volume, N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, left bundle branch block, and NYHA functional class were not sex-specific prognostic factors.

Conclusions

The authors identified a novel paradox in prognosis for females with DCM. Female DCM patients have a paradoxical early increase in major HF events despite less prevalent myocardial fibrosis and a milder phenotype at presentation. Future studies should interrogate the mechanistic basis for these sex differences.

Care coordination in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) — essential components and population-specific guidance include that coordination of care requires maximizing communication across providers, facilitating transitions, creating a plan of care, monitoring and adjusting the plan as changes present, ensuring medication reconciliation, supporting self-management, and linking patients to community resources, with important benefits including improvements in clinical outcomes and cost/healthcare utilization outcomes such as enhanced disease management, patient satisfaction, quality of life — decreased readmissions, urgent/emergent care visits, and hospital days; for pediatric cardiomyopathies, models for the care of adults with heart failure (HF) that use multidisciplinary teams should be considered, and coordination of care is necessary between pediatric cardiologists, primary care pediatricians, medical geneticists, and genetic counselors and often should include specialists in nutrition and exercise rehabilitation; in heritable cardiomyopathies, patients require surveillance monitoring, prevention of secondary complications, and often genetic screening, and collaboration with experts in cardiovascular genetics is recommended as well as with physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and genetic counselors; in chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy, it is important for oncologists to collaborate with cardiologists to evaluate cardiac function, prevent induced cardiomyopathy, monitor during treatment, and treat HF if it develops; for rheumatologic or infiltrative cardiomyopathies, coordination of care among subspecialties such as rheumatology, internal medicine, or other relevant subspecialties is imperative; and for women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, perinatologists and high-risk obstetricians should coordinate care with HF specialists.

### Future development of arrhythmogenic risk scores in patients with heart failure and inherited dilated cardiomyopathy. A scientific statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^e2bd4683]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the general population of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has progressively declined with the implementation of novel medical strategies. However, still cases occur in young individuals and the challenge of risk stratification remains unsolved. Traditional criteria, including left ventricular ejection fraction, have demonstrated their profound weakness to identify subjects at high risk of SCD in this specific context. The increasing availability of genetic information has allowed identification of certain genotypes with a high arrhythmic risk that deserve a more individualized approach. Recent European guidelines recognized the contribution of genetic information in clinical decision-making. Gene-specific risk stratification tools have been developed, and in some cases externally validated, which can support clinicians in the decisions on SCD primary prevention interventions. However, they are generally based on basic variables, whereas the growing amount of knowledge on novel methods for risk prediction, and in particular the solid data on the predictive value of cardiac magnetic resonance tissue characterization (i.e. late gadolinium enhancement) are not incorporated in available scores, and more in general, are not systematically part of the clinical work-up. In this scientific statement, we summarized the current state of the art concerning the risk stratification of SCD in DCM, with particular emphasis on genetic forms, highlight the weaknesses of the available strategies and the potential actions needed for improving them. Available risk stratification tools are discussed, and methodologies that should be incorporated in future prognostication models are summarized. Lastly, a point-by-point summary of the key prerequisites for developing the future arrhythmogenic risk scores in patients with DCM is provided.

Clinical Perspective

Nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a primary disease of the myocardium characterized by left ventricular dilation and contractile dysfunction in the absence of coronary artery disease or abnormal loading conditions.DCM is estimated to occur in ≈1 in 2500 individuals with a higher incidence in men for the European and American populations. The primary clinical manifestations of DCM include heart failure, arrhythmia, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and sudden cardiac death. The development of nonischemic DCM is believed to be the result of an interplay between genetics and environmental insults. Indeed, pathogenic variants are identified in ≈35% of nonischemic DCM cases, with pathogenic variants identified in ≈40% of familial DCM cases and in ≈60% of pediatric DCM cases. Pathogenic DCM variants occur in genes that encode a variety of proteins, including cytoskeletal, sarcomere, nuclear envelope, mitochondrial, and RNA‐binding proteins. For example, variants of the sarcomere genes MYH7, TNNT2, and ACTC1, which encode components of the thick and thin filament contractile sarcomere proteins, are associated with DCM.

Chronic heart failure (HF) clinical syndrome and etiologies — The cardinal manifestations are dyspnea and fatigue that may limit exercise tolerance and fluid retention leading to pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema, and the term heart failure is preferred over congestive heart failure because not all patients have volume overload at evaluation. The syndrome may result from pericardial, myocardial, endocardial, or great vessel disorders, with most symptoms due to impairment of left ventricular (LV) myocardial function, and HF may range from normal LV size with preserved ejection fraction (EF) to severe dilatation and/or markedly reduced EF. Coronary artery disease, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease are substantial causes, and as many as 30% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may have a genetic cause. HF is not equivalent to cardiomyopathy or LV dysfunction; it is defined as a clinical syndrome with specific symptoms and signs, and there is no single diagnostic test because diagnosis is based on careful history and physical examination.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy with mid-range ejection fraction at diagnosis: characterization and natural history [^c9d67f85]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The European Society of Cardiology has introduced a novel class of heart failure (HF) without a severely reduced ejection fraction (EF), calling it as HF with a mid‐range EF. HF with a mid‐range EF mainly includes patients with primarily mild systolic dysfunction and features of diastolic dysfunction. 1 This new entity encompasses patients with clinical, laboratory, or instrumental evidence of HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between 40% and 49%. The definition of this new class of HF could lead to a better understanding of the characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatment options for a group of patients often neglected in randomized clinical trials. 1 Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a heterogeneous myocardial disease with a frequent genetic cause, is characterized by several degrees of reduced LVEF. 2, 3, 4 Notably, DCM patients are typically relatively young, with low comorbidities and long periods of asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction. 2 They are often diagnosed in an early phase of the disease, through the application of extensive genetic counseling programs and sometimes by way of the results of preparticipation screenings for sport activities. 5, 6 Therefore, at diagnosis, DCM patients could be characterized by the absence of HF symptoms and non‐severe systolic dysfunction. However, few data on the characteristics, evolution, and outcomes of DCM patients presenting with mid‐range ejection fraction (mrEF) at baseline are available at this time. 7 In the present study, we sought to characterize DCM patients presenting with mrEF at baseline, describing their natural history and prognosis in comparison with reduced EF (rEF) patients.

Future Research

To turn a strategy of targeted, individualized therapy for HFrEFrem from an aspiration into a reality, a series of trials focusing on stratified therapy and based on disease phenotype and mechanism are required. Initial studies may focus on the short- to medium-term effects of the withdrawal of a single agent on myocardial mechanics and remodeling in patients who are perceived to have a low risk of relapse. Early identification of relapse and demonstration that remission can be restored derisks such trials from an individual patient perspective as well as for clinical services and research. These studies may then progress to larger noninferiority studies assessing the effects on longer-term clinical outcomes. Greater understanding of the likelihood of relapse and the mechanistic drivers will guide the decision-making process and enable more personalized selection of the therapies most likely to maintain remission. Large studies will be required to characterize relationships between disease heterogeneity, ongoing treatments, and disease outcomes. These insights will provide a foundation for developing effective and personalized approaches to long-term therapy that are sensitive to patients' preferences.

Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) aggregates in families, and early detection in at-risk family members can provide opportunity to initiate treatment prior to late-phase disease. Most studies have included only White patients, yet Black patients with DCM have higher risk of heart failure-related hospitalization and death.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of familial DCM among DCM probands and the age-specific cumulative risk of DCM in first-degree relatives across race and ethnicity groups.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A family-based, cross-sectional study conducted by a multisite consortium of 25 US heart failure programs. Participants included patients with DCM (probands), defined as left ventricular systolic dysfunction and left ventricular enlargement after excluding usual clinical causes, and their first-degree relatives. Enrollment commenced June 7, 2016; proband and family member enrollment concluded March 15, 2020, and April 1, 2021, respectively.

Exposures

The presence of DCM in a proband.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Familial DCM defined by DCM in at least 1 first-degree relative; expanded familial DCM defined by the presence of DCM or either left ventricular enlargement or left ventricular systolic dysfunction without known cause in at least 1 first-degree relative.

Results

The study enrolled 1220 probands (median age, 52.8 years [IQR, 42.4–61.8]; 43.8% female; 43.1% Black and 8.3% Hispanic) and screened 1693 first-degree relatives for DCM. A median of 28% (IQR, 0%-60%) of living first-degree relatives were screened per family. The crude prevalence of familial DCM among probands was 11.6% overall. The model-based estimate of the prevalence of familial DCM among probands at a typical US advanced heart failure program if all living first-degree relatives were screened was 29.7% (95% CI, 23.5% to 36.0%) overall. The estimated prevalence of familial DCM was higher in Black probands than in White probands (difference, 11.3% [95% CI, 1.9% to 20.8%]) but did not differ significantly between Hispanic probands and non-Hispanic probands (difference, -1.4% [95% CI, -15.9% to 13.1%]). The estimated prevalence of expanded familial DCM was 56.9% (95% CI, 50.8% to 63.0%) overall. Based on age-specific disease status at enrollment, estimated cumulative risks in first-degree relatives at a typical US advanced heart failure program reached 19% (95% CI, 13% to 24%) by age 80 years for DCM and 33% (95% CI, 27% to 40%) for expanded DCM inclusive of partial phenotypes. The DCM hazard was higher in first-degree relatives of non-Hispanic Black probands than non-Hispanic White probands (hazard ratio, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.26 to 2.83]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In a US cross-sectional study, there was substantial estimated prevalence of familial DCM among probands and modeled cumulative risk of DCM among their first-degree relatives.

Clinical Perspective

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), defined by left ventricular enlargement with systolic dysfunction at the exclusion of other usual clinically detectable causes responsible for impaired global contractile function, is the most prevalent form of myocardial disease in humans, with an estimated prevalence of up to 1 in 250 individuals worldwide. Notably, there is a significant sex difference in the incidence of DCM, with an overall combined mean male:female sex ratio of 2.5:1.DCM confers a significantly enhanced risk for heart failure, ventricular and supraventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac transplantation, and death., Factually, DCM is the second most prevalent cause of heart failure next to coronary heart disease, accounting for 30% to 40% of all heart failures, and the most common indication for cardiac transplantation worldwide, with an average 5‐year survival rate of approximately 50% after diagnosis of DCM, though a significant improvement of heart function has been achieved by evidence‐based therapy for heart failure., It was reported that in female patients the annual incidence of DCM‐related death was about 2%, whereas in male patients, the annual incidence of DCM‐causative death was nearly 4%, and in the United States alone, DCM contributed to ≈46 000 hospitalizations and ≈10 000 deaths annually. Obviously, DCM causes substantial morbidity and mortality as well as medical care cost, imposing an enormous socioeconomic burden on humans. Despite the clinical significance, the molecular pathogenesis underlying DCM remains incompletely understood.
