## Question

What pediatric data are available on lumexapine for epilepsy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what pediatric data exist for "lumexapine" in epilepsy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "lumexapine" exists in the provided corpus at all. Then, I should verify if this might be a misspelling or a look‑alike/sound‑alike for a known antiseizure medication with pediatric data. Next, I will consider potential confusion with non-epilepsy drugs that contain a similar stem, such as antimalarials. Finally, I will synthesize what can and cannot be concluded from the evidence and outline safe next steps while emphasizing pediatric medication safety principles [^111zT8SL].

> Wait, let me verify the existence of "lumexapine" in the supplied references before assuming anything. I need to check the FDA labels and key pediatric epilepsy sources here. I reviewed the labels and pediatric sections for levetiracetam, lacosamide, topiramate, perampanel, lamotrigine (XR and immediate‑release context), and pregabalin; I see extensive pediatric data for these established ASMs, but there are zero mentions of a drug named "lumexapine", which strongly suggests the queried name is not present in these high‑credibility epilepsy references [^114BBCTh] [^112BVADu] [^116LrUiE] [^112NtfR9] [^112AhQ14] [^115RwsSh] [^117PrDpF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I initially wondered if "lumexapine" could be lacosamide because of a superficial resemblance, but the orthography and phonetics really don't line up on closer inspection; I should correct that initial hunch and explicitly consider the most plausible epilepsy agents with pediatric approvals that might be intended here: lacosamide (Vimpat), levetiracetam (Keppra), lamotrigine, topiramate, and perampanel, all of which are documented in the provided sources with pediatric data and would be reasonable alternatives if the intended drug is one of these [^112BVADu] [^114BBCTh] [^112AhQ14] [^116LrUiE] [^112NtfR9].

> I should also consider look‑alike/sound‑alike confusion with non-ASM psychotropics (for example, loxapine or lurasidone), but I need to acknowledge that those are not treatments for epilepsy; medication name confusion is a recognized contributor to pediatric medication errors, so I need to ensure the exact product name is clarified before advising dosing or safety parameters, especially in children where dosing precision is critical [^1147VKaZ] [^112d9usV].

> But wait, what if the stem "lume-" is leading us toward lumefantrine rather than an antiseizure medication? Let me check that explicitly. Artemether‑lumefantrine (Coartem) is an antimalarial, not an ASM, and is repeatedly referenced in the materials with malaria dosing and safety considerations, including QT prolongation cautions; this would not be indicated for epilepsy and should not be substituted into an epilepsy regimen based on name similarity alone [^111co5c6] [^111DfD5p] [^116tzRWP] [^117MRiPv].

> I should confirm the evidentiary bottom line: within the supplied documents, there is no mention of "lumexapine", and therefore no pediatric safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, or dosing data for that name in epilepsy; consequently, I cannot endorse use, dosing, or monitoring for "lumexapine" in pediatric epilepsy based on this corpus, and clarification of the intended drug name is required before any clinical recommendation is made [^114BBCTh] [^112BVADu] [^116LrUiE] [^112NtfR9] [^112AhQ14] [^115RwsSh] [^117PrDpF].

> Let me think about practical, evidence‑based options while the name is being verified. If an established ASM was intended, several agents here have pediatric indications: levetiracetam has established safety and effectiveness from 1 month to 16 years for focal seizures and additional pediatric indications, with dedicated infant data as well [^114BBCTh] [^113vqvSb]; lacosamide is supported from 1 month to less than 17 years for focal seizures and from 4 years for adjunctive therapy in primary generalized tonic‑clonic seizures, including IV use where appropriate with pediatric safety characterization [^112BVADu] [^113HfGji]; topiramate carries pediatric labeling with age‑stratified dosing and explicit limitations below 2 years based on trial results [^116LrUiE] [^116TqKdd]; perampanel includes pediatric data and labeling starting at 4 years for focal seizures and 12 years for adjunctive therapy in PGTC [^112NtfR9]; lamotrigine IR has pediatric indications ≥ 2 years for multiple seizure types though XR is ≥ 13 years, with important age‑specific cautions [^112AhQ14]; pregabalin (Lyrica) has adjunctive partial‑onset seizure data down to 1 month, with age‑appropriate dosing frameworks [^117PrDpF] [^115RwsSh].

> Next, I should review systems‑level guidance to ensure safe interim management while the medication identity is clarified. Pediatric epilepsy care should follow established emergency and chronic management pathways, leveraging center protocols and age‑appropriate dosing while avoiding extrapolation to an unverified product name; this aligns with AES/NAEC guidance on standardized protocols and pediatric resource readiness, and with broader pediatric medication safety guidance emphasizing error prevention and dose verification in children [^117N9jVo] [^114hELDx] [^111zT8SL] [^112d9usV] [^111Hr5RB].

> So, to synthesize and close the loop: I should double‑check the spelling with the requestor, explicitly asking whether they meant lacosamide, levetiracetam, or another approved ASM; if "lumexapine" is a novel or investigational compound, then I need to state that no pediatric epilepsy data are present in these materials and recommend consulting primary literature or trial registries, while in the meantime adhering to labeled, evidence‑based pediatric ASMs and established safety protocols rather than attempting off‑label use of an unverified product name [^114BBCTh] [^112BVADu] [^116LrUiE] [^112NtfR9] [^112AhQ14] [^114hELDx] [^111zT8SL].

I can't find a medication called "lumexapine" in pediatric epilepsy literature or drug databases. Could you confirm the **exact drug name** or provide the **correct spelling**? If you meant:

- **Lurasidone (Latuda)**: an antipsychotic, not an antiseizure medication; no pediatric epilepsy data in this context.
- **Lumateperone**: also an antipsychotic; no pediatric epilepsy data here.
- **Levetiracetam (Keppra)**: established pediatric epilepsy data [^113hR2Kx] [^114BBCTh].
- **Topiramate (Topamax)**: established pediatric epilepsy data [^113pcyV4] [^116LrUiE].
- **Lacosamide (Vimpat)**: established pediatric epilepsy data [^111fNh7R] [^112BVADu].
- **Perampanel (Fycompa)**: established pediatric epilepsy data [^113UAGXg] [^112NtfR9].

Please specify the **exact medication** so I can provide the correct pediatric epilepsy data.

Pediatric use:

The safety and effectiveness of Keppra for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients aged 1 month to 16 years have been established [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The dosing recommendation for these pediatric patients varies according to age group and is weight-based [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

The safety and effectiveness of Keppra as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adolescents aged 12 years and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have been established [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

The safety and effectiveness of Keppra as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy have been established [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

The safety and effectiveness for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month; adjunctive therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years; and adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established.

A 3-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of Keppra as adjunctive therapy in 98 pediatric patients (Keppra N = 64, placebo N = 34) aged 4 to 16 years old with partial seizures that were inadequately controlled. The target dose was 60 mg/kg/day. Neurocognitive effects…

### Topamax [^116LrUiE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosing in monotherapy epilepsy**:

	- **Adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older**: The recommended dose for Topamax monotherapy in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older is 400 mg/day in two divided doses. The dose should be achieved by titration according to the recommended schedule.

	- **Pediatric patients 2 to 9 years of age**: Dosing in patients 2 to 9 years of age is weight-based. During the titration period, the initial dose of Topamax is 25 mg/day, administered nightly for the first week. Based on tolerability, the dosage can be increased to 50 mg/day (25 mg twice daily) in the second week. Dosage adjustments can then be made by increasing 25–50 mg/day each subsequent week as tolerated. Titration to the minimum maintenance dose should be attempted over a total titration period of 5–7 weeks. Depending on tolerability and clinical response, further titration to a higher dose, up to the maximum maintenance dose, can be attempted in 25–50 mg/day weekly increments. The total daily dose should not exceed the maximum maintenance dose appropriate for each range of body weight.

### Vimpat [^112BVADu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Vimpat has been established for pediatric use in the treatment of partial-onset seizures for patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years. This usage is supported by evidence from well-controlled studies in adults, pharmacokinetic data from both adult and pediatric patients, and safety data from 847 pediatric patients within the specified age range [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)]. However, safety and effectiveness in patients below 1 month of age have not been established.

Regarding primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, Vimpat as an adjunctive therapy has demonstrated safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy aged 4 years and older. This was established in a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study (Study 5), which involved 37 pediatric patients aged 4 to less than 17 years [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years have not been established.

Animal data suggest that lacosamide, the active ingredient, has the potential to interfere with the activity of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a protein involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth. The potential adverse effects on central nervous system development cannot be ruled out.

### Fycompa [^112NtfR9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

**Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of Fycompa for the treatment of partial-onset seizures have been established in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older. Safety and effectiveness in patients 12 years of age and older were established by three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies, which included 72 pediatric patients aged between 12 and 16 years exposed to Fycompa [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The use of Fycompa for treating partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients aged 4 to less than 12 years is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of Fycompa in patients 12 years of age and older with partial-onset seizures, pharmacokinetic data from adult and pediatric patients, and safety data in 225 pediatric patients aged 4 to less than 12 years treated with Fycompa [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The safety and efficacy of Fycompa for adjunctive therapy of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older were established in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (n = 164), which included 11 pediatric patients aged 12 to 16 years exposed to Fycompa; an additional 6 patients were treated with Fycompa in the open-label extension of the study [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

### Coartem [^111co5c6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Contraindications**:

	- **Hypersensitivity**: Known hypersensitivity to artemether, lumefantrine, or to any of the excipients of Coartem Tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

	- **Strong CYP3A4 Inducers**: Coadministration of strong inducers of CYP3A4 such as rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort with Coartem Tablets can result in decreased concentrations of artemether and/or lumefantrine and loss of antimalarial efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Artemether-lumefantrine treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria: A systematic review and meta-analysis of day 7 lumefantrine concentrations and therapeutic response using individual patient data [^117MRiPv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Day 7 lumefantrine concentrations were measured either in venous plasma (n = 1,395 (50%); 16 studies), capillary whole blood dried on filter paper (n = 848 (29%); 5 studies), or venous whole blood dried on filter paper (n = 544 (19%); 2 studies). The coefficient of variation of the day 7 lumefantrine concentration (on a log scale) by study, after adjusting for mg/kg dose administered, was highest in capillary blood on filter paper, ranging from 43–240%, compared to 24–27% in venous blood on filter paper and 23–70% in venous plasma.

Hemoglobin was only associated independently with lumefantrine concentrations measured in capillary whole blood samples. For blood collected on filter paper, most assays (97%) had an LLOQ ≥ 25 ng/ml, while measurements in venous plasma were more sensitive (LLOQ ≤ 5 ng/ml for 56% of samples). For lumefantrine concentrations measured in capillary blood on filter paper, 8% were below the limit of quantification (BLQ), while only 1% of those in venous plasma or in venous blood on filter paper were BLQ. The majority of children under 5 years of age (59%) had lumefantrine concentrations measured in capillary blood, while these were measured in venous plasma for the majority of older patients (60%).

The exact time of the lumefantrine concentration sample collection was available in 384 (14%) patients, with a median of 166 (IQR = 16). Additional file 5: Figure S3 shows the distribution of measured concentrations by study.

### Lamictal XR [^112AhQ14]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Lamictal XR is indicated as adjunctive therapy for primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) and partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in patients aged 13 years and older. The safety and effectiveness of Lamictal XR for any use in patients younger than 13 years have not been established.

Immediate-release lamotrigine is indicated as adjunctive therapy in patients aged 2 years and older for partial-onset seizures, the generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and PGTC seizures. However, the safety and efficacy of immediate-release lamotrigine as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures were not demonstrated in a small, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal trial in very young pediatric patients (aged 1 to 24 months). Immediate-release lamotrigine was associated with an increased risk of infectious adverse reactions (lamotrigine 37%, placebo 5%) and respiratory adverse reactions (lamotrigine 26%, placebo 5%). Infectious adverse reactions included bronchiolitis, bronchitis, ear infection, eye infection, otitis externa, pharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and viral infection. Respiratory adverse reactions included nasal congestion, cough, and apnea.

- **Juvenile animal data**: In a juvenile animal study where lamotrigine (oral doses of 0, 5, 15, or 30 mg/kg) was administered to young rats from postnatal day 7 to 62, decreased viability and growth were seen at the highest dose tested. Long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as decreased locomotor activity, increased reactivity, and learning deficits in animals tested as adults, were also observed.

### Pharmacologic and dietary treatments for epilepsies in children aged 1–36 months: A systematic review [^113hR2Kx]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Our systematic review found limited evidence on the effectiveness and safety of pharmacologic and dietary treatments for epilepsies in children aged 1–36 months. Although we included studies assessing 10 antiseizure medications (ASMs): levetiracetam, topiramate, lamotrigine, phenytoin, vigabatrin, valproate, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, rufinamide, and stiripentol, evidence is sufficient only to permit conclusions for a single drug, levetiracetam (strength of evidence [SOE]: low). One study found that freedom from monotherapy failure was more likely with levetiracetam than with phenobarbital. Everolimus was on our list of included treatments, but no everolimus studies met inclusion criteria. Sodium channel blockers (included in the list above) were evaluated; however, the corresponding data did not exist, were not included, or were insufficient to permit conclusions.

### A clinical trial of enteral levetiracetam for acute seizures in pediatric cerebral malaria [^116LVzLi]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Mid-way through the study, the protocol was amended at the Safety Monitoring Committee's request based on interim data review. Although not statistically significant at that time, the data suggested an elevated risk of respiratory suppression in the phenobarbital (PB) exposed children, despite the limitations on pre-enrollment benzodiazepines. This potentially affected the findings in two ways: first, withholding treatment until additional seizures occurred in the PB but not the levetiracetam (LVT) group might have made the LVT treatment appear more efficacious than it would have been compared to PB if everyone in the PB comparison had actually received PB. As such, this study can only confirm that LVT is comparable to PB in efficacy when PB is given for ongoing seizures that fail to respond to benzodiazepines. This protocol change, directed by the Safety Monitoring Committee, may also have impacted the study findings by making PB appear "safer" than it actually is when given for repetitive but not continuous seizures, which makes the safety findings of this study even more notable.

We also identified some potential issues related to eLVT usage among children with mild renal compromise. Since similar adverse events (AEs) occurred in PB allocated children with elevated admission serum creatinine (SCr), modestly elevated admission creatinine is likely an indicator of underlying disease severity rather than high LVT concentrations causing AEs. In terms of efficacy, there was no difference between LVT and PB for the duration of seizures, seizure freedom, coma duration, neurologic sequelae, or death.

### Long-term effectiveness and safety of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in children and adolescents with refractory epilepsy: A real-world study [^111fNh7R]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric patients are more likely to suffer from epilepsy compared to adults, and it has been estimated that approximately 6 million pediatric patients in China suffer from epilepsy, leading to a prevalence of approximately 7 per 10,000 Chinese pediatric patients. Lacosamide (LCM), (R)-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxy-propionamide), is a third-generation antiseizure medication (ASM) approved by the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration. In China, LCM has been approved for the treatment of focal-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization in adults, adolescents, and pediatric patients from 4 years of age. This new indication has greatly accelerated the use of LCM in children and adolescents with epilepsy over 4 years of age, enabling physicians to use more therapies for the treatment of refractory epilepsy.

Clinical studies have indicated a favorable short- and long-term effectiveness, as well as tolerability of lacosamide. In regulatory randomized controlled trials conducted in adults, lacosamide has demonstrated to be an effective and safe ASM, with 40% of patients with refractory focal epilepsy achieving a 50% reduction in seizure frequency in a short period of time (3 months). The evidence of lacosamide effectiveness in Chinese pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy is scarce. Therefore, some pediatric clinicians have questioned whether LCM can be used as an add-on treatment for refractory epilepsy in children and adolescents over 4 years of age. As LCM was previously approved in China in 2018, the exploration of its long-term effectiveness and safety is critical.

### Perceptions and attitudes of pediatricians and families with regard to pediatric medication errors at home [^1147VKaZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Although most studies on pediatric medication errors at home focus on dose errors, the literature has shown that parents and/or caregivers also make other mistakes, such as incorrectly preparing or reconstituting the medication or administering the dose twice. Berthe-Aucejo et al. found that among parents and caregivers, risk factors for committing errors when administering medication to pediatric patients included being young, male, and non-native to their country of residence. A higher frequency of errors may also be associated with medical prescriptions that include more than two drugs and certain types of dosing devices. According to previous studies, analgesics are most commonly involved in pediatric medication errors at home.

To reduce the occurrence of these errors, it is necessary to promote the safe use of medication at home. One prevention strategy involves medication error reporting systems; however, as far as we know, no such system exists for the parents or caregivers of pediatric patients. Currently, there is a great deal of interest in how patients and families can report patient safety events and work with policymakers and healthcare professionals to improve patient safety. In fact, in the United States, as well as in other countries such as Finland and Norway, there are initiatives to create independent agencies that can receive reports on adverse events in patient safety, analyze data, identify patterns of harm risks, investigate, and establish prevention and recommendation strategies to prevent adverse events in the home, with a particular focus on medication errors.

### Evidence-based guideline: Treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children and adults: Report of the guideline committee of the American Epilepsy Society [^113z1Hc1]. Epilepsy Currents (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for status epilepticus, particularly in pediatric patients, the AES 2016 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to support the use of intranasal lorazepam, sublingual lorazepam, rectal lorazepam, valproic acid, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, or phenytoin as initial therapy in pediatric patients.

### Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of repeated doses of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for prevention and treatment of malaria: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1131y6cw]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) can cause dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval and is not recommended in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, which affects about one in 2500 children, or those taking other QT prolonging drugs. Numerous drugs, including multiple classes of antibiotics such as erythromycin, quinolones, co-trimoxazole, and antimalarials, can prolong the QT interval. Mild QT prolongation is clinically silent, but extreme prolongation can cause arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia occurring in roughly one of 10,000 exposures to QT prolonging drugs. Diagnosis of prolonged QT requires electrocardiograms (ECGs); the normal range differs for men and women, as well as children and adults. Few studies of DP have assessed ECGs.

- **Research in context**

- **Evidence before this study**: Malaria is a major, preventable cause of morbidity, mortality, and adverse birth outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa. Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) of malaria involves curative doses of antimalarials at predefined intervals irrespective of malaria infection status, serving as a strategy for the control of malaria in pregnant women, infants, and children within seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC). DP is an effective, well-tolerated antimalarial, and the long half-life of piperaquine makes DP an attractive choice for IPT. However, DP is known to cause dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval, and limited data exist on whether the risk of QT prolongation is increased with repeated dosing. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to establish the efficacy and…

### Dose-optimization of a novel co-formulated triple combination antimalarial therapy: Artemether-lumefantrine-amodiaquine [^111Lrutx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

To minimize the extent of modifications needed to combine two existing treatments, the dosing ratio of artemether-lumefantrine (20:120 mg) was retained, with the addition of 40 mg amodiaquine. The amodiaquine dose strength was chosen to generate a similar mg/kg/day dose of amodiaquine as seen with standard dosing of artesunate-amodiaquine in a typical adult patient. This drug-to-drug ratio (20:120:40 mg) was kept constant throughout the dosing bands to simplify manufacturing, implementation, and further development of a fixed-dose co-formulated product.

The standard four dosing bands were transformed into five dosing bands to achieve more equivalent exposure in all weight groups and to reduce fluctuations in peak concentrations. Furthermore, the proposed optimal weight-based dosing was constructed to achieve equivalent drug exposure to artemether-lumefantrine-amodiaquine in small children compared to adults, while ensuring that no patients received higher peak concentrations of amodiaquine compared to dose recommendations.

### Guidelines for specialized epilepsy centers: Executive summary of the report of the National Association of Epilepsy Centers Guideline Panel [^114hELDx]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

- **EMU protocols and safety**: EMU patients often have poorly controlled epilepsy and are at increased risk for status epilepticus and other adverse events. EMUs must be prepared to manage epilepsy-related emergencies with immediately available medications, equipment, and bedside providers or an emergency medical team. Centers with pediatric patients should have specific protocols addressing the medications and dosages used for children, and other pediatric resources, including child life specialists.

The EMU should be designed with seizure precautions and safety in mind. Risks of seizure-related falls and injuries increase with medication withdrawal or postictal agitation. The implementation of standardized protocols to guide safe ASM reduction, mitigate adverse events, and anticipate acute seizure management are widely recommended as essential safety measures. Yet, many centers lack relevant protocols, and practice varies significantly. Standardized seizure response protocols also increase information gained through EMU studies by encouraging consistent testing of speech, memory, motor function, and level of awareness during and following a seizure. Standardized admission order sets ensure that protocols are consistently applied and should include seizure precautions and safety measures for all patients, regardless of whether they suffer from epileptic seizures or nonepileptic events.

- **Communication and reporting**: Few epilepsy guidelines address the importance of communication and education. A 2012 expert consensus guideline from Schafer et al. recognized that communication with patients is crucial.

### Movement disorders secondary to novel antiseizure medications in pediatric populations: A systematic review and meta-analysis of risk [^1144gyE1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

The number of approved and marketed anti-seizure medications has drastically increased in recent years, providing more options than ever for managing epilepsy. Concomitant with this diversity, further guidance is necessary to aid clinicians and patients in the rational choice of treatments. The pharmacokinetic implications of the patient's age must also be considered when assessing the adverse event profile of a drug.

Many antiseizure medications exert their effect on GABAergic spiny projection neurons of the striatum as well as cholinergic and GABAergic interneurons. These, in addition to dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons, regulate the basal ganglia, and this connection may explain the mechanism of antiseizure medications treating and causing movement disorders.

The risk of movement disorders secondary to the use of older antiseizure medications in children has been studied. Valproic acid has been reported to cause tremor in a dose-dependent manner in 15% of children. Phenytoin and carbamazepine have also been shown to cause tremor in 14% and 1% of children, respectively. Ataxia is recognized as a complication of various antiseizure medications, including primidone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. Various other movement disorders have been reported in association with older antiseizure medications, including choreoathetosis, dystonia, and asterixis. Novel antiseizure medications are thought to be better tolerated than their conventional counterparts but have also been shown to cause movement disorders.

### Lyrica [^115RwsSh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The efficacy of Lyrica as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures was established in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in pediatric patients aged 4 to less than 17 years, with partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. During an 8-week baseline period, patients had to experience at least 6 partial-onset seizures with no seizure-free period exceeding 4 weeks. The mean duration of epilepsy was 6 years, and the mean and median baseline seizure frequencies were 57 and 18 seizures per month, respectively. Approximately 74% of the patients were taking 2 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (conAEDs) at baseline. Among the Lyrica-treated patients, 87% completed the double-blind phase of the study.

Lyrica at dosages of 2.5 mg/kg/day (maximum 150 mg/day) and 10 mg/kg/day (maximum 600 mg/day) were compared to placebo. The administration of each daily dose was divided into two equal doses (twice-daily dosing). Because of higher weight-normalized clearance in patients with body weight less than 30 kg, the Lyrica dose was increased by 40% to 3.5 mg/kg/day for patients weighing less than 30 kg randomized to the 2.5 mg/kg/day group or to 14 mg/kg/day for those randomized to the 10 mg/kg/day group.

Table 12 (not displayed here) illustrates median baseline seizure rates, median percent change from baseline in seizure rates, and percent difference relative to placebo, derived from the primary analysis model. There was evidence.

### Adjunctive perampanel oral suspension in pediatric patients from ≥ 2 to < 12 years of age with epilepsy: Pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy [^113UAGXg]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Selection of an antiepileptic drug for the treatment of pediatric patients with epilepsy has been a challenge for clinicians, largely due to the lack of published clinical studies reflecting efficacy and safety data in these patients. Age-related changes in body size and liver function (enzyme activity) in children mean that understanding pharmacokinetics, identifying appropriate antiepileptic drug dose levels, and avoiding potential adverse events (AEs) resulting from incorrect dosing constitute significant unmet clinical needs in this patient population, which suffers from epilepsy to a disproportionate degree.

The effects of age on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and dose requirements are not fully understood. However, it is known that, in general, pharmacokinetic processes in children can differ from those in adults, including absorption, metabolism, and excretion. For example, age can influence cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent hepatic metabolism, as the activity of these enzymes is different at birth compared with that in a developing child or adult. It has not been elucidated whether perampanel, a drug with a notably long half-life (approximately 105 hours) that is eliminated primarily via CYP3A4/5 hepatic metabolism, is influenced by age-related changes in liver function and CYP3A enzyme activity. In turn, this may impact dosing in children relative to achieving plasma concentrations shown to be effective. The present study, Study 232, is an open-label pilot study with an extension phase. Study 232 was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of perampanel in this patient population.

### Neuroauditory toxicity of artemisinin combination therapies-have safety concerns been addressed [^112m1Mr5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

This review is the first comprehensive and systematic exploration of specific human neuroauditory safety concerns associated with artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria since these concerns were initially raised a decade ago. Unfortunately, it reveals a lack of collective effort to systematically obtain the necessary safety data, despite ACTs becoming some of the most widely used drugs in Africa over the past decade.

The review emphasizes the technical challenges involved in accurately determining these specific safety concerns. More importantly, it questions whether the scientific community has neglected its responsibility to conduct ongoing, targeted assessments of the safety of widely used antimalarials in real-world settings during the post-marketing period. Most studies aimed to assess the efficacy and general safety of a single exposure; only 15 studies focused on specific neuroauditory and/or general neurological safety outcomes.

The absence of a standardized approach to monitoring drug adverse events has hindered the ability to compare data collected from different studies, thereby preventing any meaningful meta-analysis. While systematic assessments for adverse events in efficacy-safety studies generally adhered to the International Conference of Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, these did not concentrate on system-specific adverse events and could not rule out neuroauditory toxicity of ACTs in humans. The reviewed studies examining both multiple and single exposures to ACTs identified some changes in hearing assessment.

### Comparison of artesunate-mefloquine and artemether-lumefantrine fixed-dose combinations for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children younger than 5 years in sub-Saharan Africa: a randomised, multicentre, phase 4 trial [^116ydArg]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends combinations of an artemisinin derivative plus an antimalarial drug with a longer half-life as treatment options for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection. In Africa, artemether–lumefantrine is the most widely used artemisinin-based combination therapy. Artesunate–mefloquine is used infrequently due to perceived poor tolerance to mefloquine. WHO recommends reconsidering the use of artesunate–mefloquine in Africa. We compared the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose artesunate–mefloquine with artemether–lumefantrine for treating children under 5 years with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.

We conducted this multicentre, phase 4, open-label, non-inferiority trial in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Tanzania. Children aged 6–59 months with uncomplicated malaria were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation list, to receive a 3-day treatment. They received either one or two artesunate–mefloquine tablets (25 mg artesunate and 55 mg mefloquine) once a day or one or two artemether–lumefantrine tablets (20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine) twice a day. Parasitological assessments were performed independently by two microscopists who were blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the PCR-corrected rate of adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 63 in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority was established if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between groups was greater than −5%. Early vomiting was monitored, and neuropsychiatric status was assessed regularly.

### Tolerability and efficacy of a pediatric granule formulation of artesunate-mefloquine in young children from Cameroon with uncomplicated falciparum malaria [^112epyNj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Study site**: The study was conducted between December 2007 and March 2009 in Yaoundé, Cameroon, where malaria transmission is intense and perennial. Patients with microscopically confirmed acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were recruited from the peri-urban area of Yaoundé.

- **Study population**: Male or female children presenting with signs and symptoms of malaria were screened for study eligibility. Inclusion criteria were body weight between 10 and 20 kg, fever (temperature ≥ 37.5°C axillary or ≥ 38°C orally, rectally, or tympanically) or history of fever in the preceding 24 hours, P. falciparum malaria with a density between 2,000/μL (amended to 1,000/μL) and 250,000/μL blood, ability to take drugs by mouth and to comply with the study protocol, and provision of written informed consent by the parent or guardian. Exclusion criteria included presence of severe and complicated malaria (e.g. cerebral malaria) as defined by WHO, history of serious side effects related to artesunate-mefloquine or similar drugs, use of antimalarial drugs or any other agent with antimalarial activity within the previous week, ingestion of mefloquine within the previous 30 days, serious underlying disease, presence of severe vomiting or diarrhea, history of epilepsy, convulsion, or splenectomy, and need for parenteral treatment.

Before enrollment, written informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of the child. The trial protocol was approved by the National Ethics Committee, Yaoundé, Cameroon, and the Ethics Committee of the Technical University of Dresden.

### Lyrica [^117PrDpF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Lyrica as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures was established in a 14-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. This study involved children from 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization. The youngest patient evaluated was 3 months old. During a 48- to 72-hour baseline video electroencephalogram (EEG), patients had to experience at least two partial-onset seizures. At baseline, the mean duration of epilepsy was 1.6 years, and the mean and median baseline seizure frequencies were 12.2 and 4.4 seizures per day, respectively. Approximately 33%, 50%, and 17% of patients were taking one, two, or three concomitant antiepileptic drugs (conAEDs) at baseline, respectively. Among the Lyrica-treated patients, 97% completed the double-blind phase of the study.

In this study, Lyrica at doses of 7 mg/kg/day and 14 mg/kg/day was compared to placebo. Each daily dose was administered in three equal doses (three times a day). The primary endpoint was the 24-hour partial-onset seizure rate, based on the comparison of the baseline video EEG and a repeated 48–72 hour video EEG performed at the end of the 14 days of double-blind treatment.

A significant improvement in the partial-onset seizure rate was observed for the Lyrica 14 mg/kg/day group compared to placebo.

### Meta-analysis of drug efficacy in adult vs pediatric trials of patients with PGTC seizures [^112QSP28]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

It is difficult to perform randomized, placebo-controlled add-on trials in children with antiseizure drugs that are already approved for use in adults. Concerns have been raised about young children potentially being randomized to receive add-on placebo, thereby continuing to experience life-threatening seizures for many months, rather than seeking effective available therapy. There is an urgent need to provide safety and pharmacokinetics data in younger children, while protecting them from possibly unnecessary trials to re-demonstrate efficacy that has already been demonstrated for the same seizure type in adults.

This meta-analysis was conducted in response to a regulatory request for perampanel, for which published data on efficacy in individuals with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures only exist for patients aged ≥ 12 years. From our extensive literature review, we found that lamotrigine and topiramate trials were the only eligible studies that could be separated by age to compare children aged ≤ 12 years with adolescents and adults aged > 12 years. We did not find any substantial differences in the reported efficacy of the administered drugs between children and adults in seven clinical trials, measured either by median percent reduction in seizure frequency from baseline or ≥ 50% responder rate. Although the number of clinical trials for PGTCS that met the criteria for this meta-analysis was limited, the findings presented are based on efficacy measures from well-controlled trials, most of which were conducted in both adults and children.

### Comparison of artesunate-mefloquine and artemether-lumefantrine fixed-dose combinations for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children younger than 5 years in sub-Saharan Africa: a randomised, multicentre, phase 4 trial [^117KbxjF]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Previously, studies conducted in populations of mixed ages in Senegal, Nigeria, Mali, and Kenya reported artesunate–mefloquine as effective and well-tolerated. These trials used a follow-up period of just 28 days, which might be too short to fully assess accurate cure rates and safety of artesunate–mefloquine due to mefloquine's slow elimination. The low deployment of artesunate–mefloquine in Africa might result from early vomiting and neuropsychiatric effects reported with mefloquine monotherapy, and also from the absence of a fixed-dose paediatric formulation.

In this study, we tested a fixed-dose artesunate–mefloquine tablet designed to optimize compliance with a 3-day combination treatment and to improve the tolerability of mefloquine by dividing the dose into three equal daily doses. We found that the fixed-dose artesunate–mefloquine tablet has a good safety profile, similar to that of artemether–lumefantrine, with a low risk of repeated early vomiting during the treatment period and a low incidence of neuropsychiatric adverse events, which were deemed unrelated to study treatment.

### Anticonvulsant medications in the pediatric emergency room and intensive care unit [^112dUFU8]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Seizures are common in pediatric emergency care units, either as the main medical issue or in association with an additional neurological problem. Rapid treatment of prolonged and repetitive seizures or status epilepticus is important. Multiple anticonvulsant medications are useful in this setting, and each has various indications and potential adverse effects that must be considered in regard to individual patients. This review discusses new data regarding anticonvulsants that are useful in these settings, including fosphenytoin, valproic acid, levetiracetam, and topiramate.

- **Status epilepticus treatment algorithm**: A status epilepticus treatment algorithm is suggested, incorporating changes from traditional algorithms based on these new data.

- **Treatment issues specific to complex medical patients**: This includes patients with brain tumors, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, transplant, congenital heart disease, and anticoagulation.

### Topamax [^116TqKdd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established for adjunctive therapy treatment of partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigational trial, the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topiramate oral liquid and sprinkle formulations as an adjunct to antiepileptic drug therapy in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age with refractory partial-onset seizures were assessed. After 20 days of double-blind treatment, topiramate (at fixed doses of 5, 15, and 25 mg/kg/day) did not demonstrate efficacy compared with placebo in controlling seizures.

In general, the adverse reaction profile for Topamax in this population was similar to that of older pediatric patients. However, results from the above controlled study and an open-label, long-term extension study in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months old suggested some adverse reactions/toxicities. These were not previously observed in older pediatric patients and adults, including growth/length retardation, certain clinical laboratory abnormalities, and other adverse reactions/toxicities that occurred with greater frequency and/or severity than had been recognized previously from studies in older pediatric patients or adults for various indications.

### The German guidelines for medication safety in pediatric emergencies [^111zT8SL]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). High credibility.

Medication errors pose a significant threat to patient safety across all age groups. These errors are more prevalent in children than adults due to age-specific drug dosages, drug dilutions, and individual dose calculations based on body weight. Additionally, during emergencies, it may be necessary to rapidly administer several potentially harmful or even life-threatening drugs. The lack of specialized pediatric emergency teams for every prehospital or intra-hospital emergency, along with the use of technical resources that often do not match those of specialized facilities, further increases the risk of medication errors.

This narrative review of the German guidelines for medication safety in pediatric emergencies introduces the main principles for ensuring safe medication practices in pediatric emergencies. The guidelines also highlight the most important pragmatic measures and recommendations for enhancing medication safety in these critically sensitive situations.

The characteristics of the seven trials eligible for quantitative analysis in adolescents and adults, as well as children aged 2–12 years, are presented without the original table. All trials focused on the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) and included four studies with lamotrigine (LTG), one with perampanel, and two with topiramate (TPM). The trials were distributed as follows: two in adults, two in adults and adolescents (12–16 years of age), two in adults and children, and one in adolescents and children (2–12 years of age). The detailed summaries of individual trials are available in text e-2.

### The effect of dose on the antimalarial efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine: A systematic review and pooled analysis of individual patient data [^111BwpHt]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Artemether-lumefantrine is the most widely used artemisinin-based combination therapy for malaria, although treatment failures occur in some regions. We investigated the effect of dosing strategy on efficacy in a pooled analysis from trials conducted in a wide range of malaria-endemic settings.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed for clinical trials that enrolled and treated patients with artemether-lumefantrine and were published from 1960 to December 2012. We merged individual patient data from these trials using standardized methods. The primary endpoint was the PCR-adjusted risk of Plasmodium falciparum recrudescence by day 28. Secondary endpoints consisted of the PCR-adjusted risk of P. falciparum recurrence by day 42, PCR-unadjusted risk of P. falciparum recurrence by day 42, early parasite clearance, and gametocyte carriage. Risk factors for PCR-adjusted recrudescence were identified using Cox's regression model with frailty shared across the study sites.

- **Findings**: We included 61 studies conducted between January 1998 and December 2012, involving 14,327 patients in our analyses. The PCR-adjusted therapeutic efficacy was 97.6% (95% CI 97.4–97.9) at day 28 and 96.0% (95% CI 95.6–96.5) at day 42. After controlling for age and parasitaemia, patients prescribed a higher dose of artemether had a lower risk of parasitaemia on day 1 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.99 for every 1 mg/kg increase in daily artemether dose; p = 0.024), but not on day 2 (p = 0.69) or day 3 (p = 0.087). In Asia, children weighing 10–15 kg who received a total lumefantrine dose less than…

### Qudexyxr [^1148YD7R]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effectiveness of topiramate as initial monotherapy in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with partial-onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dose-controlled, parallel-group trial (Study 1).

Study 1 was conducted with 487 patients diagnosed with epilepsy, ranging from 6 to 83 years of age, who had 1 or 2 well-documented seizures during the 3-month retrospective baseline phase. These patients then entered the study and received topiramate 25 mg/day for 7 days in an open-label fashion. Forty-nine percent of subjects had no prior AED treatment, and 17% had a diagnosis of epilepsy for more than 24 months. Any AED therapy used for temporary or emergency purposes was discontinued prior to randomization. In the double-blind phase, 470 patients were randomized to titrate up to 50 mg/day or 400 mg/day of topiramate. If the target dose could not be achieved, patients were maintained on the maximum tolerated dose. Fifty-eight percent of patients achieved the maximal dose of 400 mg/day for more than two weeks, and patients who did not tolerate 150 mg/day were discontinued.

The primary efficacy assessment was a between-group comparison of time to first seizure during the double-blind phase. Comparison of the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for time to first seizure favored the topiramate 400 mg/day group over the topiramate 50 mg/day group. The treatment effects with respect to time to first seizure were consistent across various patient subgroups defined by age.

### A randomized trial of artesunate mefloquine versus artemether lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Senegalese children [^115NMyLi]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). High credibility.

An open randomized clinical trial study was carried out to compare the efficacy and tolerability of artesunate mefloquine 25 mg/kg body weight (Artequin paediatric) versus artemether lumefantrine (Coartem) in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children. In each arm, 160 patients were assigned to receive either AS + MQ or AL with 28 days of follow-up. The adequate clinical and parasitological response at Day 28 for per protocol analysis, after polymerase chain reaction correction, was 100% for AS + MQ and 96.8% for AL. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the respective cure rates were 96.2% for AS + MQ and 93.7% for AL. No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. The most frequent AE was vomiting, occurring in 30% of the AS + MQ arm and 36% of the AL arm. No biologically significant abnormal values related to the study drug have been reported. The new pediatric artesunate mefloquine formulated in a granule fixed-dose combination is well adapted for children in Africa.

### Monotherapy in children and infants [^115MAyid]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

An expanding array of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is available to treat childhood epilepsy, offering the potential for improved seizure control and quality of life in this important patient population. However, it also provides challenges in selecting the best regimen for the individual patient. In addition to the correct diagnosis of seizure type and the general AED efficacy profile, other important treatment considerations in pediatric patients include age-specific organ toxicity, potential cognitive and behavioral or psychiatric effects of AEDs, compliance, and drug-drug interactions, since children commonly receive more medications than nonelderly adults.

Drug dosing may be more difficult in pediatric than in adult epilepsy patients, and doses in children often require adjustment as the patient matures. Because many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of newer AEDs have not included childhood epilepsy, physicians often have incomplete data on which to base treatment decisions. Therefore, despite the wider array of potential therapies, it is often unclear how to realize the potential they offer. Recently published guidelines from a number of organizations have provided strategies for the use of new AEDs in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. Additional RCTs of monotherapy options for childhood epilepsy are greatly needed. The ketogenic diet provides an alternative to pharmacologic control of seizures in some pediatric patients.

### Movement disorders secondary to novel antiseizure medications in pediatric populations: A systematic review and meta-analysis of risk [^114URp5q]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Method - **Protocol**: A protocol was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting harms, with consultation from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and Interventions in best practice for producing and disseminating a protocol. The study protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework. Ethics committee approval was not sought for this study as per the Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of pediatric populations in which a novel antiseizure medication was used and where adverse events were reported quantitatively. Studies were excluded if (1) the mean or median participant age was greater than 19 years unless a pediatric subgroup analysis was performed, (2) the study was not published in English, and (3) the study was not performed on humans. For the purpose of this review, novel antiseizure medications included lacosamide, perampanel, eslicarbazepine, rufinamide, fenfluramine, cannabidiol, cannabidiol with low-dose tetrahydrocannabinol (≥ 20:1), and brivaracetam. These antiseizure medications were selected as they have most recently entered clinical practice in our region; a review of adverse events was consequently deemed very timely.

- **Search strategy**: We searched for randomized controlled trials meeting our criteria in two bibliographic databases, MEDLINE and EMBASE, supplemented by a search for unpublished studies through the World Health Organization.

### Meta-analysis of drug efficacy in adult vs pediatric trials of patients with PGTC seizures [^113pcyV4]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

The confidence bounds across clinical trials for a ≥ 50% responder rate in seizure frequency were comparable between adults and children. The proportional analysis of ≥ 50% responder rates based on risk ratio and odds ratio (OR) by study, and estimated risk ratio by patient subgroup, are presented in figure 2, figure e-1C, figure e-3, and figure e-1D, respectively. The efficacy comparisons of estimated OR for a ≥ 50% responder rate by patient subgroup are shown in figure e-4. Figures e-1C and e-3 show the estimated risk ratios and ORs between the drug group and placebo group from the ≥ 50% responder rates in the pediatric population. These were consistently in favor of the drug group across trials and were very similar to the ≥ 50% responder rates seen in the adult population. Furthermore, the estimated risk ratios for each patient subgroup in figure e-1D are comparable among the adult, adult plus children, and children subgroups in these studies, as evidenced by overlapping confidence intervals (CIs). The wide 95% CI for the children's subgroup is due to a small sample size (n = 8 for the drug group and n = 12 for the placebo group).

Sensitivity analyses for the median percent change in reduction of seizure frequency, related to the assumption of a common standard deviation (SD), further demonstrate similar results across studies in the adult, adult plus children, and children subgroups using three SD values between 0.69 and 1.06 (figures e-5, 6).

### Using the new antiepilepsy drugs in children [^112AEeWf]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

New epilepsy treatment options are becoming available to physicians and may help provide safe and effective seizure management in patients for whom traditional drug therapies have been unsuccessful. Presented here is a brief discussion on the screening models used to test drugs for efficacy against various seizure types and the mechanisms of action and pharmacology of antiepilepsy drugs. This is followed by a more detailed review of the clinical pharmacology of the latest three antiepilepsy drugs introduced in the United States: levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and zonisamide. All three appear to have advantages over some traditional antiepilepsy drugs, and with more clinical experience, may replace them in certain seizure types or epilepsy syndromes.

### Meta-analysis of drug efficacy in adult vs pediatric trials of patients with PGTC seizures [^1115oT9L]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

A meta-analysis of published studies was performed to determine whether the efficacy of antiseizure drugs in adults with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) is comparable with that in the pediatric population (2–12 years of age).

- **Methods**: Electronic searches were conducted in EMBASE, Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for clinical trials of PGTCS in adults and children 2–12 years of age. Neurologists used standardized search and study evaluations to select eligible trials. Median percent reduction in seizure frequency from baseline and ≥ 50% responder rates were used to compare drug efficacy in adults and children.

- **Results**: Among 7 adjunctive-therapy PGTCS trials in adults and children (2–12 years of age) that met evaluation criteria, effect sizes were consistent between adults and children for lamotrigine and topiramate. The baseline-subtracted median percent seizure reduction in seizure frequency ranged from 50.0% to 79.7% in children and 57.0% to 64.0% in adults. The ≥ 50% responder rate was similar between children and adults in a topiramate study (50% in children compared with 58% in adults).

- **Conclusions**: This meta-analysis supports the use of drug response from antiseizure drug clinical trials for PGTCS in adults to predict comparable treatment response in children 2–12 years of age with PGTCS.

### Coartem [^111DfD5p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage in pediatric patients**: A 3-day treatment schedule with a total of 6 doses is recommended as follows:

	- 5 kg to less than 15 kg body weight: One tablet as an initial dose, 1 tablet again after 8 hours, and then 1 tablet twice daily (morning and evening) for the following 2 days (total course of 6 tablets).

	- 15 kg to less than 25 kg body weight: Two tablets as an initial dose, 2 tablets again after 8 hours, and then 2 tablets twice daily (morning and evening) for the following 2 days (total course of 12 tablets).

	- 25 kg to less than 35 kg body weight: Three tablets as an initial dose, 3 tablets again after 8 hours, and then 3 tablets twice daily (morning and evening) for the following 2 days (total course of 18 tablets).

	- 35 kg body weight and above: Four tablets as an initial dose, 4 tablets again after 8 hours, and then 4 tablets twice daily (morning and evening) for the following 2 days (total course of 24 tablets).

- **Dosage in patients with hepatic or renal impairment**: No specific pharmacokinetic studies have been carried out in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Most patients with acute malaria present with some degree of related hepatic and/or renal impairment. In clinical studies, the adverse event profile did not differ in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. No specific dose adjustments are needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In clinical studies, the adverse event profile did not differ in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared.

### Neuroauditory toxicity of artemisinin combination therapies-have safety concerns been addressed [^114XwWW1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Although artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are widely viewed as safe drugs with a wide therapeutic dose range, concerns about the neuroauditory safety of artemisinins arose during their development. A decade ago, reviews of human data suggested a potential neuro-ototoxic effect, but the validity of these findings was questioned. With 5–10 years of programmatic use, emerging artemisinin-tolerant falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia, and the first calls to consider an increased dose of artemisinins, we review neuroauditory safety data on ACTs to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria.

Fifteen studies reported a neurological or auditory assessment. The large heterogeneity of neuro-ototoxic endpoints and assessment methodologies and the descriptive nature of assessments hampered a formal meta-analysis and definitive conclusions, but they highlight the persistent lack of data from young children. This subgroup is potentially most vulnerable to any neuroauditory toxicity because of their developmental stage, increased malaria susceptibility, and repeated ACT exposure in settings lacking robust safety monitoring.

### Efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in epileptic children younger than 4 years [^114n2jm7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Rufinamide, a triazole derivative, is a new-generation antiseizure medication with a novel mechanism of action. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of rufinamide treatment in children with epilepsy younger than 4 years at our center.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective study, we included children younger than 4 years who had pharmacologically resistant epilepsy and were treated with rufinamide at Boston Children's Hospital between June 2010 and June 2018. Safety and efficacy of rufinamide treatment were assessed immediately prior to initiation of rufinamide and at the last follow-up visit. Responders were defined as patients who had greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency on follow-up as compared to baseline.

- **Results**: We reviewed records of 128 children and included 103 with complete information. Patients consisted of 60 boys (58%), with a median age of 20 months (interquartile range 13–28, range 2–36). Median treatment duration was 15 months, and median rufinamide dosage at the last follow-up was 42 mg/kg/d (interquartile range 34–56). At the last follow-up, seizure frequency decreased (450 vs 90, P < 0.001) and overall seizure reduction was 54%. Fifty-one patients (49.5%) were responders with 94% seizure reduction, including 20 (19.4%) who achieved seizure freedom. Treatment retention rate at 12 months was 63%. Thirty patients (29%) developed adverse events, and 41 patients (39.8%) discontinued rufinamide because of adverse events (15; 14.5%) and lack of efficacy (26; 25%).

- **Conclusion**: Rufinamide is effective in reducing seizure frequency in pediatric epilepsy.

### Risk reduction for adverse drug events through sequential implementation of patient safety initiatives in a children's hospital [^112d9usV]. Pediatrics (2006). High credibility.

Medication management is a complex, multifaceted system. Prescribing errors occur upstream in the process, and as such, their effects can be perpetuated, and sometimes even exacerbated, in subsequent steps. These errors place patients at risk of adverse drug events. Children, especially young infants, are at particular risk because of their size, unique physiology, and immature ability to metabolize drugs.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to reduce the risk of harm to children resulting from prescribing errors.

- **Methods**: We sequentially implemented patient safety initiatives over a 1-year time frame at a pediatric tertiary care academic facility. The initiatives included an educational website with competency examination, distribution of a personal digital assistant-based standardized dosing reference, a zero-tolerance policy for incomplete or incorrect medication orders, prescriber performance feedback, and presentation of outcome data at citywide grand rounds. A total of 8,718 orders were collected and analyzed to assess the impact of these initiatives.

- **Results**: The absolute risk reduction from prescribing errors was 38 per 100 orders, with a relative risk reduction of 49%. Web-based education with point-of-care drug references and a zero-tolerance policy for incomplete or incorrect orders were most effective in decreasing potential adverse drug events. Documentation of appropriate weight-based dosing and indication for therapy increased by 24% and 42%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Process-improvement initiatives focusing on prescriber education and process adherence are essential in reducing adverse drug events in pediatric patients.

### Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of acute, uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria: a pooled analysis [^1128W9NP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

The main efficacy variable was the 28-day PCR-corrected parasitologic cure rate, defined as the proportion of patients with clearance of asexual parasitemia within 7 days of the first dose of AL and without subsequent recrudescence within 28 days. Recrudescence was defined as the reappearance of the original parasite strain as confirmed by PCR-based genotyping. Other efficacy endpoints included the 28-day non–PCR-corrected parasitologic cure rate, time to parasite clearance, time to fever clearance, and the proportion of patients with gametocytes at specific time points. The assessment times for parasite clearance and fever clearance varied between studies. The presence of gametocytes was recorded at baseline, > 0–72 hours, > 72 hours–day 7, and > day 7.

Safety data encompassed the incidence, type, and study drug relationship of adverse events. Adverse events were defined as the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition after starting the study drug, regardless of their relation to the study drug, according to the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines. A serious adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or was a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Other safety data included the incidence of death and serious adverse events, clinical laboratory assessments, and vital signs.

### A modified Delphi to define drug dosing errors in pediatric critical care [^111Hr5RB]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

We evaluated 15 above and below dosing error thresholds (N = 30 error thresholds). Consensus was achieved for 23 thresholds: 12 under-dose error thresholds and 11 over-dose error thresholds. Progression of the consensus over three rounds is presented in Figure 1. Where consensus was achieved, expert providers agreed for most medication categories and clinical scenarios that dosing over or below 10% of the reference range was considered an error (category 11–20% was an error). The results of the error thresholds are presented in Table 3.

- **Table 3: Proportion below and above reference range dosing that expert participants would consider a dosing error, and proportion of consensus agreement**

- **Assume moderate infection, normal hepatic function and normal BMI**. No drug levels yet.
- **Renal dosing adjustment with Creatinine 2x normal. No drug levels yet**.

	- N = 20 suggested > 20% for upper threshold, and N = 12 suggested > 10%, N = 4 blank. N total = 36.
	- N = 19 suggested > 10% for upper threshold, and N = 7 suggested > 10%, N = 5 > 50%. N total = 36.
	- N = 6 would not give drug at all. For overdosing, N = 22 (58%) answered 1–10%, N = 7 (18%) answered > 10%, N = 1 answered > 20%, N = 1 blank.

### Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine dispersible tablets compared with crushed commercial tablets in African infants and children with uncomplicated malaria: a randomised, single-blind, multicentre trial [^116bQGWe]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Combination treatments, preferably containing an artemisinin derivative, are recommended to improve efficacy and prevent *Plasmodium falciparum* drug resistance. Our aim was to show the non-inferiority of a new dispersible formulation of artemether-lumefantrine compared to the conventional crushed tablet in the treatment of young children with uncomplicated malaria.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised non-inferiority study on children weighing 5–35 kg with uncomplicated *P. falciparum* malaria in Benin, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, and Tanzania. The primary outcome measure was the PCR-corrected 28-day parasitological cure rate. We aimed to demonstrate non-inferiority, with a margin of -5%, of the dispersible versus crushed tablet. An asymptotic one-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) was constructed on the difference in cure rates. A computer-generated randomisation list was centrally maintained, and investigators were blinded to the study medication administered. A modified intention-to-treat analysis was used. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00386763.

- **Findings**: A total of 899 children aged 12 years or younger were randomly assigned to receive either dispersible (n = 447) or crushed tablets (n = 452). More than 85% of patients in each treatment group completed the study. A total of 812 children qualified for the modified intention-to-treat analysis (n = 403 for dispersible vs n = 409 for crushed). The PCR-corrected day-28 cure rate was 97.8% (95% CI: 96.3% to 99.2%) in the dispersible formulation group and 98.5% (95% CI: 97.4% to 99.7%) in the crushed formulation group. The lower bound of the one-sided 97.5% CI was -2.7%. The most common drug-related adverse event was vomiting.

### Mefloquine hydrochloride [^113xV7ny]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Use of mefloquine to treat acute, uncomplicated *P. falciparum* malaria in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, alongside additional data from published open-label and comparative trials. These trials involve the use of mefloquine to treat malaria caused by *P. falciparum* in patients younger than 16 years of age. However, the safety and effectiveness of mefloquine for treating malaria in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established.

In several studies, the administration of mefloquine for malaria treatment was associated with early vomiting in pediatric patients. Some reports have cited early vomiting as a potential cause of treatment failure. If a second dose is not tolerated, the patient should be monitored closely, and alternative malaria treatment should be considered if there is no improvement within a reasonable period of time [see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION].

Clinical studies of mefloquine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Existing clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. Since electrocardiographic abnormalities have been observed in individuals treated with mefloquine [see PRECAUTIONS], and underlying cardiac disease is more prevalent in elderly patients compared to younger ones, the benefits of mefloquine therapy should be carefully weighed against the possibility of adverse cardiac effects in elderly patients.

### Adjunctive perampanel oral suspension in pediatric patients from ≥ 2 to < 12 years of age with epilepsy: Pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy [^113hwTir]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

A responder is a patient who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days from baseline (i.e. pretreatment phase plus 4 weeks prior to visit 1).

Seizure freedom is only defined for patients who completed the time interval (e.g. week 1–13 seizure freedom only includes patients who completed week 13).

- **Responder rate**: From week 1 through each successive 13-week interval, the responder rate was higher in cohort 2 than in cohort 1 for overall seizures, as well as for focal and generalized seizures.

- **Seizure freedom**: Overall seizure freedom was higher in cohort 1 than in cohort 2 for all 13-week intervals. By weeks 40–52, seizure freedom for overall seizures was achieved in 36.4% (n = 4) of patients in cohort 1 and 27.3% (n = 3) of patients in cohort 2.

### Randomized, prospective, three-arm study to confirm the auditory safety and efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine in Colombian patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria [^112U7m7q]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

The safety of artemether-lumefantrine in patients with acute, uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria was investigated prospectively using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and pure-tone thresholds. Secondary outcomes included polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1:1 ratio to either artemether-lumefantrine (N = 159), atovaquone-proguanil (N = 53), or artesunate-mefloquine (N = 53).

The null hypothesis (primary outcome), claiming that the percentage of patients with a baseline to Day-7 ABR Wave III latency increase of > 0.30 msec is ≥ 15% after administration of artemether-lumefantrine, was rejected; 2.6% of patients (95% confidence interval: 0.7–6.6) exceeded 0.30 msec, which is significantly below 15%.

The secondary outcome, the polymerase chain reaction-corrected 28-day cure rate, was identical for each treatment group (100%). Kaplan-Meier estimated cure rates were similar: artemether-lumefantrine (97.5%), atovaquone-proguanil (98.1%), and artesunate-mefloquine (98.1%). However, one artemether-lumefantrine subject (3.1%) and one atovaquone-proguanil subject (3.2%) met definitions of treatment failures. No patients with recurrent infection developed markers of artemisinin or lumefantrine resistance. Treatment was generally well tolerated and supported the continued safe and efficacious use of artemether-lumefantrine in uncomplicated falciparum malaria.

### Keppra [^113vqvSb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Keppra for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 5), conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG, were randomized to receive either Keppra or placebo. The enrolled population included 116 patients (Keppra N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized.

Randomization was stratified by age range as follows:

- **1 month to less than 6 months of age**: (N = 4 treated with Keppra)
- **6 months to less than 1 year of age**: (N = 8 treated with Keppra)
- **1 year to less than 2 years of age**: (N = 20 treated with Keppra)
- **2 years to less than 4 years of age**: (N = 28 treated with Keppra).

The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Keppra dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 5…

### Adjunctive perampanel oral suspension in pediatric patients from ≥ 2 to < 12 years of age with epilepsy: Pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy [^112pPhVa]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetic data set included a total of 845 plasma perampanel observations from 194 patients (maintenance period of Study 232: 83 observations from 42 patients; Studies 235, 304, 305, and 306: 762 observations from 152 adolescent patients). A summary of demographic variables and additional covariates for these patients is presented in Supplementary Table S2.

Among these patients, 45.9% were receiving concomitant EIAEDs, all of which exhibited statistically significant and clinically relevant effects on perampanel CL/F by factors of 2.57 for carbamazepine and 1.90 for oxcarbazepine/phenytoin. These findings are consistent with previous population-based analyses of perampanel pharmacokinetic properties in both adolescents and adults.

The pharmacokinetic profile of perampanel was independent of both dose and time, and was not significantly affected by age, weight, gender, race (Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian), alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase levels, creatinine clearance, formulation, or coadministration of other non-EIAEDs (i.e. valproic acid, lamotrigine, topiramate, or levetiracetam).

### Vimpat [^113HfGji]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety of Vimpat injection was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label study of 103 pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years with epilepsy. Infusions were primarily administered over a 30 to 60-minute period; infusion times less than 30 minutes were not adequately studied in pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Although no serious or severe adverse reactions were noted at the time of infusion in this small study, the adverse reactions associated with Vimpat injection in pediatric patients are expected to be similar to those noted in adults.

In a retrospective cohort study of electronic healthcare records of 686 pediatric patients who began Vimpat with intravenous dosing, the incidence of rash within 30 days of discontinuation of intravenous Vimpat was two-fold higher in the cohort of patients who were initiated with the alternate initial dosing regimen to achieve the maintenance dosage in a shorter timeframe [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] compared to the cohort of patients who were initiated with a lower initial dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Vimpat. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

	- **Blood and lymphatic system disorders**: Agranulocytosis

### Adjunctive perampanel oral suspension in pediatric patients from ≥ 2 to < 12 years of age with epilepsy: Pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy [^114AHzxk]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Study 232 (identifier: NCT01527006) was conducted between January 2012 and May 2014 at 15 sites in North America. The extension phase was conducted between January 2012 and February 2015 at 14 sites in North America. Study 232 was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)-E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice CPMP/ICH/135/95, and the US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21. The trial protocol, amendments, and informed consent were reviewed by independent ethics committees (IECs) or institutional review boards (IRBs) for each site. A full list of participating IECs and IRBs can be found in Supplementary Table S1. Before trial participation, written informed consent was received from a parent/legal guardian for each young person participating in this study; for patients aged ≥ 7 years, written or verbal assent, or equivalent, was obtained from the patient.

- **Patients**: Patients included in Study 232 were aged ≥ 2 to < 12 years at the time of study entry, had a diagnosis of epilepsy with any type of seizure at least 6 months prior to visit 1 based on clinical history and electroencephalography, had experienced at least 1 seizure during the 4 weeks prior to visit 1, and were on a stable dose of 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs for ≥ 4 weeks before visit 1 and throughout the study. Patients were allowed a maximum of 3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs during the study; use of concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) was permitted.

### Adjunctive perampanel oral suspension in pediatric patients from ≥ 2 to < 12 years of age with epilepsy: Pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy [^113NWgAr]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

It should be noted that although a suspension rather than a tablet formulation of perampanel was given to the children participating in Study 232, the observed pharmacokinetic properties were not notably different from those of the perampanel tablet formulation administered to adolescents and adults participating in Studies 235, 304, 305, and 306. Since the completion of this study, the suspension formulation has been approved for adjunctive therapy for the treatment of focal seizures and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with epilepsy aged ≥ 12 years. The oral suspension was found to be bioequivalent and interchangeable with the tablet formulation.

Safety outcomes from the core and extension phases of Study 232 indicate that once-daily adjunctive therapy with perampanel oral suspension at daily doses up to 0.18 mg/kg was well tolerated over the entire duration of the study (up to 52 weeks) in pediatric patients (aged ≥ 2 to < 12 years) with epilepsy. The majority of serious adverse events and other significant events were transient and manageable, with patients recovering without sequelae. Additionally, the observed safety profile was similar between the two age cohorts. The Food and Drug Administration prescribing information for perampanel contains a boxed warning for serious psychiatric and behavioral reactions, including aggression, hostility, irritability, anger, and homicidal ideation, since these treatment-emergent adverse events have been previously reported in adult/adolescent patients treated with perampanel. During Study 232, treatment-emergent adv

### Keppra [^1175Yiy8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The adverse reaction data presented below were obtained from a pooled analysis of two controlled pediatric clinical studies in patients aged 4 to 16 years with partial-onset seizures. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients receiving Keppra in combination with other AEDs, where event rates were greater than those of the placebo group, included fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability.

- **Adverse reactions**: Table 5 lists adverse reactions from the pooled pediatric controlled studies (4 to 16 years of age) that occurred in at least 2% of Keppra-treated patients and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either Keppra or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

In the controlled pooled pediatric clinical studies involving patients aged 4–16 years, 7% of patients receiving Keppra and 9% receiving placebo discontinued due to an adverse reaction.

In the 7-day, controlled pediatric clinical study of children aged 1 month to less than 4 years with partial-onset seizures, the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving Keppra in combination with other AEDs, where event rates were higher than those of the placebo group, were somnolence and irritability. Due to the shorter exposure period, incidences of adverse reactions are expected to be lower than in studies with older pediatric patients. Therefore, additional controlled pediatric data presented above should also be considered applicable to this age group.

### Efficacy and effectiveness of artemether-lumefantrine after initial and repeated treatment in children < 5 years of age with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in rural Tanzania: a randomized trial [^112FV9j3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

We assessed the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of artemether-lumefantrine, which is the most widely used artemisinin-based combination therapy in Africa, against Plasmodium falciparum malaria during an extended follow-up period after initial and repeated treatments.

- **Methods**: We performed an open-label randomized trial of artemether-lumefantrine with supervised (n = 180) and unsupervised intake (n = 179) in children under 5 years of age with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in rural Tanzania. Reinfections between day 14 and day 56 were retreated within the same study arm. The main endpoints were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected cure rates by day 56 and day 42 after initial and repeated treatments, respectively, as estimated by survival analysis.

- **Results**: The PCR-corrected cure rate after initial treatment was 98.1% (95% confidence interval, 94.2%-99.4%) after supervised and 95.1% (95% CI, 90.7%-98.1%) after unsupervised intake (P = .29). After retreatment of reinfections, the cure rates were 92.9% (95% CI, 81.8%-97.3%) and 97.6% (95% CI, 89.3%-98.8%), respectively (P = .58). Reinfections occurred in 46.9% (82 of 175) versus 50.9% of the patients (relative risk [RR], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.74–1.14]; p = 0.46) after initial therapy and 32.4% (24 of 74) versus 39.0% (32 of 82) (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.54–1.27]; p = 0.39) after retreatment. Median blood lumefantrine concentrations in supervised and unsupervised patients on day 7 were 304 versus 194 ng/mL (p < 0.001) after initial treatment and 253 versus 164 ng/mL (P = .001) after retreatment. Vomiting was the most common adverse event.

### Adjunctive perampanel oral suspension in pediatric patients from ≥ 2 to < 12 years of age with epilepsy: Pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy [^115Javyh]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

During the core study, treatment-emergent adverse events related to hostility and/or aggression were reported in 9 (32.1%) patients in cohort 1 and 9 (40.9%) patients in cohort 2. This was evaluated using both narrow and broad Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ) terms.

- **Hostility and aggression**: The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were irritability and aggression. Irritability was reported in 5 patients (17.9%) from cohort 1 and 3 patients (13.6%) from cohort 2. Aggression was noted in 1 patient (3.6%) from cohort 1 and 3 patients (13.6%) from cohort 2. Two patients in cohort 1 had adverse events related to hostility and/or aggression that led to discontinuation. One experienced irritability and psychomotor hyperactivity, which were moderate in severity and probably related to the study drug. The other patient had a severe event of abnormal behavior possibly related to the study drug. Both patients recovered.

- **Dose reduction and resolution**: Two patients, one from each cohort, experienced irritability leading to dose reduction. Both instances were considered possibly related to the study drug. In cohort 1, the irritability was mild and did not resolve, whereas, in cohort 2, it was moderate and resolved. Additionally, one patient in cohort 2 experienced aggression that led to dose reduction; this event was moderate, probably related to the study drug, and resolved.

- **Suicidal ideation**: There was one patient in cohort 1 who experienced mild suicidal ideation during the titration phase.
