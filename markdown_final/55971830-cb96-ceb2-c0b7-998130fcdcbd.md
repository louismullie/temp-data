## Question

1. If an A4 sheet is precisely cut in half along a straight line parallel to the shorter side, two sheets are created that have the same shape as the original, i.e., they are obtained from it through a rotation and a reduction in scale. This year, we will say that a rectangular sheet is "contemporary" if, by cutting it into 2020 equal parts obtained with cuts parallel to its shorter side, 2020 rectangles are obtained that have the same shape as the initial one. If the shorter side of a contemporary sheet measures 1, how long is the other side?
(A) √2020
(B) 2020^(3/2)
(C) [2021/2]
(D) 2020
(E) None of the above

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the length of the longer side of a "contemporary" rectangular sheet, given that the shorter side is 1 and that cutting the sheet into 2020 equal rectangles parallel to the shorter side produces 2020 smaller rectangles that are similar in shape to the original. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "same shape" means mathematically in terms of aspect ratio. Then, I should verify how the original rectangle's dimensions relate to the dimensions of each smaller rectangle after division. Next, I will set up the similarity equation and solve for the unknown longer side. Finally, I will check the answer against the provided options and confirm there are no hidden pitfalls in the wording.

> Let me first confirm the key concept: "same shape" implies geometric similarity, which for rectangles means the aspect ratio is preserved. So if the original rectangle has width w and height h, each smaller rectangle after division must have the same width-to-height ratio as w/h, possibly rotated 90 degrees, but the ratio itself is invariant under rotation and scaling [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the cutting geometry. The problem states cuts are parallel to the shorter side, so if the shorter side is 1, the cuts run parallel to that side, dividing the longer side into 2020 equal segments. That means the new rectangles have the same height as the original (1 unit), but their width is the original longer side divided by 2020. So if the original longer side is L, each small rectangle has dimensions L/2020 by 1, and its aspect ratio is (L/2020)/1 = L/2020 [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the similarity condition. The small rectangles must have the same shape as the original, so their aspect ratio must equal the original aspect ratio. The original aspect ratio is L/1 = L, and the small rectangle's aspect ratio is L/2020. Setting these equal gives L/2020 = 1/L, because the small rectangle's shape matches the original's shape when rotated 90 degrees, which swaps width and height and inverts the ratio. Thus, L/2020 = 1/L implies L² = 2020, so L = √2020 [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the small rectangles might have the same orientation as the original, which would suggest L/2020 = L, but that would force L = 0, which is impossible. Let me reconsider: the only way the small rectangles can have the same shape as the original is if their aspect ratio matches the original's aspect ratio when appropriately oriented, which here requires L/2020 = 1/L, confirming L = √2020 [^notfound].

> I should double-check the answer choices. Option A is √2020, which matches our derivation. The other options either scale incorrectly with 2020 or introduce additive constants that don't satisfy the similarity constraint, so they can be ruled out. Therefore, the correct answer is A, √2020 [^notfound].

---

The answer is **√2020**. For the 2020 smaller rectangles to have the same shape as the original, their aspect ratio must match the original's. If the shorter side is 1 and the longer side is L, each small rectangle has dimensions 1 × (L/2020). Setting the aspect ratios equal gives L/1 = 1/(L/2020), so L² = 2020 and L = √2020.

---

## Step-by-step solution

Let the original rectangle have **shorter side = 1** and **longer side = L**. Cutting parallel to the shorter side divides the longer side into 2020 equal parts, so each small rectangle has dimensions 1 × (L/2020).

For the small rectangles to have the same shape as the original, their **aspect ratios must be equal**:

[longer side/shorter side] = [L/1] = [1/(L/2020)]

Solving for L:

L = [1/(L/2020)] implies L² = 2020 implies L = √2020

---

## Verification

Check the aspect ratio of the small rectangle: **(L/2020)/1 = √2020/2020 = 1/√2020**, which is the reciprocal of the original aspect ratio √2020/1. This confirms the shapes are the same under rotation and scaling.

---

## Conclusion

The other side of the contemporary sheet is **√2020**.

---

The correct answer is **(A) √2020**.

### A model for the fragmentation kinetics of crumpled thin sheets [^85895a60]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Thus far, we have established that an estimate of total crease length constructed from moments of the derived facet area and ridge length distributions shows consistency with the logarithmic scaling of Eq. (11). In the following section, we propose a simple mechanism for how the geometric incompatibility of a folded sheet and its confinement leads to further fragmentation, driving t forward. This argument establishes the evolution of t in accordance with n, and thus supplies the missing link to a physically based model that corroborates experimental findings.

One-dimensional model

To offer an explanation for the observed logarithmic scaling, we develop a simple one-dimensional model that proposes how additional fragments may form when a crumpled sheet is re-crumpled, relying on the statistical descriptions of facet area and segment length formulated in the previous sections. Our goal can be summarized by the following two questions: (1) Given its current state and prescribed confinement, with what probability does a sheet undergo further fragmentation? (2) How does this probability relate to the continuous variables in the fragmentation model of Eq. (1)? First, we appeal to the axial symmetry of our confinement to simplify our view of crumpling to a 1D strip of length L 0, as shown in Fig. 6. The strip is characterized by a sequence of folds in alternating directions which divide the strip into random segments. The lengths r of the segments, which are equal to the cross-sections of the intercepted facets, are distributed according to the derived gamma distribution of Eq. (10), weighted by the horizontal facet width, which increases the likelihood of a facet's occurrence within a randomly selected vertical strip. For facets of ~1:1 aspect ratio, the distribution of segment length is therebywith the average segment length given by (a + 1) θ. A comparison of Eq. (15) with experimental data is provided for a strongly compacted sample in Fig. 6 a, b, with extended results for all samples presented in Supplementary Fig. 5.

2.3 Tissue Preparation

Colonic tissue measuring 3 cm × 3 cm was transported to the laboratory in ice‐cold PBS solution within 2 h of surgery. We removed adipose tissue from the bowel wall. Colonic tissue is a flat rectangular thin sheet in an unstretched state. Measure and record the side length (length [L] and width [W]) of intestinal tissue separately, and calculate the surface area as the measurement value for each tissue in a relaxed (unstretched) state (Figure 1C). Tissue was mounted with insect pins in containers fitted with Sylgard 184 silicone rubber coating (Dow, Midland, MI), repeatedly stretched, and fixed along the edges. Measure and record the side length (length [L 0] and width [W 0]) of the colon tissue after stretching, and calculate the surface area as the measurement value of each tissue in the stretched state. The final stretching area is about 2.5 times that before stretching (Figure 1D). PBS solution was removed, and 4% paraformaldehyde was added overnight at 4°C. Replace 4% paraformaldehyde with PBS solution, and then remove the insect nail and cut off the full thickness of the colon tissue block (1 cm × 1 cm) for staining (Figure 1E).

2.4 Immunohistochemical Staining

Tissue blocks were rinsed with PBS solution (3 times × 5 min at room temperature), permeabilized with 100% methanol (1 h on ice), treated with Dent's bleach (2 h at room temperature) (Figure 1F), and then placed in blocking solution for pre‐incubation (70 rpm shaker, 3 days at 37°C). Then, they were incubated with the primary antibody (Table 1) on a shaker (70 rpm shaker, 14 days, 37°C). The tissues were then rinsed with PBS (2 × 2 h, 1× overnight), then incubated with the second antibody (Table 1) on a shaker (70 rpm shaker, 3 days, 37°C), dehydrated with successive graded methanol dilutions, and washed with benzylcarbinol‐benzyl benzoate (1:2) until the tissues appeared translucent (Figure 1G). Tissues were mounted on glass slides with benzyl alcohol‐benzyl benzoate for imaging (Figure 1H).

### A quantitative analysis of various patterns applied in lattice light sheet microscopy [^5ecc1523]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Real-space and frequency-space comparisons of Gaussian, multi-Bessel (MB)-square, and hexagonal lattice light sheets

We start our characterization by investigating 20 μm-long light sheets that are optimized for imaging adherent cells. We show the notation for the coordinate system used in the rest of the paper in Fig. 1a. We define beam length by the full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the intensity profile along the propagation direction y (Fig. 1b, c). We note that other metrics to describe propagation length such as those based on optical sectioningalso give similar results (Table S1 and Fig. S 1a). To quantify the optical sectioning of different light sheets, we also plot out both the excitation axial profile and the cumulative intensity along the axial direction at both the beam center and the propagation length FWHM (Fig. 1d, e). To start, we compared a 0.21 NA Gaussian beam, an MB-square lattice with NA = 0.35/0.25 (max and min NA respectively) and a hexagonal lattice with NA = 0.46/0.36. For Gaussian beams, there is a unique relationship between sigma, beam thickness, and propagation length. For MB-square and hexagonal lattice beams, beams of the same propagation length, but with different structure can be generated by tuning the difference between the min and max NA (∆NA), the attenuation envelope imposed at the sample plane (∆k z at the pupil), and the spacing of the MB-square Bessel array (∆k x at the pupil). The effect of these parameters for each beam type will be described in the following section. Here we kept a constant ∆NA of 0.1 for both MB-square and hexagonal lattice beams and chose an MB-square lattice spacing such that the side beamlets were just outside the inner bounding annulus, as had been done previously. Both MB-square and hexagonal lattices improved axial resolution compared to a Gaussian beam of the same propagation length (Fig. 1f, h) as measured by comparing the overall PSF axial FWHM (1.18λ for the hexagonal lattice, 1.62λ for MB-square lattice, and 1.83λ for Gaussian, Table S2). These differences became even more prominent when comparing overall PSFs away from the beam focus, for example at the propagation profile FWHM, which in this situation is 10 microns away from the beam focus (Fig. 1g, i). Axial FWHM of the overall PSFs at this location were 1.27λ for the hexagonal lattice, 1.6λ for the MB-square lattice and 2.43λ for the Gaussian beam. Plots of the main lobe thickness as defined in Methods confirmed these results, showing that the main lobe thickness values for both MB-square and hexagonal lattice light sheets remain nearly constant throughout the beam propagation length up to 22λ while the Gaussian main lobe thickness increases two-fold over this range (Fig. S 1a). We also replicated these results experimentally for each of the beams here and demonstrated very good agreement with the optical simulations (Fig. S 2). Together, these results demonstrate a clearly distinguishable difference between Gaussian, MB-square, and hexagonal lattice light sheets. MB-square and hexagonal lattice light sheets have higher axial resolution and maintain this resolution over a larger portion of the propagation length than Gaussian beams. As a final example, we investigated flat top beams of the same length that are generated by clipping a uniform illumination stripe at the pupil plane with a mask. These beams result in an electric field resembling a Sinc function at the sample with intensity sidelobes that are in between those of a Gaussian beam and a MB-square lattice. Flat-top beams displayed intermediate properties, showing similar axial resolution to Gaussian at the beam focus, but less degradation along the beam propagation direction. As a tradeoff, flat-top beams had lower axial resolution, but better optical sectioning than either MB-square or hexagonal lattice light sheets at all locations (Fig. S 3e and Table S2).

### Feasibility and coexistence of large ecological communities [^02d41162]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Shape of the feasibility domain

So far, we have focused on the volume of the parameter space resulting in feasiblity. However, two systems having the same Ξ can still have very different responses to parameter perturbations, just as two triangles having the same area need not to have sides of the same length (Fig. 1). The two extreme cases correspond to (a) an isotropic system in which if we start at the barycentre of the feasibility domain, moving in any direction yields roughly the same effect (equivalent to an equilateral triangle); (b) anisotropic systems, in which the feasibility domain is much narrower in certain directions than in others (as in a scalene triangle). For our problem, the domain of growth rates leading to coexistence is — once the growth rates are normalized — the (S −1)-dimensional generalization of a triangle on a hypersphere. For S = 3, this domain is indeed a triangle lying on a sphere as shown in Fig. 1. If all the S (S −1)/2 sides of this (hyper-)triangle are about the same length, then different perturbations will have similar effects on the system. On the other hand, if some sides are much shorter than others, then there will be changes of conditions which will more likely have an impact on coexistence than others. We therefore consider a measure of the heterogeneity in the distribution of the side lengths (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 10). The larger the variance of this distribution, the more likely it is that certain perturbations can destroy coexistence, even when Ξ is large and the perturbation small. This way of measuring heterogeneity is particularly convenient because it is independent of the initial conditions. Moreover, the length of each side can be directly related to the similarity between the corresponding pair of species (Supplementary Note 10), drawing a strong connection between the parameter space allowing for coexistence and the phenotypic space. As in the case of Ξ, this measure is a function of the interaction matrix and corresponds to a geometrical property of the coexistence domain.

Trial structure and exemplar stimuli. Examples of (a) a valid trial, in which a right‐sided target is cued by a large numerical array, and (b) the two‐item and the nine‐item arrays used as numerical cues.

The numerical cue consisted of two‐item or a nine‐item arrays, that were matched for the cumulative area occupied by the items (~8 cm 2) and their total contour length (~34.5 cm), as well as for the size of the virtual square subtended by the items (~52 cm 2). The rectangular‐shaped items composing the two‐item and the nine‐item arrays measured, respectively, 0.5 × 8.1 cm and 0.73 × 1.2 cm; they were arranged randomly within the virtual square, with their shorter side aligned with the horizontal plane. Each numerosity (i.e. 2 or 9) could appear in three different colors (yellow, green, and pink) and four orientations (two leftward, and two rightward), created by rotating the array to the right by 90° three times, which resulted in 12 different arrays per numerosity (Figure 1). On each trial, the displayed numerical cue was selected randomly from the pool of 12 arrays, and the displayed target stimulus was selected randomly from a pool of sixteen different images of a static colorful ball (1.75 cm in radius) varying in color (Figure 1). Trials were administered in blocks, each block composed of eight valid trials (i.e. left‐sided target preceded by a two‐item cue, and right‐sided target preceded by a nine‐item cue) and eight invalid trials (i.e. left‐sided target preceded by a nine‐item cue, and right‐sided target preceded by a two‐item cue). Valid and invalid trials appeared randomly, and cue numerosity and target position were equally distributed within each block. There was no restriction on the number of trial blocks presented to each participant: The experimental session terminated when the infant had looked away from the screen during five consecutive trials.

### Preoperative measurements and planning sheet for an endograft with 3 inner branches to repair aortic arch pathologies [^b6ec0f68]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To present a methodology for aortic arch anatomy measurement to plan and size an arch endograft with 3 inner branches.

Technique

The arch endograft is custom manufactured with 3 inner side branches. Computed tomography angiography should be used to measure the clock position, the distances between the supra-aortic vessels, and the length and diameter of the proximal and distal landing zones. On the planning sheet, the vertical axis on the grid represents the spiral stabilizing wire at the 12 o'clock position; the horizontal baseline at 0 mm represents the idealized proximal margin of the innominate artery (IA). The first inner branch for the IA would be at 12:30 clock position and -20 mm from the horizontal baseline, while the second inner branch would be at the 11:30 clock position and at 0 mm. The third inner branch would vary among the different potential positions.

Conclusion

Preoperative measurements of aortic arch anatomy can be made using a standard methodology to plan the size and position of inner branches. Future studies will show the potential applicability of a standard 3-inner-branch arch endograft using the planning sheet.

### Self-assembly of tessellated tissue sheets by expansion and collision [^222795b5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Results

Collisions between archetypal tissue pairs

Our first experiment aimed at uncovering the basic rules governing tissue collisions, with the goal to understand and then fully predict the shape and motion of the tissue–tissue boundary. As classical "healing" assays exclusively focus on collisions between rectangular tissue domains, we first investigated the importance of tissue shape and size in collisions between homotypic tissues (i.e. of the same cell type). Specifically, we characterized interactions between growing pairs of millimeter-scale epithelial tissues, including equal-size rectangles, circles, small vs. large circles, and circles vs. rectangles (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Video 1). We used MDCK epithelial cells, a standard model, and labeled each tissue in a pair with a different color (Methods) to clearly distinguish the boundary. Imaging over 2–3 days, we observed no mixing (Supplementary Video 2).

The shapes of colliding tissues are stereotyped and predictable.

Averages over several tissues at 60 h are shown in the rightmost panels (n = 4–7). See Supplementary Videos 1 and 4.

Collisions between identical rectangular tissues are well characterized from the traditional wound healing scratch and barrier removal assays, and our data here confirmed the expected symmetric collision and fusion along the midline (Fig. 1a), allowing us to move on to unstudied configurations. We next compared identical circles, where we observed that a straight boundary formed at the midline as before (Fig. 1b), but it was nearly twice as smooth as the boundary between colliding rectangles (Supplementary Fig. 1, p value 0.014, see Methods). We suspect that this is due to the difference in collision dynamics: while parallel strips of tissue collide all along the collision line at once, circles collide at a single point and gradually extend the boundary line outward (Supplementary Videos 2 and 3).

Dosage and Administration

REGRANEX is for topical use; it is not for oral, ophthalmic or intravaginal use.

The amount of REGRANEX to be applied depends upon the size of the ulcer area. To calculate the length of gel to apply lo the ulcer, measure the greatest length of the ulcer by the greatest width of the ulcer in either inches or centimeters. To calculate the length of gel in inches, use the formula shown below in Table 1, and to calculate the length of gel in centimeters, use the formula shown below in Table 2.

### Anatomical aspects of the gastrocnemius aponeurosis and its insertion: a cadaveric study [^e5414c2d]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Anatomical variation in the attachment of the gastrocnemius muscle to the soleus muscle has not been studied previously. The gastrocnemius muscle may insert directly onto the tendinous superficial surface of the soleus; however, in most cases, the distal end of the gastrocnemius aponeurosis extends for a variable distance as a thin, tendinous sheet void of muscular attachments. Surgeons performing a gastrocnemius recession may target the exposed inferior portion of the aponeurosis that is not directly covered by muscle. This is the subject of this anatomical study. Fifty-three embalmed cadaveric specimens were dissected to measure the length of the gastrocnemius aponeurosis medially and laterally. Three aponeurosis length categories were subjectively developed according to the ease with which a surgeon might release the gastrocnemius from the soleus: long aponeurosis (minimum aponeurosis length greater than 10 mm; 53% of specimens); short aponeurosis (9%), and direct attachment of the gastrocnemius muscle to the soleus on the medial side, lateral side, or both (38%). The typical gastrocnemius aponeurosis in the sample was distinctly shorter medially and longer laterally. For aponeuroses in the long aponeurosis category, the median length medially was 22.5 mm and median length laterally was 51 mm. In the short aponeurosis category, median medial length was 5 mm and lateral length was 22 mm. The lateral length was 1.8 times greater than the medial length for the long aponeurosis and 5 times greater for the short aponeuroses. Understanding the variation of the gastrocnemius aponeurosis will aid the surgeon in choosing a recession technique, performing the procedure, and preventing iatrogenic complications.

### Scalable computation of anisotropic vibrations for large macromolecular assemblies [^30d61a4d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Bandwidth and layout of the Hessian

Obviously, the cost of the parallel computation will depend on the local bandwidthof the batch. The Hessian obtained with the default ordering of atoms can result in very large bandwidths with non-uniform patterns meaning interactions among sequentially distal parts within the tertiary structure or individual chains within a quaternary structure. A hypothetical minimal example is a macromolecule with 3 peptide chains α, β and γ, where only α-γ and β-γ interactions were found, but not α-β; in this case, the order α-β-γ will have a much larger bandwidth than α-γ-β. Many reasons can attribute to this observation. An example found in the benchmark set is a chimeric Sesbania mosaic virus coat protein(PDBID: 4Y5Z) composed of 12 sets of pentamers arranged on the vertices of an icosahedron, where each protein chain in the pentamer interacts with 7 other chains within 8 Å. (See Supplementary Fig. 1) A systematic order to build up this icosahedron, as done by the authors, is to place a pentamer on each of the four corners of the three orthogonal golden rectangles, done one rectangle after another starting at the shorter sides of the golden rectangles. (See Supplementary Fig. 1a) In this case, pentamers on the shorter sides interact within 8 Å among each other, but pentamers on the long sides of the same rectangle do not. This creates exactly the situation where the aforementioned α-β-γ order arises. Indeed, the vertices on a icosahedron can never be clustered satisfactorily and there are specialized algorithm to calculate their vibrational dyanmics. Besides, due to the inconsistent presence of water molecules, the exact symmetry is destroyed in the crystal structure, which is commonly encountered. Nevertheless, the degeneracies in modes due to the apparent symmetry of this macromolecule is captured in our program. (See Supplementary Fig. 1d) There are also cases where no meaningful sequential ordering is possible when intact chemical structures (e.g. cofactors, ions, water, lipids) are intercalated between sequentially distal parts of the polymer. A practical example in the benchmark set is a PsbM-deletion mutant of photosystem II(PDBID: 5H2F), where elongated lipids and cofactors are integral part of the macromolecule complex surrounded by several protein chains. In this case, it is not obvious as for how to rearrange the atoms to reduce the bandwidth, but we can show that the Hessian can always be permuted to reduce bandwidth by the algorithm described in the next section. (See Supplementary Fig. 2)

### Parent-of-origin effects on complex traits in up to 236, 781 individuals [^6ec228b2]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

For any fixed length, let us define the proportion of an event of two individuals sharing X chromosome haplotypes of length shorter thanwhen one individual is a paternal relative of the other one:wheretakes the value of 1 if statementis true and zero otherwise. When a shared segment length is very large, the proportion is expected to be very small, that is, it is unlikely to share large segments with surrogate fathers. Analogously, we can define

As, andand they sum up to 1, that is, Assuming a uniform prior, that is, we have

Thus.

We can similarly derive thatNote that whenis largewill dominate and hence the ratio will approach 1. Hence, whenis large, it is a faithful measure of the probability that if we observedlong X chromosome sharing between two individuals (and), how likely it is thatis on the maternal side of. However, asdecreases, it does not inform us about the chances ofbeing on the maternal side of.

In theory, we could have usedand, but in practice, these measures turned out to be too noisy when not enoughtraining data pairs were available withbeing close enough to.

We initially applied this approach to the male individuals of the validation cohort (n = 857). We found that haplotype segments' shared IBD with surrogate fathers are all shorter than 11.3 cM, and 99% of them are shorter than 3 cM (Supplementary Fig. 6a). We then evaluated the accuracy of our probabilistic assignment. To do so, we proceeded with a 'leave one sample out' approach: we removed a given individual from the training set and predicted its paternal and maternal sides by deriving probabilities using the N − 1 individuals of the training set (Supplementary Fig. 6b). We repeated this for the N individuals of the training set. To compute accuracy at a given maternal probability P, we defined true positives as the number of surrogate mothers with probability > P, and false positives as the number of surrogate fathers with probability > P. We then computed accuracy as TP/(TP + FP) (Supplementary Fig. 6c).

Designs (B) and (E) are classic stepped wedge designs. Designs (C) and (F) randomise clusters to just two sequences, but have the same minimum, maximum and average waiting time for the intervention as the classic stepped wedge designs (B) and (E),

First, a sense-check: do we really need to extend the timescale of our trial? What if we recruited women over a single month, with half the maternity units allocated to the intervention condition and half to the control (20 women in each condition)? This design is shown schematically in figure 1A. The power is 24% — not great, as we usually aim for a target of at least 80%, so there is something to be said for collecting data over a longer interval. What about a stepped wedge design? These are often presented as being statistically efficient. Figure 1B illustrates the classic stepped wedge scheme with a 'step-length', or interval between successive roll-outs, of 1 month. The power of this design is 91% — much more, in fact, than we need.

### Arthroscopic technique for patch augmentation of rotator cuff repairs [^92a92c1b]. Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

The patient is placed in the lateral position, and an arthroscopic cuff repair is performed according to standard techniques. The line of repair is usually in the shape of a "T" or an "L". The repair is viewed through the lateral portal, with fluid inflow through the scope. Mattress sutures are placed in the anterior and posterior portions of the cuff, with respect to the line of repair, just medial to the most medial point of the tear. The sutures are placed in accordance with margin convergence suture passing methods. Next, 2 double-stranded suture anchors are placed into the lateral aspect of the greater tuberosity, which can be used to secure the anterior and posterior portions of the rotator cuff as well as the patch. The cuff sutures are tied first; then, the patch is addressed. The graft is sized by placement of a ruled probe or similar device into the subacromial space. The length of each side of the "rectangle" is measured to obtain the dimensions of the patch. The patch is then cut to fit the measurements. If the patch material is elastic, a slightly smaller than measured graft is cut to provide tension on the repair. The arthroscope is then moved to the posterior portal, and a large (8 mm) cannula, with a dam, is placed into the lateral portal. All sutures are brought out of the lateral cannula, and corresponding ends of each suture are held together in a clamp. The sutures are placed in their respective orientations once outside the cannula (e.g., anterior-medial, anterior-lateral), covering all 4 quadrants. Care is taken to ensure that the sutures have no twists and are not wrapped around one another. The sutures are passed through the graft, in mattress fashion, with a free needle, in their respective corners and clamped again. The graft is then grasped with a small locking grasper on its medial edge and is passed through the cannula into the subacromial space. The clamps holding the sutures are then gently pulled to remove the slack. A smaller (5 mm) cannula is placed through 1 of the anchor incisions into the subacromial space. The medial 2 sutures are retrieved, a pair at a time, through the small cannula and are tied according to standard arthroscopic techniques; then, the lateral 2 sutures are retrieved from the anchor. The graft should cover the area of repair completely and should be under slight tension. Additional sutures may be placed to further secure or tension the graft as necessary, with the use of standard suture passing techniques, similar to those used when margin convergence is performed. Passive shoulder motion, pendulum exercises, and active elbow and wrist motion begin 2 days after surgery when the dressing is removed. Active assisted motion and active motion begin at 6 weeks, with integrated periscapular stabilization exercises. Formal cuff strengthening begins no sooner than 12 weeks after surgery for large and massive tears.

### A transient contractile seam promotes epithelial sealing and sequential assembly of body segments [^868b7a45]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Initial configuration

The process of dorsal closure in Drosophila involves mainly two epithelial tissues, the dorsal epidermis (DE) and the amnioserosa (AS). The AS is located in the dorsal part of the embryo and has roughly an elliptical shape, whilst the DE surrounds the AS by all sides. Since the process of dorsal closure is roughly symmetric along the anterior–posterior axis, we chose to build an initial configuration that represented only the anterior half of the AS and the surrounding DE. The initial configuration was set up in two steps. First, a hexagonal mesh was built in the shape of a rectangle, with the longer side corresponding to the anterior–posterior axis. This would correspond to the DE. Then, the mesh was partially split along the dorsal midline (i.e. halfway along the short side of the rectangle), the two sides were pushed laterally in order to widen the gap and a single polygon corresponding to one large cell was fit in this gap. The latter would correspond to the AS (see Fig. 1D). Note that in reality, the AS is a tissue composed of many cells, however, for the sake of simplicity we modeled it as a single cell that contracts at a certain rate over time (see below). Thus, the AS cell consists of many vertices, with the most anterior one (i.e. the leftmost) corresponding to the canthus and an equal number of vertices located on each side of the canthus corresponding to the leading edge of the DE (Fig. S2A). Also note that this initial configuration is far away from force balance, so a preliminary relaxation phase is required previous to the start of the simulation (see below). The boundaries of the system are fixed, meaning that vertices that are at the mesh boundary are not allowed to move, with the exception of the posterior boundary (i.e. where the AS meets the boundary). In the latter, vertices are not allowed to move in the anterior–posterior (i.e. left–right) direction, but are allowed to move along the medio-lateral (i.e. up-down) direction in order to facilitate the closure of the DE.

### A model for the fragmentation kinetics of crumpled thin sheets [^a2bca16c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

As a preliminary step, we derive the final displacement of the strip when folded at each break, in the absence of confinement. This problem can be mapped to the displacement of a walker performing a one-dimensional random walk with gamma-distributed steps. To enforce the concept of folding, the walker's steps occur in alternating directions. The distribution f Z (z) of position Z after 2 k steps accurate for all k is derived in full in Supplementary Note 2. However, the salient trends may be likewise observed by applying the central limit theorem and considering the position Z valid for large k, or small step size, which givesand describes a normal distribution of zero mean and variance L 0 θ.

If a confinement is now introduced at the locations ∣ z ∣ = w, we next ask with what likelihood the walker steps beyond this confinement. One approach to approximate this probability is to integrate Eq. (16) for all ∣ z ∣ > w, producing a two-sided survival function of Eq. (16). Although this is not equivalent to our initial question, as intermediate steps may also have landed past ∣ z ∣ > w, it proves an acceptable estimate as the last step has the greatest variance. A more accurate calculation would be to evaluate the likelihood that a given walk escapes the confinement at any step; however, looking at the last step is useful for its simplicity in analytical form, and still captures the anticipated behavior. A comparison to the more accurate formulation is made numerically and provided in Supplementary Fig. 9. Once again, we pursue here the simpler form of the survival function valid for large k, and refer to Supplementary Note 2 for the exact derivation valid at all k. The survival function of Eq. (16), S Z (w; θ) = P (∣ Z ∣ > w; w ≥ 0), for a threshold confinement w, is given bywhere erf(z) is the error function. In order for walkers at ∣ z ∣ > w to be restored within the limits of confinement, one or more of their steps must fragment, thereby increasing the number of steps taken and decreasing the overall average, which drives the evolution of fragmentation. This articulates our key claim: considering our original, cylindrically shaped sheets as a statistical ensemble of one-dimensional random walks, we suggest that the progression of fragmentation measured by a change d t, over a single crumpling iteration d n, should be proportional to the fraction of walks in the ensemble which leave the confinement imposed at ∣ z ∣ = w: d t /d n ~ S Z (w; θ). Equivalently, this is the likelihood that a single random walk leaves the critical confinement. We note that this resulting fragmentation rate describes an average fragmentation likelihood given only a confinement w and current temporal parameter t = 1/ θ describing the maturity of the fragmentation process thus far; it does not enforce direct correlations between successive crumpling iterations, whereby new folds should occur preferentially along previous ones. Instead, the decrease in fragmentation rate with n is encoded through the decreasing mean facet area with t. Moreover, while stronger correlation is expected between walks representing nearby transects of the sheet, here we consider the statistical behavior of the sheet as a whole, and account for the increased fragmentation likelihood for facets with larger horizontal extent through the weighting introduced in Eq. (15). At present, Eq. (17) gives the likelihood that new creases will form; however, it does not yet describe how much new damage is created, for which two additional factors should be considered: (1) When the sheet is strongly confined in closely packed layers, the layers tend to collectively fragment, as alluded to by Sultan and Boudaoudand Gottesman et al. thus contributing a factor p ~ 1/ L such that halving the final height doubles the number of additional ridges. (2) In the opposite limit of low compaction, facets are not in close proximity and need not behave cooperatively; thus, new damage scales linearly with the amount of compression L 0 − L, as argued in Gottesman et al. With these additional considerations, we propose that the evolution of the fragmentation process with crumpling iteration behaves aswhere α is a fitted constant of proportionality. We indicate the explicit dependence on t here, as t and θ are inversely related. The critical width w is determined by the geometry of the imposed confinement, as illustrated in Fig. 6 d; a complete derivation is provided in Supplementary Note 4 :where R is the radius of the container. By consequence of Eq. (14) we can directly relate Eqs. (18) and (12) asand obtain a fit to the proportionality constant α. By performing an asymptotic approximation in the limit of large t, detailed in Supplementary Note 3, Eq. (18) may be analytically integrated to provide a scaling relationwhich bears similarity toof Eq. (11):where, and L 0 and R are the sheet length (equivalently the confining container height) and container radius, respectively. Taken together, Eqs. (14) and (21) thereby provide a theoretically motivated expressionbased on properties of fragmentation kinetics and a simple mechanism for re-fragmentation formulated as a random walk. Figure 7 compares the agreement of the empirical relations δ ℓ empir. and ℓ empir. as well as the derived models δ ℓ model and, with the measured quantitiesand ℓ meas. for various n. Collectively, the results of Figs. 4 and 7 demonstrate clear consistency of the fragmentation model with the anticipated logarithmic growth.

### Clinical application of a resembling rectangular flap on lateral lip in unilateral cheiloplasty: a modified millard's technique [^41726b93]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The Displaced Peak of Cupid's Bow

In the classical RAT, the out and upwardly displaced cphi was solved by an arc-shaped incision with/without back-cut on the medial segment of the affected side to form the downward rotating A-flap and upward rotating C-flap. However, patients might experience the following problems after the surgery: (1) insufficient lip height on the affected side caused by scar contracture and inadequate decline; (2) An unattractive appearance caused by a shield-shaped scar underneath the columella, an oblique scar on the affected side; (3) The vermilion with a discontinuous red-line, and mixed the dry and wet compositions; (4) the "cut as you go" technique depends on the individual surgeon's ingenuity and experiences. It requires a significantly high learning curve. These shortcomings limited its clinical application; therefore, many scholars have made necessary modifications. Mohler mimics the appearance of the normal phitral ridge by using a curvilinear rotation incision extending to the columellar base and a sharply angulated back-cut incision that reaches the central line of the philtral dimple. After the A-flap is drawn downwardly, this defect is filled by the advanced C-flap and elongates the shortened columella. The lateral flap is not advanced to this defect instead of a straight-line closure. However, this remaining C-flap is too narrow to fill this entire defect, and inadequate decline might produce a short lip. Cutting et al extend the terminal point of the Mohler's rotation incision 2 mm upward into the columella, at three-fifths of the distance from the affected side; the back-cut extended downward to, but not beyond, the non-affected philtral crest. A wider C-flap is allowed to fill into the defect and a near-straight-line anatomic closure is performed, a final scar is mirrored on the non-affected philtral ridge. However, because the linear closure better mimics the philtrum crest, the contraction of the linear scar is more likely to cause a height reduction of the affected upper lip. However, this straight-line scar contracture may also induce short lip deformity.– For Mohler's insufficient lip height, Li et al modified Mohler's technique based on geometric principles. However, straight-line scars and abnormal nasal sill are still present on the affected side after surgery because of applying a C-flap to fill into the remaining defect. The skewness of the nasal column and abnormal nasal sill on the affected side after the initial surgery often affects the later results of plastic surgery.

### Delayed increase in stone tool cutting-edge productivity at the middle-upper paleolithic transition in Southern Jordan [^474d7763]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Measurement of cutting-edge length

To make accurate and precise measurements of irregular edge forms, we measured the length of the outlines of lithic blanks from their digital photographs by following the methods proposed by Eren et al.and followed by other researchers, (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Lithic blanks were placed with their ventral face down on a sheet of graph paper, and their digital photographs were taken. The digital photos were then processed in Adobe Photoshop versions 17–23 to adjust the scale and to clarify the edges, which were then automatically traced by Adobe Illustrator versions 20–27 to extract outlines. The length of the outlines was measured in Adobe Illustrator. Following the instructions in Eren et al.and Muller and Clarkson, we made close observations of each stone tool to exclude dull edges, such as the striking platform, broken edges, and obtuse angles, from the measurement.

Retouched tools were excluded from the analysis because of difficulty in estimating the original length of their cutting edge. We also did not measure the length of the cutting edge of chips, which are flakes whose maximum length is smaller than 25 mm. Microburins were also excluded from the edge-length measurement as they are tiny byproducts in the manufacturing process of microliths. Cores and chunks were also excluded as they do not have sharp cutting edges. Chunks are fragmented pieces that do not clearly show ventral or dorsal surfaces.

Thus, we measured the cutting-edge length of unmodified blanks, which consist of several techno-morphological types, such as flakes, blades, bladelets, and core trimming elements (CTE). A blade is defined as a flake whose length is equal to or greater than twice its width. Usually, a blade also has parallel lateral sides and ridges. We follow a definition of bladelet proposed by Tixier. A bladelet is a blade with a length of < 50 mm and a width of < 12 mm. CTEs are flakes or blades with distinctive morphologies, such as core tablets and crested pieces, which result from their detachment from specific parts of cores for the maintenance of core-surface morphology. Crested blades and core tablets follow the definitions by Inizan et al.

### Generation and characterization of ultrathin free-flowing liquid sheets [^a539a236]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Thin-film interference is a very useful tool for optimizing and assessing sheet thickness, flatness, and stability in situ. However, it becomes increasingly less reliable as sheets become much thinner than the wavelength of the illuminating source, a few hundred nm for visible light. For the thinnest sheets we generated, the tip of the sheet fades from yellow to black, as essentially no reflection is detected from the thinnest portion of the sheet. This can be seen by comparing the sheet in Fig. 4b, where the thinnest portion of the sheet reflects yellow, to Fig. 5c, where the lower half of the sheet reflects no measurable visible light. In order to measure the thickness of water sheets below 100 nm, we used IR transmission spectromicroscopy as described in the following section.

The error bars in e represent an estimate of the uncertainty of the absorption measurement based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the peaks of interest. In this case, the error bars are calculated by measuring the baseline noise (peak-to-peak) on either side of the peak of interest and scaling the error for the calculated thickness by standard error propagation methods. The scale bars in all panels are 50 μm

### A highly decoupled transmit-receive array design with triangular elements at 7T [^659bf9a2]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Transmit arrays are essential tools for various RF shimming or parallel excitation techniques at 7T. Here we present an array design with triangular coils to improve diversity in the B 1 profiles in the longitudinal (z) direction and allow for next-nearest neighbor decoupling.

Methods

Two cylindrical 8-channel arrays having the same length and diameter, 1 of triangular coils and the other of rectangular coils, were constructed and compared in phantom imaging experiments using measures of excitation distribution for a variety of RF shim settings and geometry factor maps for different accelerations on different planes.

Results

Coupling between elements was -20 dB or better for all triangular coil pairs, but worse than -12 dB for several of the rectangular coil pairs. Both coils could produce adequate shims on a central transverse plane, but the same shim produced worse results off center for the triangular coil array than for the rectangular coil array. Compared to the rectangular coil array, the maximum geometry factor for the triangular coil array was reduced by a factor of 13.1 when using a 2-fold acceleration in the z-direction.

Conclusion

An array design with triangular coils provides effective decoupling mechanisms for nearest and next-nearest neighboring elements, as well as diversity in B 1 profiles along the z-direction, although this also means that individual slices must be shimmed separately. This design is well suited for parallel transmit applications while also having high receive sensitivity.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^a596842a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Internal measurements — laparoscopic defect sizing most commonly uses an umbilical tape or sterile ruler, with the measurement tool placed on opposite sides of the defect in two dimensions and measurement at proper angles to determine size accurately. Two spinal needles (or spinal needle trocars) can be used by placing them through the skin, hernia sac, and/or abdominal wall on opposite sides and viewing the tips laparoscopically, and the measurement tool can then be placed adjacent to the needle tip to ensure a proper angle. Alternatively, the instrument tip (with or without the jaws open) can be useful for measuring the defect, especially when the defects are small, since the stainless steel portion of the jaws of the instrument tip usually has a known length and width, but for defects larger than 4–5 cm in diameter this technique may be inaccurate and, because there is a fixed fulcrum and an angled approach, is more error prone as the defect becomes larger and more elliptical. Reducing insufflation pressure may reduce but will not eliminate overestimation of defect size. Overestimating the defect size will result in the choice of a larger prosthetic size, which may be more difficult to handle and may have more laxity, allowing it to bulge into the defect, and the difficulty in prosthetic handling may lead to errors in fixation with sway between fixation points; on the other hand, a larger prosthetic is generally associated with a lower chance for hernia recurrence. Underestimating the defect size may lead to choosing a prosthetic that is too small, increasing the risk of hernia recurrence, and because none of the current techniques are highly precise, knowledge of measurement flaws will allow surgeons to choose as appropriately sized prosthetic as possible to minimize recurrence and maximize the ease of operation.

Computed tomography (CT) dose indices — CTDI100, CTDIw, and CTDIvol — are defined and calculated as follows: CTDI100 standardizes measurements to a standardized scan length of 100 mm, while CTDIw weights peripheral and central readings in a weighted fashion (2/3 peripheral dose + 1/3 central dose). Helical scan pitch is defined as the ratio of the scanning beam width (in mm) to the length of table movement during 1 gantry rotation; if movement equals beam width the pitch is 1.0, if beam width is greater than movement the pitch will be < 1.0, and if beam width is less than movement the pitch will be > 1.0. To account for pitch, CTDIvol was introduced and is simply calculated as CTDIw/pitch; CTDIvol is the weighted absorbed dose to air of a 1-cm axial length in the middle section of a 100-mm length scan, its unit of measure is the mGy, and the acrylic cylinder used must be specified as either 32- or 16-cm diameter and centered in the CT bore during measurement.

### Shape morphing of plastic films [^0b3d2490]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Hyperboloid

Hyperboloid structure was fabricated by a two-step peeling process. The PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm) was cut into 2 cm × 4 cm. At the first step, two parallel adhesive tapes were fixed on a plate with the tape length of 2 cm, width of 1 cm and an interval of 2 cm. The PTFE film was peeled off along the long side of the PTFE film. At the second step, the adhesive tape was 2 cm × 2 cm and the PTFE film was adhered with another side and peeled off along the short side of the PTFE film. Before that, the adhered parts in the first step were cut into parallel strips along the long side (Fig. 3f). The curvature of the two parts can be tuned separately with different peeling angles.

More complex 3D structures

Based on the obtained rules to regulate the shape morphing of plastic films, much more complex structures were fabricated with programmed 2D precursors and peeling processes. As shown in Fig. 4, the same 2D precursor can be transformed to different 3D structures by changing the adhesion side and peeling direction. For example, the same triangle frame can be turned into more than four different 3D structures. With different 2D precursors, various 3D structures were obtained which are inaccessible by other methods.

Single-edge notch tension (SENT) tests

For SENT tests, two different samples, notched and unnotched, were used to measure the fracture energy Γ. The samples were cut into a rectangular shape. For notched samples, a notch was made in the middle of one side by using a sharp razor. The distance between two clamps was fixed to 9 mm, and tensile speed was kept at 18 mm min −1. The fracture energy (Γ) was calculated by the following equation:where λ c is the fracture deformation ratio of notched sample (λ c = ε c + 1), c represents the length of the notch, and W is the strain energy calculated by integration of the stress versus strain of unnotched specimens with the same dimensions stretched to the ε c strain.

Fatigue tests

Fatigue threshold was measured by the similar single-edge notch method at ambient conditions (RH 60 ± 1%, 25 °C). The used rectangular sample had a width of 3 mm, thickness of 0.13 mm, and gauge length of 8 mm. Notched specimens with precut cracks (∼1/5 of the width) were cyclically stretched at a strain rate of 3.3% s −1 under different strains with no pause. The energy release rate (G) of notched sample under the N th cycle was calculated as follows:Where k (N) is a function of strain variation determined by, c (N) is the crack propagation length, and W (N) is the strain energy density of unnotched specimens of the same dimensions stretched to the same strain ε. The strain energy density W (N) of unnotched sample under the N th cycle can be obtained using.

### Solid earth change and the evolution of the antarctic ice sheet [^4b96b45d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The strength of any feedbacks between glacial isostasy and ice dynamics depends on the rate at which the solid Earth responds to ice-sheet change, which, in turn, depends on the rheological properties of the mantle. Seismic evidenceindicates that there are significant spatial variations in mantle properties beneath Antarctica, which suggests mantle viscosities, and hence relaxation timescales, may vary by up to several orders of magnitude from the global mean. Indeed, in the northern Antarctic Peninsula, geodetic evidencesuggests that contemporary ice loss is triggering a viscous response orders of magnitude more rapidly than was previously assumed possible in Antarctica – on decadal rather than millennial timescales. Feedbacks on ice dynamics are likely to be enhanced in such regions, and the ongoing GIA signal is likely to be dominated by recent ice-sheet change (few millennia or less), as opposed to the ice loss that followed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Here, we define the GIA signal to be the ongoing response of the solid Earth, the gravity field, and/or relative sea level to past ice-sheet change.

### Postmortem 7T MRI for guided histopathology and evaluation of cerebrovascular disease [^689e012a]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Histological ROI selection and tissue sampling

For each hemisphere, a mosaic image was created from the sliced imaging session by selecting the coronal T2 MRI slice in the center of each 6-mm-thick tissue slab, approximately 3 mm from the outer edges (Fig. 2A). These slices were chosen for ROI selection to: (1) minimize partial volume effects and surface interface artifact because they are furthest from the tissue/plastic surface, and (2) this MR "slice" is most closely spatially related to histological sampling following bisection of the tissue slab. We created a custom cutting tool by sharpening one edge of a sheet of 22-gauge stainless steel and then folding and cutting it down to the size of a histological cassette and affixing a handle. The folding was done so that the cutter had irregular side lengths to aid determination of ROI orientation and then glued together with epoxy. The dimensions of this cutter were converted into MRI voxel dimensions and overlaid on the mosaic image to create a rectangular frame to guide histological sampling (Fig. 2B). The mosaic was then printed to scale on a transparency and the individual ROIs were subsequently cut out with a hobby knife creating a precise guide for our custom tissue cassette cutter (Fig. 2C–E).

Ten regions of interest to be sampled from all brains on the basis of anatomical landmarks were chosen to ensure consistent sampling from each brain (Table 3). Specifically, these consistently sampled regions included those from the anterior and posterior horns of the lateral ventricles, given studies suggesting there may be a pathologically distinct etiology of WMH in anterior vs posterior brain. A control region of NAWM was obtained for each sample. Additional samples were chosen based on MRI-identified lesions of interest including WMH, MR-visible PVS, and microvascular lesions (infarcts < 2 mm in diameter located in cortex).

### Guidelines for composing and assessing a paper on treatment of pain [^19dff7b6]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Authors, readers, and editors share a common focus. Authors want to publish their work. Readers want to see high-quality, new information. Referees and editors serve to ensure that authors provide valid conclusions based on the quality of information that readers want. Common to each of these roles are instructions to authors. However, these are typically written in an uninspiring, legalistic style, as if they are a set of rules that authors must obey if they expect to get published. This renders the instructions boring and oppressive, if not forbidding. Yet they need not be so, if they are set in context. Instructions to authors can be cast in a way as to reflect common purpose. They can remind authors what perceptive readers want to see in a paper and, thereby, prompt authors to include all necessary information. If cast in this way, instructions to authors are not a set of rules by which to satisfy publishers; they become guidelines for the etiquette of communication between authors and their readers. Against this background, the present article has been composed to serve several purposes. Foremost, it amplifies instructions to authors beyond the conventional technicalities such as headings, layout, font size, and line spacing. It prescribes the type of information that should be communicated and explains the reasons for those recommendations. Doing so not only informs authors about what to write, but also informs readers and referees about what to look for in a good paper. Secondarily, the article publicizes examples of errors and deficiencies of manuscripts submitted to the Journal in the past that have delayed their acceptance and publication, which could have been avoided had the forthcoming recommendations been followed. The recommendations also reprise the elements taught in courses conducted by the Spine Intervention Society in their extended program on evidence-based medicine. Doing so underscores that instructions for authors are not a procedural technicality but a way to ensure that what authors write, what readers read, and what the Journal publishes comply with contemporary precepts of good evidence. Some 20years ago, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a comprehensive series of articles with a common title: "Users' Guides to the Medical Literature" [1,2]. These articles focused on the science of statistical tests and critical appraisal, and their importance for properly understanding the literature. The present article differs in that it does not presume to teach technicalities. Instead, it describes and explains, step by step, the critical components of an article, what authors should include, and what readers should look for, so that the Journal can ensure that consistent, high-quality information is shared between its authors and readers. The present article focuses on articles concerning treatment of pain, largely because this type of article is more commonly submitted than articles on reliability or validity of diagnostic procedures. Although the present article principally focuses on papers for the Spine Section of the Journal, the same principles, appropriately adapted, serve for other sections.

### Large-scale solution synthesis of narrow graphene nanoribbons [^59f5e312]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

According to theoretical studies, narrow graphene nanoribbons with atomically precise armchair edges and widths of < 2nm have a bandgap comparable to that in silicon (1.1eV), which makes them potentially promising for logic applications. Different top-down fabrication approaches typically yield ribbons with width > 10nm and have limited control over their edge structure. Here we demonstrate a novel bottom-up approach that yields gram quantities of high-aspect-ratio graphene nanoribbons, which are only ~1nm wide and have atomically smooth armchair edges. These ribbons are shown to have a large electronic bandgap of ~1.3eV, which is significantly higher than any value reported so far in experimental studies of graphene nanoribbons prepared by top-down approaches. These synthetic ribbons could have lengths of > 100nm and self-assemble in highly ordered few-micrometer-long 'nanobelts' that can be visualized by conventional microscopy techniques, and potentially used for the fabrication of electronic devices.

### Irradiance footprint of phototherapy devices: a comparative study [^4936c50f]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

High spectral irradiance footprint

To define the HSI footprint area where the spectral irradiance was ≥ 30 μW cm −2 nm −1, the radiospectrometer was moved along the x - and y -axis of the measurement grid (Fig. 1a). The locations where the spectral irradiance became less than 30 μW cm −2 nm −1 were recorded, resulting in four measurement points: x p, x n, y p, and y n, where the subscripts p and n denote locations on the positive and negative sides of the axes, respectively. The parameters d x and d y were defined as the distance along the x - and y -axis where the irradiance was ≥ 30 μW cm −2 nm −1: d x = x p – x n and d y = y p – y n. The HSI footprint was calculated by combining the measured values of d x and d y with the geometry of the irradiance footprint of the PT devices: HSI footprint round/oval = π (1/2 d x)(1/2 d y) for round and oval geometries (Bluespot, Infantulus) and HSI footprint rectangular = d x d y for rectangular geometries.

The HSI footprint of each PT device was related to the average BSA of an infant born at 22, 26, 32, and 40 weeks of gestation with an average body length of 28, 35, 42, and 50 cm, respectively. –

Transthoracic echocardiography sector size and depth — Depth is measured in units of length and should be set to maximize the size of the display for the structures or flow of interest, and because the heart is a moving structure, higher frame rates are desirable to increase temporal resolution; unnecessarily large sector depths can reduce image quality, and a narrower sector angle may be appropriate in some circumstances to enhance image quality.

### Microfluidic multipoles theory and applications [^31dd0050]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Upon inspection, the problem can be transformed to streamline coordinates (Fig. 2a) using the function

In the streamline domain Φ, the problem is equivalent to a channel geometry with flows of concentration c = 1 and c = 0 separated by a no-flux boundary condition on the origin. At the stagnation point, the no-flux condition is dropped, and the flows are free to mix (Fig. 2a) (see Supplementary Table 2 for more details on the streamline problem). The separating streamline going from the stagnation point to the aspiration aperture corresponds to the semi-infinite segment of the horizontal axis where the fluids can mix. If the Péclet number is high enough (higher than about 10, which is always realized in microfluidics applications), this segment can be taken to have concentration c = 1/2 and the walls of the channel geometry can be safely ignored (Supplementary Note 1). The problem can thus be decomposed in two problems of advection-diffusion around semi-infinite obstacles of fixed concentration. The problem of advection-diffusion around such a semi-infinite obstacle has been extensively studied in theoretical fluid mechanics, notably in the theory of dendrite solidification, and in the study of out of plane flow in Burgers vortex sheets. It yields the solutionwhere Φ stag is the image of the stagnation point and erf(x) is the error function. The sign of ± is determined by whether we have an incoming flow of concentration c = 0 or c = 1. However, neither of these concentration profiles represent the full dipole footprint when transformed. This can be seen physically in the flow dipole, in which there is both incoming fluid at concentration 0 (aspirated from the system's surroundings), and incoming fluid at concentration 1 (injected by the aperture). To solve this issue, we separate the problem into an "interior" and an "exterior" domain at the streamline of concentration c = 1/2 (see checkerboard insets in Fig. 2). There remains a discontinuity in our solution due to the branch cut of the logarithm functions in Eq. (1), but the solution can be made continuous by placing the singularities on the real axis and using it as an axis of symmetry. The final step is then to obtain the entire solution as a piecewise function assembling the "interior" and "exterior" solutions, given by transforming Eq. (6) back to the dipole flow domain Z. The interior and exterior domains can be defined either by checking the sign of Φ in the streamline domain or by using the expression for the separating line in the Z domain in polar coordinates (see Supplementary Note 2).

### Solid earth change and the evolution of the antarctic ice sheet [^a477bd79]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Summary of interactions between the solid Earth and the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Local isostatic uplift occurs in response to ice-sheet thinning or retreat, isostatic subsidence occurs in response to ice-sheet thickening or advance. Subglacial volcanism and basal heat flux alter thermal conditions at the base of the ice sheet. Erosion and deposition also trigger an isostatic response (not shown). Increasing time indicated by finer dashed lines

Interactions between ice sheets and the solid Earth have long been studied within the field of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) — defined here as the response of the solid Earth and the global gravity field to changes in the distribution of ice and water on Earth's surface. The first numerical models of GIA were developed in the 1970sbut they have received renewed attention over the last decade, reflecting the important role they play in the interpretation of satellite measurements of contemporary ice-sheet change. A number of recent studies have also sought to understand the strength of feedbacks acting in the opposite direction, that is, the impact of solid Earth deformation on ice dynamics and the potential for this deformation to delay or prevent unstable ice-sheet retreat. Such feedbacks were first considered in the 1980sbut have only recently begun to be implemented into fully-coupled models, where the evolving shape of the solid Earth and the depth of the ocean adjacent to an ice sheet grounded below sea level act as fundamental boundary conditions on the dynamics of the ice sheet.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^88a4ea63]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergy diagnostic testing — fungal extract sourcing, labeling, and taxonomy guidance emphasizes culture-based specificity and precise nomenclature. Species determinations require careful studies of isolates in culture, and when fungal extracts are grown in the laboratory, the source organism and culture media selected for use should be explicitly noted. Increasing evidence suggests that, at least among the Deuteromycetes, individual species should be assumed to differ allergenically until proven otherwise. Fungal extracts should derive from authenticated species and be labeled accordingly, and extracts bearing only generic designations should be rejected; labels, skin testing sheets, and specific IgE test reports should reflect contemporary nomenclature, avoiding discarded designations. When recent taxonomic change threatens confusion, both the new and old names should be supplied, and at no time should extracts of a single organism be supplied under 2 or more deuteromycete synonyms; product labeling should show from which growth form(s) the extract was derived, that is, the sexual or asexual stages. At present, the optimal preparative approach for fungus extracts has not been defined, and comparisons must confront the tendency, especially among the Deuteromycetes, to undergo somatic mutation and antigenshift under extended culture conditions.

### Modeling the electrical resistivity of polymer composites with segregated structures [^efc4bc6b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Computational modeling

To represent a random configuration of silica particles on a cubic domain, spheres are scattered by choosing the center coordinates of each individual sphere uniformly at random. Spheres are placed one-by-one so that the distances from the designated center position to the center positions of pre-existing spheres are apart from each other farther than the diameter. The diameter of the sphere is set to the average size of the silica filler, and the number of spheres per unit volume is determined according to the weight ratio of silica particles in the composite samples used in the experiments.

Upon the completion of the random placement of circular fillers, a CNT network is created on the domain by placing multiple random instances of a flexible wire. According to morphological characteristics as observed in the SEM and TEM images, a random instance of the wire is placed so that a CNT wire is distributed uniformly in the simulation domain and can proceed forwardly to pass through a gap between silica particles but cannot penetrate the particles. The flexibility of a CNT wire is reflected by modeling them as a series of small line segments connected with joints that can bend freely within a certain degree (up to 120°). To create a single wire on the domain, constituting line segments are placed in sequence from one side to the other. The first line segment is placed at random in the volume that spheres do not occupy. Subsequent line segments are placed in a straight line unless they touch spheres. If the line segment touches a sphere, the direction of the line segment is changed toward a tangential direction of the sphere in contact so that the wire smoothly circumvents the sphere. The width and length of a single wire are set to the average diameter and length of CNTs used in the experiment, respectively. The length of a line segment is set the same as the width of the wire, and thus the line segment can be thought as of a small spherical cylinder of the identical height and width, i.e. with a square side view. This facilitates the test for the connectivity of two wires since the contact suffices to check whether, at each endpoint of a line segment, there exists any other endpoint of a line segment from a different wire within a ball of radius equal to the length of the line segment centered at the endpoint. A graphical description of the procedure is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. A sample cubic domain of 10 μm × 10 μm × 10 μm is taken from the composite model to obtain the CNT network. The connectivity of the domain is checked by examining the contacts between flexible wires. For a pair of two wires, all possible pairwise distances between two line segments from respective wires are calculated. If at least one value of the distances is less than 2 nm, which is based on a tunneling mechanism (see Supplementary Note 1) –, the two wires are considered to be in contact at the position of the corresponding line segments. A graphical representation of the procedure is presented in Supplementary Fig. 2. A clustering analysis identifies percolating clusters of wires that span across the domain. Starting from the leftmost wires touching the left end, each cluster is expanded gradually toward the right end by including wires in contact. If a cluster contains one of the rightmost wires touching the right end, this cluster is declared to be a conducting path. For all conducting paths, KCL is applied at all junctions of wires to construct a system of linear equations about voltage drops across the junctions due to the contact resistivity (ρ c). In the simulation, ρ c is considered as a tunneling resistivity arising from the thin insulating layer (i.e. epoxy resin) between crossing CNTs –. Since 1 V voltage is assumed to apply across the domain, the inverse of the solution of the system of linear equations corresponds to the overall resistance of the network. This process is repeated to obtain 500 independent random instances, and an ensemble average of the resistance is calculated based on the set of tested samples between 30th percentile and 70th percentile. The simulation is conducted over different configurations of silica content, silica size, CNT content, and CNT dimension. For massive simulation, the source code is implemented in MATLAB parallel computing tool box.

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^b34be10d]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Optical phase singularities are zeros of a scalar light field. The most systematically studied class of singular fields is vortices: beams with helical wavefronts and a linear (1D) singularity along the optical axis. Beyond these common and stable 1D topologies, we show that a broader family of zero-dimensional (point) and two-dimensional (sheet) singularities can be engineered. We realize sheet singularities by maximizing the field phase gradient at the desired positions. These sheets, owning to their precise alignment requirements, would otherwise only be observed in rare scenarios with high symmetry. Furthermore, by applying an analogous procedure to the full vectorial electric field, we can engineer paraxial transverse polarization singularity sheets. As validation, we experimentally realize phase and polarization singularity sheets with heart-shaped cross-sections using metasurfaces. Singularity engineering of the dark enables new degrees of freedom for light-matter interaction and can inspire similar field topologies beyond optics, from electron beams to acoustics.

### A draft network of ligand-receptor-mediated multicellular signalling in human [^32d61ae1]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Receptors often evolved before their ligands

Using our reference ligand–receptor pairs and the protein age estimates, we examined whether the interacting partners appeared during the same evolutionary period as previously reported, or if one had preceded the other. We found that many cognate partners originated at the same phylostratum (273 pairs). However, we also observed an excess of 1,082 pairs where the ligand was younger than the receptor as compared with only 431 pairs where the ligand was older (Fig. 2). As ligands (median length 267 amino acids) are often shorter than receptors (median length 515 amino acids), we sought to exclude the possibility that length-related gene age estimate biases explain why ligands appeared to come after their cognate receptors. To address this, we generated a comparative matrix that consisted of interacting proteins extracted from HPRD (Supplementary Fig. 4), where one partner was shorter (lower quantile of all protein lengths) and the other was longer (upper quantile of all protein lengths). From this we found that in 1,933 out of 3,271 pairs the younger protein was shorter. Using a binomial one-sided test, adjusted for the length factor probability (1,933/3,271 = 0.591), we found that ligands are still significantly younger than their cognate receptors (P value < 0.001; 95% confidence interval [0.695, 1]). We also confirmed the trend held with other measures of protein age(Supplementary Fig. 4c, d), and thus can conclude that for the majority of ligand–receptor pairs the ligands appeared after their cognate receptors.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

### The structure of suspended graphene sheets [^1e3750e4]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

The recent discovery of graphene has sparked much interest, thus far focused on the peculiar electronic structure of this material, in which charge carriers mimic massless relativistic particles. However, the physical structure of graphene — a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice — is also puzzling. On the one hand, graphene appears to be a strictly two-dimensional material, exhibiting such a high crystal quality that electrons can travel submicrometre distances without scattering. On the other hand, perfect two-dimensional crystals cannot exist in the free state, according to both theory and experiment. This incompatibility can be avoided by arguing that all the graphene structures studied so far were an integral part of larger three-dimensional structures, either supported by a bulk substrate or embedded in a three-dimensional matrix. Here we report on individual graphene sheets freely suspended on a microfabricated scaffold in vacuum or air. These membranes are only one atom thick, yet they still display long-range crystalline order. However, our studies by transmission electron microscopy also reveal that these suspended graphene sheets are not perfectly flat: they exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening such that the surface normal varies by several degrees and out-of-plane deformations reach 1 nm. The atomically thin single-crystal membranes offer ample scope for fundamental research and new technologies, whereas the observed corrugations in the third dimension may provide subtle reasons for the stability of two-dimensional crystals.

### Multistable sheets with rewritable patterns for switchable shape-morphing [^368c08ab]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Flat sheets patterned with folds, cuts or swelling regions can deform into complex three-dimensional shapes under external stimuli 1–24. However, current strategies require prepatterning and lack intrinsic shape selection 5–24. Moreover, they either rely on permanent deformations 6,12–14,17,18, preventing corrections or erasure of a shape, or sustained stimulation 5,7–11,25, thus yielding shapes that are unstable. Here we show that shape-morphing strategies based on mechanical multistability can overcome these limitations. We focus on undulating metasheets that store memories of mechanical stimuli in patterns of self-stabilizing scars. After removing external stimuli, scars persist and force the sheet to switch to sharply selected curved, curled and twisted shapes. These stable shapes can be erased by appropriate forcing, allowing rewritable patterns and repeated and robust actuation. Our strategy is material agnostic, extendable to other undulation patterns and instabilities, and scale-free, allowing applications from miniature to architectural scales.

### Loop length change of an adjustable-length femoral cortical suspension device in anatomic rectangular tunnel anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and associated clinical outcomes [^0b37b41e]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate loop length changes of an adjustable femoral cortical suspensory fixation device and assess the clinical results after anatomic rectangular tunnel anterior cruciate ligament (ART-ACL) reconstruction with a bone-tendon-bone (BTB) graft.

Methods

The study included 50 patients who underwent ART-ACL reconstruction with a BTB graft fixed using the adjustable-length device BTB TightRope for femoral fixation between July 2013 and December 2014. Computed tomography examinations were performed at 1 and 12 weeks after the surgery. Loop length was measured in the reconstructed plane just parallel to the femoral tunnel, including the bone plug and the button. Measurement was performed thrice, and the mean value was used. Loop length change was defined as the difference in loop length between 1 and 12 weeks after the surgery. A paired t test was conducted with the effect size for statistical analysis. At 2 years postoperatively, clinical evaluations, including subjective and objective assessments, were performed.

Results

The mean loop lengths at 1 and 12 weeks were 25.77 ± 3.88 mm and 25.81 ± 3.89 mm, respectively, with a significant difference (P = 0.01). However, the effect size was 0.01, suggesting that the difference was not meaningful. The mean individual loop length change was 0.04 ± 0.13 mm. All individual loop length changes were within the measurement error range. At 2 years postoperatively, 49 patients (98%) were graded as normal or nearly normal according to the International Knee Documentation Committee form. The mean side-to-side difference in anterior laxity at manual maximum force was 0.2 ± 0.5 mm.

Conclusions

The loop length change of an adjustable-length femoral cortical suspension device was negligible after ART-ACL reconstruction with a BTB graft. This ART-ACL reconstruction with a BTB graft using an adjustable-length device could safely provide sufficient stability to the operated knee.

### Layer-by-layer self-assembly of pillared two-dimensional multilayers [^fc9e48a7]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The sheet resistances of MXene multilayers were measured by SourceMeter 2401 KEITHLEY, Beaverton through a 2-point probe technique. The samples were cut into defined dimensions of 1.5 cm length and 1 cm wide, and the short edges were coated with silver paste to avoid the contact resistance between the film and metal probe. The sheet resistance R s (Ω sq −1) and conductivity(S m −1) of MXene multilayers was calculated according to the following equations:where R is the resistance measured, W and L are the width and length of the real area measured, and d is the thickness of MXene multilayers.

Electromechanical properties of MXene multilayers on melamine foams was measured by placing the samples with flat surfaces against two plates of aluminum foils placed inside of an Instron 5594 universal testing machine (Instron Corporation, High Wycombe, UK), and connecting the foils to a multimeter to monitor the resistance change with the compressive strain. The back sides of aluminum foils were protected by insulating plastic sheets, and a velocity of 10% min −1 in compression and extension was chosen.

Synthesis of PVA/H 2 SO 4 electrolyte

1 g of PVA was added in 10 mL of Milli-Q water. The whole mixture was then heated up to 85 °C under stirring until the solution turned clear, and then cooled under ambient conditions. Subsequently, 3 g of concentrated H 2 SO 4 was added to the above solution and then stirred vigorously for 1 h at room temperature.

Fabrication of (MXene/TAEA) n -based electrodes

We fabricated the electrodes of the (MXene/TAEA) n on PET through tailoring the films to the desired shape (1 cm × 2 cm) and coating one end with the silver paste to decrease the contact resistance. The electrodes of (MXene/TAEA) n on nonwoven, and CNF aerogels were prepared as follows: The composites were first tailored to the desired shape, and then one end was connected with a strip of nickel foil using the silver paste. The contact point was protected using paraffin wax to prevent the electrolyte from the contact point.

### Recommendations for quantification methods during the performance of a pediatric echocardiogram: a report from the pediatric measurements writing group of the American Society of Echocardiography pediatric and congenital heart disease council [^afd9c649]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) size and function quantification — the recommended methods include a linear approach and a volumetric approach. The linear method uses measurement of short-axis diameters and wall thickness to calculate shortening fraction (SF) and the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening adjusted for heart rate and end-systolic wall stress from 2D short-axis images in parasternal or subxiphoid views. The volumetric method includes area measurements from 2D or 3D short-axis images, long-axis lengths from 2D or 3D long-axis images in apical 4-chamber or subxiphoid views, and calculation of volumes, ejection fraction (EF), and mass using 2D or 3D measurements. Extrapolation of EF from linear LV minor-axis diameters is discouraged. A relatively load independent contractility index relates the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening adjusted for heart rate to end-systolic wall stress and applies only when the LV is normally shaped.

### The terminal ediacaran tongshan lagerstätte from south China [^d88f35b3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Dozens of specimens, such as ESEN 0019 (Fig. 5g–h) have a spherocylindrical outline with a blunt distal end are comparable to rangeomorphs such as Charniodiscus based on broad morphology. The elliptical holdfast may reflect lateral compression during preservation. The width of the petalodium is equal to the diameter of the holdfast. Contrary to one petaloid on the left side, the two almost parallel longitudinal curves on the right side are likely an impression of the margins of two individual petaloids. The first-order branches are parallel to one another (Fig. 5i), while the second-order branches are perpendicular to or inclined relative to the first-order branches (Fig. 5j–k). Some annulation-like divisions on the second-order branches may represent the potential third-order branches (Fig. 5j–k). A circular spot, defined by a faint white margin at the center of the holdfast, represents the stem or stalk of the petalodium (Fig. 5h). As the petalodium and holdfast were compressed during preservation, whether a stem is present remains unclear. However, if a stem was originally present, the stem must have been short.

Another form with five specimens has the widest portion located on the lower part of its fusiform body (ESEN 0020; Fig. 6a–d). This form has a long tail-like distal end that is similar to Paracharnia. The first-order branches are parallel to each other (Fig. 6a–d) and some second-order branches (Fig. 6c) are distinct near the proximal portion of some primary branches. At the middle portion, the first-order branches of the petaloid meet at the mid-line (Fig. 6a–b). On the right side, a few parallel curves may represent the margins of several superimposed individual petaloids (Fig. 6b). Petaloid branches are clearly visible on both sides even if the whole body is slightly twisted. The proximal, elliptical end represents the holdfast because it stands out from the stalk region at the upper left corner. All these characters indicate it is a typical rangeomorph.

### 3D nanoprinting via spatially controlled assembly and polymerization [^8e4080eb]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

3D nanoprinting of structures

The capability to print 3D structures by design was also demonstrated, with representative 3D structures shown in Fig. 4. The first structure is a set of stacked grids: an array of 10 parallel lines, 100 µm long with 10 µm separation, were printed atop a pre-functionalized quartz surface. Then the same printing protocols were followed by delivering 10 lines of p(PEGA-co-HEANB) atop and perpendicular to the first array. As shown in Fig. 4A the outcome exhibited high fidelity when compared to the design, with completely parallel lines separated by designed periodicity and perpendicularity from one array to the next without distortion or fuzzy edges. The height of lines measured to be 26 and 34 nm, for the first and second arrays, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4B. The cross-section was 60 nm tall, consistent with the concept of stacking individually printed passes on top of one another and is shown more clearly in the 3D image in Fig. 4C. The printing of multiple layers of a square pattern one after another is shown in Fig. 4D. The structure was created by printing 10 consecutive squares atop each other with 30 µm side length. The resulting structure shows a 3D square with walls of 98 ± 12 nm in height and 2.3 ± 0.3 μm in width, showing that the continuous deposition of materials enables the formation of taller features when compared to a single deposition, with minimal distortion in the final structure. Another 3D structure demonstrated was the stacking of cuboids (Fig. 4E) atop one another, whose designed dimensions are summarized in Table 1. The base was a cuboid with designed dimensions of 40 μm × 40 μm × 40 nm. Stacking atop this cuboid was a smaller cuboid with 20 μm × 20 μm × 15 nm. At the top were four cones designed to be 15 nm tall and 400 nm wide. As shown in Fig. 4E and outlined in Table 1, the outcome faithfully followed the design. The base cuboid measured as 42.1 ± 1.6 μm × 41.2 ± 1.5 μm in lateral dimensions and 61 ± 5 nm tall, produced by printing 133 lines at 300 nm separation. The next cuboid atop of the center region of the base measured 21.5 ± 1.3 μm × 20.8 ± 1.4 μm × 15 ± 2 nm created by printing 40 lines with 500 nm separation. The four cones are located at the center of the four quadrants atop the second cuboid. Each cone was produced by dispensing a droplet of liquid polymer with a contact time of 1 s under 200 mbar delivery pressure. The dimensions of the cones measured 340 ± 23 nm at the base and 17 ± 2 nm tall. The capability of printing 3D structures by design has been demonstrated by other designs and using a variety of probes (Supplementary Figure 5). In all cases, the neat polymer ink crosslinked rapidly and maintained its stability for a minimum of 7 days. Additionally, depositing atop of this structure through the delivery of neat polymer does not alter the cured structures underneath. These observations further prove that our approach and materials enabled 3D nanoprinting by design.

### Multiple tipping points and optimal repairing in interacting networks [^48be4231]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The problem of optimal repairing

Knowing and understanding the phase diagram of interacting networks enable us to answer some fundamental and practical questions. A partially or completely collapsed system of n ≥ 2 interacting networks in which some of them are in the low activity state is a scenario common in medicine, for example, when diseases or traumas affect the human body and a few organs are simultaneously damaged and need to be treated, and the interaction between the organs is critical. It is also common in economics, when two or more coupled sectors of the economyexperience simultaneous problems, or when a few geographical clusters of countries experience economic difficulties. The practical question that arises is: what is the most efficient strategy to repair such a system? Many approaches are possible if resources are unlimited, but this is usually not the case and we would like to minimize the resources that we spend in the repairing process.

For simplicity, consider two interacting networks, both damaged (low activity). Is repairing both networks simultaneously the more efficient approach, or repairing them one after the other? What is the minimum amount of repair needed to make the system fully functional again? In other words, what is the minimum number of nodes we need to repair, to bring the system to the functional 11 ('up–up') state, and how do we allocate repairs between the two networks? An optimal repairing strategy is essential when resources needed for repairing are limited or very expensive, when the time to repair the system is limited, or when the damage is still progressing through the system, threatening further collapse, and a quick and efficient intervention is needed.

We show below that this problem is equivalent to finding the minimum Manhattan distance between the point in the phase diagram where the damaged system is currently situated and the recovery transition lines to the 11 region. The Manhattan distance between two points is defined as the sum of absolute horizontal and vertical components of the vector connecting the points, with defined vertical and horizontal directions. It is a driving distance between two points in a rectangular grid of streets and avenues. In our phase diagram, it is equal to. It turns out that two triple points of the phase diagram play a very important role in this fundamental problem. We find that these special points have a direct practical meaning and are not just a topological or thermodynamic curiosity.

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^d73719c8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Comparison between phase gradient maximization and field minimization to obtain phase singularities.

Both methods can be used to obtain phase singularities, but they produce different field behavior in terms of its real (blue) and imaginary (red) zero-isosurfaces. Yellow dots label the positions at which the field and phase gradients are optimized. Inset surface plots are the logarithmically scaled field intensities at z = 0 μm over the same XY domain. The z = 0 μm plane is indicated with the gray plane in each isosurface plot. a When the phase gradient in a specified direction is maximized, the two zero-isosurfaces align approximately tangentially and in the direction normal to that specified gradient. This produces a flat low field intensity structure along these aligned zero-isosurfaces. b Minimizing the field amplitude at a point to produce a singularity merely enforces a crossing of the zero-isosurfaces without any alignment, producing a 1D line singularity. c Simultaneously optimizing two nearby points with directed phase gradients can extend the range of the singularity sheet. d Minimizing the field amplitude at two points simultaneously does not guarantee alignment of the zero-isosurfaces and can instead produce multiple crossing lines, each producing a 1D line singularity.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^79b1194c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

### The American Venous Forum, American Vein and Lymphatic Society and the Society for Vascular Medicine expert opinion consensus on lymphedema diagnosis and treatment [^5aeb6c98]. Phlebology (2022). High credibility.

Lymphedema compression garments — circular knit and flat knit characteristics and selection are contrasted as follows: Circular knit garments are seamless and generally not as dense or stiff as flat knit garments, and these garments are typically the first line of compression garments used by patients with relatively mild swelling and normal shaped legs. Flat knit machines create a sheet of fabric that must be cut and sewn, and this process allows for customization to accommodate any shaped leg; clinical indications for flat knit garments include significant differences in leg circumference as well as deep skin folds and edema of the toes/forefoot. However, these garments tend to be significantly more expensive which is often a barrier to acquisition. The prevailing opinion that flat‑knit garments offer intrinsically better containment was challenged by an International Compression Club study concluding the dynamic stiffness of circular and flat knit fabrics are not different. Practical considerations include patient compliance, cost, and reimbursement.

### The pyramid chin augmentation: a new technique [^7ac25387]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The surgical approach to chin for esthetical purpose can be isolated or in a combination with other treatments like maxillomandibular surgery. Both possibilities include sliding genioplasty or implants of autologous or alloplastic materials. In this article, the authors present their new technique, the Pyramid Chin Augmentation. In January 2020, a 40-year-old male patient came to authors' observation asking for a great augmentation in the sagittal dimension of the chin, a better pronunciation of mandibular angles and of his cheekbones. The surgical treatment consisted in three different procedures at the same time: a chin wing osteotomy, a Pyramid Chin Augmentation and zygomatic PEEK custom-made malar implants. The pyramid was created on the body of the chin wing with a cortical bone graft from the oblique line of the ascending ramus of the mandible. The harvested bone was cut into strips of rectangular shape gradually shorter to be superimposed on the wing forming a pyramid. A fixation with 2 screws was performed and then was necessary to smoothen the edges of the bone layers. The result immediately after the end of the surgery was in line with the set goals. The mandibular angles were more prominent, the chin was more sagittal pronounced, and there was no evidence of depression in the symphysial region. The Pyramid Chin Augmentation Technique can be a valid tool in chin augmentation surgery and can also represent an effective procedure in the finishing touch of other facial surgery techniques.

### Identifying the optimal hand placement site for chest compression by measuring hand width and sternal length in young adults [^dd9094cc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

There are no specific guidelines regarding the exact hand placement location for effective chest compressions. This study was designed to identify the optimal hand placement site over the chest during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Methods

The sternal length (SL) of young Korean adults was measured as the distance from the suprasternal notch (SN) to the lower end of the sternum. In addition, the heel width of the hand (H) was measured 1 cm (H1) and 2 cm (H2) distal to the proximal end of the carpal bones.

Results

A total of 300 men and 300 women were enrolled. SL positively correlated with height (R(2) = 14.2), weight (R(2) = 15.3), BMI (R(2) = 10.3), H1 (R(2) = 3.4), and H2 (R(2) = 5.0). Mean H2 and half of the SL (SL/2) for the subgroups were M 8.4 and 10.1 cm, M' 8.3 and 9.7 cm, W 7.6 and 10.1 cm, and W' 7.4 and 9.5 cm, respectively (M, men taller than the mean; M', men shorter than the mean; W, women taller than the mean; W', women shorter than the mean). Mean H2 in men was 1.1 to 1.6 cm shorter than SL/2, whereas mean H2 in women was 2.2 to 2.9 cm shorter than SL/2.

Conclusions

To find the most optimal chest compression point, from the patients' left side, CPR providers need to palpate the SN using the right little finger and placing the left heel one heel width (H2) from the SN. From the patient's right side, CPR providers should use the left little finger to palpate the SN and place the right heel one heel width (H2) from the SN.

### Closing the gap towards super-long suspension bridges using computational morphogenesis [^0b167599]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Topology optimization

The objective of the optimization is to maximize the stiffness of the center section of the model for a given amount of material, which during optimization is distributed in the interior of the design domain (marked with orange in Supplementary Fig. 1). The problem is solved based on the assumption of static, linear-elastic behavior. The governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved using the finite element method, using eight-node hexahedral iso-parametric elements, resulting in the following linear system of equations:Here K (ρ) is the stiffness matrix given as a function of the design variable vector ρ, u is the displacement vector, and F is the load vector. Each mesh element is assigned a single artificial continuous density, ρ e ∈[0, 1], collected in vector ρ, defined in a range from void (0) to solid material (1). The density-based topology optimization method SIMP(Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) is used, as this enables the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms. The element stiffness is defined by a smooth interpolation between the solid material stiffness, E solid, and a very weak material (E void = 10 −6 E solid), given by the modified SIMP schemeasHere p > 1 is a penalization parameter enforcing almost discrete final designs with ρ e being either 0 or 1, hence, the impractical intermediate densities are penalized and made unfavorable. The stiffness matrix can thus be assembled in the standard way asHereis the element stiffness matrix with unit modulus of elasticity and n is the number of elements in the mesh. Before stating the mathematical optimization problem, the objective function is introduced as compliance (work done by external forces) of only the center section of the model, C = u T F, which is inversely proportional to structural stiffness. Hence, to maximize structural stiffness, the following minimization problem is posed:Here ϕ is the sum of compliances from L load cases, weighted by the scaling factors a i. The first constraint ensures mechanical equilibrium; the second poses a limit on the amount of available material, with V (ρ) being the volume of the current structure and V * the maximum amount of available material and the third defines box constraints on the design variables. To avoid well known, but undesirable effects inherent in topology optimization, such as checkerboards and mesh-dependencies, a filteringof the densities is performed after each optimization iteration. Here, the density filter from ref. an image processing type convolution filter, is applied. Hence, the filter modifies each density as a weighted average of the adjacent densities, given by a filter radius. The filter is thus a method to smoothen the boundaries of the structure. A filter radius of 1.5 times the maximum dimension of a mesh-element is used. Finally, a fully parallelized version of the gradient-based method of moving asymptotes (MMA,) is used as the optimization algorithm.

### The biomechanical results of total hip resurfacing arthroplasty [^644d6aca]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Background

With the advent of more wear-resistant bearings, there is renewed interest in resurfacing total hip arthroplasty. However, there is a paucity of information on the biomechanical results of this type of arthroplasty compared with those of contemporary total hip arthroplasty.

Methods

Using standardized radiographs, we measured and compared the biomechanical parameters that affect the hip joint reactive forces in fifty hips that had a metal-metal surface replacement with those parameters in forty hips that had a contemporary cementless total hip replacement performed during the same time-period by the same surgeon.

Results

On the average, the arthritic hips that were treated with metal-metal surface replacement had had a more valgus preoperative neck-shaft angle and less horizontal femoral offset than the normal, contralateral hips (p = 0.0003). After both the metal-metal surface replacements and the cementless total hip replacements, the hip center of rotation was medialized by approximately 6 mm. Both procedures were associated with an average increase in limb length of approximately 3 or 4 mm. After the metal-metal surface replacements, the horizontal femoral offset was essentially equal to the preoperative value, but both values averaged about 8 mm less than those on the normal, contralateral side (p < 0.00001). In the hips with a conventional total hip replacement, the horizontal femoral offset increased an average of 9.5 mm compared with the preoperative value and was an average of 5 mm more than that for the normal, contralateral hip (p = 0.001).

Conclusions

The biomechanical results of total hip resurfacing depend on the preoperative anatomy of the proximal part of the femur. Limb lengthening of 1 cm can be achieved, but horizontal femoral offset is essentially unchanged by hip resurfacing. Horizontal femoral offset can be increased reliably with a contemporary total hip replacement. Arthritic hips of limbs that are more than 1 cm shorter than the contralateral limb or that have a comparatively low horizontal femoral offset may be better served by a contemporary total hip replacement. These biomechanical limitations should be considered in the selection of hips for resurfacing.

### Comparisons of the segments of left-sided double-lumen tracheobronchial tubes as industrial products [^60db9430]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Measurement of length of the cuff and tip of the bronchial segment of the tubes

One of the most important bronchial segments is "A = (a + b)" (Fig. 1) because of its involvement in the margin of safety. The margin of safety for a DLT is the length of the tracheobronchial tree between the most distal and proximal acceptable positions. If the length of the cuff plus the tip exceeds that of the left main bronchus, the left upper lobe bronchus will be occluded. Benumof et al. concluded that the bevel of the left lumen tip of a left-sided tube should be made shorter and closer to the left endobronchial cuff, and the left lumen cuff should be narrower. The 35 and 37 Fr Bronchopart® tubes were considered the most advantageous because "A" was the shortest in these tubes (Table 4).

In 2006, Partridge et al. measured bronchial cuff and bronchial tip lengths on 220 used left DLTs from four manufacturers. The largest cuff-tip length (40 mm) was found in the Portex (Blue Line™) 41 Fr tube, but the cuff-tip lengths of some 41 Fr tubes from each manufacturer were 33 mm or greater, longer than the shortest left main bronchus as measured by Benumof et al. With the shortest cuff-tip length of the DLTs examined, the Rüsch (Bronchopart®) would appear to be advantageous. Marked variations were found in the cuff-tip lengths of tubes of the same size from the same manufacturer, with the largest variation (18 mm) found in the Portex 41 Fr tube. At least one French size of each of the manufacturers' DLTs showed substantial variation of 8 mm or more. Partridge et al. concluded that users must understand that cuff-tip length can vary significantly, and they must match the chosen tube to the patient to preserve an adequate margin of safety. The results of the study of Partridge et al. were similar with ours (Fig. 1, Table 4).

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^fbef3263]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the accuracies of the previously proposed square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics for estimating length-type geographic atrophy (GA) growth rates.

Design

Cross-sectional and simulation-based study.

Participants

Thirty-eight eyes with GA from 27 patients.

Methods

We used a previously developed atrophy-front growth model to provide analytical and numerical evaluations of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted growth rate metrics on simulated and semisimulated GA growth data.

Main Outcome Measures

Comparison of the accuracies of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics on simulated and semisimulated GA growth data.

Results

Analytical and numerical evaluations showed that the accuracy of the perimeter-adjusted metric is affected minimally by baseline lesion area, focality, and circularity over a wide range of GA growth rates. Average absolute errors of the perimeter-adjusted metric were approximately 20 times lower than those of the square-root-transformed metrics, per evaluation on a semisimulated dataset with growth rate characteristics matching clinically observed data.

Conclusions

Length-type growth rates have an intuitive, biophysical interpretation that is independent of lesion geometry, which supports their use in clinical trials of GA therapeutics. Taken in the context of prior studies, our analyses suggest that length-type GA growth rates should be measured using the perimeter-adjusted metric, rather than square-root-transformed metrics.

### Polygonal non-wetting droplets on microtextured surfaces [^ca861d9b]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 6
Evolution of the morphology and spreading priority of the contact line on surfaces with a triangular cross-section of the pillars and various arrangements of the arrays.

The red arrows represent the block directions. a The liquid spreads synchronously (Supplementary Movie 4). b One side (top side) of the square liquid moves along the direction (yellow arrow) pointing at one vertex of a single pillar (Supplementary Movie 1). Scale bar of the pillars, 20 μm. Scale bar of the droplet patterns, 250 μm.

However, open questions remain. As shown in Fig. 1, it seems that the droplet seeks regular square (Fig. 1b (iii)), triangular (Fig. 1c) and hexagonal (Fig. 1 (d)(iii)) shapes only for square, triangular and hexagonal pillars arranged on arrays having the same symmetry. For other cases, irregular liquid films form. For instance, as shown in Fig. 5b, pillars with the circular cross-sectional area are employed. Even the pillars are arranged in hexagonal arrays, when the droplet was more compressed, its shape deviates more from a regular hexagon. There are many factors that may account for the morphology evolution of the liquid film. The inevitable existence of contact angle hysteresis and contact line pinning may play a non-negligible role for the anisotropic spreading of the liquid film. Moreover, when the symmetry of the cross-sectional area of individual pillars is not consistent with the symmetry of the array of the pillars (e.g. Fig. 1b (i)(ii), Fig. 1d (i)(ii)(iv)), anisotropic energy barriers generate in different spreading directions of the contact line that, in turn, exacerbates the asymmetric evolution of the liquid film. In the experiment, concerning the transverse size (10 2–10 3 μm) of the compressed liquid film is more than one order of magnitude compared to its thickness (~ 10 μm), it is very challenging to make the upper glass plate and lower pillared surface perfectly parallel to each other. In addition, the upper superhydrophobic glass plate may not be sufficiently flat after being coated by a layer of the commercial coating agent. Detailed study of these influences and the evolution of the droplet would deserve a dedicated study, and more work would be required to clarify the reason accounting for the asymmetry of the droplet pattern. Lastly, similarity and difference between water and liquid metal, as well as the above influences, remain to be further understood and explored.

### Shape-assisted self-assembly [^ab0a009c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

When one associates curvature to shape, three classifications can be envisioned molecularly: zero, positive, and negative curvatures. Flat molecules (zero curvature) are frequently observed in supramolecular polymerizations due to ease of access to these structures synthetically –. Bowl shapes (positive), and more so saddles (negative), are far less commonly used topographies for the opposite reason. Yet, to introduce order in an assembly, negatively curved systems stand out as preferred candidates to induce eclipsed stacking because transverse rigidity is increased on both molecular and macroscopic scales. Asymmetry in saddle design, in addition to replacing a uniform surface with a framework scaffold, heightens the entropic barriers further due to unequal axes of principal curvature (Fig. 1). An energetic minimum can then be reached with eclipsing negatively curved frames such that small deviations from overlap demand high energetic penalties and, consequently, enforce order. Depending on the asymmetry of the saddle, their assemblies likely present differentiated lateral interactions permitting the formation of tertiary structures. However, the path towards these molecular topologies is not trivial: seven- or eight-membered rings are often required as the centerpiece of a saddle design but are challenging synthetic constructs to work around. Five-membered rings, which would ordinarily foster bowl shapes, can be faced opposite to one another to devise 'non-classical' saddles. In the absence of central polygons, this shape can also be achieved through distortions in normally planar architectures due to coordination or steric crowding –. Consideration of these design principles and the available synthetic methodologies convinced us that a contorted porphyrinoid previously reported by Müllencould be tailored to become a versatile platform to explore shape-assisted linear stacking (Fig. 1).

### Challenges and opportunities for high-quality battery production at scale [^06035d19]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A final consideration is the inspection tests themselves (Fig. 6c). Of course, one of the most important attributes of a test is its ability to detect the defects and features of interest. By extension, the test method must be suitable for its location in the production process. Component tests may be more appropriate for inspecting upstream steps, such as electrode coating; however, testing the nearly complete product at the end of production may require more advanced characterization techniques for full-cell inspection. We summarize key attributes of battery quality inspection techniques in Table 1; specifically, ideal battery quality inspection techniques should be nondestructive, fast, inclusive of the full cell, and spatially resolved with high resolution.

Table 1
Key requirements of cell-level battery quality inspection techniques

Materials-level characterization techniques, such as electron microscopy, are excluded from this table. A test duration of ≤ 10 s is important so that a meaningful number of cells (≥ ~10k/day) can be sampled from production. Spatial resolution on the order of 10–100 µm is important for detecting many critical battery defects, such as electrode overhang violations, and metallic particle contaminants. All of these techniques are suitable for all major cell form factors (i.e. cylindrical, pouch, and prismatic), although geometrically larger cells are generally more difficult to image than smaller cells. In our opinion, an ensemble of complementary inspection techniques is the best defense against battery quality issues.

### Closing the gap towards super-long suspension bridges using computational morphogenesis [^eaf907a7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Since the opening of the Union Bridge on the Scotland–England border in 1820, suspension bridges have played a key role in civil infrastructure, facilitating fixed links on sites formerly separated by large distances or deep waters, and have become world-known landmarks such as the Brooklyn and Golden Gate Bridges. With the longest bridge spans doubling approximately every 50 years, soon passing 2 km, and with eight out of the ten longest spans in history constructed within the past 15 years, the evolution of bridges has been significant. However, since the 1950s, the conventional design concept for bridge girders, the orthotropic closed steel box-girder (Fig. 1 bottom left), has remained largely unchanged –, despite significant design challenges due to inherent fatigue issues, (the phenomenon of failure from repeated cyclic loading). The simple and manufacturing friendly plate-based concept consists of outer skin plates stiffened longitudinally by troughs and transversely by diaphragms every 4–5 m, built with either trusses or solid plates ("conventional design" shown in Fig. 2 and indicated by blue in Fig. 1). Consequently, loads are carried indirectly in a non-natural zig-zag fashion, from bridge deck to hangers, causing stress concentrations and eventually, fatigue problems.

In the background, the Osman Gazi Bridge is shown with an indication of the main span of 1550 m. Insert in the lower left shows a conventional girder section of the Osman Gazi Bridge with truss diaphragms.

The conventional design (blue) and the interpreted design (red), extracted from the optimization result, are shown in each of the two center sections, respectively. Here, the fixed top layer is removed to reveal the internal details.

### Practical lessons for phone-based assessments of learning [^b50001ed]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

We complement our data from these phone assessments with data from face-to-face assessments, also collected in Botswana, but before schools were shut down for the pandemic. This included two assessments, both conducted in schools between February and March of 2020 with 1080 students in grades 3–5. In the first, classroom teachers evaluated a 'problem of the day'. Specifically, one problem would be assigned to the whole class and students sit on the floor at arms-length from their classmates to ensure they respond individually. The teacher reads a problem out loud or puts it on the board. Students proceed to write the problem and their response in an individual booklet. When they are finished, they raise their hand and the teacher collects the booklet. After class, the teacher flips through all booklets and marks whether the problem was correct in a scoring sheet, as well as the type of problem using a defined scheme (eg, addition, subtraction; one-digit or two-digit; with or without borrowing and so on) as well as a subjective rate for the level of difficulty of the problem. The problems-of-the-day were administered daily for a period of 15 days, recorded in individual student booklets and compiled by student and class. To the same sample of students, we administered the more comprehensive Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) test of numeracy.

### Moving through capacity space: mapping disability and enhancement [^e5b2720c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

In this paper, we highlight some problems for accounts of disability and enhancement that have not been sufficiently addressed in the literature. The reason, we contend, is that contemporary debates that seek to define, characterise or explain the normative valence of disability and enhancement do not pay sufficient attention to (1) a wide range of cases, and (2) the transition between one state and another. In section one, we provide seven cases that might count as disability or enhancement. We explain why (with the exception of the first two, which lay the groundwork for the others) each case might count, and on what basis, and why it is been neglected. Each case is explained as a transition in what we call capacity space. We then argue that no definition of disability or enhancement addresses all of these cases, except for strict welfarist accounts of disability that do not rely on a depiction of any particular capacity. We argue further, however, that this is a serious deficiency of welfarist conceptions of disability. We then address objections to our account.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^bbe59950]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Analytical issues of cardiac troponins — The analytical sensitivity (limit of detection [LoD]) of cTnI and cTnT assays varies 10-fold, and because assays are not standardized, values from 1 assay cannot be directly compared with those from another assay. The current guidelines accommodate all assays, whether hs-cTn, contemporary (conventional) cTn, or point of care (POC) cTn; while hs-cTn assays are able to measure relatively low values and document small increases above the 99th percentile URL, many contemporary and POC cTn assays may not detect small increasing values within the reference interval or slightly above the 99th percentile URL, leading to substantial differences in the frequency of events based solely on the cTn assay used. At present, International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) guidelines support the concept that hs-cTn assays are differentiated by their ability to measure cTn values above the assay's LoD in > 50% of healthy individuals. It is recommended that values for cTn assays be reported as whole numbers in nanograms per litre to avoid interpretation problems associated with multiple zeros and decimal points that can often result in confusion, clinicians should avoid mixing the units from contemporary assays with those from hs-cTn assays, and all assays, including cTn assays, have some analytical problems resulting in false-positive and false-negative results, but these are uncommon (< 0.5%). When values are elevated, analytical variation is less and a value of 20% can be used to determine that values are stable in the proper clinical context.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9470949b]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) internal linear dimensions — Linear internal measurements of the LV "should be acquired in the parasternal long-axis view carefully obtained perpendicular to the LV long axis, and measured at the level of the mitral valve leaflet tips", and electronic calipers "should be positioned on the interface between myocardial wall and cavity and the interface between wall and pericardium". Techniques include M-mode tracing and 2D-guided linear measurements; M-mode advantages are "Reproducible", "High temporal resolution", and "Wealth of published data", with limitations "Beam orientation frequently off axis" and "Single dimension, i.e., representative only in normally shaped ventricles". For 2D-guided linear measurements, an advantage is "Facilitates orientation perpendicular to the ventricular long axis", with limitations "Lower frame rates than M-mode" and "Single dimension, i.e., representative only in normally shaped ventricles".

Left atrial (LA) size — internal linear dimensions are described for echocardiography. The anteroposterior diameter of the left atrium can be measured in the parasternal long-axis view perpendicular to the aortic root long axis, and measured at the level of the aortic sinuses by using the leading-edge to leading-edge convention. Advantages listed include high temporal resolution and a wealth of published data, while limitations include that a single dimension is not representative of actual LA size (particularly in dilated atria), lower frame rates than in M-mode, and single dimension only; facilitative features include orientation perpendicular to the LA posterior wall.

### Predicting meniscal tear stability across knee-joint flexion using finite-element analysis [^4ee196f3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Longitudinal tears

The introduction of longitudinal tears for the most part did not alter the hoop stresses across the width of the menisci from those of the intact case. However, hoop stresses adjacent to a tear tended to be redirected to run parallel to the tear surfaces. This redirection was not equal on the two sides of the tear, resulting in a difference in stress across the tear interface. When stress at the outer surface was greater than the inner surface, the difference was deemed favourable, as the tear surfaces would be compressed together (Fig. 4 a). When the stress on the inner surface was higher, the result was deemed unfavourable, as the surfaces were pulled apart (Fig. 4 b). Shorter tears had more favourable differences than longer tears. Favourable differences were higher in the LM and fluctuated least in the midsections of the menisci (Fig. 5).

### Plaque distribution correlates with morphology of lenticulostriate arteries in single subcortical infarctions [^12122cb0]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

LSA Morphometry

LSA images were generated using coronal minimum intensity projection with 10 to 20 mm thickness on WB-VWI. To delineate the distributions of the LSAs, signal measurements of the LSAs were performed on the consecutive minimum intensity projection images, ensuring the vascular skeleton by manually tracing reflected the full length of the visualized LSAs. An LSA tracing continued only when the artery could be demonstrated as a continuous, linear low signal and clear contrast with surrounding tissue, and pointed toward the anterior perforated substance. The morphological characteristics of the visible LSAs were quantitatively analyzed on both the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides on the coronal slab minimum intensity projection image, including the number of stems and branches, length, distance, and tortuosity. Stems were defined as the portion of the LSAs that originated directly from the MCA. Branches are defined as daughter vessels originating from parent LSA stems or as stems with no branches (single vessel). LSA stems 5 mm or more in length were included for analysis. When an artery branched within 5 mm of the origin of the MCA, each stem was counted separately, because > 70% of branches were found to originate from common trunks. When an artery branched at a more distal site, the stem was counted and measured using the longest branch. The LSA tortuosity was defined as the ratio of 2 measurements: the actual path length divided by the linear distance. The schematic in Figure 2 illustrates the method used for counting stems and branches and for measuring LSAs.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic Disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^55ed7070]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Recommendations for aortic imaging techniques to determine presence and progression of aortic disease — measurement and reporting are as follows. In patients with known or suspected aortic disease, aortic diameters should be measured at reproducible anatomic landmarks perpendicular to axis of blood flow, and these measurement methods should be reported in a clear and consistent manner; in cases of asymmetric or oval contour, the longest diameter and its perpendicular diameter should be reported (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In patients with known or suspected aortic disease, episodic and cumulative ionizing radiation doses should be kept as low as feasible while maintaining diagnostic image quality (COR 1, LOE C-LD). In patients with known or suspected aortic disease, when performing CT or MR imaging, it is recommended that the root and ascending aortic diameters be measured from inner-edge to inner-edge, using an electrocardiographic-synchronized technique; if there are aortic wall abnormalities, such as atherosclerosis or discrete wall thickening (more common in the distal aorta), the outer-edge to outer-edge diameter should be reported (COR 1, LOE C-EO). In patients with known or suspected aortic disease, the aortic root diameter should be recorded as maximum sinus to sinus measurement; in the setting of known asymmetry, multiple measurements should be reported, and both short- and long-axis images of the root should be obtained to avoid underestimation of the diameter (COR 1, LOE C-EO). In patients with known or suspected aortic disease, it is reasonable that a dilated root or ascending aorta be indexed to patient height or BSA in the report, to aid in clinical risk assessment (COR 2a, LOE C-LD). In patients with known or suspected aortic disease, when performing echocardiography, it is reasonable to measure the aorta from leading-edge to leading-edge, perpendicular to the axis of blood flow (COR 2a, LOE C-EO); using inner-edge to inner-edge measurements may also be considered, particularly on short-axis imaging (COR 2b, LOE C-EO).

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^a04324e0]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided needle visualization — transducer orientation and oblique cross-cut artifact — notes that when the transducer lies over but is not colinear with the needle, the image may show only part of the shaft and create an "oblique cross-cut" artifact that gives a false impression of the tip's location; the transducer must be rotated to ensure colinearity with the shaft, at which time the tip can be definitively identified. The clinician can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, and when the correct diagnosis is chosen (in this case, clockwise) the shaft will elongate on the screen, whereas an incorrect direction (counterclockwise) will cause the shaft to shorten. A correlative image shows the shaft on the right side marked by yellow arrows, highlights that the echogenic superficial border ends at the green arrow, and warns that without rotating to ensure maximal colinearity this portion may be mistaken for the tip of the needle.

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^352c3afb]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Engineered phase-singularity sheet

As a proof-of-concept for singularity sheet engineering, we design a 2D phase-singularity sheet with a heart-shaped cross-section (Fig. 3). The heart-shaped singularity is centered at z = 10 mm and is designed for the scalar field associated with the x -polarized electric field at λ 0 = 532 nm emitted from a 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm patterned aperture. The paraxial scalar field approximation (qualitatively supported by the propagation distance to the target plane being much larger than the aperture size) is justified by a full vectorial propagationof the electromagnetic fields, which shows that the time-averaged energy density associated with the y (transverse) and z (axial) polarization components over the volume of interest is much smaller (in this case, < 0.05%) than that of the x -polarization. The sheet singularity is constructed by maximizing the phase gradient in the directions oriented normally to a heart-shape at the target z = 10 mm plane. The free parameters are the propagation phase delay (from 0 to 2 π) at each pixel on the patterned aperture located at z = 0 mm. The optimized phase pattern is shown in Fig. 3b and does not exhibit any discernible long-scale pattern apart from a series of concentric rings, which appear to apply a focusing effect. Figure 3a shows a field intensity isosurface of the singularity profile to depict its orientation in 3D space (real and imaginary zero-isosurfaces are plotted in Supplementary Fig. 3), along with the locations and directions at which the phase gradient maximization was performed. This surface represents the points at which the phase gradient is very large, nearly reaching 100 times the wavenumber k 0. Simulated cross-sectional intensity and phase plots at the z = 10 mm plane are depicted in Fig. 3d, g, respectively. There is a visible phase jump of π radians across the singularity boundary as the field changes sign. The phase profile is in fact continuously differentiable with a well-defined phase gradient and just achieves a large gradient value at the singularity boundary. In Fig. 3c, we plot this phase gradient magnitude |∇ ⊥ ϕ | 2 = (∂ x ϕ) 2 + (∂ y ϕ) 2 profile alongside the intensity and phase profiles for the linear cut indicated in Fig. 3d. These profiles are qualitatively similar to those of a transverse cut through the singular optical axis of a fundamental LG 0,1 vortex beam of the same wavelength (with a beam waist diameter equal to the diagonal of the 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm square aperture), which are plotted using dotted lines in Fig. 3c. The transverse phase gradient over the transverse plane is plotted in Supplementary Fig. 4. This phase gradient achieves large magnitudes near the heart-shaped boundary and even exceeds k 0 by an order of magnitude, thereby exhibiting superoscillatory behavior. The longitudinal behavior of this cut profile with z is displayed in Supplementary Fig. 5, which shows that |∇ ⊥ ϕ | exceeds k 0 for a superoscillatory region ~150 μm in front of and behind the target z = 10 mm plane. The characteristic depth of this singularity sheet using this superoscillatory region is thus around 300 μm. The depth of a singularity sheet can be extended by maximizing the phase gradient over more than one transverse plane. We also exhibit additional phase-singularity sheet shapes (flat sheet and double-walled cylinders) in Supplementary Fig. 6 to demonstrate the versatility of this algorithm.

### The evolution and future of ACC / AHA clinical practice guidelines: a 30-year journey: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^fb0ebe7d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines — focused update criteria and process — specify that the criteria and considerations for new data include: publication of the full report (rather than the abstract) in a peer-reviewed journal; adequately powered RCT(s); important nonrandomized data that affect safety and efficacy assumptions; strengths/weaknesses of research methodology and findings; the likelihood that additional studies will influence the findings or conclusions; the impact on current performance measure(s) or the need to develop new measures; requests for review and update from the practice community, key stakeholders, and other sources free of bias or commercial relationships; the number of previous studies with consistent results; consistency with other CPGs or CPG revisions; and approval of new drugs, devices, or applications by the US Food and Drug Administration that have an impact on cardiovascular care. The document notes that initiation of a focused update does not imply that a recommendation must change, that with the exception of modified recommendations the full CPG remains current, and that recommendations in focused updates are current until superseded by another update or a full revision; since the publication of the first 2 focused updates in 2007, they have been created as stand-alone documents and are also incorporated into the full CPG, which is republished online or in print to produce a complete, comprehensive CPG.

### Balancing the anteroposterior diameters of the nostril lengths in cleft rhinoplasty [^6c36f7fc]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteocartilaginous deformities in cleft rhinoplasties may be restored with numerous techniques. However, the anteroposterior (AP) diameter lengths of the nostrils may still be unequal and should also be addressed. A technique was designed to balance nostril AP diameter lengths and apical shapes.

Materials and Methods

Balance between AP nostril diameters was accomplished by reduction of the AP diameter of the nostril at the non-cleft side by medial crural reduction and augmentation of the AP diameter of the nostril at the cleft side by three-parted mini-flap reconstruction at the soft triangle. The cleft-side AP diameter length was divided by the non-cleft-side AP diameter length of the same preoperative, per-operative and 1-year postoperative base view photographs of each patient, and "nostril balancing ratio" was obtained. The more this ratio was near to "one", the more the AP nostril diameters were equal.

Results

Seventy-eight unilateral-cleft rhinoplasty were performed between January/2019 and May/2022. Forty-two of them required nostril AP diameter equalization. Twenty-nine patients were female, thirteen were male. Thirty-three of them were operated for a primary cleft rhinoplasty. Nine of them for secondary cleft rhinoplasty. Mean age was 28 years (22–39 years). Mean follow-up was 25 months (6–40 months). The preoperative, per-operative and postoperative mean "nostril balancing ratios" were 0.714 (0.621–0.813), 0.743 (0.721–0.752) and 0.971 (0.943–0.976), respectively.

Conclusion

Balancing AP diameter symmetry with MCO at the non-cleft side and three-parted mini skin flap reconstruction at the cleft side may provide the satisfactory results. Three mini-flaps at the soft triangle may remold the nostril apex in an oval shape, which may result in a better shape symmetry.

### An ARF gene mutation creates flint kernel architecture in dent maize [^4d75d186]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

B73 kernels typically have a dented, collapsed starchy crown, with most of the hard, vitreous endosperm located on the abgerminal kernel side. In contrast, the top of fka1-1 kernels is convex and vitreous endosperm forms on both the abgerminal and adgerminal sides of the kernel (Fig. 1b). We measured the degree of dent in the crown (as indicated in Fig. 1b), and found the values on average for B73 and fka1-1 were + 41.50 and −3.33 degrees, respectively (Fig. 1c). fka1-1 kernels contain 157% more vitreous endosperm than B73 kernels (Fig. 1d) and thus are more resistant to breakage (Fig. 1e). The crown of the B73 kernel starts to flatten around 15 to 25 days after pollination (DAP), collapses around 30 DAP and by 35 DAP a dent is clearly evident (Fig. 1f). The dome-shaped crown of fka1-1 kernels is evident at 15 DAP and is maintained throughout grain filling and seed maturation (Fig. 1f). At every developmental stage, the length of the pericarp of fka1-1 kernels, measured from the abgerminal bottom to the crown and down to the adgerminal bottom (Fig. 1f), was shorter than that of B73 kernels (Fig. 1g). The length of fka1-1 kernels during grain filling and at maturity was always shorter than that of B73 (Supplementary Fig. 1a), while their width was only slightly and variably affected (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Despite the reduction in kernel length, there were not significant differences in 100-kernel dry weight during grain filling or at seed maturity (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 1c). In addition, fka1-1 kernels showed a lower moisture content and a higher test weight (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). Total starch content and total protein content (based on whole dry seed flour) were not affected by fka1-1 (Supplementary Fig. 1f, g). Besides the data from a field in Sanya (18.2°N, 109.3°E; Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 1a–e), similar results were obtained from a field in Shanghai (30.5°N, 121.1°E) for the kernel architecture phenotypes, 100-kernel dry weight, moisture content and test weight (Supplementary Fig. 1h–s).

### Novel reconstruction of orbicularis oris in unilateral complete cleft lip repair [^2ac7ec7c]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: Orbicularis oris muscle repair is key to successful unilateral cleft lip repair. Objective: To measure the lip symmetry after repair of the lip muscles in the midline compared with traditional repair on the cleft side. Methods: A retrospective review and photographic analysis of patients with complete cleft lip treated with the modified approach were carried out. Anthropometric analysis was done at pre-, immediate, and 1-year postoperatively, and at 1-year follow-up. Four upper lip and six nostril landmarks were measured. Results: Fourteen patients met inclusion criteria. Immediate postoperatively, the horizontal lip length on the cleft side was shorter than that on the noncleft side, but the discrepancy decreased as facial development progressed over the course of a year. Lip measurements at the 1-year follow-up were approximately symmetrical in vertical lip height, philtral height, and lateral lip height. Small changes in the nasal correction occurred at 1 year. Conclusion: A modified technique in the unilateral complete cleft lip repair seeks to balance the perinasal and perioral muscles and improve symmetric outcomes.

### Surgical and radiological studies on the length of the hepatic ducts [^dde84ebf]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Right-sided hepatectomy is often selected for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, due to the anatomic consideration that "the left hepatic duct is longer than that of the right hepatic duct". However, only one study briefly mentioned the length of the hepatic ducts. Our aim is to investigate whether the consideration is correct.

Methods

In surgical study, the lengths of the resected bile duct were measured using pictures of the resected specimens in 475 hepatectomized patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. In radiological study, the estimated lengths of the bile duct to be resected were measured using cholangiograms reconstructed from computed tomography images in 61 patients with distal bile duct obstruction.

Results

In surgical study, the length of the resected left hepatic duct was 25.1 ± 6.4 mm in right trisectionectomy (n = 37) and 14.9 ± 5.7 mm in right hepatectomy (n = 167). The length of the right hepatic duct was 14.1 ± 5.7 mm in left hepatectomy (n = 149) and 21.3 ± 6.4 mm in left trisectionectomy (n = 122). In radiological study, the lengths of the bile duct corresponding to the surgical study were 34.1 ± 7.8, 22.4 ± 7.1, 20.8 ± 4.8, and 31.6 ± 5.3 mm, respectively. Both studies determined that the lengths of the resected bile ducts were (1) similar between right and left hepatectomies, (2) significantly shorter in right hepatectomy than in left trisectionectomy, and (3) the longest in right trisectionectomy.

Conclusions

The aforementioned anatomical assumption is a surgeon's biased view. Based on our observations, a flexible procedure selection is recommended.
