## Question

Which antiplatelet medication is best for curing tuberculosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiplatelet medication is best for curing tuberculosis, a question that suggests antiplatelets might have antimicrobial efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which I need to scrutinize carefully. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard, evidence-based drug regimens that actually cure tuberculosis. Then, I should verify whether antiplatelet agents have any role in TB treatment or if their mention arises from a specific complication like tuberculous meningitis. Next, I should review the randomized evidence for aspirin or clopidogrel as adjuncts in TBM and whether they affect outcomes. After that, I need to check for clinically relevant drug–drug interactions between rifampin and antiplatelets and correct any misconceptions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear clinical answer and recommendations, ensuring I align with authoritative guidelines and high-quality trials.

> Let me first confirm the core premise: antiplatelet drugs do not cure tuberculosis, and they have no antimycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis; cure comes from multidrug anti-tuberculous therapy such as isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in drug-susceptible disease, whereas antiplatelets are indicated for vascular risk reduction in atherothrombotic conditions rather than for infectious pathogen eradication [^116RR7N2] [^111AgAdu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from mixed search results; I need to check why antiplatelets and anti-tuberculous drugs might appear together in the same context. Pyrazinamide and ethionamide are anti-tuberculous antibiotics, not antiplatelet agents, and their inclusion alongside aspirin or clopidogrel typically reflects the tuberculous meningitis literature where antiplatelets have been explored as adjuncts to reduce stroke risk, not to treat infection itself [^116RR7N2] [^115KstpJ].

> Next, I should review the standard of care for curing active, drug-susceptible TB to anchor the answer; the recommended first-line regimen is 2 months of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, with modifications for resistance patterns and comorbidities per CDC/ATS principles referenced in FDA labeling for pyrazinamide, and none of these roles are replaced by antiplatelets [^116RR7N2].

> I will now examine the specific reason antiplatelets appear in TB discussions: tuberculous meningitis is highly morbid with frequent cerebral infarction, and adjunctive antiplatelet therapy, particularly aspirin, has been hypothesized to mitigate ischemic complications given the prothrombotic milieu; however, I should confirm the magnitude and certainty of benefit from randomized evidence before considering any clinical implication [^115czHtc].

> Let me review the randomized data and not overstate effects; the ACT TBM randomized trial comparing add-on aspirin 75 mg or clopidogrel 75 mg versus standard therapy showed no significant reduction in clinical stroke, imaging infarction, mortality, or functional outcomes at one and three months, indicating no clear efficacy signal for routine use, which I should emphasize to avoid misapplication [^112PXTPf] [^111rZi4N] [^112CuiCk].

> Wait, let me verify the broader evidence synthesis; a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs in TBM found no significant reduction in mortality or composite mortality plus new stroke with aspirin, with a modest reduction in new stroke that was based on limited and heterogeneous trials, so routine antiplatelet use as adjunctive TBM therapy remains unsupported pending larger, definitive trials [^notfound].

> Now, I need to check drug–drug interactions and correct any misconceptions because this affects bedside decisions; I initially thought rifampin reduces clopidogrel activation by up to 75%, but wait, that sounds inconsistent with enzyme induction pharmacology — let me verify; in fact, rifampicin increases clopidogrel active metabolite exposure and enhances P2Y12 receptor blockade and inhibition of platelet aggregation, so my earlier statement was incorrect and I should correct it explicitly here, while still cautioning that potent rifampin induction creates complex interactions across antithrombotics warranting specialist oversight and bleeding vigilance during concomitant use [^112xZQtW] [^116Lqj8X] [^112pc8e8].

> Let me synthesize and ensure nothing critical is missed: there is no antiplatelet medication that cures tuberculosis, and antiplatelets are not part of TB curative regimens; for TBM, current randomized data do not support routine aspirin or clopidogrel to prevent stroke or improve survival, and any adjunctive antiplatelet consideration should be individualized in multidisciplinary care, with attention to interactions, bleeding risk, and the primacy of optimized anti-tuberculous therapy and adjunctive measures validated for TBM [^116RR7N2] [^112PXTPf] [^112pc8e8].

---

No antiplatelet therapy **cures TB**; only standard anti-tubercular regimens [^116RR7N2] eradicate Mycobacterium tuberculosis [^115KstpJ]. Antiplatelets like aspirin or clopidogrel **are not substitutes for anti-TB drugs** and do not improve microbiological cure or mortality. In TB meningitis, low-dose aspirin may reduce new strokes [^112pc8e8] but does not lower mortality [^112pc8e8], and clopidogrel offers no added benefit [^112PXTPf]. Antiplatelets are not recommended for TB treatment and should only be used for standard cardiovascular indications.

---

## Mechanism of action of antiplatelet therapy

Antiplatelet agents inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, reducing ischemic events in cardiovascular disease [^1114gdge]. They **do not have direct antimicrobial activity** against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB [^116ctQwr].

---

## Standard anti-tubercular therapy

The standard treatment for active TB involves a combination of anti-tubercular drugs, including [^116RR7N2]:

- **Isoniazid**
- **Rifampin**
- **Pyrazinamide**
- **Ethambutol**

These drugs are **administered in combination regimens** to effectively eradicate Mycobacterium tuberculosis and achieve microbiological cure [^115KstpJ].

---

## Role of antiplatelet therapy in tuberculosis

Antiplatelet therapy does **not have a direct role** in curing TB. However, it has been investigated as an adjunctive therapy in specific clinical scenarios, such as tuberculous meningitis (TBM), where it may potentially reduce the risk of ischemic stroke associated with TBM [^115czHtc].

---

## Clinical evidence on antiplatelet therapy in tuberculosis

Several clinical studies have **evaluated the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet therapy**, particularly aspirin, in TBM, including evidence that **aspirin in TBM** was associated with a significant reduction in new-onset stroke in a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (hazard ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.29–0.87, p = 0.01), although it did not significantly reduce mortality or the composite outcome of mortality and new-onset stroke [^112pc8e8], while **clopidogrel in TBM** was evaluated in the ACT TBM randomized trial, which found no significant difference in clinical stroke, radiological infarction, or mortality between clopidogrel, aspirin, and standard treatment groups [^112PXTPf].

---

## Safety considerations and drug interactions

Antiplatelet therapy carries a **risk of bleeding complications**, particularly in patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathies. Additionally, drug interactions between antiplatelet agents and anti-tubercular drugs, such as rifampin, may increase the risk of bleeding and other adverse effects [^112xZQtW].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend antiplatelet therapy** as a primary or adjunctive treatment for TB. Antiplatelet therapy is only recommended for specific cardiovascular indications and not for the treatment of infectious diseases such as TB.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Antiplatelet therapy **does not cure TB** and is not recommended as a primary or adjunctive treatment for TB. The standard treatment for TB involves combination anti-tubercular drug regimens, which are effective in eradicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antiplatelet therapy may have a limited role in specific clinical scenarios, such as reducing the risk of ischemic stroke in TBM, but it does not significantly impact overall mortality or cure rates in TB patients.

## References

### Pyrazinamide [^116RR7N2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Pyrazinamide is indicated for the initial treatment of active tuberculosis in adults and children when combined with other antituberculous agents. The recommendation of the CDC for drug-susceptible disease is to use a six-month regimen for the initial treatment of active tuberculosis, consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide given for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months. Patients with drug-resistant disease should be treated with regimens individualized to their situation. Pyrazinamide frequently will be an important component of such therapy.

In patients with concomitant HIV infection, the physician should be aware of the CDC's recommendations. It is possible these patients may require a longer course of treatment. Pyrazinamide is also indicated after treatment failure with other primary drugs in any form of active tuberculosis. It should only be used in conjunction with other effective antituberculous agents.

See recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and American Thoracic Society for complete regimen and dosage recommendations.

### Trecator [^115KstpJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Trecator is primarily indicated for the treatment of active tuberculosis in patients with M. tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid or rifampin, or when there is intolerance on the part of the patient to other drugs. Its use alone in the treatment of tuberculosis results in the rapid development of resistance. It is essential to administer a suitable companion drug or drugs, with the choice being based on the results of susceptibility tests.

If the susceptibility tests indicate that the patient's organism is resistant to one of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs (i.e. isoniazid or rifampin) yet susceptible to ethionamide, ethionamide should be accompanied by at least one drug to which the M. tuberculosis isolate is known to be susceptible. If tuberculosis is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin, yet susceptible to ethionamide, ethionamide should be accompanied by at least two other drugs to which the M. tuberculosis isolate is known to be susceptible.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Trecator and other antibacterial drugs, Trecator should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Patient nonadherence to prescribed treatment can result in treatment failure.

### Efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in tubercular meningitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Nx8us]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in tubercular meningitis, in addition to anti-tubercular therapy, did not show a significant reduction in mortality (primary outcome) or the composite outcome of mortality and new onset stroke. However, aspirin significantly reduced the incidence of new onset stroke compared to placebo in patients with tubercular meningitis [hazard ratio of 0.51 (95% CI 0.29–0.87, p = 0.01)], with a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) = 10. Sensitivity analyses by Mai et al. and Misra et al. also showed similar results; a significant reduction was not observed in mortality or composite outcomes, but there was a statistically significant reduction in new onset stroke with aspirin compared to placebo.

As a major complication of tubercular meningitis is cerebral stroke (with a reported incidence of approximately 13–57%), which can lead to poor clinical outcomes, and the mortality is about three times higher in young tubercular meningitis patients with stroke compared to those without, even an NNT of 10 could have potential clinical significance in terms of mortality reduction and prevention of new onset stroke, thus preventing disability.

Since tubercular meningitis is a hypercoagulable state with decreased protein S and increased factor VIII, aspirin, due to its antiplatelet action, can inhibit platelet aggregation at low doses (75–150 mg) and prevent ischemic cerebrovascular events such as new onset stroke. However, at high doses (> 150 mg), aspirin has anti-inflammatory action.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add-on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^112PXTPf]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

- **Summary**: The benefit of antiplatelet therapy for stroke prevention or treatment among patients with tubercular meningitis (TBM) is uncertain. We hypothesized that add-on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to standard treatment would be safe and effective in reducing clinical stroke and/or cerebral infarction in patients with TBM.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, open-label, superiority trial with blinded outcome assessment. Patients with suspected TBM were randomized to receive either add-on oral aspirin 75 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg along with anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) or only ATT. Clinical follow-up, MRI brain, and MR angiogram were performed at baseline, and at one and three months from randomization. The primary outcome was a reduction in the occurrence of clinical stroke and/or imaging-based cerebral infarction at one and three months. The safety outcome involved the occurrence of major or minor bleeding. Key secondary outcomes included mortality at one and three months and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at three months.

- **Findings**: A total of 237 patients with TBM were randomized (77 in the aspirin group, 77 in the clopidogrel group, and 83 in the standard treatment group). At one month, clinical stroke outcomes were available for 66 (85.7%), 72 (93.5%), and 69 (83.1%) patients respectively, and MRI brain scans were available for 61 (79.2%), 65 (84.4%), and 62 (74.7%) patients, respectively. Clinical stroke was observed in one patient (1.5%) in the aspirin group, none (0.0%) in the clopidogrel group, and in three patients (4.3%) in the standard group (across group comparison, p = 0.2). Imaging-based cerebral infarction was observed in six patients across groups, further details truncated.

### A phase 2A trial of the safety and tolerability of increased dose rifampicin and adjunctive linezolid, with or without aspirin, for human immunodeficiency virus-associated tuberculous meningitis: The LASER-TBM trial [^115czHtc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis (TB). With currently available treatment, mortality is high, up to 50% in those coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In those who survive, there is a high burden of disability due to neurological sequelae such as stroke, epilepsy, inflammatory complications within the spinal cord, and cognitive impairment. Drug regimens used to treat TBM are largely based on those used in pulmonary TB. There is a need to design and evaluate new regimens that account for the differing ability of drugs to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) while simultaneously counteracting the dysregulated immune response that occurs in TBM in order to improve outcomes for this disease.

Rifampicin at standard adult doses seldom achieves adequate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations; it is therefore likely that higher doses would increase CNS bactericidal activity. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in TBM have evaluated high-dose rifampicin (13 mg/kg intravenous [IV] and 15 mg/kg oral) with conflicting results. A recent pharmacokinetic (PK) study suggested that doses higher than 15 mg/kg may improve outcomes by demonstrating approximately 8-fold and approximately 6-fold higher CSF exposures with 35 mg/kg (oral) and 20 mg/kg (IV) doses, respectively, compared with the standard oral dose (10 mg/kg). Linezolid, now part of the World Health Organization recommended treatment in drug-resistant TB, is known to have broad tissue penetration, including into the CNS. Two observational studies of linezolid found favorable results in this context.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^111zjGFX]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). Low credibility.

At baseline, clinical stroke was noted in 40 patients (17%) out of 235 available records. Using an intention-to-treat approach following a complete cases analysis method, at one month, clinical stroke occurred in four patients (1.9%): one (1.5%) in the aspirin group, none in the clopidogrel group, and three (4.3%) in the standard treatment group. At three months, a new clinical stroke had occurred in five more patients (2.7%): two (3.3%) in the aspirin group, one (1.6%) in the clopidogrel group, and two (3.4%) in the standard treatment group. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of clinical stroke at both one month and three months across and between groups.

- **Occurrence of clinical stroke and imaging based cerebral infarction**:
	- At baseline, 215 CT scans and 225 MRI scans were available and detected 32 (14.8%) and 72 (31%) infarctions, respectively. MRI at one month was available for 188 patients and at three months for 172 patients. MRI detected new infarctions compared to the baseline in 21 (11.2%) patients: six (9.8%) in the aspirin group, eight (12.3%) in the clopidogrel group, and seven (11.3%) in the standard treatment group. At three months, MRI detected new infarctions compared to the MRI at one month in seven (4.1%) patients: two (3.5%) in the aspirin group, three (5.0%) in the clopidogrel group, and two (3.6%) in the standard treatment group. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of MRI-detected infarctions across groups.

Regarding medical management for peripheral artery disease, specifically concerning antiplatelet therapy, the 2022 CCS guidelines recommend considering initiating single antiplatelet therapy with either aspirin (75–325 mg) or clopidogrel (75 mg) in patients with symptomatic lower extremity PAD who are at high bleeding risk but remain eligible for antithrombotic therapy.

### Twelve months of isoniazid compared with four months of isoniazid and rifampin for persons with radiographic evidence of previous tuberculosis: an outcome and cost-effectiveness analysis [^117X15nh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Isoniazid taken daily for 12 months and isoniazid and rifampin taken daily for 4 months are both recommended options for patients with radiographic evidence of previous tuberculosis and positive tuberculin skin tests who have not had prior treatment. We compared the completion rates, number of adverse effects, and cost-effectiveness of these two regimens. Patients were treated at the San Francisco Tuberculosis Clinic from 1993 through 1996. A Markov model was developed to assess the impact on life expectancy and costs. One thousand twenty-two patients, with a mean age of 52 years, and more than 90% foreign-born, were treated; 545 received isoniazid, and 477 received isoniazid and rifampin. For isoniazid, 79.8% completed 12 months of therapy, and 4.9% had adverse effects versus 83.6% completion and 6.1% adverse effects for isoniazid and rifampin (p > 0.05 for all between-group comparisons). Both regimens increased life expectancy by 1.4 to 1.5 years. Compared with isoniazid, isoniazid and rifampin produced net incremental savings of $135 per patient treated. In patients with radiographic evidence of prior tuberculosis who have not been previously treated, isoniazid for 12 months and isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months have similar rates of completion and adverse effects, and both increase life expectancy compared with no treatment. Isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months is cost-saving compared with isoniazid alone. This advantage was maintained even when compared with 9 months of isoniazid, the new American Thoracic Society/Centers for Disease Control (ATS/CDC) recommendation for treatment with isoniazid alone.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^115AJ3Ke]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). Low credibility.

In this study of 237 patients with TBM, we found no significant difference in the rates of clinical stroke, radiological infarction, composite stroke and/or infarction, or mortality among the treatment groups.

Previous studies have been inconclusive regarding the efficacy of aspirin in TBM patients. Clopidogrel has never been tested previously among patients with TBM. Even if an effect exists, various factors in our patients might be responsible for an overall futility of the antiplatelet agents. We had most patients belonging to grade III (49%) severity of TBM, with prognostically poor outcomes; although, it could be assumed to be associated with a higher occurrence of vascular events, which could make the effect of intervention more apparent. This is likely due to the demographic distribution of TBM in Southeast Asia and the potential referral bias of the tertiary care centres.

Previous studies for the efficacy of aspirin in TBM patients had fewer patients of grade III TBM, for example, 12.7% and 12.5%, but even among patients with mild to moderate disease, these studies could not prove the efficacy of aspirin. One of the studies showed a reduction in the risk of stroke when aspirin was given in combination with steroids compared to ATT alone without aspirin or steroids. This finding may not be relevant currently as steroids are invariably added in the TBM treatment regimen among non-HIV patients. In the same trial, there was no difference between groups that used only aspirin as an add-on therapy with standard ATT compared to ATT alone.

This article discusses platelet-active drugs as part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. New data on antiplatelet agents include the following:

- **Role of aspirin in primary prevention**: Recommendations have been made based on the assessment of cardiovascular risk.

- **Interindividual variability and resistance**: There is an increasing number of reports suggesting substantial interindividual variability in the response to antiplatelet agents, along with various phenomena of "resistance" to the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and clopidogrel.

- **Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists**: The benefit/risk profile of currently available glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists is substantially uncertain for patients with acute coronary syndromes who are not routinely scheduled for early revascularization.

- **Aspirin and clopidogrel in long-term management**: There is an expanding role for the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel in the long-term management of high-risk patients.

- **Cardiovascular effects of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors**: The cardiovascular effects of selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have been the subject of increasing attention.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, specifically in relation to antiplatelet therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy for at least 12 months. This approach is suggested to reduce bleeding risk in selected patients with chronic coronary disease who have been treated with PCI and a drug-eluting stent, following a completed 1–3-month course of dual antiplatelet therapy.

### Tuberculosis control interventions targeted to previously treated people in a high-incidence setting: A modelling study [^115H84aE]. The Lancet Global Health (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our study provides impetus for further research to better understand the individual and population-level benefits of tuberculosis control interventions targeted at previously treated people. Studies and trials of the feasibility, safety, effect, and population-level impact of targeted active case finding and secondary isoniazid preventive therapy in previously treated individuals in high-incidence settings would be particularly useful.

Other interventions to prevent re-tuberculosis, such as adjuvant immunotherapy during tuberculosis treatment, extending the duration of tuberculosis treatment for certain high-risk patients, or post-treatment vaccination, might be considered in the future. Further mathematical modelling, which includes detailed costs of interventions, would be useful for policymakers as they could establish whether such interventions are cost-effective and how investment in these approaches may compare with alternatives.

### Economic implications of novel regimens for tuberculosis treatment in three high-burden countries: A modelling analysis [^11782vqc]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

Research in context

- **Evidence before this study**: Previous modelling analysis projected the health effects of novel tuberculosis treatment regimens meeting target profiles but did not incorporate costs. Studies have also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of specific regimens that are now in widespread use. To identify relevant cost-related studies of future novel regimens, a search was conducted in PubMed using the terms "tuberculosis OR tuberculosis" AND "cost OR economic" AND "novel OR improved" AND "model OR analysis OR estimate" AND "treatment OR therapeutic OR regimen". This search, performed on Jan 3, 2024, without language restrictions, focused on human studies published from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2023, yielding 156 studies. Several studies analyzed the cost or cost-effectiveness of existing regimens and programs for treating tuberculosis or interventions aimed at improving treatment programs without incorporating improved regimens. Three studies were identified that assessed the costs or cost-effectiveness of novel treatment regimens, all of which focused on shorter-duration regimens to treat rifampin-susceptible tuberculosis. Two studies found that shorter regimens with similar characteristics to the standard of care would yield substantial savings, whereas one study suggested that a less efficacious, higher-cost, shorter-duration regimen would not be cost-effective in South Africa but could improve treatment outcomes.

### Tuberculosis control interventions targeted to previously treated people in a high-incidence setting: a modelling study [^117SgAcm]. The Lancet Global Health (2018). Low credibility.

Although our projections are consistent with the epidemiology of tuberculosis in other high-incidence communities in South Africa, we expect interventions among previously treated people to be less effective in settings with lower tuberculosis incidence, and where a smaller proportion of the tuberculosis burden is attributable to former tuberculosis patients. For example, previously treated people accounted for 4.1% of the adult population and for 13% of prevalent tuberculosis cases in Lusaka, Zambia, and for 1.5% and 15%, respectively, in Nigeria — two settings with lower tuberculosis incidence than our study setting. Nonetheless, given that new approaches for tuberculosis control are most needed in areas where tuberculosis incidence has been persistently high, our results suggest that efforts to both prevent and rapidly detect and treat re-disease will produce important health benefits.

In our scenario analysis, for which we lowered the force of infection by 50%, we noted that targeted active case finding in combination with secondary isoniazid preventive therapy reduced the expected number of incident tuberculosis cases and deaths to a lesser extent, but still averted a third of incident cases.

Differences in the prevalence of HIV in a population might influence the effect of interventions targeted to previously treated people in several ways. Communities with higher HIV prevalence might experience more re-tuberculosis given the elevated risk of re-infection with tuberculosis among HIV-infected individuals, and thus benefit more from similar interventions.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, particularly in the context of antiplatelet therapy, the CAIC/CCS 2024 guidelines recommend initiating short dual antiplatelet therapy for 1–3 months rather than 6–12 months in patients at high bleeding risk undergoing elective PCI. Thereafter, maintenance with single antiplatelet therapy is recommended in patients who do not experience any ischemic or bleeding events in the first month.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^111rZi4N]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Mortality data was available for 226 patients at one month and for 198 patients at three months. There was no significant difference in mortality at one and three months' follow-up across the three groups and between groups [Table 3]. Using the intention-to-treat approach following a complete cases analysis method, at one month, a total of 18 patients (8.0%) died; seven (9.6%) in the aspirin group, four (5.3%) in the clopidogrel group, and seven (9.0%) in the standard treatment group. At three months, 13 new deaths (6.6%) were recorded; four (6.2%) in the aspirin group, four (5.9%) in the clopidogrel group, and five (7.6%) in the standard treatment group [Table 3].

A large number of patients remained dependent (mRS ≥ 2) in all treatment groups at three months [34 (48.0%), 30 (42.2%), and 34 (47.2%) in the aspirin, clopidogrel, and standard treatment groups respectively] and nine months [20 (30.8%), 21 (32.3%), and 21 (31.8%) in the aspirin, clopidogrel, and standard treatment groups respectively]. There was no significant difference in functional outcome at both one month and three months across the three groups and between groups [Table 3]. Moreover, no significant difference was observed between aspirin and clopidogrel groups (p⁴ in Table 3) in the occurrence of cerebral infarction or stroke, mortality, and functional outcome. Secondary outcomes using per protocol analysis did not differ from intention-to-treat analysis, except for functional outcome at three months in the adjusted model of relative risk [Table 3].

### Systematic review, meta-analysis, and cost-effectiveness of treatment of latent tuberculosis to reduce progression to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^115t36P8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence-based recommendations for treating individuals with presumed latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) after exposure to infectious multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) are lacking due to the limited size of existing observational studies. The incidence of tuberculosis among those treated for latent MDR-TB infection remains unknown.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of studies published between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 2014, to analyze TB incidence, treatment completion and discontinuation, and cost-effectiveness. Contacts with LTBI were considered effectively treated if they received at least one medication likely effective against their MDR-TB strain. We selected studies comparing treatment versus non-treatment outcomes and performed a meta-analysis to estimate the relative risk of TB incidence along with its 95% confidence interval.

- **Results**: Data from 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. Six articles presented outcomes for contacts who were treated versus those not treated for MDR-LTBI; ten provided outcomes only for treated contacts, and five for untreated contacts. The estimated reduction in MDR-TB incidence was 90% (ranging from 9%-99%) based on data from five comparison studies. High treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse effects were noted among those on pyrazinamide-containing regimens. The greatest cost-effectiveness was observed with a fluoroquinolone/ethambutol combination regimen.

- **Conclusions**: With few studies meeting inclusion criteria, the results should be interpreted cautiously. We found a reduced risk of TB incidence with treatment for latent MDR-TB infection.

### Savaysa [^116Lqj8X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Avoid concomitant use of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, thrombolytics, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) due to increased risk of bleeding. Concomitant use of rifampin should also be avoided.

- **Drug interactions**: Co-administration of anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, thrombolytics, and SSRIs or SNRIs may increase the risk of bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with anticoagulants, aspirin, other platelet aggregation inhibitors, and/or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Long-term concomitant treatment with Savaysa and other anticoagulants is not recommended because of increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Short-term co-administration may be needed for patients transitioning to or from Savaysa [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. In clinical studies with Savaysa, concomitant use of aspirin (low dose ≤ 100 mg/day), thienopyridines, and NSAIDs was permitted and resulted in increased rates of clinically relevant bleeding. Carefully monitor for bleeding in patients who require chronic treatment with low-dose aspirin and/or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. As with other anticoagulants, patients may be at an increased risk of bleeding in case of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in tubercular meningitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114L6SHN]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) September 2018 report, tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and a leading killer of patients who are HIV-positive. TB remains a global epidemic, with 10 million people diagnosed and 1.5 million fatalities as reported in the 2018 WHO report. Tubercular meningitis (TBM) is an important neuro-infectious condition that leads to high mortality and morbidity, often resulting in chronic neurological sequelae.

One significant factor contributing to the high morbidity and mortality in these patients is stroke. Mortality is three times higher in TBM patients with infarction compared to those without. This may be explained by the hypothesis that TBM represents a hypercoagulable state, characterized by a decrease in protein S and an increase in factor VIII, leading to a prothrombotic state. This condition could be responsible for the ischemic stroke and neuropathy observed in patients with TBM. Stroke occurs in approximately 15 to 57% of TBM patients, especially in severe cases or advanced stages. Of these patients, about 20% exhibit focal neurological deficits.

The recommended treatment for these patients includes anti-tubercular therapy along with corticosteroids and supportive care. However, even with optimal care, the prognosis remains poor, with significant neurological sequelae and high mortality rates.

### 2011 ASA/ACCF/AHA/AANN/AANS/ACR/ASNR/CNS/SAIP/SCAI/SIR/SNIS/SVM/SVS guideline on the management of patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral artery disease: Executive summary. A report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, and the American Stroke Association, American Association of Neuroscience Nurses, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, American College of Radiology, American Society of Neuroradiology, Congress of Neurological Surgeons, Society of Atherosclerosis Imaging and Prevention, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Interventional Radiology, Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery, Society for Vascular Medicine, and Society for Vascular Surgery [^113kMk6W]. Circulation (2011). High credibility.

The 2011 guidelines developed by AANN/AANS/ACC/ACR/AHA/ASA/ASNR/CNS/SAIP/SCAI/SIR/SNIS/SVM/SVS recommend the initiation of antiplatelet therapy for medical management of carotid artery stenosis. This therapy includes aspirin alone (75–325 mg daily), clopidogrel alone (75 mg daily), or a combination of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole (25 and 200 mg BID, respectively). It is preferred over the combination of aspirin with clopidogrel in patients who have experienced either obstructive or non-obstructive extracranial carotid atherosclerosis, sustained ischemic stroke, or TIA.

### Post-tuberculosis sequelae and the burden of "long TB": Continuing TB care after treatment completion [^114WT1BF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the nearly 80 years since the publication of the landmark trial, "Streptomycin Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis" (TB) — the first-ever randomized clinical trial — TB research and care have been understandably focused on pathogen eradication and microbiologic cure. An inherent feature of this focus on microbiologic outcomes, which has been dutifully performed by TB programs built around administering directly observed therapy, is that TB care ends at the completion of a certain number of doses of antitubercular medications. Consequently, TB cure rates and mortality rates from TB have steadily improved in recent decades, representing a major advance for global public health.

However, this focus on microbiologic cure has led to a myopic view of TB as a disease defined primarily by the detection of the pathogen. Although there is an increasing recognition that the binary categorization of latent TB infection versus active TB disease is an oversimplification, the relatively recent conceptualization of TB as having a more nuanced microbiologic and clinical spectrum has yet to incorporate a post-treatment state into this continuum.

The approach to TB is analogous to a situation in which those suffering cerebrovascular accidents have their acute pathology addressed only to be discharged without follow-up care or regard for their long-term neurologic debility. The fact that TB is an infectious disease, with treatment centered on the pathogen, has seemingly led to a sense of fatalism regarding its sequelae, thus affecting individuals with persistent lung damage after treatment completion.

### Aminoglycosides and capreomycin in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: Individual patient data meta-analysis of 12,030 patients from 25 countries, 2009–2016 [^115oMu9S]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

As new drugs are developed for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the role of currently used drugs must be reevaluated.

- **Methods**: We combined individual-level data on patients with pulmonary MDR-TB published during 2009–2016 from 25 countries. We compared patients receiving each of the injectable drugs and those receiving no injectable drugs. Analyses were based on patients whose isolates were susceptible to the drug they received. Using random-effects logistic regression with propensity score matching, we estimated the effect of each agent in terms of standardized treatment outcomes.

- **Results**: More patients received kanamycin (n = 4,330) and capreomycin (n = 2,401) than amikacin (n = 2,275) or streptomycin (n = 1,554), opposite to their apparent effectiveness. Compared with kanamycin, amikacin was associated with six more cures per 100 patients (95% confidence interval, 4–8), while streptomycin was associated with seven (95% CI, 5–8) more cures and five (95% CI, 4–7) fewer deaths per 100 patients. Compared with capreomycin, amikacin was associated with nine (95% CI, 6–11) more cures and five (95% CI, 2–8) fewer deaths per 100 patients, while streptomycin was associated with 10 (95% CI, 8–13) more cures and 10 (95% CI, 7–12) fewer deaths per 100 patients treated. In contrast to amikacin and streptomycin, patients treated with kanamycin or capreomycin did not fare better than patients treated with no injectable drugs.

- **Conclusions**: When aminoglycosides are used to treat MDR-TB and drug susceptibility test results support their use, streptomycin and amikacin, not kanamycin, are preferable options.

### Tuberculosis control interventions targeted to previously treated people in a high-incidence setting: A modelling study [^115XDGHU]. The Lancet Global Health (2018). High credibility.

In high-incidence settings, disease among previously treated individuals contributes substantially to the burden of incident and prevalent tuberculosis. The extent to which interventions targeted to this high-risk group can improve tuberculosis control has not been established. We aimed to project the population-level effect of control interventions targeted at individuals with a history of previous tuberculosis treatment in a high-incidence setting.

- **Methods**: We developed a transmission-dynamic model of tuberculosis and HIV in a high-incidence setting with a population of roughly 40,000 people in suburban Cape Town, South Africa. The model was calibrated using local demography, TB and HIV prevalence, TB case notifications, and treatment outcomes through a Bayesian calibration approach. We projected the effect of annual targeted active case finding in all individuals who had previously completed tuberculosis treatment and targeted active case finding combined with lifelong secondary isoniazid preventive therapy. We estimated the impact of these targeted interventions on local tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality over a 10-year period (2016–2025).

- **Findings**: We projected that, under control efforts in this setting, the tuberculosis epidemic will remain in slow decline for at least the next decade. Additional interventions targeted to previously treated people could greatly accelerate these declines. We projected that annual targeted active case finding, combined with secondary isoniazid preventive therapy in those who were previously treated, could significantly enhance tuberculosis control efforts.

### Potentiation of clopidogrel active metabolite formation by rifampicin leads to greater P2Y12 receptor blockade and inhibition of platelet aggregation after clopidogrel [^112xZQtW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

The thienopyridine P2Y(12) receptor antagonist clopidogrel reduces the risk of arterial thrombosis, and individual pharmacodynamic responses to clopidogrel are believed to reflect the levels of active metabolite (AM) generated. Rifampicin increases the inhibitory effect of clopidogrel on platelet aggregation (PA). This study investigates the response to clopidogrel before and during administration of rifampicin to examine the relationship between individual AM levels and P2Y(12) blockade.

- **Methods**: Healthy volunteers received a 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel followed by 75 mg daily for 7 days. After a washout period and treatment with rifampicin [300 mg twice a day (b.i.d.)], they received the same regimen of clopidogrel. Clopidogrel AM levels were determined over 4 hours after the clopidogrel loading dose and unblocked P2Y(12) receptor number was assessed using a (33) P-2MeSADP binding assay. PA was measured by optical aggregometry with ADP and TRAP.

- **Results**: Rifampicin enhanced clopidogrel AM production [area-under-the-curve (AUC): clopidogrel 89 ± 22 ng h mL(-1), clopidogrel+rifampicin 335 ± 86 ng h mL(-1), P < 0.0001], increased P2Y(12) blockade (unblocked receptors: clopidogrel 48 ± 24, clopidogrel+rifampicin 4 ± 2, P < 0.0001), and reduced PA (5 μmol L(-1) ADP: clopidogrel 20 ± 4, clopidogrel+rifampicin 5 ± 2, P < 0.01). Increasing numbers of unblocked receptors were required for an aggregation response with decreasing concentrations of ADP. PA induced by ADP 2 μmol L(-1) was particularly sensitive to low levels of receptor blockade.

- **Conclusion**: The potentiation of clopidogrel AM production by rifampicin contributes to a greater P2Y(12) receptor blockade and enhanced inhibition of platelet aggregation.

Regarding medical management for carotid artery stenosis, specifically concerning antiplatelet therapy, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of low-dose aspirin (75–325 mg daily) in patients with > 50% asymptomatic CAS. This is mainly for the prevention of late myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^117V3iy5]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). Low credibility.

Tubercular meningitis (TBM) remains the most serious form of extrapulmonary TB, with high rates of death and disability. Ischemic stroke in TBM is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, typically affecting the small and medium-sized intracranial vessels. The presumed mechanism is inflammatory, leading to endarteritis, local thrombosis, or accelerated atherosclerosis. Cerebral infarction can occur silently or manifest as a clinical stroke or worsening sensorium, with around 17–64% and 45–50% of patients with TBM showing evidence of infarction on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, respectively, with or without clinical features suggestive of stroke.

Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents commonly used for the secondary prevention of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Aspirin may have an additional benefit due to its anti-inflammatory effect and has been previously studied in TBM. In two prior studies, the absolute risk reduction in stroke prevention was 19.1% and 16.2%, respectively. Pooled analysis observed no reduction in mortality but found a significant reduction in the rate of new stroke [hazard ratio of 0.51 (95% CI 0.29–0.87, p = 0.01)]. However, these studies are limited by small sample sizes and methodological concerns, making the results variable and insufficient for specific recommendations. Clopidogrel has not been evaluated previously in TBM.

The present study is therefore aimed at studying the effect of aspirin and clopidogrel on the occurrence of clinical stroke and/or cerebral infarction.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs in interventional radiology [^111eihSm]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

In treating peripheral arterial disease, a profound knowledge of antiplatelet and anticoagulative drug therapy is essential to ensure a positive clinical outcome and to anticipate and avoid complications. Side effects and drug interactions can have fatal consequences for the patient, so interventionalists should be aware of these risks and capable of managing them. Aspirin remains the first-line agent for antiplatelet monotherapy, with clopidogrel added where dual antiplatelet therapy is required.

In cases of suspected antiplatelet drug resistance, the dose of clopidogrel may be doubled; alternatively, prasugrel or ticagrelor may be used. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, such as abciximab or eptifibatide, may be beneficial in cases of hypercoagulability or acute embolic complications. Desmopressin, tranexamic acid, or platelet infusions may be utilized to mitigate antiplatelet drug effects in cases of bleeding.

- **Intraprocedural anticoagulant therapy**: Treatment with unfractionated heparin (UFH) remains the preferred option, although low molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) are suitable, particularly for post-interventional treatment. Dose adjustment of LMWH is often necessary in renal insufficiency, which is frequently observed in elderly patients. Protamine sulfate is an effective antagonist for UFH; however, it is less effective for LMWH.

- **Newer antithrombotic drugs**: These, such as direct thrombin inhibitors or factor X inhibitors, have limited importance in periprocedural treatment, except for treating patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Nonetheless, understanding the pharmacologic properties of these newer agents is important.

### New measurable indicator for tuberculosis case detection [^113LcfDD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). High credibility.

Reversing global tuberculosis (TB) incidence by 2015 is included in the Millennium Development Goals. Prevalence and death rates (indicator 23) and the proportion of cases detected and cured under a directly observed treatment strategy (DOTS) (indicator 24) are used to measure progress towards this goal. For indicator 24, the World Health Organization (WHO) has formulated the following goals: a case detection rate of 70% and a cure rate of 85%. If both targets are achieved, the effect on TB transmission will be considerable.

WHO defines the cure rate as the proportion of new cases of smear-positive TB that were cured through treatment; this rate is routinely measured by treatment registers. The case detection rate is the proportion of incident smear-positive TB cases detected through a TB program. The case detection rate is measured as the notification rate of new cases of smear-positive TB divided by the estimated incidence rate.

Incidence is estimated by using various sources of information. An important element in these estimates is the proposed relationship between the incidence of TB and the annual risk for TB infection. Styblo estimated that, in the absence of control, a 1% (i.e. 1,000/100,000) annual risk for infection would correspond with an incidence of new cases of smear-positive TB of approximately 50 per 100,000. In other words, in the absence of control measures, 50 cases would generate 1,000 infections; i.e. the average patient with a new case of smear-positive TB would generate approximately 20 infections over time.

This article on currently available antiplatelet drugs is part of the "Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition)". It describes the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of aspirin, reversible cyclooxygenase inhibitors, thienopyridines, and integrin alphaIIbbeta3 receptor antagonists. The relationships among dose, efficacy, and safety are thoroughly discussed, with a mechanistic overview of randomized clinical trials. The article does not provide specific management recommendations; however, it highlights important practical aspects related to antiplatelet therapy, including the optimal dose of aspirin, the variable balance of benefits and hazards in different clinical settings, and the issue of interindividual variability in response to antiplatelet drugs.

### Collaborative meta-analysis of randomised trials of antiplatelet therapy for prevention of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in high risk patients [^111AgAdu]. BMJ (2002). Low credibility.

To determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events, collaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews) of randomised trials were conducted. These trials compared an antiplatelet regimen versus a control or one antiplatelet regimen against another in high-risk patients. These patients had acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition, and results were available before September 1997. Trials were required to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated, and comparisons had to be unconfounded; that is, study groups differed only in terms of the antiplatelet regimen.

- **Studies reviewed**: The analysis included 287 studies involving 135,000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77,000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens.

- **Main outcome measure**: The primary measure was the occurrence of a "serious vascular event", which encompasses non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death.

Overall, among these high-risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one-quarter. Non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one-third, non-fatal stroke by one-quarter, and vascular mortality by one-sixth, with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths. Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction and 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend initiating dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for six months after PCI. This should be followed by single antiplatelet therapy to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and bleeding events in patients with chronic coronary disease treated with PCI.

### Platelets restrict the oxidative burst in phagocytes and facilitate primary progressive tuberculosis [^114oYWnu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Platelets are generated in the capillaries of the lung, control hemostasis, and display immunological functions. Tuberculosis primarily affects the lung, and patients show platelet changes and hemoptysis. A role of platelets in the immunopathology of pulmonary tuberculosis requires careful assessment.

- **Objectives**: To identify the dynamics and interaction partners of platelets in the respiratory tissue and establish their impact on the outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis.

- **Methods**: Investigations were primarily performed in murine models of primary progressive pulmonary tuberculosis by analyzing mouse strains with variable susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection using platelet depletion and delivery of antiplatelet drugs.

- **Measurements and main results**: Platelets were present at the site of infection and formed aggregates with different myeloid subsets during experimental tuberculosis. Such aggregates were also detected in patients with tuberculosis. Platelets were detrimental during the early phase of infection, and this effect was uncoupled from their canonical activation. Platelets left lung cell dynamics and patterns of antimycobacterial T-cell responses unchanged but hampered antimicrobial defense by restricting the production of reactive oxygen species in lung-residing myeloid cells. Platelets are detrimental in primary progressive pulmonary tuberculosis, orchestrate lung immunity by modulating innate immune responsiveness, and may be amenable to new interventions for this deadly disease.

### Newly formed reticulated platelets undermine pharmacokinetically short-lived antiplatelet therapies [^113d5kK8]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

Aspirin, together with thienopyridine P2Y12 inhibitors, commonly clopidogrel, is a cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy. However, many patients receiving this therapy display high on-treatment platelet reactivity, which is a major therapeutic hurdle to the prevention of rethrombotic events. The emergence of uninhibited platelets after thrombopoiesis has been proposed as a contributing factor to high on-treatment platelet reactivity. Here, we investigate the influences of platelet turnover on platelet aggregation in the face of different dual-antiplatelet therapy strategies.

- **Approach and results**: Traditional light transmission aggregometry, cytometry, advanced flow cytometric imaging, and confocal microscopy were used to follow the interactions of populations of platelets from healthy volunteers and patients with stable cardiovascular disease. Newly formed, reticulated platelets overproportionately contributed to, and clustered at, the core of forming aggregates. This phenomenon was particularly observed in samples from patients treated with aspirin plus a thienopyridine, but was absent in samples taken from patients treated with aspirin plus ticagrelor.

- **Conclusions**: Reticulated platelets are more reactive than older platelets and act as seeds for the formation of platelet aggregates even in the presence of antiplatelet therapy. This is coherent with the emergence of an uninhibited subpopulation of reticulated platelets during treatment with aspirin plus thienopyridine, explained by the short pharmacokinetic half-lives of these drugs.

### Potential of pan-tuberculosis treatment to drive emergence of novel resistance [^114hNQ8z]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Another potential concern about using novel drugs, such as bedaquiline, in all patients is that the broader population scale of acquired resistance might leave many patients without effective treatment options. We did not identify any clinical pathways by which this scenario was likely to occur. In our model, RR-TB was treated similarly in both scenarios (dependent on DST coverage) and showed high enough rates of durable cure to cause preexisting RR-TB to decrease over time in the pan-TB scenario. Meanwhile, although we modeled retreatment with a rifamycin-based regimen for a substantial proportion of RS-TB cases that were not cured with the initial pan-TB regimen treatment (some of which had resistance to B, X, or both), we projected similar levels of complex resistance with this approach as with continued use of a rifamycin-based first-line regimen followed by the use of novel drugs after the selection of rifampin resistance. This finding suggests that even as resistance accumulated to components of a pan-TB regimen, most patients for whom the pan-TB regimen was ineffective would (once identified by DST) have existing rifamycin-based regimens as back-ups.

In reality, many of the characteristics of future pan-TB regimens are unknown. Although the pan-TB target regimen profile seeks to improve regimen duration, tolerability, and pharmacologic forgiveness, the effects of those improvements on adherence and ultimately effectiveness may be unpredictable and setting-dependent. Our model suggests that if the difference in effectiveness is small between a pan-TB regimen and the rifamycin-based alternatives, significant challenges might remain in their implementation.

### Clinical management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 16 European countries [^117UitY3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a significant public health burden in Europe, with reported treatment success rates around 50% or less, and even lower cure rates.

The study aimed to document the management and treatment outcomes for patients with MDR-TB in Europe. A prospective cohort study was conducted, analyzing the management and treatment outcomes stratified by the incidence of MDR-TB across European countries. Treatment outcomes were compared using both World Health Organization criteria and simplified definitions by the Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (TBNET).

A total of 380 patients with MDR-TB were recruited and followed up between 2010 and 2014 across 16 European countries. Patients from high-incidence countries, compared to those from low-incidence countries, were more frequently treated with standardized regimens (83.2% vs. 9.9%), experienced delayed treatment initiation (median 111 vs. 28 days), developed additional drug resistance more often (23% vs. 5.8%), and had higher mortality rates (9.4% vs. 1.9%). Only 20.1% of patients using pyrazinamide had proven susceptibility to the drug. According to World Health Organization outcome definitions, the frequency of cure was higher in high-incidence countries (38.7% vs. 9.7%).

Simplified outcome definitions, including one year of follow-up after the end of treatment, showed similar frequencies of relapse-free cure in low- (58.3%), intermediate- (55.8%), and high-incidence (57.1%) countries. However, the highest frequency of treatment failure was observed in high-incidence countries (24.1% vs. 14.6%).

For medical management concerning perioperative cardiac risk in noncardiac surgery, specifically regarding antiplatelet management, the ACCP 2022 guidelines advise against the routine use of bridging therapy. This includes avoiding glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors, cangrelor, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in patients with coronary stents who require interruption of antiplatelet drugs for an elective surgery or procedure.

### Drug regimens identified and optimized by output-driven platform markedly reduce tuberculosis treatment time [^112CL8zr]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Both regimens comprised previously approved drugs, and the first regimen (PRS Regimen I) comprised exclusively generic drugs. Both regimens were markedly more efficacious than the standard regimen in reducing the lung burden of M. tuberculosis. For example, at four weeks after the start of treatment, mice treated with PRS Regimen I had 1.3 logs fewer CFU in their lungs than mice treated with the standard regimen, while mice treated with PRS Regimen IIC had 4.0 logs fewer lung CFU counts than standard regimen-treated mice.

Both regimens were also markedly more efficacious than the standard regimen in achieving relapse-free cure. Whereas the standard regimen required 12 weeks to achieve 80% relapse-free cure and 16 weeks to achieve 100% relapse-free cure in our in vivo model, PRS Regimen I achieved these milestones in 8 and 12 weeks, respectively, and PRS Regimen IIC in 3 and 4 weeks, respectively. Thus, compared with the standard regimen, PRS Regimens I and IIC reduced the duration of treatment required to achieve 80% relapse-free cure by 33% and 75%, respectively, and 100% relapse-free cure by 25% and 75%, respectively.

In addition, as discussed below, PRS Regimen II achieves lung culture negativity and relapse-free cure in the mouse model faster than other regimens shown to accelerate treatment. If our results in mice extrapolate to humans, PRS Regimen IIC would be expected to reduce the duration of treatment of TB from 6–8 months, as is currently the case for the standard regimen, to 1½–2 months.

### Consistent reduction in periprocedural myocardial infarction with Cangrelor as assessed by multiple definitions: Findings from CHAMPION PHOENIX (Cangrelor versus standard therapy to achieve optimal management of platelet inhibition) [^115ARjyr]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Because the majority of ischemic events that occurred during the first 48 hours of CHAMPION PHOENIX were type 4a MIs related to PCI, these data highlight the need for adequate and effective antithrombotic therapies. Guidelines recommend that patients undergoing PCI be treated with oral antiplatelet therapies before or immediately after the procedure. The oral P2Y12 inhibitors currently used in practice have a delayed onset of action and do not result in antiplatelet effects for approximately 60 to 120 minutes. The delay in the onset of antiplatelet effect is a particular problem in patients such as those treated with ad hoc PCI after elective coronary angiography or in patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndrome, in whom little antiplatelet effect may be present during the actual PCI. Furthermore, some medications, such as those used during moderate sedation, may delay the onset of antiplatelet effects.

Intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are available and can be used in patients undergoing PCI who are not pretreated with an oral P2Y12 inhibitor. However, prior studies showed that the majority of benefit from glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors occurred in patients with elevated cardiac biomarkers. Yet, the EARLY-ACS trial (Early Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibition in Non–ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome) and ACUITY trial (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy) showed that the routine use of these agents in these populations increased the risk of bleeding without significant improvements in clinical outcomes. As a result, the use of intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors is limited in practice.

### Long-term treatment outcomes in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^111BgupY]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). High credibility.

To describe long-term treatment outcomes in patients with multi-drug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) and validate established outcome definitions for MDR/RR-TB treatment, a study was conducted.

Among patients with MDR/RR-TB admitted to a German MDR/RR-TB referral centre from 1 September 2002 to 29 February 2020, researchers compared long-term treatment outcomes derived from individual patient follow-up with treatment outcomes defined by WHO-2013, WHO-2021, and the Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group-2016. In total, 163 patients (mean age, 35 years; standard deviation, 13 years; 14/163 [8.6%] living with HIV; 109/163 [66.9%] men, 149/163 [91.4%] migrating to Germany within 5 years) initiated treatment for culture-confirmed MDR/RR-TB.

Additional drug resistance to a fluoroquinolone or a second-line injectable agent was present in 15 of the 163 (9.2%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains; resistance against both drug classes was present in 29 of the 163 (17.8%) strains. The median duration of MDR/RR-TB treatment was 20 months (interquartile range, 19.3–21.6 months), with a median of five active drugs included. The median follow-up time was 4 years (47.7 months; interquartile range, 21.7–65.8 months).

Cure was achieved in 25 (15.3%), 82 (50.3%), and 95 (58.3%) patients according to the outcome definitions of WHO-2013, WHO-2021, and the Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group-2016, respectively. The lost to follow-up rate was 17 of 163 (10.4%). Death was more likely in patients living with HIV (hazard ratio, 4).

### Dedicated outreach service for hard to reach patients with tuberculosis in London: Observational study and economic evaluation [^113iSuvw]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

The Find and Treat service appears to be cost-effective based on a threshold of £20,000-£30,000/QALY gained, used by NICE. Although analyses of each Find and Treat component should be interpreted with caution due to overlapping costs between the two services, they both seem to be cost-effective separately. We obtained similar results when making assumptions more unfavorable to the Find and Treat service. In the most unfavorable case, data were interpreted unfavorably in five instances to create a very highly unlikely scenario; the mobile screening unit had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of about £26,000. NICE would often still consider this ratio acceptable, particularly since during model parameterization, whenever data were unavailable, we made conservative assumptions to ensure that the benefit of Find and Treat was not overestimated.

One limitation of our analysis is the absence of a trial randomizing tuberculosis cases to be either managed or not managed by the Find and Treat service. The absence of randomization meant that we could not be sure of the outcomes of Find and Treat managed cases if the service did not exist. Consequently, we based our model of such outcomes on controls with active tuberculosis in London's enhanced tuberculosis surveillance system who presented for care. Although we chose controls to have at least one risk factor to represent the potential target population for the Find and Treat service, the service also manages extreme cases.

### Antiplatelet drugs [^116ctQwr]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Platelets play a major role in thromboembolic diseases, making antiplatelet therapy crucial in treatment and prophylaxis. Upon vascular injury, platelets rapidly adhere to the exposed subendothelial matrix, becoming activated and resulting in the recruitment of additional platelets from the circulation to form a stable arterial platelet plug. Although controlled plug formation is desired for preventing excessive blood loss and promoting wound healing, several pathological conditions may result in the formation of occlusive thrombi, leading to severe clinical complications, including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.

Many antiplatelet approaches have been investigated, which interfere with one or more stages in thrombus formation. This review discusses antiplatelet agents that interfere with the three principal phases in thrombus formation: platelet adhesion, amplification of platelet activation, and platelet aggregation. For each stage, novel experimental targets and clinically established antiplatelet strategies are reviewed. Limitations and possible benefits are discussed for each target.

### Role of aspirin in tuberculous meningitis: A randomized open label placebo controlled trial [^117TjcrR]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin in preventing stroke and mortality in tuberculous meningitis (TBM).

- **Methods**: Patients with TBM, diagnosed based on clinical, MRI, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) criteria, were randomized to receive either aspirin 150 mg daily or a placebo. All patients received a four-drug antitubercular treatment regimen comprising rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, with or without corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was MRI-proven stroke at 3 months. Secondary endpoints included mortality and functional outcomes assessed by Barthel Index scores at 3 months. Adverse drug reactions were also analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 118 TBM patients were randomized into aspirin and placebo groups. Baseline demographic and clinical parameters, including the severity of meningitis and MRI/CSF changes, did not significantly differ between the two groups. Nineteen patients (16.1%) were lost to follow-up. Twenty-one patients (33.3%) developed stroke after randomization. Stroke occurrence was insignificantly lower in the aspirin group (24.2%) compared to the placebo group (43.3%; OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12–1.39). Aspirin resulted in an absolute risk reduction of stroke by 19.1% and a significant reduction in mortality compared to placebo (21.7% vs. 43.4%, P = 0.02). Binary logistic regression analysis identified age (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03–1.14, P = 0.001) as the only independent risk factor for stroke, while aspirin was significantly associated with improved survival (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.21–8.31). Aspirin was well tolerated, with no patients requiring withdrawal due to side effects.

- **Interpretation**: Aspirin administration led to an insignificantly lower stroke incidence and a significant reduction in mortality among TBM patients compared to placebo.

### Current antiplatelet therapies: benefits and limitations [^1148FsCo]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is the criterion standard for the treatment of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and those who have acute coronary syndromes. Clopidogrel, in combination with aspirin, is the standard of care for reducing cardiovascular events in these patients. However, patients who receive currently available antiplatelet therapy may still develop atherothrombotic events. Despite the clinical benefits achieved with clopidogrel, significant clinical limitations are associated with its use. This article summarizes the understanding of the benefits and limitations of the commonly used antiplatelet therapies.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^117RmxVo]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Baseline characteristics are outlined in supplementary tables S1–S3. The mean age of the patients was 29.93 (± 14.07) years, with a female preponderance (59%). At admission, altered sensorium was present in 153 (65%) patients, and seizures had occurred in 88 (37%) patients. TBM diagnosis was definite in 122 (51%), highly probable in 96 (41%), and probable in 19 (8%). CSF GeneXpert was positive in 111 (47%) among the 178 tested patients. CSF AFB was detected in only one among the 222 tested, and mycobacterium grew in only 12 (5.1%) among 99 cultures available. Nearly half, 117 (49%) of the patients, had advanced BMC grade 3 severity of TBM at admission, and the majority (61%) were moderate to severely disabled on the modified Rankin scale (mRS 4 and 5). Other comorbidities were uncommon. Presence of extraneural tuberculosis and previous ATT exposure were evenly distributed among the groups.

- **Baseline characteristics**: Baseline characteristics of overall, aspirin group, clopidogrel group, and standard treatment group among patients with TBM.

### Stroke in Takayasu arteritis with concomitant tuberculosis: An unusual pediatric case report [^113aJGhB]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in angiographic examinations are considered the gold standard for diagnosing TA in children. Routine angiography, arterial CTA, and magnetic resonance angiography results suggest that dilation, aneurysm, stenosis, occlusion, and thickening of the arterial wall occur in the aorta and its main branches or pulmonary artery. Stroke, which is more commonly noted in the basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, brain lobe, and cerebral watershed, can be detected using head computed tomography or MRI.

Glucocorticoids and traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic immunosuppressants are currently effective drugs for TA. Studies have shown that biological agents such as tocilizumab effectively treat TA and reduce recurrence with few adverse reactions. Hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis can be managed with urapidil, nifedipine, and terazosin, whereas stroke can be treated with antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin.

The clinical assessment of TA activity is challenging because some clinical symptoms — such as low fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and persistently elevated inflammatory markers — also appear during tuberculosis activities. Hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis can be aggravated due to the side effects of hormone-induced water-sodium retention. In addition, methotrexate, tocilizumab, and glucocorticoids are preferred due to disease progression. As tocilizumab is used, the risk that latent tuberculosis infection progresses to active M. tuberculosis infection should be considered, especially in tuberculosis-endemic areas.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^112CuiCk]. The Lancet Regional Health - Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

The benefit of antiplatelet therapy for stroke prevention or treatment among patients with tubercular meningitis (TBM) is uncertain. We hypothesized that add-on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to standard treatment would be safe and effective in reducing clinical stroke and/or cerebral infarction in patients with TBM.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, open-label, superiority trial with blinded outcome assessment. Patients with suspected TBM were randomized to receive either add-on oral aspirin 75 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg along with ATT (anti-tubercular treatment), or only ATT. Clinical follow-up, MRI brain, and MR angiogram were performed at baseline, one, and three months from randomization. The primary outcome was the reduction in occurrence of clinical stroke and/or imaging-based cerebral infarction at one and three months. The safety outcome was the occurrence of major or minor bleeding. Key secondary outcomes included mortality at one and three months and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at three months.

- **Findings**: A total of 237 patients with TBM were randomized (77 in the aspirin group, 77 in the clopidogrel group, and 83 in the standard treatment group). At one month, clinical stroke outcome was available for 66 (85.7%), 72 (93.5%), and 69 (83.1%) patients and MRI brain was available for 61 (79.2%), 65 (84.4%), and 62 (74.7%) patients, respectively. Clinical stroke was observed in one (1.5%) in the aspirin group, none (0.0%) in the clopidogrel group, and three (4.3%) patients in the standard group. Across group comparison yielded a p-value of 0.2; imaging-based cerebral infarction was observed in six (9.8%).

### Efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in tubercular meningitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112pc8e8]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

Tubercular meningitis (TBM) is associated with high mortality and stroke and can lead to chronic neurological sequelae even with the best care and antitubercular therapy. Studies have shown that aspirin as an adjunctive therapy might play some role in the management of TBM. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in TBM patients.

- **Methods**:
	- We conducted a systematic search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with tubercular meningitis, published until October 2019 across all major clinical journals. The study was registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42019136689). Articles were tested for eligibility, assessed for quality, and examined for various biases. Data synthesis and analysis were performed using Review Manager 5.3. The primary endpoint for efficacy assessment was mortality at three months. The secondary endpoint was stroke or a composite outcome of stroke and mortality at three months. Adverse effects were also assessed as a secondary safety endpoint.

- **Findings**:
	- Overall, three eligible randomized controlled trials with 365 participants were included, providing quantitative data for this meta-analysis. The analysis of primary and secondary endpoints was conducted using a fixed-effect model. There was no significant reduction in mortality [hazard ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.45–1.35, p = 0.37)] and composite outcome of mortality and new-onset stroke [hazard ratio 0.86 (95% CI 0.60–1.24, p = 0.43)] in the aspirin group compared to placebo. However, aspirin compared to placebo significantly reduced.

### The role of aspirin in childhood tuberculous meningitis [^114xwaq7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Arterial stroke is the main cause of poor outcome in childhood tuberculous meningitis. Aspirin has an antithrombotic action at low dose and anti-ischemic and anti-inflammatory properties, which are dose-related. The aim of the study was to explore the possible benefits of aspirin in children with tuberculous meningitis. A total of 146 consecutive children with a diagnosis of probable tuberculous meningitis were studied.

Patients were randomized into three groups: (1) placebo group, (2) low-dose aspirin group, and (3) high-dose aspirin group. Twenty-nine additional patients who received aspirin before admission were excluded from the randomized study but continued on low-dose aspirin. Aspirin, irrespective of dose, did not show any significant benefit regarding morbidity (hemiparesis and developmental outcome) and mortality. Aspirin was well tolerated, but one death was probably related to aspirin.

The fact that the outcome of the high-dose aspirin group compared favorably with the other treatment groups, despite younger age and more severe neurological involvement at baseline, needs further investigation.

### Tuberculosis control interventions targeted to previously treated people in a high-incidence setting: a modelling study [^112SiPeb]. The Lancet Global Health (2018). Low credibility.

We project that within 10 years in this setting, a combination of targeted active case finding and secondary isoniazid preventive therapy could avert more than a third of incident tuberculosis cases and tuberculosis deaths. Targeted active case finding alone could have a notable effect on tuberculosis prevalence and mortality but is expected to have a smaller effect on incidence. Our simulations suggest that a marked effect of targeted active case finding is achieved when it can be coupled with secondary isoniazid preventive therapy. Our projections show that much of the effect of targeted active case finding and secondary isoniazid preventive therapy accrues in the first few years after their implementation. The diminishing effect over time suggests a saturation effect, which might imply that such targeted interventions could be used within an adaptive control strategy.

Our study constitutes a first step towards better understanding the effect of interventions targeted to previously treated people in high-incidence settings. However, several limitations must be noted. We applied our model to a specific setting with a high tuberculosis incidence, where high rates of retreatment due to relapse and reinfection had been previously reported. We note that the effect of interventions targeted at previously treated people, which we project for this setting, might not be easily generalized to other high-incidence settings for several reasons. High rates of retreatment have been reported from several other high-incidence settings. However, the population-

### Antifibrinolytic therapy to reduce haemoptysis from any cause [^116wi9cQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Haemoptysis is a common pathology worldwide, occurring more frequently in low-income countries. It has different etiologies, many of which have infectious characteristics. Antifibrinolytic agents are commonly used to manage bleeding from different sources, but their usefulness in pulmonology is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytic agents in reducing the volume and duration of haemoptysis in adult and pediatric patients.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) in The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and LILACS for publications describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antifibrinolytic therapy in patients presenting with haemoptysis. We also performed an independent search in MEDLINE for relevant trials not yet included in CENTRAL or DARE. We conducted electronic and manual searches of relevant national and international journals and reviewed the reference lists of included studies to locate relevant RCTs. An additional search was carried out to find unpublished RCTs.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytic agents in reducing haemoptysis in adult and pediatric patients of both genders presenting with haemoptysis of any etiology and severity. The intervention of interest was the administration of antifibrinolytic agents compared with placebo or no treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All reviewers meticulously analyzed the collected data.
