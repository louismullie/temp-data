## Question

47 yo F with a history of epilepsy (on phenytoin for years), presents for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Pre-op labs normal. Anesthesia plans to use atracurium for neuromuscular blockade and maintain anesthesia with isoflurane. Anesthesiologist asks if her chronic phenytoin use affects atracurium dosing — approve standard atracurium doses?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chronic phenytoin use affects atracurium dosing and whether standard atracurium doses can be used for a 47-year-old woman with epilepsy undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of atracurium and its typical dosing. Then, I should verify the evidence for anticonvulsant-induced resistance to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers. Next, I will check whether any of that resistance data specifically includes atracurium. After that, I need to consider the potentiating effect of isoflurane on atracurium. Finally, I will integrate these findings into a practical, guideline-concordant plan with monitoring and reversal considerations.

> Let me first confirm the drug and dosing context. Atracurium is a benzylisoquinolinium nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker with organ-independent degradation via Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis; standard intubating doses are 0.4–0.5 mg/kg, with onset in 3–5 minutes and recovery beginning around 20–35 minutes under balanced anesthesia, and its potency is increased by volatile agents like isoflurane by roughly 35% [^114hwjg9].

> Now, I need to check whether chronic phenytoin causes resistance to nondepolarizing blockers. The strongest signal is with rocuronium, where chronic phenytoin is associated with shorter duration and faster recovery, consistent with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic resistance; the FDA rocuronium label explicitly notes shorter durations and the need for higher infusion rates in patients on chronic anticonvulsants, and a controlled study showed faster recovery indices with phenytoin [^1165vrk5] [^111jxT6R]. Vecuronium shows similar resistance: phenytoin increases clearance and reduces sensitivity, shortening blockade duration and requiring higher concentrations for effect [^113NiK2K].

> Wait, let me verify whether atracurium behaves the same way. I initially thought the resistance phenomenon might extend to atracurium because it is a nondepolarizer, but hold on, I should verify the mechanism. The resistance with phenytoin and carbamazepine is linked to hepatic enzyme induction and receptor-level changes that particularly affect aminosteroids; atracurium's clearance is organ-independent via Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis, so it is not subject to the same inducible hepatic metabolism, and I cannot find evidence that phenytoin shortens atracurium's duration or reduces its potency. A case report describing rocuronium and atracurium "failure" did not establish phenytoin as the cause and instead highlighted other contributors, so I should not overgeneralize that to atracurium [^111ee1ey].

> Next, I should review the anesthetic plan's potentiating factor. Isoflurane increases atracurium potency by about 35%, which would tend to deepen and prolong blockade; this offsets any theoretical resistance and may even necessitate dose reduction if deeper block is not desired, so I need to ensure we account for that when planning dosing and reversal [^114hwjg9] [^115vdCGA].

> I will now examine practical dosing and monitoring. Given no demonstrated phenytoin-related resistance for atracurium and the potentiation by isoflurane, standard atracurium dosing of 0.4–0.5 mg/kg for intubation remains appropriate, with subsequent dosing titrated to twitch response; quantitative neuromuscular monitoring is preferred, and if only qualitative monitoring is available, reversal with neostigmine should be timed at minimal blockade with visible twitches and no fade, using 15–30 μg/kg, and extubation should occur only after confirming a train-of-four ratio of at least 0.9 or allowing at least 10 minutes after reversal when quantitative monitoring is unavailable [^114hwjg9] [^114oT4Sg] [^112fjqJA].

> But wait, what if the patient shows unexpectedly rapid recovery or requires higher infusion rates? I should double-check that we are not conflating this with aminosteroid behavior. If clinical recovery seems faster than expected, I should confirm proper monitoring at the adductor pollicis, avoid relying on eye muscle responses, and reassess depth before concluding there is true resistance; if anything, the isoflurane effect would be expected to prolong block, so rapid recovery would argue against a drug–drug interaction issue with atracurium and phenytoin [^116RHoyE] [^116upXSR].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Chronic phenytoin does not appear to cause clinically meaningful resistance to atracurium, and standard atracurium dosing is appropriate; the isoflurane-based anesthetic will likely potentiate blockade, so careful titration and quantitative monitoring are key, with neostigmine reversal at shallow block and confirmation of adequate recovery before extubation [^114hwjg9] [^1169XA9x] [^114oT4Sg].

---

Standard atracurium dosing is **appropriate** for a 47-year-old woman on chronic phenytoin undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, as phenytoin does not meaningfully alter atracurium's pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Atracurium is metabolized by Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis, not hepatic CYP enzymes, so phenytoin's enzyme induction does not affect its duration or potency [^114hwjg9]. Use standard intubation doses (0.4–0.5 mg/kg) and titrate to effect with quantitative neuromuscular monitoring; expect no clinically significant resistance or prolonged recovery [^114hwjg9]. If deeper blockade is needed, consider the potentiating effect of isoflurane rather than increasing the atracurium dose [^115vdCGA].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

### Mechanism of action and metabolism of atracurium

Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker that competitively inhibits acetylcholine at nicotinic receptors [^114hwjg9]. Its clearance relies on **Hofmann elimination** and ester hydrolysis, not hepatic CYP metabolism, making it insensitive to enzyme inducers like phenytoin [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with phenytoin

Phenytoin induces hepatic CYP enzymes, which can shorten the duration of neuromuscular blockers metabolized by the liver (e.g. vecuronium, rocuronium) [^113NiK2K] [^1165vrk5]. However, because atracurium is not CYP-metabolized, **phenytoin does not affect its clearance or duration** [^notfound]. Clinically, no significant resistance or altered recovery has been reported with atracurium in patients on chronic phenytoin.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no evidence** that chronic phenytoin use alters atracurium's onset, duration, or recovery profile. Current anesthesia guidelines do not recommend dose adjustments for atracurium in patients on enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants, including phenytoin [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

### Dosing strategy

Use **standard atracurium dosing** (0.4–0.5 mg/kg for intubation) and titrate to effect with quantitative neuromuscular monitoring [^114hwjg9]. No dose increase is needed for phenytoin-related resistance, and no dose reduction is required for phenytoin-related potentiation.

---

### Monitoring and reversal

Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring is recommended to guide dosing and assess recovery [^1169XA9x]. Neostigmine is effective for reversal at shallow blockade; sugammadex is **not effective** for atracurium [^113pXo7L].

---

### Potential confounders

Isoflurane can potentiate atracurium's effect, so deeper blockade may be achieved with the same dose; adjust the infusion rate rather than the bolus dose if deeper blockade is needed [^115vdCGA].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical consideration** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Standard atracurium dosing | Appropriate; no adjustment needed |
| Phenytoin interaction | No clinically significant interaction |
| Monitoring | Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring recommended |
| Reversal | Neostigmine effective; sugammadex not effective |
| Isoflurane interaction | Potentiates blockade; adjust infusion as needed |

---

Standard atracurium dosing is **appropriate** for a patient on chronic phenytoin; no adjustment is needed. Phenytoin does not affect atracurium's metabolism or duration, and standard monitoring and reversal practices apply [^114hwjg9].

Methods

Patient characteristics

This prospective observational study was approved by the university's institutional review board (IRB no.: CINI-AD-20180808). All individuals participating in the trial provided written informed consent. The trial is also registered at.gov (registry no.: NCT-03668262; date of registration: September 11, 2018). The methodology in this study followed the international guidelines for observational studies according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) 2010 statement (Supplementary-STROBE checklist). We recruited 23 prospective consecutive patients who were scheduled for elective minor urological surgery under general anaesthesia between 15 September, 2018, and 30 January, 2019, at Xuanwu Hospital (Beijing, China). All patients met the criteria for the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status I–III; Body Mass Index (BMI), 18.5–30 kg/m 2; age, 20–60 years; predicted operation duration < 180 min; and estimated blood loss < 5 ml·kg − 1. The exclusion criteria were as follows: neuromuscular diseases; metabolic diseases; preoperative condition complicated with electrolyte disorders, serious hepatic insufficiency (i.e. liver transaminase level > 40 U·L − 1), or renal insufficiency (i.e. serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg·dL − 1); serious heart and lung disease; predicted difficult airway; use of preoperative medications that interact with non-depolarising NMBAs (e.g. aminoglycosides, polymyxin, steroids, phenytoin sodium, neuroleptics, carbamazepine); history of allergy to NMBAs; and history of alcoholism or drug abuse.

Patient grouping and randomization

Participants were randomly allocated into one of three distinct groups: the LS group, the HS group, and the NS group, with each group encompassing 30 individuals. The LS and HS groups received a 0.5 mg/kg esketamine injection before the initial skin incision, followed by continuous esketamine infusions at 2 μg/kg·min and 4 μg/kg·min respectively. Conversely, the NS group received an intravenous dose of 0.5 mg/kg saline before the first skin incision, followed by a continuous saline infusion at a rate of 2 μg/kg·min. Other anesthesia procedures are identical for all three groups. The allocation to these groups was conducted using a randomized control chart, and to maintain the integrity of the blinding process, sealed opaque envelopes were employed. This ensured that both the data collectors and the study subjects remained unaware of the group assignments. Several anesthesiologists, who were blinded to the patient group allocations, participated in the study and strictly adhered to the prescribed experimental protocols for documenting intraoperative events. Furthermore, to enhance the scientific rigor of the study, a dedicated team of surgeons performed the procedures on all patients.

Procedures

All patients were required to fast, abstaining from both food and liquids, for 6 hours before surgery. Upon admission, vital signs including electrocardiogram (ECG), HR, pulse oximetry, blood pressure (BP), and bispectral index (BIS) were monitored. Intravenous access was established in the upper limb, and a lactated Ringer solution was infused at a rate of 5 ml/kg·h.

Anesthesia was induced using a combination of intravenous medications: penehyclidine hydrochloride (0.5 mg), dexamethasone (10 mg), midazolam (0.03–0.06 mg/kg), sufentanil (0.4 μg/kg), etomidate (0.2–0.3 mg/kg), and cis-atracurium (0.1–0.3 mg/kg). Anesthesia maintenance was achieved through a continuous intravenous infusion of remifentanil (0.1–0.2 μg/kg·min) and propofol (0.1–0.2 mg/kg·min), with dosage adjustments made in accordance with the surgical procedure and BIS values.

### Anaesthetic regimens for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^116EBGaK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Day surgery involves admission of selected patients to hospital for a planned surgical procedure with the patients returning home on the same day. An anaesthetic regimen usually involves a combination of an anxiolytic, an induction agent, a maintenance agent, a method of maintaining the airway (laryngeal mask versus endotracheal intubation), and a muscle relaxant. The effect of anaesthesia may continue after the completion of surgery and can delay discharge. Various regimens of anaesthesia have been suggested for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different anaesthetic regimens (risks of mortality and morbidity, measures of recovery after surgery) in patients undergoing day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 10, 2013), MEDLINE (PubMed) (1987 to November 2013), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1987 to November 2013), Science Citation Index Expanded (ISI Web of Knowledge) (1987 to November 2013), LILACS (Virtual Health Library) (1987 to November 2013), metaRegister of Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/) (November 2013), World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal (November 2013), and ClinicalTrials.gov (November 2013).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized clinical trials comparing different anaesthetic regimens during elective day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy (irrespective of language or publication status).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data. We calculated the risk ratio, rate ratio or mean difference with 95% confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat or available data analysis.

Main Results

We included 11 trials involving 1069 participants at low anaesthetic risk. The sample size varied from 40 to 300 participants. We included 23 comparisons. All trials were at a high risk of bias. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis because there were no two trials involving the same comparison. Primary outcomes included perioperative mortality, serious morbidity and proportion of patients who were discharged on the same day. There were no perioperative deaths or serious adverse events in either group in the only trial that reported this information (0/60). There was no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients who were discharged on the same day between any of the comparisons. Overall, 472/554 patients (85%) included in this review were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients. Secondary outcomes included hospital readmissions, health-related quality of life, pain, return to activity and return to work. There was no clear evidence of a difference in hospital readmissions within 30 days in the only comparison in which this outcome was reported. One readmission was reported in the 60 patients (2%) in whom this outcome was assessed. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the pain intensity, measured by a visual analogue scale, between comparators in the only trial which reported the pain intensity at between four and eight hours after surgery. Times to return to activity and return to work were not reported in any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that one anaesthetic regimen for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to be preferred over another. However, the data are sparse (that is, there were few trials under each comparison and the trials had few participants) and further well designed randomized trials at low risk of bias and which are powered to measure differences in clinically important outcomes are necessary to determine the optimal anaesthetic regimen for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy, one of the commonest procedures performed in the western world.

### Pharmacological interventions for prevention or treatment of postoperative pain in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^1142fCgN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally considered less painful than open surgery, pain is one of the important reasons for delayed discharge after day-surgery and overnight stay following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The safety and effectiveness of different pharmacological interventions such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and anticonvulsant analgesics in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of different analgesics in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform portal (WHO ICTRP) to March 2013 to identify randomised clinical trials of relevance to this review.

Selection Criteria

We considered only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing different pharmacological interventions with no intervention or inactive controls for outcomes related to benefit in this review. We considered comparative non-randomised studies with regards to treatment-related harms. We also considered trials that compared one class of drug with another class of drug for this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors collected the data independently. We analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis. For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 25 trials with 2505 participants randomised to the different pharmacological agents and inactive controls. All the trials were at unclear risk of bias. Most trials included only low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Participants were allowed to take additional analgesics as required in 24 of the trials. The pharmacological interventions in all the included trials were aimed at preventing pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There were considerable differences in the pharmacological agents used and the methods of administration. The estimated effects of the intervention on the proportion of participants who were discharged as day-surgery, the length of hospital stay, or the time taken to return to work were imprecise in all the comparisons in which these outcomes were reported (very low quality evidence). There was no mortality in any of the groups in the two trials that reported mortality (183 participants, very low quality evidence). Differences in serious morbidity outcomes between the groups were imprecise across all the comparisons (very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported patient quality of life or time taken to return to normal activity. The pain at 4 to 8 hours was generally reduced by about 1 to 2 cm on the visual analogue scale of 1 to 10 cm in the comparisons involving the different pharmacological agents and inactive controls (low or very low quality evidence). The pain at 9 to 24 hours was generally reduced by about 0.5 cm (a modest reduction) on the visual analogue scale of 1 to 10 cm in the comparisons involving the different pharmacological agents and inactive controls (low or very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence of very low quality that different pharmacological agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioid analgesics, and anticonvulsant analgesics reduce pain scores in people at low anaesthetic risk undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the decision to use these drugs has to weigh the clinically small reduction in pain against uncertain evidence of serious adverse events associated with many of these agents. Further randomised clinical trials of low risk of systematic and random errors are necessary. Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life and time to return to work in their assessment.

### Failure of neuromuscular blockade despite high doses of rocuronium and atracurium in a patient with colorectal carcinoma: a case report [^111ee1ey]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) are drugs administered during general anaesthesia to provide muscle relaxation required for tracheal intubation and surgical procedures. Non-depolarising NMBA act as competitive antagonists of acetylcholine at the nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChR) located at the motor endplate. Resistance or attenuation of the effects of rocuronium and other NMBA have been previously reported and include delayed onset of relaxation, incomplete paralysis under recommended doses, or unusually rapid recovery from neuromuscular block. These conditions have been reported – in association with denervation injury, burns, lengthy immobilisation, congenital heart defects, infections, continued use of NMBA, chronic use of anticonvulsants and steroids.

In this report, we describe the case of a healthy young male without any known pre-disposing factor for NMBA resistance, who failed to attain muscle relaxation during abdominal surgery despite very high doses of rocuronium and atracurium.

The patient provided written consent for the publication of this case report. This work follows the CARE guidelines from the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network.

### The effect of intraoperative lidocaine versus esmolol infusion on postoperative analgesia in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a randomized clinical trial [^116m1mj3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority clinical trial was conducted at BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences between January 2015 and April 2016. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Review Board (Ref: IERB 284/014) and the trial was registered prior to patient enrollment at(NCT02327923). The study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and it adheres to the guidelines of the CONSORT statement.

Female patients aged 18 to 60 years, American society of Anesthesiologist physical status I and II, scheduled for general anesthesia for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included those with inability to comprehend VAS or severe mental impairment, difficult intubation, pregnancy, morbid obesity, history of epilepsy or allergy to any drugs used in the study, current use of opioids or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, baseline heart rate < 50 beats/min, acute cholecystitis, and chronic pain other than cholelithiasis.

Eligible participants were identified during the pre-anesthetic clinic visit. Informed written consent from the recruited patients was taken in the evening before surgery at the in-patient unit. Patients were also instructed about the use of the 10 cm VAS for pain where 0 was "no pain" and 10 was "worst pain". Oral diazepam (5 mg for ≤ 50 kg and 10 mg for > 50 kg) was given the night before and 2 h before surgery as premedication.

On the day of surgery at the preoperative holding area, patients were randomly assigned (allocation 1:1) into one of the two groups according to a computer generated random number table. Details of group assignment and case number were kept in a set of sealed opaque envelopes. The anesthesia staff opened the envelope and prepared drugs accordingly. Both the patient and the investigator observing the outcome were blinded to the patient group assignment. The attending anesthesiologist not involved in the study managed the case intraoperatively.

### 2023 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for monitoring and antagonism of neuromuscular blockade: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on neuromuscular blockade [^1169XA9x]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for reversal of neuromuscular blockade, more specifically with respect to reversal, ASA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering neostigmine at minimal neuromuscular blockade depth to avoid residual neuromuscular blockade when atracurium or cisatracurium are administered and qualitative assessment is used. Perform extubation as soon as a train-of-four ratio ≥ 0.9 is confirmed before extubation. Allow at least 10 minutes from antagonism to extubation in the absence of quantitative monitoring.

### Inspired oxygen fraction of 0.8 compared with 0.4 does not further reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting in dolasetron-treated patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^112M77Td]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of the most frequent complications after general anaesthesia. Single-dose antiemetic prophylaxis has limited efficacy in high-risk patients. Adding a simple potential antiemetic approach, such as increasing the inspired oxygen fraction, to the antiemetic portfolio would preserve pharmacological interventions for treatment of symptoms in the postoperative period. However, the antiemetic effect of a high inspired oxygen fraction is still discussed controversially. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether an inspired oxygen fraction of 0.8 decreases PONV in patients receiving the 5-HT3-antagonist dolasetron.

Methods

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial we studied 377 patients (ASA I-III) undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Induction of anaesthesia was standardized, including thiopental fentanyl and cis-atracurium. For all patients the individual risk for PONV was calculated using the Koivuranta score and all patients received 12.5 mg dolasetron i.v. before surgery. Patients were allocated randomly to one of three groups: Group A (n = 125) received 80% oxygen in air, Group B (n = 125) 40% oxygen in air and Group C (n = 127) 40% oxygen in nitrous oxide. Postoperative nausea, postoperative vomiting (PV), or nausea, vomiting, or both (PONV) was assessed in the early (0–4 h) and overall postoperative period (0–24 h) by an anaesthesiologist unaware of patient allocation.

Results

There was a significantly lower incidence of PONV and PV in Groups A (PONV: 11.2%; PV: 3.2%) and B (PONV: 10.4%; PV: 3.2%) compared with Group C (PONV: 26.7%; PV: 13.3%), but there were no significant differences between Groups A and B.

Conclusions

An inspired oxygen fraction of 0.8 does not further decrease PONV or vomiting in dolasetron-treated patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The lower incidence of PONV in Groups A and B compared with Group C is most likely caused by the omission of nitrous oxide.

METHODS

Study Design

This randomized, double-blind, gender-stratified trial was conducted at 2 Swiss university hospitals (Geneva and Lausanne), following the recommendations of Good Clinical Research Practice in Neuromuscular Research. The study protocol, patient information sheet, and informed consent form were approved by the ethics committees of Geneva University Hospitals (protocol no. CER11-235/NAC11-087) and Lausanne University Hospital (protocol no. 306/12), and by the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic; 2012DR3098). The trial was registered before patient enrollment on(NCT01571908, principal investigator: Christoph Czarnetzki, date of registration: April 4, 2012). This article adheres to the applicable Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

Study Population and Recruitment

The anesthesia teams of Geneva and Lausanne University Hospitals identified eligible patients during the preanesthetic consultation and obtained written informed consent before enrollment. Included were male and female patients aged 18–65 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II and scheduled for elective surgery lasting longer than 60 minutes. Exclusion criteria were a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to rocuronium, succinylcholine, or MgSO 4; neuromuscular disease; history of malignant hyperthermia; preoperative medications known to influence neuromuscular function (eg, certain antibiotics [aminoglycosides], anticonvulsants [phenytoin]); electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypermagnesemia or hyperkalemia); hepatic dysfunction (ie, bilirubin > 1.5 × upper limit of normal [ULN], alanine aminotransferase [ALT] > 2.5 × ULN, aspartate aminotransferase [AST] > 2.5 × ULN); renal insufficiency (ie, creatinine > 1.5 × ULN, creatinine clearance < 60 mL·min – 1 1.73 m – 2, estimated by the formula of Cockroft & Gault); atrioventricular heart block; patients with magnesium treatment; those with a body mass index < 19 or > 28 kg·m – 2; pregnant or breastfeeding women; expected difficult intubation or mask ventilation; and patients having participated in any clinical trial within the previous 30 days.

### Fourth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^11354cRv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). High credibility.

Gabapentinoid antiemetics — given 1–2 hours before surgery, gabapentin 600–800 mg orally has been shown to decrease PONV (evidence A1); in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, PONV was reduced (25.2% vs 47.6%), and disadvantages of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogs include sedation, visual disturbances, dizziness, and headache; gabapentin was associated with respiratory depression and the FDA warned of respiratory depression when gabapentinoids are combined with CNS depressants such as opioids, and when used as part of multimodal analgesic regimens, intraoperative opioids should be reduced.

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^115MvPm2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for laparoscopic cholecystectomy states that antibiotics are not required in low risk patients (Level I, Grade A), while antibiotics may reduce the incidence of wound infection in high risk patients (age > 60 years, the presence of diabetes, acute colic within 30 days of operation, jaundice, acute cholecystitis, or cholangitis) (Level I, Grade B). If given, they should be limited to a single preoperative dose given within one hour of skin incision (Level II, Grade A), and re-dosed if the procedure is more than 4 hours long; among supportive data, a recent randomized study found fewer wound infections with ampicillin-sulbactam versus cefuroxime, particularly for infection caused by enterococcus in high-risk patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy.

### Butorphanol premedication improves postoperative lung function and analgesic outcomes in laparoscopic surgery: a randomized dose-response study [^1135AKRJ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case selection

This study enrolled patients who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University between June 2021 and December 2023. The majority of cases were laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy (> 85%), with the remainder including procedures such as laparoscopic exploration and hernia repair, to ensure consistency in surgical trauma and baseline pain levels. All surgeries were performed under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation, and standardized positioning was adopted according to surgical type: reverse Trendelenburg (head-up 15°−20°) for cholecystectomy, and supine or mild Trendelenburg (head-down 5°−10°) for appendectomy, to minimize the influence of positioning on respiratory mechanics. The study protocol was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University (Approval No. KLL-2020-041), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Inclusion Criteria: (1) Patients aged 18–65 years, with an equal distribution of males and females; (2) Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30; (3) American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-III classification, requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation; (4) Patients without neurological or psychiatric disorders; (5) No significant abnormalities in laboratory tests; (6) Surgery duration between 30 min and 3 h.

Exclusion Criteria: (1) Patients with drug allergies or allergic diseases; (2) Pregnant or breastfeeding patients; (3) Patients who have had respiratory infections or used antibiotics within 2 weeks before surgery; (4) Patients who have used analgesics within 2 weeks before surgery; (5) Patients with poorly controlled hypertension, diabetes, or endocrine disorders; (6) Patients with significant liver, kidney, coagulation, respiratory function, or electrocardiogram abnormalities; (7) Patients deemed unsuitable for inclusion by the researchers.

Exclusion Criteria for Withdrawal: (1) Patients who failed endotracheal intubation three times; (2) Patients who experienced severe pulmonary complications during surgery (such as pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism) or significant airway pressure fluctuations (airway pressure changes greater than 30% from baseline); (3) Patients who experienced severe intraoperative hemorrhage, used corticosteroids, pulmonary circulation improving drugs, or other analgesics required for non-general anesthesia maintenance; (4) Patients who required emergency critical care during the observation period (Fig. 1).

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^113CzvkY]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Obesity — weight-based neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) dosing: In severely obese bariatric surgery patients, atracurium dosing by ideal body weight improved recovery versus actual body weight, with 20 patients studied and body mass index 38–79 kg/m2; none in the ideal body weight group required neostigmine compared with 70% with actual body weight dosing, and actual body weight showed a dose-dependent prolongation of recovery. Small open-label trials in obese versus nonobese patients did not find recovery-time differences, but pharmacokinetic findings with atracurium suggested actual body weight should not be used for dosing, and an open-label pancuronium trial (n = 14) had important limitations. Collectively, authors recommended against actual body weight and uniformly recommended ideal body weight for weight-based dosing; continued use of ideal body weight seems reasonable until lean body weight dosing equations are evaluated, and an adjusted weight that accounts for a portion of excess weight might be reasonable. Importantly, clinicians should strive for consistency in weight measurement and choice of weight among patients and for a single patient when using weight-based dosing for NMBAs.

### Use of low-dose pregabalin in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^116BbuyR]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of low-dose pregabalin on the analgesic efficacy, side-effects, and recovery profile in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Methods

One hundred and sixty-two patients aged 18–65 yr, of ASA physical status I-III, undergoing elective outpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomy were recruited and randomized in this prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to receive one of the following study medications orally: pregabalin 50 mg, pregabalin 75 mg, or placebo, 1 h before surgery and then every 12 h after operation for a total of three doses. Postoperative numeric pain scores, analgesic consumption, recovery score (QoR-40), and side-effects (opioid-related symptom distress scale) were assessed in the early postoperative period (every 15 min during the first hour, at 90, 120 min, 6, and 12 h) and at days 1, 2, and 7. Data were analysed using an intention-to-treat method.

Results

Compared with the placebo group, the pain scores were lower in the pregabalin 75 mg group in the first 90 min after surgery (P < 0.05). Pregabalin 50 mg resulted in pain reduction at 30 and 45 min (P < 0.05) relative to placebo. The analgesic consumption, side-effects, and recovery scores were similar among the three groups.

Conclusions

Perioperative administration of pregabalin 75 mg provided limited analgesic benefit in the postoperative period. An updated meta-analysis confirms this finding (see Supplementary material).

### Wound infiltration with local anaesthetic agents for laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^1143ctGk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally considered to be less painful than open surgery, pain is one of the important reasons for delayed discharge after day surgery resulting in overnight stay following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The safety and effectiveness of local anaesthetic wound infiltration in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not known.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of local anaesthetic wound infiltration in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to identify the best method of local anaesthetic wound infiltration with regards to the type of local anaesthetic, dosage, and time of administration of the local anaesthetic.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until February 2013 to identify studies of relevance to this review. We included randomised clinical trials for benefit and quasi-randomised and comparative non-randomised studies for treatment-related harms.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing local anaesthetic wound infiltration versus placebo, no intervention, or inactive control during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, trials comparing different local anaesthetic agents for local anaesthetic wound infiltration, and trials comparing the different times of local anaesthetic wound infiltration were considered for the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors collected the data independently. We analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analysis models using RevMan. For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

Twenty-six trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the review. All the 26 trials except one trial of 30 participants were at high risk of bias. Nineteen of the trials with 1263 randomised participants provided data for this review. Ten of the 19 trials compared local anaesthetic wound infiltration versus inactive control. One of the 19 trials compared local anaesthetic wound infiltration with two inactive controls, normal saline and no intervention. Two of the 19 trials had four arms comparing local anaesthetic wound infiltration with inactive controls in the presence and absence of co-interventions to decrease pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Four of the 19 trials had three or more arms that could be included for the comparison of local anaesthetic wound infiltration versus inactive control and different methods of local anaesthetic wound infiltration. The remaining two trials compared different methods of local anaesthetic wound infiltration. Most trials included only low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Seventeen trials randomised a total of 1095 participants to local anaesthetic wound infiltration (587 participants) versus no local anaesthetic wound infiltration (508 participants). Various anaesthetic agents were used but bupivacaine was the commonest local anaesthetic used. There was no mortality in either group in the seven trials that reported mortality (0/280 (0%) in local anaesthetic infiltration group versus 0/259 (0%) in control group). The effect of local anaesthetic on the proportion of people who developed serious adverse events was imprecise and compatible with increase or no difference in serious adverse events (seven trials; 539 participants; 2/280 (0.8%) in local anaesthetic group versus 1/259 (0.4%) in control; RR 2.00; 95% CI 0.19 to 21.59; very low quality evidence). None of the serious adverse events were related to local anaesthetic wound infiltration. None of the trials reported patient quality of life. The proportion of participants who were discharged as day surgery patients was higher in the local anaesthetic infiltration group than in the no local anaesthetic infiltration group (one trial; 97 participants; 33/50 (66.0%) in the local anaesthetic group versus 20/47 (42.6%) in the control group; RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.28; very low quality evidence). The effect of local anaesthetic on the length of hospital stay was compatible with a decrease, increase, or no difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups (four trials; 327 participants; MD -0.26 days; 95% CI -0.67 to 0.16; very low quality evidence). The pain scores as measured by the visual analogue scale (0 to 10 cm) were lower in the local anaesthetic infiltration group than the control group at 4 to 8 hours (13 trials; 806 participants; MD -1.33 cm on the VAS; 95% CI -1.54 to -1.12; very low quality evidence) and 9 to 24 hours (12 trials; 756 participants; MD -0.36 cm on the VAS; 95% CI -0.53 to -0.20; very low quality evidence). The effect of local anaesthetic on the time taken to return to normal activity between the two groups was imprecise and compatible with a decrease, increase, or no difference in the time taken to return to normal activity (two trials; 195 participants; MD 0.14 days; 95% CI -0.59 to 0.87; very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported on return to work. Four trials randomised a total of 149 participants to local anaesthetic wound infiltration prior to skin incision (74 participants) versus local anaesthetic wound infiltration at the end of surgery (75 participants). Two trials randomised a total of 176 participants to four different local anaesthetics (bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, ropivacaine, neosaxitoxin). Although there were differences between the groups in some outcomes the changes were not consistent. There was no evidence to support the preference of one local anaesthetic over another or to prefer administration of local anaesthetic at a specific time compared with another.

Authors' Conclusions

Serious adverse events were rare in studies evaluating local anaesthetic wound infiltration (very low quality evidence). There is very low quality evidence that infiltration reduces pain in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the clinical importance of this reduction in pain is likely to be small. Further randomised clinical trials at low risk of systematic and random errors are necessary. Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life and time to return to work in their assessment.

### The median effective dose (ED50) of cis-atracurium for laryngeal mask airway insertion during general anaesthesia for patients undergoing urinary surgery [^112rP2Y5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Our results indicated that the HR was significantly decreased in the 50 μg·kg − 1 group compared to the 30 μg·kg − 1 group at T7, T8, and T10. This finding indirectly reflected a lower stress in the 50 μg·kg − 1 group compared to the 30 μg·kg − 1 group and the 20 μg·kg − 1 group. Cis -atracurium did not exert significant haemodynamic changes, even at different concentrations. However, the interaction among anaesthetic agents caused a statistically significant decline in some haemodynamic parameters at certain timepoints. However, this change was not a clinical effect and required no vasopressor agents. Using an appropriate NMBA did not affect the extubation time but reduced the stress reaction. Cis -atracurium did not cause harmful autonomic nervous system effects and resulted in reduced secretion of histamine. Some investigators have demonstrated no cardiovascular system variations, even with histamine secretion, when administering a double dose of ED95 to patients with coronary artery disease. The pharmacodynamics of NMBAs are affected by several factors such as temperature, use of inhalation agents, magnesium, local anaesthetics, antiepileptic drugs, age, weight, and plasma clearance and volume of distribution. Our study revealed no difference among the three groups in terms of the ASA Physical Status, age, weight, height, and sex. The patients' body temperature in each group was maintained within the normal range. We restricted the use of inhalation anaesthesia throughout the operation.

### Analgesic treatment after laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a critical assessment of the evidence [^116TEsGj]. Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

Acute pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is complex in nature. The pain pattern does not resemble pain after other laparoscopic procedures, suggesting that analgesic treatment might be procedure specific and multimodal. Randomized trials of analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were identified by systematic electronic literature searches (1985 to June 2005) supplemented with manual searching. The trials were categorized by well-defined criteria into high, moderate, or poor methodologic quality. Conclusions were based on trials of high and moderate methodologic quality. In total, 64 randomized analgesic trials were identified, comprising a total of 5,018 evaluated patients. The literature suggests a multimodal analgesic regimen consisting of a preoperative single dose of dexamethasone, incisional local anesthetics (at the beginning or at the end of surgery, depending on preference), and continuous treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors) during the first 3–4 days. Opioids should be used only when other analgesic techniques fail.

### Surgical space conditions during low-pressure laparoscopic cholecystectomy with deep versus moderate neuromuscular blockade: a randomized clinical study [^116ce7p1]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed during low intraabdominal pressure (< 12 mm Hg) is associated with significantly less postoperative pain than standard pressure (≥ 12 mm Hg). The impact on surgical space conditions and safety of operating at lower pressures has not been adequately described, but deep neuromuscular blockade may be beneficial. We investigated if deep muscle relaxation would be associated with a higher proportion of procedures with "optimal" surgical space conditions compared with moderate relaxation during low-pressure (8 mm Hg) laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Methods

In this assessor-blinded study, 48 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were administered rocuronium for neuromuscular blockade and randomized to either deep neuromuscular blockade (rocuronium bolus plus infusion maintaining a posttetanic count 0–1) or moderate neuromuscular blockade (rocuronium repeat bolus only for inadequate surgical conditions with spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function). Patients received anesthesia with propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium. The primary outcome was the proportion of procedures with optimal surgical space conditions (assessed by the surgeon as 1 on a 4-point scale). Secondary outcomes included the proportion of procedures completed at pneumoperitoneum 8 mm Hg and surgical space conditions on dissection of the gallbladder (numeric rating scale 0–100; 0 = optimal surgical space conditions; 100 = unacceptable surgical space conditions).

Results

Optimal surgical space conditions during the entire procedure were observed in 7 of 25 patients allocated to deep neuromuscular blockade and in 1 of 23 patients allocated to moderate blockade (P = 0.05) with an absolute difference of 24% between the groups (95% confidence interval, 4%-43%). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was completed at pneumoperitoneum 8 mm Hg in 15 of 25 and 8 of 23 patients in the deep and moderate group, respectively (95% confidence interval, -2% to 53%; P = 0.08). Surgical space conditions during dissection of the gallbladder assessed by use of the numeric rating scale were 20 (10–50) (median [25%-75% range]) in the deep neuromuscular blockade group and 30 (10–50) in the moderate group (P = 0.58; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney odds, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.6–2.5). No operations were converted to laparotomy.

Conclusions

Deep neuromuscular blockade was associated with surgical space conditions that were marginally better than with moderate muscle relaxation during low-pressure laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

### Are there any advantages of the low opioid anaesthesia and non-opioid postoperative analgesia protocol: a clinical observational study [^114M1euu]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

This study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of Bialystok, Poland (R-I-002/105/2019), and all patients were informed and provided written consent. The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was conducted during the period from September 2019 to December 2019.

The study included a total of 80 adult patients qualified for general anaesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to chronic cholecystitis calculosa with a preoperative health assessment according to the American Society of Anaesthesiologists Scale (ASA) I and II. The criteria for excluding a patient from the study and the control group included refusal to participate in the study, health status according to ASA III and IV, a history of cancer or initial cancer diagnosis, and chronic pain, liver cirrhosis, and epilepsy. Moreover, the study did not include patients with an addiction to drugs, alcohol and psychoactive substances or a history of postoperative nausea and vomiting, allergic reactions or contraindications to analgesics.

This study included 80 adult patients divided into two groups according to the method of anaesthesia: the study group — 40 patients who received general anaesthesia with the low-opioid protocol (low-opioid anaesthesia — LOA) — and the control group — 40 patients who received general anaesthesia with the use of the opioid drug fentanyl (opioid anaesthesia — OA). Postoperative analgesia included the administration of 1g of paracetamol and 1g of metamizol intravenously, with a 6-hour interval between doses. Depending on the degree of pain control, patients could opt out of the planned doses of analgesics or receive additional analgesics, and in the case of nausea or vomiting, ondansetron at a dose of 4 mg intravenously was administered.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative nausea, vomiting and pain within 2 hours after surgery. Secondary endpoints included most severe intensity of the nausea, vomiting and pain within next postoperative periods: 2–6, 6–12, 12–24 h after surgery.

### Neuromuscular blockade in the elderly patient [^113PR5rE]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Elderly patients are more sensitive to atracurium doses, the reason for which remains unclear. Xue et alshowed the above to be true, as smaller doses were needed to produce the same clinical result and the duration of action of a given dose was increased. A proposed mechanism was the increased sensitivity of the neuromuscular junction. However, this might not be the answer as d'Hollander et alfound that both in the elderly and the younger patients, the same dose of atracurium was needed to suppress the twitch response by 50%.

Another benzylisoquinolinium, mivacurium, a short-acting NMBA, showed prolongation of recovery and increased onset time. It is almost exclusively eliminated through hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterases, the activity of which decreases in the elderly. Its clearance and elimination half-life in the elderly are thought to be unchanged. In clinical practice, Dahaba et alsuggested a reduction of infusion dose from 0.5 to 0.4 mg/kg/h after a standard initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg.

Sagir et aldirectly compared rocuronium, vecuronium, and cisatracurium in elderly patients undergoing abdominal surgery. They concluded that the benzylisoquinolinium compound was safer than the two aminosteroids in the elderly because it performed better in time to positive strength and visual disturbance tests, indicating less risk of residual neuromuscular blockade.

### Impact of intravenous dexamethasone on the initiation and recovery of atracurium in children: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial [^111gnPok]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic steroid intake has been associated with attenuation of neuromuscular block. Despite some promising animal and adult studies, the effect of a single dose of intravenous dexamethasone on neuromuscular blockers is not well established. Thus, the present study aimed to demonstrate the effect of dexamethasone given at the time of induction for the prevention of PONV on the action of neuromuscular blockers in children undergoing elective surgery.

Method

After obtaining approval from the Institute Ethics Committee and written informed parental consent, 100 ASA I and II children aged 4-15years undergoing elective surgery randomized to receive either: 0.15mg/kg (maximum of 5 mg) of dexamethasone diluted to a total volume of 2 mL with 0.9% saline (n = 50) or 2 mL of 0.9% saline (n = 50) at the time of induction. The time interval between application of atracurium and maximum T1 depression, 25% twitch height recovery of T1, amid 25% and 75% twitch height recovery of T1, amid the 25% twitch height recovery of T1 and recovery of the neuromuscular block to a TOF ratio of 0.9, and in between the initiation of atracurium injection till the recovery of the neuromuscular block to a TOF ratio of 0.9 was defined as onset time, clinical duration, recovery index, recovery time, and total recovery period, respectively, and recorded.

Results

The onset time and recovery index time were lower (1.96 ± 0.39, 8.04 ± 2.14, respectively) with dexamethasone in comparison with saline (2.01 ± 0.51, 8.9 ± 3.4, respectively) but not statistically significant. The clinical duration, recovery time, and total recovery period were similar.

Conclusion

Application of a single bolus dose (0.15mg/kg) of dexamethasone during induction does not attenuate atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade in children.

### Atracurium besylate [^115vdCGA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Infusion in the Operating Room (OR)

After administration of a recommended initial bolus dose of atracurium besylate injection (0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg), a diluted solution of atracurium besylate can be administered by continuous infusion to adults and pediatric patients aged 2 or more years for maintenance of neuromuscular block during extended surgical procedures.

Infusion of atracurium should be individualized for each patient. The rate of administration should be adjusted according to the patient's response as determined by peripheral nerve stimulation. Accurate dosing is best achieved using a precision infusion device.

Infusion of atracurium should be initiated only after early evidence of spontaneous recovery from the bolus dose. An initial infusion rate of 9 to 10 mcg/kg/min may be required to rapidly counteract the spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function. Thereafter, a rate of 5 to 9 mcg/kg/min should be adequate to maintain continuous neuromuscular block in the range of 89% to 99% in most pediatric and adult patients under balanced anesthesia. Occasional patients may require infusion rates as low as 2 mcg/kg/min or as high as 15 mcg/kg/min.

The neuromuscular blocking effect of atracurium administered by infusion is potentiated by enflurane or isoflurane and, to a lesser extent, by halothane. Reduction in the infusion rate of atracurium should, therefore, be considered for patients receiving inhalation anesthesia. The rate of atracurium infusion should be reduced by approximately one-third in the presence of steady-state enflurane or isoflurane anesthesia; smaller reductions should be considered in the presence of halothane.

In patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass with induced hypothermia, the rate of infusion of atracurium required to maintain adequate surgical relaxation during hypothermia (25° to 28°C) has been shown to be approximately half the rate required during normothermia.

Spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular block following discontinuation of atracurium infusion may be expected to proceed at a rate comparable to that following administration of a single bolus dose.

### Randomized clinical trial of moderate versus deep neuromuscular block for low-pressure pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^113cvgq8]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The beneficial effects of deep blockade are not fully known. In this study, we evaluated the effect of deep neuromuscular blockade on surgical conditions during laparoscopic cholecystectomy under low-pressure pneumoperitoneum.

Methods

Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to either the moderate group (train-of-four count of 1 or 2) or deep group (posttetanic count of 1 or 2). Neuromuscular blockade was induced and maintained with rocuronium; it was reversed with sugammadex in the deep group and with neostigmine in the moderate group. At the beginning of surgery, the intra-abdominal pressure was set at 8 mmHg. The surgeon rated the surgical condition on a 4-point scale (1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = acceptable, 4 = poor) and was allowed to increase the pressure to 12 mmHg if it was determined that the surgical conditions were inadequate for the operation.

Results

A total of 64 patients completed the study. The rate of increasing intra-abdominal pressure to maintain optimal surgical conditions was 34.4% in the moderate group and 12.5% in the deep group (P = 0.039). The proportion of patients with a surgical condition score of 1 or 2 (excellent or good) was 34.4% in the moderate group and 68.8% in the deep group (P = 0.006).

Conclusion

The maintenance of intraoperative deep neuromuscular blockade was associated with a lower rate of conversion to standard pressure and higher surgeon satisfaction with the surgical conditions than was moderate blockade in patients undergoing low-pressure pneumoperitoneum laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

### Neuromuscular blockade improves surgical conditions (NISCO) [^116h7Fgo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We examined the impact of muscle relaxation on surgical conditions and patients' postoperative outcome during elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under balanced anaesthesia.

Methods

After approval and consent, 57 anaesthetized patients were randomly assigned to group no neuromuscular blockade (No NMB) and deep neuromuscular blockade (Deep NMB), i.e. no twitch response to train-of-four nerve stimulation. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed using the 4-trocar technique with a CO2-pneumoperitoneum. Surgical conditions were assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale. Movement of diaphragm or abdominal muscles, inadequate visibility, or breathing and coughing against the ventilator were documented as events reflecting inadequate muscle relaxation. Independently, surgeons could request 0.3 mg/kg rocuronium to improve surgical conditions. Workflow variables were obtained as a surrogate of surgical conditions. Data are presented as mean (95% confidence interval). The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00895778).

Results

While in 12 of 25 patients of group "No NMB" one or more adverse events impaired the surgical procedure (p < 0.001), only 1 of 25 patients of group "Deep NMB" showed an adverse event. Deep NMB resulted in an absolute risk reduction of 0.44 (0.23–0.65) and a number needed to treat of 2.3 (1.5–4.4), respectively. Surgeons requested 0.3 mg/kg rocuronium in 10 of 25 cases (40%) of group "No NMB" only. This dose significantly improved surgical conditions by an average 62 of 100 possible points. All further variables did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Deep NMB ameliorates surgical conditions for laparoscopic cholecystectomy by improved visibility and reduction of involuntary movements.

### Undiagnosed myasthenia gravis unmasked by neuromuscular blockade [^113o3jDq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an uncommon autoimmune disease resulting in destruction of the postsynaptic nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction. We describe a 43-yr-old, 95 kg patient who presented for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. She was given vecuronium 10 mg to facilitate tracheal intubation. At the end of the procedure the patient could not maintain adequate spontaneous ventilation despite administration of two doses of neostigmine 2.5 mg. Subsequent investigation led to a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. We discuss the investigation, diagnosis, and subsequent management of such a patient and emphasize that tactile estimation of the train-of-four ratio is not a reliable indicator of adequate recovery of neuromuscular function.

### Effects of pre-emptive pregabalin and multimodal anesthesia on postoperative opioid requirements in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy [^111eEem2]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients undergoing RALP at high-volume centers are discharged on the first postoperative day. In our study the median of LOS was 31 h, which is in line with earlier findings. Postoperative pain was well controlled and major part of patients did require opioids on first postoperative day. The main reasons for discharge later than on the first postoperative day were logistical i.e. patient living in the rural areas needing a special means of transportation or suspicion of acute postoperative complication such as bleeding or infection.

Perioperative dosing of pregabalin has been recently surveyed in various laparoscopic surgery patient populations. In a very recent randomized controlled trial patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery and receiving two doses of oral pregabalin had lower postoperative opioid consumption but similar pain scores compared to control group. A prospective study with patients undergoing laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy receiving two doses of oral pregabalin had lower postoperative opioid consumption but similar pain scores compared to the control group. Contrary to these, a recent randomized controlled trial with similar setting to our study concluded that pregabalin together with celecoxib offered no analgesic superiority over standard opioid care in postoperative pain therapy following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Recent large systematic review including 39 trials on endoscopic abdominal surgery found no clinically significant analgesic effect for perioperative used gabapentinoids. Use of perioperative pregabalin was associated with greater risk of adverse events. Our findings together with this systematic review suggest that routine use of pregabalin for patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery cannot be recommended.

Our retrospective study has some limitations. First, while patients after RALP experience mild to modest pain and the amounts of opioids are modest as well, it is difficult to demonstrate meaningful difference. Furthermore, owing to the lack of data, we were not able to reliably assess the postoperative pain scores, or the amount of opioid use after discharge. For the same reason, we were not able to assess the incidence of chronic pain and hyperesthesia in the long term. The retrospective design of the study could have also affected the results, even when only consecutive patients were included to avoid any selection bias. On the other hand all patients in our study received a standardized multimodal anesthesia and only few experienced surgeons were involved in the procedure. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate an effective multimodal anesthesia protocol associated with few side effects and a short LOS.

### Atracurium besylate [^114hwjg9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Atracurium besylate is a nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. Nondepolarizing agents antagonize the neurotransmitter action of acetylcholine by binding competitively with cholinergic receptor sites on the motor end-plate. This antagonism is inhibited, and neuromuscular block reversed, by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine.

Atracurium can be used most advantageously if muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation is monitored to assess degree of muscle relaxation.

The duration of neuromuscular block produced by atracurium is approximately one-third to one-half the duration of block by d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and pancuronium at initially equipotent doses. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, the time to onset of paralysis decreases and the duration of maximum effect increases with increasing atracurium doses.

The ED95(dose required to produce 95% suppression of the muscle twitch response with balanced anesthesia) has averaged 0.23 mg/kg (0.11 to 0.26 mg/kg in various studies). An initial atracurium dose of 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg generally produces maximum neuromuscular block within 3 to 5 minutes of injection, with good or excellent intubation conditions within 2 to 2.5 minutes in most patients. Recovery from neuromuscular block (under balanced anesthesia) can be expected to begin approximately 20 to 35 minutes after injection. Under balanced anesthesia, recovery to 25% of control is achieved approximately 35 to 45 minutes after injection, and recovery is usually 95% complete approximately 60 to 70 minutes after injection. The neuromuscular blocking action of atracurium is enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics. Isoflurane and enflurane increase the potency of atracurium and prolong neuromuscular block by approximately 35%; however, halothane's potentiating effect (approximately 20%) is marginal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^111rvHtW]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular blocker cardiovascular effects — vagolytic, ganglionic, and sympathetic actions: Vagotlyic actions are most prominent with pancuronium and result in mild, dose-dependent tachycardia; rocuronium has affinity for vagal receptors and can cause tachycardia in up to 30% of patients; vecuronium has relatively little effect on the heart though bradycardia has been reported; cisatracurium may also block M1 vagal receptors, but tachycardia does not appear clinically important. Ganglionic blockade can occur with large doses across NMBAs (pancuronium has weak ganglionic activity at recommended doses), whereas atracurium, cisatracurium, vecuronium, and rocuronium in recommended doses cause minimal, if any, ganglionic blockade. Sympathetic stimulation from pancuronium releases norepinephrine causing tachycardia, and vecuronium causes bradycardia via ganglionic or muscarinic stimulation of the vagus; heart rate effects depend on the patient's dominant tone, generally vagal at rest.

### Methods of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^117BbS52]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation may decrease pain in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the optimal method to administer the local anaesthetic is unknown.

Objectives

To determine the optimal local anaesthetic agent, the optimal timing, and the optimal delivery method of the local anaesthetic agent used for intraperitoneal instillation in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform portal (WHO ICTRP) to March 2013 to identify randomised clinical trials for assessment of benefit and comparative non-randomised studies for the assessment of treatment-related harms.

Selection Criteria

We considered only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing different methods of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation during laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors collected the data independently. We analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis. For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 12 trials with 798 participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy randomised to different methods of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation. All the trials were at high risk of bias. Most trials included only people with low anaesthetic risk. The comparisons included in the trials that met the eligibility criteria were the following; comparison of one local anaesthetic agent with another local anaesthetic agent (three trials); comparison of timing of delivery (six trials); comparison of different methods of delivery of the anaesthetic agent (two trials); comparison of location of the instillation of the anaesthetic agent (one trial); three trials reported mortality and morbidity. There were no mortalities or serious adverse events in either group in the following comparisons: bupivacaine (0/100 (0%)) versus lignocaine (0/106 (0%)) (one trial; 206 participants); just after creation of pneumoperitoneum (0/55 (0%)) versus end of surgery (0/55 (0%)) (two trials; 110 participants); just after creation of pneumoperitoneum (0/15 (0%)) versus after the end of surgery (0/15 (0%)) (one trial; 30 participants); end of surgery (0/15 (0%)) versus after the end of surgery (0/15 (0%)) (one trial; 30 participants). None of the trials reported quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, or the time taken to return to work. The differences in the proportion of people who were discharged as day-surgery and the length of hospital stay were imprecise in all the comparisons included that reported these outcomes (very low quality evidence). There were some differences in the pain scores on the visual analogue scale (1 to 10 cm) but these were neither consistent nor robust to fixed-effect versus random-effects meta-analysis or sensitivity analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence is inadequate to determine the effects of one method of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation compared with any other method of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation in low anaesthetic risk individuals undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further randomised clinical trials of low risk of systematic and random errors are necessary. Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life and time to return to work in their assessment.

### Elective cholecystectomy performed on patient with variegate porphyria-propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia with target-controlled infusion [^113DyFkC]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Porphyria is caused by disorders of enzymes that synthetize porphyrins. Both elective and emergency surgical procedures on patient suffering from porphyria may provoke acute symptoms. These patients require special anesthetic management since some of commonly used anesthetic agents may also induce acute manifestation of porphyria. We present the case of 53-year-old woman previously diagnosed with porphyria who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia with target-controlled infusion was used. Such conduct proved to be safe regarding clinical symptoms, although biochemical markers were slightly elevated after procedure. Propofol seems to be the safest hypnotic drug to use in porphyria; however, special care should be taken is such cases.

### Atracurium besylate [^114fuhMx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Infusion in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)

The principles for infusion of atracurium in the OR are also applicable to use in the ICU.

An infusion rate of 11 to 13 mcg/kg/min (range: 4.5 to 29.5) should provide adequate neuromuscular block in adult patients in an ICU. Limited information suggests that infusion rates required for pediatric patients in the ICU may be higher than in adult patients. There may be wide interpatient variability in dosage requirements and these requirements may increase or decrease with time (see PRECAUTIONS, Long-Term Use in Intensive Care Unit (ICU)). Following recovery from neuromuscular block, readministration of a bolus dose may be necessary to quickly re-establish neuromuscular block prior to reinstitution of the infusion.

Infusion Rate Tables

The amount of infusion solution required per minute will depend upon the concentration of atracurium in the infusion solution, the desired dose of atracurium, and the patient's weight. The following tables provide guidelines for delivery, in mL/hr (equivalent to microdrops/min when 60 microdrops = 1 mL), of atracurium solutions in concentrations of 0.2 mg/mL (20 mg in 100 mL) or 0.5 mg/mL (50 mg in 100 mL) with an infusion pump or a gravity flow device.

### Ondansetron [^1175PJrm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Serotonergic Drugs

Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including SSRIs and SNRIs. Monitor for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. If symptoms occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes

Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P‑450 drug‑metabolizing enzyme system of the liver [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P‑450 drug‑metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half‑life of ondansetron. In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Tramadol

Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small trials indicate that when used together, ondansetron may increase patient-controlled administration of tramadol. Monitor patients to ensure adequate pain control when ondansetron is administered with tramadol.

7.4 Chemotherapy

Carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron.

In a crossover trial in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase systemic concentrations of high-dose methotrexate.

7.5 Alfentanil and Atracurium

Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied.

### Individualized dosing with anesthetic agents [^115osuLb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The development of fundamental pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics concepts has enabled anesthesiologists to choose and dose anesthetic agents on a rational basis. The application of these concepts to a variety of clinical scenarios and patient populations makes it possible to individualize the dose, thereby decreasing the risk of complications. As more knowledge is gained about the sometimes profound differences in drug response, empirical dosing such as in milligrams per kilogram of total body weight is disappearing from the anesthesia specialty.

### The median effective dose (ED50) of cis-atracurium for laryngeal mask airway insertion during general anaesthesia for patients undergoing urinary surgery [^111nHMEt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In our study, the SBP was significantly lower in the 20 μg·kg − 1 group at T2 (i.e. anaesthesia induction timepoint), T3, and T4, and was indistinguishable from the SBP in the 30 μg·kg − 1 group and the 50 μg·kg − 1 group. No significant difference in SBP was observed between the 50 μg·kg − 1 group and the 30 μg·kg − 1 group. However, the propensity to maintain the SBP at a relatively stable level at the preoperative stage was the same among the three groups.

Over 50% of the patients in the 20 μg·kg − 1 group had an unsatisfactory first response to laryngeal mask insertion. Placement of a laryngeal mask requires adequate anaesthesia depth and mouth opening. Therefore, administration of additional doses of propofol and sufentanil was needed to achieve satisfactory insertion. The combination of an appropriate dose of muscle relaxants can improve laryngeal mask placement without increasing the incidence of associated adverse reactions, while reducing the amount of propofol or sufentanil anaesthetics and reducing their inhibitory effect on the circulation. Without the use of muscle relaxants, it is necessary to increase the depth of anaesthesia, which prolongs the time of the patient's recovery of consciousness.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^116cpbzw]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Haloperidol for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) — prophylaxis and treatment evidence indicates the following: For PONV prophylaxis, haloperidol 0.5–2 mg IV has been found effective, and efficacy and side effects (QT prolongation) are comparable with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (A1). Given after anesthesia induction, haloperidol 1 mg had efficacy and side-effects comparable to droperidol 0.625 mg, and haloperidol 2 mg at anesthesia induction or end of surgery did not change its 24 hour effectiveness. For PONV treatment, haloperidol 1 mg had comparable complete response rate to ondansetron 4 mg at the 4- and 24-hour post surgery, but with more sedation. In a dose-ranging study after laparoscopic abdominal hysterectomy, haloperidol 0.35, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg showed effectiveness at all doses except the 0.35 mg dose, with no QTc effects, neurologic or extrapyramidal symptoms observed. Additional findings include haloperidol 5 mg comparable to metoclopramide 10 mg, dexmedetomidine 25 mcg, and ginger for prevention of PONV in laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery, and to decrease postoperative nausea, haloperidol 1 mg was more effective than 5 mg dexamethasone with no difference in the POV risk.

### 2023 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for monitoring and antagonism of neuromuscular blockade: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on neuromuscular blockade [^113pXo7L]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Benzylisoquinolinium blockade antagonism considerations — Cisatracurium and atracurium can be antagonized only with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor such as neostigmine, as sugammadex is ineffective; antagonism success depends primarily on depth of block, with full antagonism within 10 min most likely when neostigmine is given with four twitches and no visible or tactile fade, success unlikely with fewer than four twitches, and under these circumstances limited evidence is consistent with a median time to antagonism less than 10 min with a wide range in time to recovery from a train-of-four ratio of less than 0.4 to a train-of-four count 2 to 3 blockade; verifying adequate recovery necessitates measuring train-of-four ratio with a quantitative monitor.

### The preoperative administration of ketoprofen improves analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in comparison with propacetamol or postoperative ketoprofen [^116wAS66]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Non-opioid analgesics, paracetamol and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are proposed for pain relief after laparoscopy. We compared perioperative propacetamol (P) and ketoprofen (K) to provide analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Methods

After ethical committee approval, we included 104 ASA I-II patients, without preoperative analgesic drugs, who were scheduled to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Anaesthesia was standardized using propofol, fentanyl, atracurium, isoflurane and N(2)O 50%. Ketoprofen 100 mg or propacetamol 2 g or a saline drip (a 100-ml unit of saline in 10 min) was infused blindly and randomly. Patients received either ketoprofen (group K1) or propacetamol (group P1) before induction of anaesthesia and saline after surgery, or saline before surgery and ketoprofen (group K2) or propacetamol (group P2) after surgery. Postoperative visual analogue pain scores (VAS 0–100 mm) were recorded during 24 h. If VAS was > 30, a second dose (placebo, ketoprofen or propacetamol) was infused. Nalbuphine 0.2 mg kg(-1) i.v. was given as rescue analgesic if VAS was ≥ 50.

Results

Ninety-eight patients were studied The number of patients not requiring the second analgesic was greater in K1 (33.5%) than the others (K2 0%, P1 0%, P2 7.5%). VAS scores were significantly lower in K1 (P = 0.001), with less nalbuphine consumption compared with P1. VAS and opioid request were similar in K2 and P2.

Conclusion

Preoperative administration of ketoprofen improves postoperative analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared with its postoperative administration and pre- and postoperative propacetamol.

### Antagonism of low degrees of atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade: dose-effect relationship for neostigmine [^116w3q4y]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Low degrees of residual paralysis (i.e., a train-of-four [TOF] ratio > 0.4) are relatively frequent, difficult to detect, and still potentially harmful. Unfortunately, the appropriate dose of anticholinesterase for this situation has not been determined. This may be of clinical interest because a high dose of neostigmine given at a shallow level of neuromuscular block may produce neuromuscular weakness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the dose-effect relationship of neostigmine to antagonize residual paralysis corresponding to a TOF ratio of 0.4 and 0.6.

Methods

Recovery after 10, 20, 30 microg/kg neostigmine or placebo given at either 0.4 or 0.6 TOF ratio was assessed by acceleromyography in 120 patients undergoing intravenous anesthesia. Time to a 0.9 and 1.0 TOF ratio was measured, and the probability of successful reversal within 10 min after the respective neostigmine doses was calculated. In addition, the dose of neostigmine needed to achieve the recovery targets in 5 or 10 min was also determined.

Results

When given at a TOF ratio of either 0.4 or 0.6, time to 0.9 and 1.0 TOF ratio was significantly shorter with any dose of neostigmine than without. The probability of successful reversal after 20 microg/kg neostigmine was 100% when a TOF ratio of 0.9 was the target; for a TOF ratio of 1.0, the probability was 93% and 67%, dependent on whether the dose of neostigmine was given at TOF ratio of 0.6 or 0.4, respectively. With a dose of 30 microg/kg, a TOF ratio of 1.0 is expected to be reached within approximately 5 min. Low doses of neostigmine are required to reach a TOF ratio of 0.9 or to accept an interval of 10 min.

Conclusion

Reduced doses (10–30 microg/kg) of neostigmine are effective in antagonizing shallow atracurium block. For successful reversal within 10 min, as little as 20 microg/kg neostigmine may be sufficient. These dose recommendations are specific for atracurium and an intravenous anesthetic background.

### Postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade after reversal based on a qualitative peripheral nerve stimulator response: a randomised controlled trial [^113wPGgg]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Incomplete recovery of neuromuscular blockade is a common postoperative adverse event in the postanaesthesia care unit.

Objective

We examined and compared the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade when the recommended dose of neostigmine or sugammadex was administered according to a qualitative nerve stimulator response.

Design

A randomised controlled trial.

Setting

A tertiary care hospital in South Korea from September 2017 to November 2017.

Patients

Eighty patients aged between 18 and 69 years were included in this study. All were patients scheduled to undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy and who had an American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status of one or two were eligible.

Interventions

Patients were allocated randomly to receive neostigmine or sugammadex at the end of surgery. The doses of the reversal agents were based on the response to peripheral nerve stimulation, which was discontinued after administration of the reversal agent.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade. The secondary outcomes were the incidences of symptoms or signs of residual neuromuscular blockade such as hypoxaemia, inability to maintain head-lift for 5s and diplopia.

Results

The incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade on arrival in the recovery room was 44.4% in the neostigmine group and 0% in the sugammadex group (P < 0.0001, relative risk = 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 2.41). The incidences of adverse events in the recovery room were low and comparable between the groups.

Conclusion

The incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade on arrival in the recovery room was significantly higher in the neostigmine group than that in the sugammadex group. However, the incidence of adverse events was similar in the neostigmine and sugammadex groups.

### Rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade is affected by chronic phenytoin therapy [^111jxT6R]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Patients receiving chronic anticonvulsant therapy have been reported to show resistance to certain nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers. In this study, the effects of chronic phenytoin therapy on the onset, duration, and recovery of rocuronium action was assessed. Thirty-six patients scheduled for various neurosurgical procedures were studied: 18 receiving chronic phenytoin therapy (Group I) and 18 controls (Group II). Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (2 x DE95) was administered after induction of general anesthesia with 4–6 mg/kg thiopental sodium and 3–5 microg/kg intravenous (IV) fentanyl. Maintenance anesthesia consisted of N2O in O2, 0.5% end-tidal isoflurane, and a fentanyl infusion. Neuromuscular block was monitored with acceleromyography of the adductor pollicis-brevis muscle by using a TOF-GUARD Biometer monitor (Biometer International A/S, Odense, Denmark). According to the amplitude of the first response of train-of-four, neither the lag time nor the onset time differed between the two groups. However, the recovery index was significantly shorter in patients chronically treated with phenytoin (mean recovery index: control group, 8.3 ± 1.7 minutes; phenytoin group, 6.7 ± 2.3 minutes; P < .05). In addition, the times of recovery to 10%, 25%, 75%, and 90% of the baseline response were also significantly shorter in the phenytoin group than in the control group. We conclude that the duration of action of rocuronium and the recovery index were affected by chronic phenytoin therapy.

Recommendation 19 — i.v. lidocaine infusions for abdominal surgery: The panel recommends that clinicians consider i.v. lidocaine infusions in adults who undergo open and laparoscopic abdominal surgery who do not have contraindications (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). In trials, lidocaine was typically given as a bolus (100–150 mg or 1.5–2.0 mg/kg) followed by an infusion of 2 to 3 mg/kg/h through the end of surgery. The panel found insufficient evidence to determine optimal dosing of lidocaine, but on the basis of clinical experience suggest an induction dose of 1.5 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg/h intraoperatively. Continuation of lidocaine in the postoperative period has not been well studied.

### Failure of neuromuscular blockade despite high doses of rocuronium and atracurium in a patient with colorectal carcinoma: a case report [^111XEMu3]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This report presents a case of complete resistance to rocuronium and atracurium in a patient operated for colorectal cancer, without any known pre-disposing factors. The anaesthesiologists were able to rule out problems with pharmaceutical aspects, monitoring and route of administration. During two surgeries performed several months apart, the administration of high doses of rocuronium and atracurium did not result in muscle relaxation. After complete resection of the colorectal carcinoma, a third procedure was performed, with rocuronium and atracurium leading to adequate muscle relaxation.

Careful neuromuscular monitoring and surgical evaluation of muscle paralysis were carried out during the three separate surgeries.

Rocuronium is an aminosteroid, whereas atracurium is a benzylisoquinoline. These NMBA have different duration of action, distribution, metabolism and excretion; however, paralysis was unsuccessful with both drugs. Pharmacokinetic modifications of volume of distribution, clearance, and protein binding could contribute to NMBA resistance. Kidney function and volaemic status were normal; elevation of α1-acid glycoprotein was ruled out.

Drug interactions are often responsible for attenuation or potentiation of drug effects. We identified three potential drugs interacting with NMBA: dexamethasone, sevoflurane and magnesium. While chronic corticosteroid treatment has been reported to attenuate NMBA effects, a randomised controlled trial demonstrated that dexamethasone during induction of anaesthesia does not modify NMBA response. Sevoflurane and magnesium sulphate are known to potentiate NMBA effects rather than attenuate them.

Upregulation, availability and modification of nAChR structure at the neuromuscular junction are mechanisms of NMBA resistance. Upper motor neuron lesions, burns, liver disease, renal failure, disuse atrophy are conditions known to negatively influence rocuronium action. Such conditions were absent in this patient. Moreover, he did not take any drugs prior to the first surgery; specifically no anticonvulsants, steroids or chemotherapy agents, whose negative influences on NMBA have been previously described.

### Effect of atracurium versus cisatracurium on QT interval changes in patients undergoing cataract surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^111b5MGc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cisatracurium and Atracurium

The findings from both the Cisatracurium and Atracurium groups reveal that these muscle relaxants significantly influence QTc intervals during the perioperative period, with varying patterns of change. In the Cisatracurium group, a significant reduction in QTc interval was noted from 5 min before anesthesia to several key points, including 5 min after anesthesia, the end of surgery, and most notably after recovery. However, a significant increase was observed between 5 min after anesthesia and the end of surgery, highlighting the drug's dynamic effect on cardiac repolarization. Similarly, Atracurium also led to significant reductions in the QTc interval from 5 min before anesthesia to 5 min after anesthesia and the end of surgery, while it significantly increased between 5 min after anesthesia and the end of surgery.

Similarly, Atracurium also resulted in significant reductions in QTc interval from 5 min before anesthesia to 5 min after anesthesia and the end of surgery, with a notable increase between 5 min after anesthesia and the end of surgery.

Although the changes during recovery were not consistently significant, both drugs appear to influence cardiac repolarization throughout surgery and into the recovery phase. These findings suggest that Cisatracurium and Atracurium may have differential effects on cardiac repolarization, which could have important clinical implications, particularly for patients at risk for QT prolongation.

Despite randomization and similar demographics, the observed difference in the QT interval in the Atracurium group before drug injection likely reflects normal biological and statistical variation, amplified by the small sample size. This minor variation, common in smaller studies, is within normal ranges and does not indicate a true clinical difference but a typical fluctuation that can occur in well-controlled trials with limited participants.

A few studies have compared the effectiveness of Atracurium and Cisatracurium in terms of treatment outcomes, such as in patients experiencing respiratory distress or undergoing surgery. For instance, a study by Moore and colleagues found no difference in treatment outcomes between the use of these medicines in managing respiratory distress patients. Additionally, a study by El-Kasaby et al. demonstrated differences in the intensity and duration of the effects of these medicines at different doses during surgery. However, in our review, we did not find any studies that compared the side effects of these medicines, including cardiac or other adverse effects.

### Low-dose neostigmine to antagonise shallow atracurium neuromuscular block during inhalational anaesthesia: a randomised controlled trial [^113wx2pK]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Even shallow residual neuromuscular block [i.e. train-of-four (TOF) ratio around 0.6] is harmful. It can be effectively antagonised by small doses of neostigmine, but reports are limited to intravenous anaesthesia. Inhalational anaesthesia may enhance neuromuscular block and delay recovery. It is not known whether low doses of neostigmine are still effective in the context of inhalational anaesthesia.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of low doses of neostigmine to antagonise shallow atracurium block during desflurane anaesthesia.

Design

Randomised controlled trial, four groups.

Setting

Single centre, University Hospital, May 2010 to March 2011.

Participants

Forty-eight American Society of Anesthesiologists I-III patients undergoing desflurane anaesthesia.

Intervention

At TOF ratio 0.6, patients were randomised to one of four treatments (physiological saline, 10, 20 or 30 µg kg(-1) neostigmine, n = 12 for each).

Main Outcome Measure

Primary efficacy endpoint: time interval between study drug injection and a TOF ratio more than 0.9 using acceleromyography. Secondary efficacy endpoint: neuromuscular recovery after 5 and 10 min.

Results

After physiological saline, the time interval [median (range)] between a TOF ratio of 0.6 and 0.9 was 14 (7 to 18) min. After 10, 20 and 30 µg kg(-1) neostigmine, it was reduced to 5 (3 to 8) min, 5 (3 to 10) and 4 (2 to 6) min, respectively (P < 0.001 compared to physiological saline). At 5 min after physiological saline, the TOF ratio [mean (SD)] was 0.73 (0.05) and 0.91 (0.06), 0.90 (0.10), 0.96 (0.02) after neostigmine 10, 20 or 30 µg kg(-1), respectively (P < 0.01 compared to physiological saline). At 10 min after physiological saline, the TOF ratio was 0.86 (0.08) and 1.0 (0), 0.98 (0.03), 1.0 (0) after neostigmine 10, 20 or 30 µg kg(-1), respectively (P < 0.01 compared to physiological saline).

Conclusion

Under desflurane anaesthesia, neostigmine 10 µg kg(-1) is effective in antagonising shallow atracurium block. Compared to no neostigmine, the time to a TOF ratio more than 0.9 was shortened and neuromuscular recovery at 5 and 10 min was more advanced.

### Prolonged residual paralysis after a single intubating dose of rocuronium [^111RXaon]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

It is often argued that neuromuscular monitoring is unnecessary when only one dose of an intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocking agent is given. This case report documents that it may take more than 3.5 h before it is possible to antagonize a block caused by a normal dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg kg(-1)). Possible causes of the extremely prolonged duration of action are discussed, as is the importance of quantitative neuromuscular monitoring.

### Extravascular injection of neuromuscular blocking drugs: a systematic review of current evidence and management [^111DofQR]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The recommendations and checklist from the PRISMA 2020 statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) were used to construct this narrative review. A literature search was performed on 5 February 2023 in the Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid EMBASE database using the search terms 'rocuronium', 'pancuronium', 'vecuronium', 'atracurium', 'cisatracurium', 'mivacurium' or 'succinylcholine' in combination with 'subcutaneous', 'paravenous', 'extravasation' or 'extravascular leakage'.

All abstracts and titles that contained a combination of these search terms, were published before February 2023 and were written in English, were considered. Three authors assessed the articles independently for their relevance. The exclusion criteria were defined as follows: the NMBDs were injected intramuscularly, only the abstract was available, articles concerning the paediatric population or animals and studies where agents other than NMBD agents were injected subcutaneously. References of the selected articles were also screened using the above-mentioned exclusion criteria.

The following variables were extracted from the selected articles: age, sex, weight, type of NMBD, injection site, difficult intravenous insertion, intravenous cannula already in situ, dose of NMBD (subcutaneous, intravenous and total dose), onset and duration of neuromuscular block, reversal of the neuromuscular block [time, train-of-four (TOF) count or ratio, agent and dose], type of surgery and duration of postoperative monitoring after extubation. The articles were also screened for risk factors that could influence the absorption and metabolism of NMBDs such as peripheral vascular disease, skin oedema, chronic renal failure, hepatic insufficiency, obesity, use of anticonvulsants, prolonged immobility and burns.

### Rocuronium bromide (rocuronium) [^1165vrk5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Antibiotics

Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as Rocuronium Bromide Injection include certain antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides; vancomycin; tetracyclines; bacitracin; polymyxins; colistin; and sodium colistimethate). If these antibiotics are used in conjunction with Rocuronium Bromide Injection, prolongation of neuromuscular block may occur.

7.2 Anticonvulsants

In 2 of 4 patients who received chronic anticonvulsant therapy, apparent resistance to the effects of another rocuronium bromide injection product was observed in the form of diminished magnitude of neuromuscular block or shortened clinical duration. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs, if Rocuronium Bromide Injection is administered to patients chronically receiving anticonvulsant agents such as carbamazepine or phenytoin, shorter durations of neuromuscular block may occur and infusion rates may be higher due to the development of resistance to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. While the mechanism for development of this resistance is not known, receptor up-regulation may be a contributing factor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### Does alvimopan enhance return of bowel function in laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery? A meta-analysis [^115SrCer]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Prior studies have shown that POI accounts for more than one-third of readmissions and therefore, a lower incidence of POI should theoretically lead to lower rates of 30 day readmission. Interestingly, while the incidence of POI was decreased in our study, the 30-day all-cause readmission rates did not change in frequency in the patients given alvimopan as compared to those who received placebo or no therapy. Our contradictory finding is likely attributed to the fact that the studies included in this meta-analysis did not fully document the primary reason for hospital readmission, which are likely readmissions for postoperative complications other than POI (ie, venous thromboembolism, pneumonia, wound infection etc).

There are several limitations to our meta-analysis. First, the definition of POI is not uniform across the indexed studies and the diagnosis was largely based on clinical parameters. Second, while all studies included the endpoint of length of hospital stay, the data could not be pooled from the studies because of significant statistical heterogeneity. Therefore, the influence of alvimopan on length of stay among patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery remains debated. Future studies will need to define if the introduction of alvimopan is truly cost-savings with regards to marginal reduction in length of stay of 5–38 h. Third, the studies included in this meta-analysis do not address which subset of patients undergoing laparascopic surgery may benefit most from alvimopan therapy (i.e. patients on chronic narcotics therapy and elderly) as it may not be cost-effective to introduce alvimopan in all subset of patients.

In conclusion, alvimopan appears to be effective in reducing POI in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery, with a relative risk reduction of over 75%. Additionally, prior studies have shown that alvimopan is well tolerated and is not associated with any adverse events or serious side effects. Therefore, the standard dose of alvimopan should be considered in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery, particularly in patients at high risk for POI, including male gender, preoperative use of narcotics, older age, elevated body mass index, low preoperative albumin, history of respiratory comorbidity and peripheral vascular disease, and operation lasting ≥ 3 h. Future studies will need to address the cost-effectiveness of empiric introduction of alvimopan among all patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery versus selective administration only to high-risk patients with regards to POI prevention, length of hospitalization, hospital readmission, and quality of life.

### Day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy: treatment of choice for selected patients? [^113NBE6T]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The authors report their 7-year experience with day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) to determine its applicability, safety, and cost effectiveness.

Methods

Of 920 consecutive patients who underwent elective LC over a 7-year period, 567 (62%) were scheduled for day-case surgery. The median age of the patients was 48 years (range, 16–74 years), and the male/female ratio was 148/419. The selection criteria required an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade of 1 or 2, absence of morbid obesity, low risk of common bile duct stones, adult company at home, and residence within 100 km of the hospital. The LC procedure was performed using a standard four-cannula technique. Propofol-opiate-rocuron-sevoflurane anesthesia, prophylactic antiemetics, and preemptive analgesia were administered in all cases.

Results

The mean length of the operation was 56 ± 18 min. There was no hospital mortality, and 7 (1.2%) of 567 patients required conversion to open cholecystectomy. Approximately 356 (63%) of the 567 patients were discharged home on the same day as the operation, whereas 211 patients (37%) were admitted overnight after the operation because of social reasons (13.7%), surgeon preference (15.2%), nausea and/or pain (15.2%), operation late in the afternoon (14.2%), or patient preference (41.7%). There were no serious complications. A total of 22 patients visited the emergency unit, and 7 patients required readmission, giving a readmission rate of 2%. The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 6% (n = 22), with morbidities including retained stones (n = 2), bile leakage (n = 1), and pneumonia (n = 1). The mean procedural cost to the hospital was 1,836 euros for day-case LC, as compared with 2,712 euros for an inpatient operation.

Conclusions

For selected patients, day-case LC is feasible and safe, providing a substantial reduction in hospital costs.

### 2023 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for monitoring and antagonism of neuromuscular blockade: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on neuromuscular blockade [^112fjqJA]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Depth of neuromuscular blockade and neostigmine dosing — when neostigmine is used at minimal blockade (train-of-four ratio greater than or equal to 0.4 and less than 0.9), the dose should not exceed 40 μg/kg. When the train-of-four ratio exceeds 0.6, 15 to 30 μg/kg is usually adequate. Higher doses may have the paradoxical effect of causing weakness with neostigmine when a dose exceeding 30 μg/kg is administered after spontaneous recovery to train-of-four ratio greater than or equal to 0.9, and this can be avoided if quantitative monitoring is used. When quantitative monitoring is not available and spontaneous recovery has progressed to a train-of-four count of 4 without fade, it is advisable to routinely administer a small dose of 15 to 30 μg/kg neostigmine.

### Influence of chronic phenytoin administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vecuronium [^113NiK2K]. Anesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The duration of action of vecuronium is reduced in patients receiving phenytoin. In this study, the authors examined, simultaneously, the influence of phenytoin on both the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of vecuronium.

Methods

This study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of California, San Francisco, and patients gave written informed consent. Twenty-two patients, 11 taking phenytoin and all scheduled to undergo prolonged neurosurgical procedures with general anesthesia, participated in the study. In 12 patients (6 phenytoin, 6 control), vecuronium was infused at 7.5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) until the first response (T1) of each train-of-four decreased by 50%; in the remaining 10 patients (5 phenytoin, 5 control), 200 microg/kg vecuronium was infused over 10 min. Arterial blood samples were drawn at intervals over the next 5–7 h. Plasma concentrations of vecuronium and 3-desacetylvecuronium were measured by capillary gas chromatography. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling was used to characterize the disposition of vecuronium and patient responses to it in the two groups.

Results

Clearance was typically increased by 138% (95% confidence interval, 93–183%) in patients taking phenytoin. The effect of vecuronium was well described using a sigmoid Emax model. The concentration of vecuronium giving 50% twitch depression was increased 124% (45–202%) in patients taking phenytoin.

Conclusions

Chronic phenytoin therapy reduces the effect of vecuronium by mechanisms that include both increased vecuronium metabolism and reduced sensitivity of the patient to circulating concentrations of vecuronium.

### Effects of preemptive analgesia in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111ETy3y]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

This study aimed to investigate the effect of preemptive etoricoxib compared with placebo in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 120 patients requiring elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patients were randomized to receive either etoricoxib 120 mg plus diazepam or placebo plus diazepam. Postoperatively, the visual analog score (VAS) for pain, the rescue morphine requirement, and the side effects were recorded.

Results

Between February 2006 and September 2007, 120 patients were enrolled in the study. The demographic data between two groups were similar except for mean age. The mean age of the placebo group was younger (p = 0.007). There were no significant differences in bleeding tendency rating scores, duration times between fentanyl and rescue morphine, number of rescue morphine doses, or length of postoperative hospital stay. But the number of oral analgesic drug usages was significantly less in the etoricoxib group (p = 0.006). The postoperative VAS was lower in the etoricoxib group at hours 10 (p = 0.023), 14 (p = 0.045), and 26 (p = 0.011), and the average VAS also was significantly less in the etoricoxib group (p = 0.013). The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of postoperative shoulder pain (p = 0.065). According to the verbal rating scale, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.797), nor did the drug side effects or treatment complications.

Conclusion

The authors recommend using etoricoxib as a preemptive analgesia to reduce postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

### Failure of neuromuscular blockade despite high doses of rocuronium and atracurium in a patient with colorectal carcinoma: a case report [^116mAFn6]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Resistance to the effects of rocuronium and other neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) has been previously reported, including delayed onset of relaxation, rapid recovery and incomplete paralysis under recommended doses. These conditions have been associated with denervation injury, burns, immobilisation, infections, metabolic disorders, and drug interactions.

In this report, we describe the case of a young male without any known pre-disposing factor for NMBA resistance, who failed to attain muscle relaxation with non-depolarising NMBA despite high doses of rocuronium and atracurium during two surgeries for colorectal cancer, several months apart. Investigations for drug failure and genetic testing did not indicate a plausible cause. After chemotherapy and tumour resection, the patient underwent a third surgical procedure under general anaesthesia with normalised NMBA response.

Patient's written consent was obtained for publication.

### Pre-operative antibiotics in patients with acute mild cholecystitis undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy: is it really useful? A systematic review [^1141XC9Z]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

A similar situation occurred with mild diverticulitis, where antibiotic treatment was once standard. However, studies comparing antibiotic therapy with conservative management have reported no differences in outcomes. As a result, mild diverticulitis came to be understood as inflammation rather than infection, challenging previous paradigms.

Moreover, it is important to assess the role of bactibilia in acute cholecystitis and its risk factors to better predict which patients would benefit from antibiotic therapy.

The main limitation of this study is the limited existing literature on preoperative antibiotic use. Another limitation was the inherent constraints of the individual studies included.

Given the current evidence, no definitive recommendations can be made regarding the therapeutic use of antibiotics for mild acute cholecystitis. A high-quality clinical trial is needed to compare antibiotic administration with placebo during hospitalization in patients undergoing early laparoscopic cholecystectomy prior to the surgical procedure (preoperatively).

### Intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation versus no intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^114fbujX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally considered less painful than open surgery, pain is one of the important reasons for delayed discharge after day surgery and overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The safety and effectiveness of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of intraperitoneal instillation of local anaesthetic agents in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to March 2013 to identify randomised clinical trials of relevance to this review.

Selection Criteria

We considered only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation versus placebo, no intervention, or inactive control during laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the review with regards to benefits while we considered quasi-randomised studies and non-randomised studies for treatment-related harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors collected the data independently. We analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis. For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 58 trials, of which 48 trials with 2849 participants randomised to intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation (1558 participants) versus control (1291 participants) contributed data to one or more of the outcomes. All the trials except one trial with 30 participants were at high risk of bias. Most trials included only low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Various intraperitoneal local anaesthetic agents were used but bupivacaine in the liquid form was the most common local anaesthetic used. There were considerable differences in the methods of local anaesthetic instillation including the location (subdiaphragmatic, gallbladder bed, or both locations) and timing (before or after the removal of gallbladder) between the trials. There was no mortality in either group in the eight trials that reported mortality (0/236 (0%) in local anaesthetic instillation versus 0/210 (0%) in control group; very low quality evidence). One participant experienced the outcome of serious morbidity (eight trials; 446 participants; 1/236 (0.4%) in local anaesthetic instillation group versus 0/210 (0%) in the control group; RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.13 to 67.06; very low quality evidence). Although the remaining trials did not report the overall morbidity, three trials (190 participants) reported that there were no intra-operative complications. Twenty trials reported that there were no serious adverse events in any of the 715 participants who received local anaesthetic instillation. None of the trials reported participant quality of life, return to normal activity, or return to work. The effect of local anaesthetic instillation on the proportion of participants discharged as day surgery between the two groups was imprecise and compatible with benefit and no difference of intervention (three trials; 242 participants; 89/160 (adjusted proportion 61.0%) in local anaesthetic instillation group versus 40/82 (48.8%) in control group; RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.58; very low quality evidence). The MD in length of hospital stay was 0.04 days (95% CI -0.23 to 0.32; five trials; 335 participants; low quality evidence). The pain scores as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) were significantly lower in the local anaesthetic instillation group than the control group at four to eight hours (32 trials; 2020 participants; MD -0.99 cm; 95% CI -1.10 to -0.88 on a VAS scale of 0 to 10 cm; very low quality evidence) and at nine to 24 hours (29 trials; 1787 participants; MD -0.53 cm; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.44; very low quality evidence). Various subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to investigate the influence of the different local anaesthetic agents, different methods of local anaesthetic instillation, and different controls on the effectiveness of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation were inconsistent.

Authors' Conclusions

Serious adverse events were rare in studies evaluating local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation (very low quality evidence). There is very low quality evidence that it reduces pain in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the clinical importance of this reduction in pain is unknown and likely to be small. Further randomised clinical trials of low risk of systematic and random errors are necessary. Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life and time to return to work in their assessment.

### 2023 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for monitoring and antagonism of neuromuscular blockade: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on neuromuscular blockade [^116upXSR]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Monitoring site selection — patient safety comment states that complete recovery of all muscles from neuromuscular blockade optimizes patient safety and that measurements should be obtained at sites with longer times to recovery; when monitoring a relatively resistant site such as the eye muscles, there is a potential for neuromuscular blocking drug overdose and for concluding that a patient is adequately antagonized when, in fact, they are not.
