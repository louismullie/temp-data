## Question

In the VERITAS trial for COPD, did remizumab achieve its primary endpoints?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether remizumab achieved its primary endpoint(s) in the VERITAS COPD trial, and I need to determine that outcome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the identity of the trial (VERITAS) and the molecule (remizumab). Then, I should check whether either appears in the provided evidence set. Next, I will consider if VERITAS might be an alternate or sponsor code name for any of the well-known COPD biologic trials. Finally, I should review what the typical primary endpoints are in COPD biologic studies to frame what "achieved its primary endpoint" would mean if the correct trial can be identified, before concluding what can and cannot be stated from the supplied references [^116jkovT] [^111feTfS] [^1144zduu].

> Let me first confirm the trial and drug identity against the provided materials, because I need to ensure I am not missing an obvious match; after reviewing the set, I find reports on dupilumab (NOTUS), mepolizumab (MATINEE, METREX/METREO), benralizumab (GALATHEA/TERRANOVA), and tezepelumab (COURSE), but I see no mention of a VERITAS trial or a drug named remizumab anywhere in the references, which strongly suggests the requested pairing is not present in the supplied corpus [^117W35dM] [^114MTo4h] [^117AgWs4] [^111o4JaG] [^117JhAXq] [^112FZTq7].

> Wait, let me verify a potential name confusion: at first glance, "remizumab" might be a typographical error for "reslizumab", but hold on, I should confirm the indication history; reslizumab is an anti–IL-5 antibody studied and approved for eosinophilic asthma and is not represented here as a COPD trial, so that initial assumption would be incorrect for a COPD VERITAS query [^112W7viW] [^112YaBtt] [^112FZTq7].

> I will now examine whether VERITAS could be an alternate label for any of the COPD biologic programs described here, but none of the large COPD trials in the set carry the VERITAS name — NOTUS (dupilumab), MATINEE and METREX/METREO (mepolizumab), GALATHEA/TERRANOVA (benralizumab), and COURSE (tezepelumab) are all distinct and do not map to VERITAS, so I should double-check but see no plausible alias or renaming that would reconcile this discrepancy [^117W35dM] [^114MTo4h] [^117AgWs4] [^111o4JaG] [^117JhAXq].

> Let me consider the primary endpoint context to ensure we are aligned on what success would look like if the correct study were identified; COPD biologic trials typically use the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations as the primary endpoint, with common secondary endpoints including time to first exacerbation, FEV1, and health status, and exemplar results in the provided set show dupilumab significantly reduced exacerbations (NOTUS), mepolizumab reduced exacerbations in eosinophilic COPD in some programs, while benralizumab did not meet primary exacerbation endpoints in GALATHEA/TERRANOVA, all consistent with heterogeneity of treatment effects and endpoint behavior in COPD exacerbation trials [^116jkovT] [^117W35dM] [^114MTo4h] [^111o4JaG] [^112gRi75].

> Putting this together, I should confirm that, based solely on the supplied references, there is no information on a COPD trial named VERITAS or on a biologic called remizumab, so I cannot determine whether remizumab achieved its primary endpoint(s) in VERITAS from this evidence set; if you can provide an alternative or corrected trial name, the sponsor, or a ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, I can re-evaluate and benchmark outcomes against the COPD biologic trial standards illustrated by NOTUS, MATINEE, METREX/METREO, GALATHEA/TERRANOVA, and COURSE [^117W35dM] [^114MTo4h] [^117AgWs4] [^111o4JaG] [^117JhAXq] [^117NeJSM].

I can't find a **COPD trial** of "remizumab" or a study named "VERITAS". Could you confirm:

- The **exact drug name** (e.g. reslizumab [^112W7viW], benralizumab [^111o4JaG], or another agent)?
- The **study name** or a **registry ID** (e.g. NCT number)?
- The **primary endpoint** you're asking about?

If you meant one of the following:

- **Reslizumab**: available data are in asthma, not COPD [^112W7viW].
- **Benralizumab**: GALATHEA/TERRANOVA [^111o4JaG] did not meet the primary endpoint in COPD.
- **Dupilumab**: NOTUS [^117W35dM] met its primary endpoint in COPD with type 2 inflammation [^111feTfS].
- **Mepolizumab**: MATINEE [^114MTo4h] met its primary endpoint in eosinophilic COPD [^116ivpim].

Once you confirm the drug and study, I'll **provide a precise answer**.

### Dupilumab for COPD with blood eosinophil evidence of type 2 inflammation [^117W35dM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The NOTUS study, published by Surya P. Bhatt and colleagues in 2024 in the New England Journal of Medicine, focuses on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study investigated the role of dupilumab in patients with COPD accompanied by type 2 inflammation. It employed a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, including 935 patients, among whom 303 were female and 632 were male.

Inclusion criteria required patients to have COPD and a blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/mL. Key exclusion criteria included a diagnosis or history of asthma, COPD diagnosis for less than 12 months prior to randomization, significant pulmonary disease other than COPD, and cor pulmonale.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Dupilumab**: n = 470 received a subcutaneous dose of 300 mg every two weeks.
	- **Placebo**: n = 465 received a matching placebo every two weeks.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- A significant decrease was observed in the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (0.86 events/year versus 1.3 events/year; relative risk [RR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 0.82).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- A significant increase in least-square mean improvement in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at week 12 (0.139 L vs. 0.057 L; mean difference [MD] 0.082, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12).
	- A significant increase in least-square mean improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at week 52 (0.115 L vs. 0.054 L; MD 0.062, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11).
	- A significant increase in least-square mean reduction in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score at week 52 (9.8 points vs. 6.4 points; MD 3.4, 95% CI 0.

### Reslizumab for inadequately controlled asthma with elevated blood eosinophil counts: results from two multicentre, parallel, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials [^112W7viW]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Elevated numbers of blood eosinophils are a risk factor for asthma exacerbations. Reslizumab is a humanised anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody that disrupts eosinophil maturation and promotes programmed cell death. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of reslizumab in patients with inadequately controlled, moderate-to-severe asthma.

- **Methods**: We conducted two duplicate, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials. Both trials enrolled patients with asthma aged 12–75 years from 128 clinical research centres in study 1 and 104 centres in study 2, spanning Asia, Australia, North America, South America, South Africa, and Europe. These patients had inadequately controlled asthma despite medium-to-high doses of inhaled corticosteroids and had blood eosinophils of 400 cells per μL or higher, along with one or more exacerbations in the previous year. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either intravenous reslizumab (3.0 mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 1 year via computerised central randomisation.

Both patients and investigators were blinded to treatment assignments. Each patient received a specific volume of the study drug (reslizumab or matching placebo) based on body weight and random treatment group assignment. Additionally, the sponsor's clinical personnel involved in the study were unaware of the study drug identity until the database was locked for analysis and treatment assignments revealed. The primary outcome was the annual frequency of clinical asthma exacerbations and was measured over the duration of the study.

### Predicting response to benralizumab in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Analyses of GALATHEA and TERRANOVA studies [^111o4JaG]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Benralizumab did not significantly reduce exacerbations compared with placebo in the phase 3 GALATHEA and TERRANOVA trials for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to identify clinical and physiological characteristics of patients with COPD that could help to identify people who are likely to have the greatest treatment effect with benralizumab.

- **Methods**: We analysed individual study and pooled results from GALATHEA and TERRANOVA. At study enrollment, patients from GALATHEA and TERRANOVA were aged 40–85 years, had moderate to very severe airflow limitation, elevated blood eosinophil counts, and at least two exacerbations or one severe exacerbation in the previous year despite dual inhaled therapy (inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting β2-agonists or long-acting β2-agonists plus long-acting muscarinic antagonists) or triple inhaled therapy (inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting β2-agonists plus long-acting muscarinic antagonists). We analysed data for 3,910 patients who received benralizumab (30 mg or 100 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks; first three doses every 4 weeks) or placebo with dual or triple therapy to identify factors consistently associated with annual exacerbation rate reduction. We evaluated the annual exacerbation rate for benralizumab versus placebo as the primary endpoint. GALATHEA and TERRANOVA are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02138916 and NCT02155660, respectively.

### Mepolizumab to prevent exacerbations of COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype [^114MTo4h]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The MATINEE study, published in 2025 in The New England Journal of Medicine, investigated the effect of mepolizumab in preventing exacerbations among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and an eosinophilic phenotype. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included a population of 804 patients, with 253 female and 551 male participants. Inclusion criteria required patients to have COPD, a history of exacerbations, and a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 300 cells/mL while receiving triple inhaled therapy.

Key exclusion criteria involved a history of asthma, recent pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, or lower respiratory tract infection (within the past 4 weeks), lung volume reduction surgery in the last 12 months, parasitic infestation within 6 months, cirrhosis or unstable liver disease, immunodeficiency, and alcohol or drug abuse within the past 2 years.

- **Intervention groups**:
	- **Mepolizumab**: 403 patients received 100 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52–104 weeks.
	- **Placebo**: 401 patients received a matching placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52–104 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- A significant decrease was observed in the incidence of the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations, with rates of 0.8 events/year for the mepolizumab group versus 1.01 events/year for the placebo group (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- There was a significant increase in time to the first moderate or severe exacerbation, with 419 days for the mepolizumab group compared to 321 days in the placebo group (HR 1.3, 95% CI 1.08).

### First study of infliximab treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114CsJ3g]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is believed to be important in the induction and maintenance of airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We aimed to evaluate the effect of the anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha drug infliximab in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with the percentage of sputum neutrophils as the primary endpoint.

We performed an exploratory single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 2 trial in which 22 smokers with mild-to-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease participated. Fourteen patients received three infusions of infliximab (5 mg/kg) at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, and eight patients received placebo infusions. Sputum samples, respiratory symptoms, quality of life, exhaled nitric oxide, lung function parameters, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, resting energy expenditure, and side effects were evaluated.

This study did not show a positive short-term effect of infliximab on airway inflammation, lung function, resting energy expenditure, or quality of life. Exhaled nitric oxide increased significantly at Day 2, Week 6, and Week 8 in patients receiving infliximab compared with those receiving placebo. Eight patients in the infliximab group (vs. none in the placebo group) reported increased coughing, but no serious adverse events or increase in respiratory infections were reported during 9 weeks of follow-up.

In this short-term study, no clinically beneficial effects of infliximab were observed, and there were no significant findings to support its efficacy in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### COPDCompex: A novel composite endpoint for COPD exacerbations to enable faster clinical development [^1144zduu]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The frequency of moderate and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations is an important endpoint in clinical trials. However, this often results in large and lengthy trials when powered to evaluate it. We aimed to develop a composite endpoint, COPDCompEx, that could predict treatment effect on exacerbations, enabling the design of shorter early-phase clinical trials that require fewer patients.

- **Methods**: In this post hoc analysis, data from 20 randomized controlled trials were used to develop and test COPDCompEx. Diary events were tested against predefined threshold values for peak expiratory flow, reliever medication use, and symptoms. A COPDCompEx event was defined as the first occurrence of a diary event, a moderate or severe exacerbation, or a study dropout. Ratios of event frequency, treatment effect, and future trial sample size were compared between COPDCompEx and moderate and severe exacerbations.

- **Findings**: At 3 months, the proportion of patients experiencing COPDCompEx events increased over 3-fold compared to exacerbations alone. All components contributed to the COPDCompEx event rate. Treatment effects at 3 months were closely matched between COPDCompEx and exacerbations, and the large net gain in power substantially reduced the required sample size.

- **Interpretation**: COPDCompEx may be used to predict treatment effect on moderate and severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This may enable the design of shorter Phase 2 clinical trials requiring fewer patients compared to exacerbation studies, with exacerbations as a key Phase 3 endpoint.

### Camzyos [^113UKHx7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Camzyos was shown to be superior to placebo in reducing the proportion of patients who met the primary endpoint, defined as the composite of patient decision to proceed with SRT before or at Week 16, or meeting SRT eligibility (LVOT gradient of ≥ 50 mmHg and NYHA class III-IV, or class II with exertional syncope or near syncope) at Week 16 (18% vs. 77%, respectively, p < 0.0001; see Table 5).

- **Secondary endpoints**: The treatment effects of Camzyos on LVOT obstruction, functional capacity, and health status were assessed by change from baseline through Week 16 in post-exercise LVOT gradient, proportion of patients with improvement in NYHA class, and KCCQ-23 CSS. Figure 11 shows the time course for changes in KCCQ-23 CSS. Figure 12 shows the distribution of changes from baseline to Week 16 for KCCQ-23 CSS. The figure displays the cumulative percentage of patients achieving a certain level of response.

### Lebrikizumab in moderate-to-severe asthma: pooled data from two randomised placebo-controlled studies [^114wX1o6]. Thorax (2015). High credibility.

In a subset of patients with asthma, standard-of-care treatment does not achieve disease control, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Lebrikizumab is a humanised, monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks interleukin-13 activity.

- **Methods**: LUTE and VERSE were replicate, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, evaluating multiple doses of lebrikizumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma despite the use of medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a second controller. Patients received lebrikizumab 37.5, 125, or 250 mg, or placebo subcutaneously every four weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of asthma exacerbations during the placebo-controlled period. Analyses were performed on prespecified subgroups based on baseline serum periostin levels. Following the discovery of a host-cell impurity in the study drug material, protocols were amended to convert from phase III to phase IIb. Subsequently, dosing of study medication was discontinued early as a precautionary measure. The data collected for analysis were from a placebo-controlled period of variable duration and pooled across both studies.

- **Results**: The median duration of treatment was approximately 24 weeks. Treatment with lebrikizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations, which was more pronounced in periostin-high patients (all doses: 60% reduction) than in periostin-low patients (all doses: 5% reduction); no dose–response was evident. Lung function also improved following lebrikizumab treatment, with the greatest increase in FEV₁ in periostin-high patients.

### Efficacy of revefenacin, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist for nebulized therapy, in patients with markers of more severe COPD: a post hoc subgroup analysis [^112mDGMX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Revefenacin, a once-daily, long-acting muscarinic antagonist delivered via a standard jet nebulizer, increased trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in prior phase 3 trials. We evaluated the efficacy of revefenacin in patients with markers of more severe COPD.

- **Methods**: A post hoc subgroup analysis of two replicate, randomized, phase 3 trials was conducted over 12 weeks. Endpoints included least squares change from baseline in trough FEV1, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) responders, and transition dyspnea index (TDI) responders at Day 85. This analysis included patient subgroups at high risk for COPD exacerbations and compared patients who received revefenacin 175 μg and placebo: severe and very severe airflow limitation (percent predicted FEV1 30%–65 and > 75 years) and comorbidity risk factors.

- **Results**: Revefenacin demonstrated significant improvements in FEV1 versus placebo at Day 85 among the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and all subgroups. Additionally, there was a greater number of SGRQ and TDI responders in the ITT population and the majority of subgroups analyzed among patients who received revefenacin versus placebo. For the SGRQ responders, the odds of response (odds ratio > 2.0) were notable.

### Guidance for the better care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111BhPHN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The expert group considered six questions regarding the effectiveness of drug treatment in COPD and assigned priority to a range of outcomes that varied between interventions. Notably, the risk of pneumonia was prioritized above efficacy outcomes for questions related to corticosteroids but was not discussed in connection with long-acting bronchodilator therapy or opiate use to manage breathlessness. This suggests that prior knowledge in the field influences the weighting given to particular outcomes.

Clinical practice guidance needs to address a broader audience beyond practicing clinicians, including both patients and payers. The authors clearly elucidate the interests of these different stakeholders, using carefully nuanced language to support their conclusions and the implications for these interest groups. It is uncertain whether people reading the summary will grasp these subtleties, presenting a fertile area for further research.

Understanding why guideline writers reached their conclusions is always interesting. This is detailed in the section on committee discussion, which, along with a series of research needs, accompanies each question.

### Efficacy and safety of tezepelumab versus placebo in adults with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COURSE): A randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2a trial [^117JhAXq]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which has shown increased expression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with healthy individuals. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in patients with moderate to very severe COPD despite receiving triple inhaled therapy.

- **Methods**: COURSE was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2a trial conducted across 90 sites in ten countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. Eligible participants were aged 40–80 years, had moderate to very severe airflow limitation, were receiving triple inhaled maintenance therapy, and had at least two moderate to severe COPD exacerbations in the 12 months before enrolment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive tezepelumab 420 mg or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for up to 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by geographical region and by number of exacerbations in the 12 months before enrolment. Participants, investigators, site staff, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the annualised rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks. A prespecified subgroup analysis assessed the primary endpoint in patients grouped by baseline blood eosinophil counts (BECs). Efficacy and safety were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04039113 (completed).

- **Findings**: Between July 30, 2019, and Oct 4, 2022, 333 patients (mean age 67.2 years) were enrolled…

### Effect of 1-year treatment with roflumilast in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117LKp2a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The oral phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, roflumilast, can improve lung function in moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Whether treatment is effective in more severe COPD (GOLD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease] stages III and IV) over a longer period is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether roflumilast improves lung function and decreases exacerbation frequency over 1 year in patients with stable COPD.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial for 1 year. We recruited 1,513 patients (mean post-bronchodilator FEV1 41% predicted), with 760 receiving oral 500 microg roflumilast and 753 receiving placebo once daily.

- **Measurements and main results**: We recorded post-bronchodilator FEV1, exacerbation rate, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score at the study end point, and number and type of reported adverse events during treatment. Post-bronchodilator FEV1 increased by 39 mL with roflumilast compared with placebo by 52 weeks (p = 0.001). The mean exacerbation rate was low and comparable in both treatment groups (0.86 vs. 0.92 exacerbations/patient/year for roflumilast and placebo, respectively). In a retrospective analysis, the exacerbation rate in patients in GOLD stage IV disease was 36% lower in patients treated with roflumilast than in those treated with placebo (1.01 vs. 1.59 exacerbations/patient/year, respectively; p = 0.024). The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score did not differ between treatments. The most common adverse events related to roflumilast were not completed in the provided text.

### Lebrikizumab in moderate-to-severe asthma: pooled data from two randomised placebo-controlled studies [^115vbZPp]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

A host cell protein impurity (PLBL2) was identified after the initiation of the studies. This discovery necessitated changes in the manufacturing process of the drug product. As a consequence, the studies were reclassified from phase III to phase IIb. Upon this conversion, it was decided to enroll 225 patients from approximately 70 sites in the United States for each study, totaling 450 patients. The planned placebo-controlled period spanned 28–52 weeks, with a variable number of doses administered depending on the timing of patient enrollment. Following the treatment period, patients were monitored for safety for 24 weeks (greater than five half-lives of the drug) after the last dose, including those who discontinued treatment early. The protocols specified that data from the two studies would be pooled for analysis, and an internal administrative review of the unblinded data would inform the design of subsequent phase III clinical studies.

Coinciding with the administrative data readout, results from an immunoassay designed to measure immune response to the host cell protein impurity demonstrated that nearly all lebrikizumab-treated patients exhibited an immune response. Consequently, a decision was made to discontinue dosing early as a precautionary measure to avoid further exposure to the impurity-containing study drug material. All patients were asked to complete the safety follow-up period.

### Spiriva Respimat [^111C2roJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Spiriva Respimat compared to placebo was evaluated in six clinical trials: one dose-ranging trial and five confirmatory trials (Trials 1–5). Additionally, Spiriva Respimat was compared to Spiriva HandiHaler in a long-term active-controlled trial in COPD (Trial 6).

- **Dose-ranging trial**: Dose selection for the Phase III clinical program was supported by a 3-week randomized, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled, parallel group trial in 202 COPD patients. A total of five doses of tiotropium Respimat (1.25 to 20 mcg) were evaluated compared to placebo. Results demonstrated numerical improvements in FEV1 at all doses compared to placebo. The difference in trough FEV1 from placebo for the 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mcg once daily doses were 0.08 L (95% CI -0.03, 0.20), 0.03 L (-0.08, 0.15), 0.13 L (0.02, 0.25), 0.11 L (-0.004, 0.224), and 0.13 L (0.01, 0.24), respectively. Based on these results, the 5 and 10 mcg doses were further evaluated in the confirmatory COPD trials.

### Icenticaftor, a novel treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, needs further verification of its effectiveness [^111GssU2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with great interest the Phase IIB study by Martinez and colleagues that assessed icenticaftor, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator, as a potential treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly targeting the chronic bronchitic (CB) phenotype. This trial, which is the largest and longest prospective randomized controlled study at the time of writing, included six treatment arms: a placebo group and groups that received twice-daily oral icenticaftor doses of 450, 300, 150, 75, and 25 mg. The results revealed that the 300-mg twice-daily dose was the optimal regimen, as it demonstrated improvements in trough FEV1, cough, sputum, rescue medication use, and fibrinogen levels (lowered) at week 24.

### Can inhaled fluticasone alone or in combination with salmeterol reduce systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [NCT00120978] [^116FZFyG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Systemic inflammation is associated with various complications in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including weight loss, cachexia, osteoporosis, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Inhaled corticosteroids attenuate airway inflammation, reduce exacerbations, and improve mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Whether inhaled corticosteroids by themselves or in combination with a long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist repress systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is unknown. The Advair Biomarkers in COPD (ABC) study will determine whether the effects of inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with a long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist reduce systemic inflammation and improve health status in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

- **Methods/Design**: After a 4-week run-in phase during which patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will receive inhaled fluticasone (500 micrograms twice daily), followed by a 4-week withdrawal phase during which all inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists will be discontinued, patients will be randomized to receive fluticasone (500 micrograms twice daily), a fluticasone/salmeterol combination (500/50 micrograms twice daily), or placebo for four weeks. The study will recruit 250 patients across 11 centers in western Canada. Patients must be 40 years of age or older with at least a 10 pack-year smoking history and have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease defined as a forced expiratory volume in one second to vital capacity ratio of…

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by progressive airflow limitation associated with chronic inflammation. There are few treatment options for the disease. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, in patients with moderate to severe COPD.

- **Methods**: This phase III, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study was undertaken in an outpatient setting. A total of 1411 patients with COPD were randomly assigned roflumilast 250 microg (n = 576), roflumilast 500 microg (n = 555), or placebo (n = 280) given orally once daily for 24 weeks. Primary outcomes were postbronchodilator FEV1 and health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes included other lung function parameters and COPD exacerbations. Analyses were by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: 1157 (82%) patients completed the study; 32 (11%) withdrew from the placebo group, 100 (17%) from the roflumilast 250 microg group, and 124 (22%) from the roflumilast 500 microg group. Postbronchodilator FEV1 at the end of treatment significantly improved with roflumilast 250 microg (by 74 mL [SD 18]) and roflumilast 500 microg (by 97 mL [18]) compared with placebo (p < 0.0001). Improvement in health-related quality of life was greater with roflumilast 250 microg (-3.4 units [0.6]) and roflumilast 500 microg (-3.5 units [0.6]) than with placebo (-1.8 units [0.8]), although the differences between treatment groups were not significant. The mean numbers of exacerbations per patient were 1.13 (2.37), 1.03 (2.33), and 0.75 (1.89) with placebo, roflumilast.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1137qfa3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2019 report defines COPD as a "common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway or alveolar abnormalities, usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases". Pharmacologic treatment for COPD aims to improve quality of life (QOL) and control symptoms while reducing the frequency of exacerbations.

The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to address specific clinically important questions regarding the pharmacologic management of COPD. The expert panel, in collaboration with a team of methodologists, prioritized and developed six questions that addressed significant COPD management issues. These questions were rephrased by the methods team using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes (PICO) format. Panel members then compiled and prioritized a list of outcomes that were important for clinical decision-making and particularly important to patients. Evidence syntheses for each PICO question were focused on clinical outcomes deemed "critical" for clinical decision-making. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for the following clinical questions:

1. In patients with COPD who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance, is LABA/LAMA combination therapy more effective and as safe as LABA or LAMA monotherapy?

2. In patients with COPD who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite…

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112gGHR2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations:

- **Patients with COPD experiencing dyspnea or exercise intolerance**: We recommend long-acting β2-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

- **Patients with COPD with continued dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite dual therapy (LABA/LAMA)**: We suggest triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics, oral steroids, or hospitalization (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

- **Patients with COPD receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA)**: We suggest that the ICS can be withdrawn if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

- **ICS as additive therapy in COPD patients with blood eosinophilia**: We do not make a recommendation for, or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators, except for those with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics, oral steroids, or hospitalization. In these cases, we suggest ICS as an additive therapy (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

- **Patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations despite optimal therapy**: We advise against the use of maintenance oral corticosteroid therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).

### Pamrevlumab for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: The ZEPHYRUS-1 randomized clinical trial [^111bDVoC]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis slow the rate of lung function decline but may be associated with adverse events that affect medication adherence. In phase 2 trials, pamrevlumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits connective tissue growth factor activity, attenuated the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis without substantial adverse events.

The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of pamrevlumab for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Design, setting, and participants involved a phase 3 randomized clinical trial including 356 patients aged 40 to 85 years with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who were not receiving antifibrotic treatment with nintedanib or pirfenidone at enrollment. Patients were recruited from 117 sites in 9 countries between July 18, 2019, and July 29, 2022; the last follow-up encounter occurred on August 28, 2023.

Pamrevlumab (30 mg/kg administered intravenously every 3 weeks; n = 181) or placebo (n = 175) was administered for 48 weeks.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the absolute change in forced vital capacity (FVC) from baseline to week 48. There were 5 secondary outcomes, including time to disease progression, defined as a decline of ≥ 10% in predicted FVC or death. The exploratory outcomes included patient-reported symptoms. Adverse events were reported.

Among 356 patients (mean age, 70.5 years; 258 [72.5%] were men; 221 [62.1%] were White), 277 (77.8%) completed the trial. There was no significant between-group difference for the absolute change in FVC.

### Diagnosis and management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A clinical practice guideline update from the American College of Physicians, American College of Chest Physicians, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society [^113Lggh8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The 2011 guidelines from the American College of Physicians recommend offering inhaled bronchodilators to patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who exhibit respiratory symptoms and have an FEV1 of less than 60% of the predicted value.

### Revefenacin, a once-daily, lung-selective, long-acting muscarinic antagonist for nebulized therapy: Safety and tolerability results of a 52-week phase 3 trial in moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115jtcna]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Prior replicate 12-week phase 3 trials demonstrated that once-daily doses of revefenacin inhalation solution at 88 μg and 175 μg produced significant bronchodilation over 24 h post dose in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective was to characterize the safety profile of revefenacin 88 μg and 175 μg over 52 weeks of treatment.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, parallel-group, 52-week trial (NCT02518139), 1,055 participants with moderate to very severe COPD received revefenacin 88 μg or 175 μg in a double-blind manner, or open-label active control tiotropium.

- **Results**: Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were comparable across all treatment groups (n patients; revefenacin 88 μg, 272 [74.7%]; 175 μg, 242 [72.2%]; tiotropium, 275 [77.2%]). Numerically fewer COPD exacerbations (n patients) were observed with revefenacin 175 μg (73 [21.8%]) than with 88 μg (107 [29.4%]) or tiotropium (100 [28.1%]). Serious AEs were comparable with revefenacin 88 μg (58 [15.9%]) and tiotropium (58 [16.3%]), but were lower with revefenacin 175 μg (43 [12.8%]), and mortality was low. In patients using revefenacin 88 μg or tiotropium with a concomitant long-acting β-agonist (LABA) product, the incidence of AEs was slightly higher than without concomitant LABA. LABA did not affect the incidence of AEs for patients who received revefenacin 175 μg.

- **Conclusions**: Revefenacin was generally well tolerated over 52 weeks of treatment, and had a safety profile that supports its use as a long-term once-daily bronchodilator for nebulized therapy.

### Anti-inflammatory effects of roflumilast in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ROBERT): a 16-week, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^113qvVLv]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The clinical effects of roflumilast, a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, are well established, but little is known about the anti-inflammatory mechanisms underlying the drug's efficacy. The aim of the Roflumilast Biopsy European Research Trial (ROBERT) was to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of roflumilast on bronchial mucosal inflammation in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic bronchitis.

- **Methods**: ROBERT was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 18 sites in five countries. Eligible patients were aged 40–80 years, had COPD, and had experienced a chronic productive cough for 3 months in each of the two previous years. Additionally, patients were required to have a post-bronchodilator predicted FEV1 between 30–80% and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio of 70% or less. Patients entered a 6-week run-in period before being randomly assigned (1:1) via a computerised central randomisation system to receive either 500 μg of roflumilast once daily or a placebo for 16 weeks, in addition to bronchodilator therapy (with inhaled corticosteroids not permitted). Randomisation was stratified by concomitant use of long-acting β agonist. Both participants and investigators were blinded to group assignment. Roflumilast and placebo were supplied as identical yellow, triangular tablets. Airway inflammation was assessed by quantifying inflammatory cells in bronchial biopsy samples and induced sputum samples. The primary endpoint was the change in the number of CD8 inflammatory cells in the bronchial biopsy submucosa from randomisation.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: An analysis from the platelet inhibition and patient outcomes (PLATO) trial [^116VBLbk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Ticagrelor significantly reduced the primary composite endpoint of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in patients, both with or without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Figures 1 and 2). The relative reduction in the rate of the primary endpoint with ticagrelor was similar between COPD and non-COPD patients and consistent with the main trial findings. However, the absolute reduction was greater in patients with COPD (5.8% versus 1.5%). No COPD status-by-treatment interactions were found in the efficacy endpoint analyses. Consistent with the main trial, ticagrelor was associated with a reduction in deaths from any cause in patients with or without COPD (interaction P = 0.557).

Cumulative Kaplan–Meier estimates of the time to the first adjudicated occurrence of the primary efficacy endpoint (a composite of death from vascular causes, MI, or stroke) showed that COPD patients randomized to ticagrelor or clopidogrel are represented by solid blue and red lines, respectively. Non-COPD patients randomized to ticagrelor or clopidogrel are represented by dashed blue and red lines, respectively. K-M indicates Kaplan–Meier.

For both COPD and non-COPD patients, there was no significant difference in the rates of overall major bleeding, regardless of using PLATO (Figure 3) or thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) study group criteria, between ticagrelor- and clopidogrel-treated patients (Figure 1). In alignment with the main trial, ticagrelor was associated with increased PLATO-defined non-coronary artery bypass graft (non-CABG)-related major bleeding in non-COPD patients. However, in COPD patients, these rates were not increased.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113EpGs7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

- **Mortality**: Two studies (n = 241) assessed mortality risk. The studies revealed no significant difference in mortality with the use of oral steroids versus no oral steroid (RR 1.01; 95% CI, 0.28–3.70; P = 0.98). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 0 fewer per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 26 fewer to 98 more).

- **Exacerbations**: Two studies (n = 108) assessed exacerbation risk. The studies revealed no significant difference in exacerbations with the use of maintenance oral steroids versus no oral steroid (RR 1.38; 95% CI, 0.90–2.10; P = 0.14). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 190 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 50 fewer to 550 more).

- **Dyspnea (daily symptom score, visual analog scale)**: Two studies (n = 142) assessed dyspnea. The studies revealed no statistically significant difference in dyspnea with the use of maintenance oral steroids versus no oral steroid (SMD = −0.22; 95% CI, −0.56 to 0.12; P = 0.21). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 0.22 SDs lower; 95% CI, 0.56 lower to 0.12 higher).

- **Hospital admissions**: One study (n = 191) assessed the risk of hospital admission. The study revealed no significant difference in admissions with the use of oral steroids versus no oral steroids (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.25–1.61; P = 0.34). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 42 fewer per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 88 fewer to 71 more).

### Long-term safety study of infliximab in moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114NXvhG]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The rationale for this study stemmed from an observed increase in malignancies among infliximab-treated patients (5.7%) compared to those receiving a placebo (1.3%) in a 44-week, phase 2 clinical study involving 234 individuals with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

- **Objectives**: To collect malignancy and mortality data from completed clinical studies of infliximab in COPD treatment.

- **Methods**: The multicenter, observational Remicade Safety Under Long-Term Study in COPD (RESULTS COPD) collected malignancy and mortality data every six months for five years from patients who received ≥ 1 study-agent dose in a phase 2 study. Co-primary endpoints were the number of patients with malignancy and the number of deaths. Secondary endpoints included the number of patients with a malignancy according to malignancy type.

- **Results**: There was a gap period between the end of the phase 2 study and the initiation of RESULTS COPD, during which six malignancies and 14 deaths were reported spontaneously for the 107 (45.7%) of 234 patients with long-term safety information. Twenty-eight patients (overall 12.0%; placebo 10.4%, infliximab 12.7%) reported malignancies, including 12 patients during RESULTS COPD. Twenty-six patients (overall 11.1%; placebo 9.1%, infliximab 12.1%) died, including nine during RESULTS COPD. Lung cancer was the most common malignancy type (placebo n = 2; infliximab n = 10).

- **Conclusions**: The greater proportion of malignancies observed with infliximab versus placebo in a phase 2 study diminished over the long-term follow-up. Due to the observational nature and limited patient participation, the findings should be interpreted with caution.

Evaluations of dosing intervals compared once-daily and twice-daily dosing, supporting the selection of a once-daily dosing interval for further evaluation in the confirmatory COPD trials.

- **Vilanterol**: Dose selection for vilanterol in COPD was supported by a 28-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. This trial evaluated five doses of vilanterol (ranging from 3 to 50 mcg) or a placebo administered in the morning to 602 subjects with COPD. Results demonstrated dose-related increases from baseline in FEV1 on Day 1 and Day 28.

The differences in trough FEV1 after Day 28 from baseline for placebo and the 3, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 mcg doses were 29 mL (95% CI: -8, 66), 120 mL (95% CI: 83, 158), 127 mL (95% CI: 90, 164), 138 mL (95% CI: 101, 176), 166 mL (95% CI: 129, 203), and 194 mL (95% CI: 156, 231), respectively. These results supported the evaluation of vilanterol 25 mcg in the confirmatory trials for COPD.

Dose-ranging trials in subjects with asthma evaluated doses from 3 to 50 mcg, comparing 12.5 mcg once-daily versus 6.25 mcg twice-daily dosing frequency. The results supported the selection of the vilanterol 25 mcg once-daily dose for further evaluation in the confirmatory trials for COPD.

There was a statistically significant reduction in the annual rate of decline in FVC (in mL) over 52 weeks in patients receiving OFEV compared to patients receiving placebo. The annual rate of decline in FVC (in mL) over 52 weeks was significantly reduced by 107 mL in patients receiving OFEV compared to patients receiving placebo. Results in the subpopulations of patients with HRCT with UIP-like fibrotic pattern and patients with other fibrotic patterns (Other HRCT) are included with the overall population.

- **Annual rate of decline in FVC based on underlying ILD diagnosis**: A post-hoc exploratory analysis by ILD diagnosis was performed. Treatment response across ILD diagnoses was consistent for FVC. ILD includes interstitial lung disease; autoimmune ILDs consist of rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD, mixed connective tissue disease, systemic sclerosis-associated ILD, and other terms. Other ILDs include fibrosing ILDs not categorized under autoimmune ILDs, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, or unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. The three most common ILDs in this category are exposure-related ILD, sarcoidosis, and pleuro-parenchymal fibroelastosis. These results are from a post-hoc exploratory analysis and are provided for descriptive purposes.

- **Change in FVC from baseline over time in treatment groups**: Figure 5 shows the change in FVC from baseline over time in the treatment groups. When the mean observed FVC change from baseline was plotted over time, the curves dive.

### Lebrikizumab in moderate-to-severe asthma: Pooled data from two randomised placebo-controlled studies [^117HmLiE]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

In the previous phase II (MILLY) study in moderate-to-severe asthma, lebrikizumab significantly improved lung function, with the greatest changes in periostin-high patients. There was a non-significant trend for a lower exacerbation rate through 24 weeks with lebrikizumab treatment compared with placebo. The placebo-corrected rate of exacerbations was reduced by 67% in periostin-high patients and by 29% in periostin-low patients. The results from the combined phase IIb studies, LUTE and VERSE, extend the findings described previously in a larger population with more severe asthma. The results from these studies also support the finding that baseline periostin level can be predictive of lebrikizumab treatment benefit. Notably, periostin-low patients in the placebo group experienced fewer exacerbations than periostin-high patients in the placebo group in the combined phase IIb studies, LUTE and VERSE. Larger phase III trials, currently underway, are required to confirm over a longer duration of treatment the effects observed in this study on the rate of asthma exacerbations and lung function, as well as to further investigate whether these improvements can translate into symptom benefits for patients.

The IL-13 contribution to the pathophysiology is not limited to patients with a history of exacerbations. Accordingly, in neither the studies nor the previous phase II study (MILLY) was a history of exacerbation required. In the combined phase IIb studies, LUTE and VERSE, approximately 52% of patients had not experienced an exacerbation in the previous year.

### Review of drug development guidance to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US and EU perspectives [^117NeJSM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). High credibility.

From the perspective of the clinician, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) seems to have become more challenging to manage in recent years. The increasing prevalence of the disease in an aging population with multiple comorbidities, coupled with the reality that mortality rates are increasing at a time when death rates in other chronic diseases have stabilized or even declined, are contributing factors. However, from the earliest use of the term COPD in the late 1960s, this disease was considered one confined to the lungs, characterized by fixed or partially reversible airflow limitation, and almost exclusively found in smokers. Thankfully, there is now recognition that COPD is more complicated, and the oversimplified understanding of the condition is outdated.

The rejection of a "one-size-fits-all" approach to therapy and the move toward targeting those at risk of disease exacerbations, considering systemic manifestations of the condition, and identifying specific treatable traits are welcome developments. That is not to say that the medicines prescribed for years have not been helpful. Inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids remain a mainstay of treatment for many patients and do control symptoms and reduce exacerbation risk. However, the degree of efficacy is variable, and because medicines do not reduce mortality or alter the rate of lung function decline, there is a clear need for new and more effective pharmacological treatments.

An improved understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms responsible for COPD will help move the management of COPD to a more precise and effective approach.

### Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1153rJHj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with cough, sputum production, or dyspnoea, and a reduction in lung function, quality of life, and life expectancy. Apart from smoking cessation, no other treatments that slow lung function decline are available. Roflumilast and cilomilast are oral phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE₄) inhibitors proposed to reduce the airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction seen in COPD. This Cochrane Review was first published in 2011 and was updated in 2017 and 2020.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral PDE₄ inhibitors for management of stable COPD.

- **Search methods**: We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register (date of last search: 9 March 2020). We found other trials at web-based clinical trials registers.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs if they compared oral PDE₄ inhibitors with placebo in people with COPD. We allowed co-administration of standard COPD therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies by involving a third review author. We assessed our confidence in the evidence by using GRADE recommendations. Primary outcomes were change in lung function (minimally important difference (MID) = 100 mL) and quality of life (scale 0 to 100; higher score indicates more limitations).

- **Main results**: We found 42 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analyses for roflumilast (28 trials).

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113jdbvi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Two studies (n = 247) evaluated the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, secondary infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute psychiatric illness requiring consultation, an invasive procedure, or initiation of a specific therapy. These studies reported a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use compared to no oral steroid use (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16–2.34; P = 0.006). The certainty of these estimates was low based on GRADE criteria, with an absolute risk increase of 174 more per 1,000 patients (95% CI, 43 more to 359 more).

Based on five critical outcomes using RCT evidence and the completion of the GRADE evidence table, the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be "low", and this certainty level was assigned to the final recommendation according to GRADE guidance.

The panel concluded that maintenance oral steroid therapy has not shown clinical benefit in trials, and current evidence indicates a risk of harm from chronic oral steroid usage. Two RCTs demonstrated an increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use, indicating possible excess harm for patients prescribed daily oral steroids. However, these recommendations were based on RCTs with small sample sizes, limited event occurrence, short study durations, and broad confidence intervals. Additionally, these studies took place when alternative medications were less available.

### Lebrikizumab in moderate-to-severe asthma: pooled data from two randomised placebo-controlled studies [^114xaLoZ]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

The pooled population for the study included a total of 463 patients, with 258 (56%) patients randomized in the LUTE study and 205 (44%) in the VERSE study. When dosing was terminated, patients discontinued the placebo-controlled treatment period and moved into the 24-week safety follow-up period.

- **Patient characteristics**: Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar across treatment groups. Due to early dosing termination, not all patients participated in the placebo-controlled treatment period for the minimum duration (seven doses of the study drug over 28 weeks) as specified in the amended protocols.

- **Treatment duration**: The median duration of treatment was 24.1 weeks, and the median time spent in the study, including the safety follow-up period, was 44.1 weeks. Patients received a median of six doses of the study drug during the placebo-controlled period, with a range of 1 to 12 doses administered.

This structure ensures clarity and readability while maintaining all original information.

### International differences in the frequency of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations reported in three clinical trials [^112gRi75]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are the cornerstone of evidence-based treatment. It is now customary to conduct large, complex studies to identify therapies that reduce the incidence of clinically important but infrequent events like death, hospitalization, or symptomatic deterioration. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbations are important because they drive clinical and physiological deterioration as well as healthcare costs. However, the interpretation of exacerbation data in clinical trials has proven to be very complex. Exacerbations are not normally distributed over time, and their occurrence can lead to behavioral changes such as leaving the trial. Further, the operational identification of an exacerbation's presence and severity relies on the post hoc determination of a new therapeutic intervention. The determinants of this therapeutic decision have not been studied in detail, and physicians in different countries might choose to manage the same event differently. Moreover, exacerbations may be under or overreported when determined only by patient-reported symptom variability and the specific treatment initiated.

Although some studies have relied on complex statistical models that address the problem of the patient's individual propensity to exacerbate, other studies have focused on identifying differences in the time to first exacerbation. Even when using these approaches, large numbers of patients are needed to provide sufficient statistical power for a proper test of the null hypothesis when exacerbation is an outcome.

### Inhaled corticosteroids versus placebo for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112UBF7X]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been the subject of much uncertainty. COPD clinical guidelines currently recommend the selective use of ICS. ICS are not recommended as monotherapy for people with COPD and are only given in combination with long-acting bronchodilators due to the greater efficacy of combination therapy. Incorporating and critiquing newly published placebo-controlled trials into the monotherapy evidence base may help resolve ongoing uncertainties and conflicting findings about their role in this population.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of inhaled corticosteroids used as monotherapy versus placebo in people with stable COPD, in terms of objective and subjective outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was October 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised trials comparing any dose of any type of ICS, given as monotherapy, with a placebo control in people with stable COPD. We excluded studies of less than 12 weeks' duration and studies of populations with known bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) or bronchodilator reversibility.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our a priori primary outcomes were: 1. exacerbations of COPD and 2. quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were: 3. all-cause mortality, 4. lung function (rate of decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)), 5. rescue bronchodilator use, 6. exercise capacity, 7. pneumonia, and 8. adverse events.

Survival was evaluated for OFEV compared to placebo in Study 2 and Study 3 as an exploratory analysis to support the primary endpoint (FVC). All-cause mortality was assessed over the study duration and available follow-up period, irrespective of the cause of death and whether patients continued treatment. All-cause mortality did not show a statistically significant difference (see Figure 3).

Figure 3: Kaplan-Meier estimates of all-cause mortality at vital status – end of study: Study 2 and Study 3

- **Bid = twice daily**:

The clinical efficacy of OFEV has been studied in patients with chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (Study 5 [NCT02999178]). A total of 663 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either OFEV 150 mg twice daily or a matching placebo for at least 52 weeks. Randomization was stratified based on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) fibrotic pattern as assessed by central readers: 412 patients with UIP-like HRCT pattern and 251 patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns were randomized. There were two co-primary populations defined for the analyses in this trial: all patients (the overall population) and patients with HRCT with UIP-like HRCT fibrotic pattern.

The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC (in mL) over 52 weeks. Other endpoints included time to first acute ILD exacerbation and time to death.

### Daliresp [^116UFx7P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Patients enrolled in the two 6-month efficacy trials had moderate to severe COPD (FEV1 40–70% predicted); the median age was 65 years, with 68% male and 97% Caucasian participants. COPD exacerbations and lung function (FEV1) were co-primary efficacy outcome measures in the four 1-year trials. In the two 6-month supportive efficacy trials, lung function (FEV1) alone was the primary efficacy outcome measure.

The two 6-month dose-selection efficacy trials (Trials 1 and 2) explored doses of 250 mcg and 500 mcg once daily in a total of 1929 patients (751 and 724 on Daliresp 250 and 500 mcg, respectively). The selection of the 500 mcg dose was primarily based on nominal improvements in lung function (FEV1) over the 250 mcg dose. The once-daily dosing regimen was chiefly based on the determination of a plasma half-life of 17 hours for roflumilast and 30 hours for its active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide.

An additional placebo-controlled 1-year trial (Trial 9) evaluated the effect of Daliresp 500 mcg on COPD exacerbations when added to a fixed-dose combination (FDC) product containing an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA). At screening, patients were required to have had two or more exacerbations in the previous year. This trial randomized a total of 2354 patients (1178 randomized to Daliresp, 1176 to placebo). Approximately 60% of the patients enrolled had severe COPD (postbronchodilator FEV1 30%-50% of predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis, and 39% had very severe COPD (postbronchodilator FEV1 ≤ 30% of predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: An analysis from the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial [^116NwAmN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). High credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experiencing acute coronary syndromes are at high risk for clinical events. In the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes trial, ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel reduced the primary endpoint of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke but increased the incidence of dyspnea, which may lead clinicians to withhold ticagrelor from patients.

- **Methods and results**: In 18,624 patients randomized to treatment with ticagrelor or clopidogrel, a history was recorded in 1085 (5.8%). At one year, the primary endpoint occurred in 17.7% of patients with and 10.4% in those without (P < 0.001). The one‐year event rate for the primary endpoint in patients treated with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel was 14.8% versus 20.6% (hazard ratio = 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.54 to 0.97), for death from any cause 8.4% versus 12.4% (hazard ratio = 0.70; 95% confidence interval: 0.47 to 1.04), and for major bleeding rates at one year 14.6% versus 16.6% (hazard ratio = 0.85; 95% confidence interval: 0.61 to 1.17). Dyspnea occurred more frequently with ticagrelor (26.1% vs. 16.3%; hazard ratio = 1.71; 95% confidence interval: 1.28 to 2.30). There was no differential increase in the relative risk of dyspnea compared to non-patients (1.85). No status-by-treatment interactions were found, showing consistency with the main trial results.

- **Conclusions**: In this post-hoc analysis, patients experienced high rates of ischemic events. Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel reduced and substantially decreased the absolute risk of ischemic events (5.8%) in patients, without increasing overall major bleeding events. The benefit-risk profile indicates favorable outcomes for ticagrelor despite the higher incidence of dyspnea compared to clopidogrel.

### Striverdi Respimat [^113eTd2S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The confirmatory trials in the Striverdi Respimat clinical development program involved eight studies, organized as four pairs of replicate, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving 3,533 COPD patients. Among these, 1,281 patients received the 5 mcg dose, and 1,284 patients received the 10 mcg dose.

- **Trial structure**:
	- Two replicate, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 48-week trials (Trials 1 and 2)
	- Two replicate, placebo- and active-controlled [formoterol 12 mcg twice daily], parallel group, 48-week trials (Trials 3 and 4)
	- Two replicate, placebo- and active-controlled [formoterol 12 mcg twice daily], 6-week crossover trials (Trials 5 and 6)
	- Two replicate, placebo- and active-controlled [tiotropium bromide 18 mcg once daily], 6-week crossover trials (Trials 7 and 8)

These trials enrolled patients aged 40 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, and moderate to very severe pulmonary impairment. This was characterized by post-bronchodilator FEV1 less than 80% predicted normal [GOLD II – IV] and a post-bronchodilator FEV1 to FVC ratio of less than 70%.

### Corticosteroid therapy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114Ri8jT]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized in part by a chronic inflammatory state in the airways, largely from chronic noxious stimuli such as tobacco smoke, and is punctuated with acute inflammatory exacerbations, which are often infectious. Although pathologically and biochemically different from the inflammation of asthma, the chronic inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — especially in subgroups with asthma-like features and particularly during exacerbations — might be expected to respond to corticosteroid therapy, as does asthma. Complications from long-term corticosteroid use are important, but they appear less when the corticosteroid is given via the inhaled route. Clinical evidence is particularly strong supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids to prevent exacerbations and oral corticosteroids to reduce the duration and impact of exacerbations.

### Ventavis [^115YbLry]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical response at 12 weeks, a composite endpoint defined by: a) improvement in exercise ability (6-minute walk test) by at least 10% versus baseline evaluated 30 minutes after dosing, b) improvement by at least one NYHA class versus baseline, and c) no death or deterioration of pulmonary hypertension. Deterioration required two or more of the following criteria:

- **Refractory systolic blood pressure**: 100 U/L, or total bilirubin ≥ 5 mg/dL.
- **Rapidly progressive cardiogenic renal failure**: Example includes a decrease of estimated creatinine clearance to ≤ 50% of baseline.
- **Decrease in 6-minute walking distance**: By ≥ 30% of baseline value.
- **New long-term need for intravenous catecholamines or diuretics**.
- **Cardiac index**: ≤ 1.3 L/min/m².
- **Central venous pressure (CVP)**: ≥ 22 mmHg despite adequate diuretic therapy.
- **Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2)**: ≤ 45% despite nasal oxygen therapy.

Although effectiveness was seen in the full population (response rates for the primary composite endpoint of 17% and 5%; p = 0.007), there was inadequate evidence of benefit in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic thromboembolic disease (WHO Group 4). The results presented are therefore those related to patients with PAH (WHO Group 1). The response rate for the primary efficacy endpoint among PAH patients was 19% for the iloprost group, compared with 4% for the placebo group (p = 0.0033).

### Esbriet [^113z53oY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In Study 1, the primary efficacy analysis for the change in percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) from baseline to Week 52 demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect of ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 278), compared with placebo (n = 277), using a rank ANCOVA with the lowest rank imputation for missing data due to death. In Study 2, there was a statistically significant difference at Week 72 for the change in %FVC from baseline. However, in Study 3, no statistically significant difference was observed at Week 72 for the change in %FVC from baseline.

Figure 1 presents the cumulative distribution for all cut-offs for the change from baseline in %FVC at Week 52 for Study 1. For all categorical declines in lung function, the proportion of patients experiencing a decline was lower on ESBRIET than on placebo. Study 2 showed similar results.

- **Mean change from baseline in forced vital capacity (FVC) (ml)**: In Study 1, a reduction in the mean decline in FVC (in ml) was observed in patients receiving ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (-235 ml) compared to placebo (-428 ml), with a mean treatment difference of 193 mL at Week 52 (see Figure 2). In Study 2, a reduction in the decline in FVC volume was also observed in patients receiving ESBRIET 2403 mg/day, compared with placebo, with a mean treatment difference of 157 mL at Week 72. There was no statistically significant difference in the decline in FVC volume observed in Study 3.

### Anti-IL-5 therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112FZTq7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admissions, disease-related morbidity, and mortality. COPD is a heterogeneous disease with distinct inflammatory phenotypes, including eosinophilia, which may drive acute exacerbations in a subgroup of patients. Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin 5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R) have a role in the care of people with severe eosinophilic asthma and may similarly provide therapeutic benefit for people with COPD of eosinophilic phenotype.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibody therapies targeting IL-5 signaling (anti-IL-5 or anti-IL-5Rα) compared with placebo in the treatment of adults with COPD.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, clinical trials registries, manufacturers' websites, and reference lists of included studies. Our most recent search was 23 September 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing anti-IL-5 therapy with placebo in adults with COPD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data and analyzed outcomes using a random-effects model. The primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring antibiotics or oral steroids, hospitalizations due to exacerbation of COPD, serious adverse events, and quality of life. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane and the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

- **Main results**: Six studies involving a total of 5542 participants met our inclusion criteria.

### SPL drug information for mepolizumab [^116ivpim]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of mepolizumab for subcutaneous (SC) administration as an adjunctive treatment for adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is 100 mg every four weeks. This is specifically for cases that are inadequately controlled, exhibit an eosinophilic phenotype, and are undergoing maintenance therapy.

### From dream to REALITI-A and beyond: Mepolizumab for the treatment of eosinophil-driven diseases [^117AgWs4]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

The Phase III METREX (MEpolizumab vs. placebo as add‐on treatment for frequently exacerbating COPD patients; NCT02105948) and METREO (MEpolizumab vs. placebo as add‐on treatment for frequently exacerbating COPD patients characterized by eosinophil level; NCT02105961) trials investigated the effect of mepolizumab in patients with COPD who had exacerbations despite receiving ICS‐based triple maintenance therapy; the primary endpoint was the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations. Both trials examined outcomes in patients with COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype (defined as a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 150 cells/µl at screening or ≥ 300 cells/µl within the previous year). In addition, the METREX trial included a cohort of patients without an eosinophilic phenotype.

In METREX and METREO, in patients with an eosinophilic COPD phenotype, mepolizumab reduced the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations by 18% and 20%, respectively, for mepolizumab 100 mg SC versus placebo. This is consistent with results observed in the benralizumab Phase III COPD trials. In contrast, COPD exacerbations were not significantly reduced versus placebo in the non‐eosinophilic populations in METREX.

Of note, in METREX and METREO, there was a clear blood eosinophil count‐dependent suppressive effect on exacerbations treated with OCS but no effect on exacerbations treated with antibiotics alone. Better stratification of exacerbation endpoints may be key to the successful clinical development of eosinophil‐targeting therapies in COPD.

### Benralizumab for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and sputum eosinophilia: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a study [^115ZEUrJ]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation in 10–20% of patients. Benralizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 receptor α monoclonal antibody, depletes blood and sputum eosinophils. We aimed to establish whether benralizumab reduces acute exacerbations of COPD in patients with eosinophilia and COPD.

- **Methods**: We conducted this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a study between Nov 18, 2010, and July 13, 2013, at 26 sites in the UK, Poland, Germany, Canada, the United States, Denmark, and Spain. Adults aged 40–85 years, with moderate-to-severe COPD, at least one acute exacerbation of COPD, and a sputum eosinophil count of 3.0% or more within the previous year, were randomly assigned (1:1) via computer-generated permuted block randomisation (block size of four), with an interactive voice or web-response system, to receive placebo or 100 mg benralizumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks (three doses), then every 8 weeks (five doses) over 48 weeks. Study site personnel included in study assessments, participants, and data analysts were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the annualised rate of acute exacerbations of COPD at week 56, defined as the number of acute exacerbations divided by the total duration of person-year follow-up. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included COPD-specific Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ-C), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire self-administered standardised format (CRQ-SAS), pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and safety.

### Cardiovascular and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapeutics: Two paths, one destination [^116nqofw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

Crim and colleagues tested whether vascular stiffness was affected by inhaled long-acting β2-agonist, corticosteroid, or combination therapy in patients with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Baseline arterial pulse wave velocity predicted mortality but was unaffected by therapy. The authors conclude that inhaled therapy for COPD appeared unlikely to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk. Although aggressive risk factor modification and smoking cessation are pivotal in addressing CV risk in COPD, optimal use of existing drugs and potential avenues for developing novel therapies deserve further discussion.

For the management of hypertension in COPD, limited contemporary data support the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazides. In an analysis of clinical trials involving more than 12,000 patients with COPD, treatment with roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor with a wide range of anti-inflammatory actions, was associated with a 35% relative risk reduction in major adverse CV events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and CV death), independent of age, sex, smoking status, and concomitant COPD treatments. These findings warrant further investigation of the potential CV benefits of roflumilast. Endothelial activation earlier in life has been associated with the development of subclinical heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Lung Study, an increase in endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was associated with a…

### Biologics and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112YaBtt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of airway inflammation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) provides a rationale for biological agents targeting specific inflammatory pathways. This approach has been strikingly effective in patients with other chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and asthma. However, there are important and unresolved challenges in COPD, including our incomplete understanding of the heterogeneity of the lower airway inflammatory response and how these contribute to the clinical expression of disease. As a result, progress has been slow, and there have been many failures. One notable exception is the targeting of eosinophilic airway inflammation with anti-IL-5, which has an acknowledged and important role in the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma.

Recent phase III studies have shown a reduction in exacerbations of around 20% in patients with COPD, providing clear evidence of a blood eosinophil count-dependent beneficial effect. The demonstration of clinical efficacy linked to a clinically accessible biomarker raises the possibility of precision biomarker-directed use of biological agents in patients with COPD. The hope is that this will be an exemplar for the future development of biological agents in patients with COPD.

### Roflumilast in moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with long-acting bronchodilators: two randomised clinical trials [^112B3Ppg]. Lancet (2009). High credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have few options for treatment. The efficacy and safety of the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast have been investigated in studies of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, but not in those concomitantly treated with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators. The effect of roflumilast on lung function in patients with moderate to severe COPD who are already being treated with salmeterol or tiotropium was investigated.

- **Methods**: In two double-blind, multicentre studies done in an outpatient setting, following a 4-week run-in, patients older than 40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomly assigned to oral roflumilast 500 microg or placebo once a day for 24 weeks, in addition to salmeterol (M2–127 study) or tiotropium (M2–128 study). The primary endpoint was change in prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Analysis was by intention to treat. The studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00313209 for M2–127, and NCT00424268 for M2–128.

- **Findings**: In the salmeterol plus roflumilast trial, 466 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 467 with placebo; in the tiotropium plus roflumilast trial, 371 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 372 with placebo. Compared with placebo, roflumilast consistently improved mean prebronchodilator FEV(1) by 49 mL (p < 0.0001) in patients treated with salmeterol, and 80 mL (p < 0.0001) in those treated with tiotropium. A similar improvement in postbronchodilator FEV(1) was noted in both groups.

### An update on outcomes for COPD pharmacological trials: A COPD investigators report - Reassessment of the 2008 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society statement on outcomes for COPD pharmacological trials [^116jkovT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In 2008, a dedicated American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society task force published a paper on the possible use and limitations of clinical outcomes and biomarkers to evaluate the impact of pharmacological therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Since then, our scientific understanding of COPD has increased considerably. There has been a progressive shift from a one-size-fits-all diagnostic and therapeutic approach to a personalized approach, and many new treatments currently in development will require new endpoints to evaluate their efficacy adequately.

- **Objectives**: The emergence of several new relevant outcome measures motivated the authors to review advances in the field and highlight the need to update the content of the original report.

- **Methods**: The authors separately created search strategies for the literature, primarily based on their opinions and assessments supported by carefully chosen references. No centralized examination of the literature or uniform criteria for including or excluding evidence were used.

- **Measurements and main results**: Endpoints, outcomes, and biomarkers have been revisited. The limitations of some of those reported in the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society task force document have been highlighted. In addition, new tools that may be useful, especially in evaluating personalized therapy, have been described.

Because the "label-free" treatable traits approach is becoming an important step toward precision medicine, future clinical trials will need to incorporate new methodologies to ensure effective evaluation and treatment of COPD patients.

### Mavrilimumab, a fully human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor α monoclonal antibody: Long-term safety and efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^116XxTrR]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary function and long-term pulmonary safety analysis findings indicate that the mean Borg Dyspnea Index score in the overall as-treated population remained unchanged at week 134 compared with week 74. Similar dyspnea scores from baseline through week 134 were observed in populations of patients who switched to 100 mg mavrilimumab from 30 mg mavrilimumab, 150 mg mavrilimumab, 50 mg golimumab, or placebo.

A small proportion of patients experienced an event defined as clinically relevant (more than a 20% decrease from baseline and 20% reduction from baseline to less than 80% predicted). In most cases, these events occurred at a single time point and were not associated with a respiratory adverse event. Mean FEV1, FVC, and D-values remained within 5% of the mean baseline value for patients treated during the randomized phases of the phase IIb studies; however, baseline D-values were measured in a minority of patients (48 patients in study 1107 and 0 patients in study 1071).

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Emerging medical therapies [^1152yxEw]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

As many as 10 million Americans have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and, as a consequence, experience disabling symptoms, high cost of care, and substantial mortality. Several new approaches are being investigated for possible benefit in managing or even reversing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This article reviews four new approaches that are either in or close to phase III trials:

- **Long-acting bronchodilators**: These medications are showing promise in clinical trials.
- **Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors**: Undergoing investigation for potential benefits.
- **Vasodilators**: Their role and efficacy require further study.
- **Retinoids**: This class is being explored for therapeutic use.

Of these, tiotropium appears to be the closest to receiving clinical approval in the United States. The risk/benefit ratio and the cost-effectiveness of the other compounds are less clear and await additional study.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111hYXCp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and more specifically with respect to combination therapy, the ATS 2020 guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year that required antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, or hospitalization.
