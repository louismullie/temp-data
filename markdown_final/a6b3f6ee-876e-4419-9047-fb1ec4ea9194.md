## Question

Do you need to titrate topamax

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Topamax (topiramate) needs to be titrated and how to titrate it safely and effectively across indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labeling says about titration for each approved indication. Then, I should verify whether any guideline or high-quality evidence contradicts or supports a no-titration approach. Next, I will examine the pharmacologic rationale for slow titration, including cognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse effects. After that, I should review special populations and drug interactions that modify titration. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, indication-specific titration framework and confirm whether any exceptions exist where titration is not required.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. Across FDA labels, topiramate is consistently initiated at a low dose and increased in small, weekly increments to a target maintenance dose, which by definition constitutes titration; for example, epilepsy adjunctive therapy starts at 25–50 mg/day and increases by 25–50 mg/day weekly to 200–400 mg/day, and migraine prevention starts at 25 mg/day and increases by 25 mg/day weekly to 100 mg/day, with explicit statements that titration rate should be guided by clinical outcome and can be slowed if needed [^115b1XgH] [^notfound] [^113d9F6L].

> Wait, let me verify whether any indication allows starting at a full therapeutic dose without titration. I need to check migraine, epilepsy, and off-label uses like cyclic vomiting syndrome and substance use disorders. For migraine, pivotal trials and labels uniformly used 25 mg weekly increments to 50–100 mg/day, never starting at 100 mg/day, which confirms titration is required; for epilepsy, adjunctive and monotherapy schedules start low and escalate weekly; for cyclic vomiting syndrome, guidance specifies starting at 25 mg/day and increasing by 25 mg weekly to 50–75 mg twice daily; for alcohol and stimulant use disorders, VA/DoD and addiction guidelines recommend gradual titration over weeks to minimize adverse effects, reinforcing that titration is standard even off-label [^114SnZFH] [^115b1XgH] [^114h4YL6] [^111LcnYc] [^113rYKGo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the pharmacologic rationale for slow titration. Rapid titration and higher initial doses are associated with higher rates of cognitive-related dysfunction, somnolence, fatigue, and psychiatric/behavioral disturbances; slower weekly increments reduce these dose-related adverse effects without sacrificing efficacy, and many adverse events cluster during the titration phase, supporting a gradual approach to improve tolerability and retention [^114zA2gW] [^111tVQUJ] [^115Kdikc] [^114HnL7K].

> I will now examine special populations and drug–drug interactions that modify titration. In renal impairment with creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min, the usual dose should be halved and titration slowed; during hemodialysis, supplemental dosing and careful titration are needed; in hepatic impairment, no specific guidance exists, so caution and slower titration are prudent; concomitant enzyme inducers like phenytoin or carbamazepine lower topiramate levels and may necessitate dose adjustments, while valproate co-administration increases risk of hyperammonemia and hypothermia, warranting vigilance and potentially slower titration with symptom monitoring [^115j22ze] [^114mZm3w] [^116Cdg7v] [^1154GcjZ].

> Let me consider formulation-specific nuances. Immediate-release products are titrated in weekly 25–50 mg increments depending on indication, while extended-release formulations for epilepsy and migraine follow the same slow weekly titration principles, albeit sometimes as once-daily regimens; phentermine/topiramate ER has its own proprietary titration schedule with 3.75/23 mg for 14 days, then 7.5/46 mg, with optional escalation to 11.25/69 mg and 15/92 mg based on response, and discontinuation requires tapering to mitigate seizure risk, which underscores that even fixed-dose combinations rely on structured titration and tapering strategies [^113d9F6L] [^114dgwyC] [^112t1YWw].

> But wait, what if a patient cannot tolerate weekly increases? I should confirm whether labels allow flexibility. FDA labeling explicitly states that dose and titration rate should be guided by clinical outcome and that longer intervals between dose adjustments can be used, which means clinicians can extend titration beyond weekly increments if adverse effects emerge, balancing efficacy and tolerability on a case-by-case basis [^115b1XgH] [^116Fcyah].

> Next, I should review whether any high-quality guideline contradicts titration. The VA/DoD headache guideline recommends topiramate for migraine prevention and explicitly advises slow titration to reduce side effects, aligning with FDA labeling; the AGA obesity guideline details a stepwise titration for phentermine/topiramate ER; and the ASN kidney guidance emphasizes reduced starting doses and slower titration in CKD, all reinforcing that titration is mandatory rather than optional [^113F9ip8] [^113YbGyQ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if there might be an exception where a full therapeutic dose could be started immediately, but I should double-check that assumption. I find no FDA-approved or guideline-endorsed scenario that permits starting at a full maintenance dose without titration; even in studies using higher starting doses, those were within controlled protocols with close monitoring and still reflected incremental escalation, so the practical, safety-conscious approach remains slow titration for all indications [^116Fcyah].

> Synthesis and answer: Yes, Topamax (topiramate) must be titrated for all indications to mitigate dose-related cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and somnolence/fatigue adverse effects; typical practice is to start at 25–50 mg/day and increase by 25–50 mg/day weekly to a target maintenance dose tailored to the indication, with allowance to extend intervals based on tolerability, and with dose reductions and slower titration in renal impairment and when interacting drugs are present [^115b1XgH] [^116Fcyah] [^115j22ze] [^1154GcjZ].

Topamax (topiramate) **requires titration** to reduce the risk of cognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse effects [^114zA2gW] and to improve tolerability [^115Kdikc]. Standard adult titration starts at **25–50 mg/day** [^115b1XgH] and increases by 25–50 mg/day weekly to a typical maintenance of 200–400 mg/day in two divided doses for epilepsy [^113oJeXm] and 100 mg/day for migraine prevention [^1154zVEV]. Slower titration is recommended in patients with renal impairment [^114mZm3w], older adults, or those on interacting medications [^11526tPf]. Rapid titration increases the risk of cognitive impairment, somnolence, and mood changes [^111tVQUJ], so dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response and tolerability [^115b1XgH].

---

## Rationale for titration

Titration is necessary to balance efficacy and tolerability; **slow titration reduces adverse effects** [^115Kdikc] and improves adherence [^115Kdikc].

---

## Standard titration protocols

Key adult titration parameters by indication:

| **Aspect** | **Epilepsy (adjunctive therapy)** | **Migraine prevention** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial dose | 25–50 mg/day in two divided doses [^115b1XgH] | 25 mg/day for one week [^1154zVEV] |
| Titration | Increase by 25–50 mg/day every week [^113d9F6L] to a target of 200–400 mg/day [^113oJeXm] | Increase by 25 mg/day weekly to 100 mg/day (50 mg twice daily) [^1154zVEV] |
| Maximum dose | 400 mg/day (higher doses do not improve response) [^115b1XgH] | 200 mg/day (higher doses increase adverse effects without added benefit) [^112zZKoW] [^114zA2gW] |

---

### Pediatric patients

Pediatric dosing is **weight-based**, starting at 25 mg/day (or 1–3 mg/kg/day) and increasing by 1–3 mg/kg/day every 1–2 weeks to 5–9 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 400 mg/day [^115b1XgH] [^116Fcyah].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting titration

- **Cognitive effects**: Rapid titration increases cognitive adverse effects [^111tVQUJ]; slower titration improves tolerability [^115Kdikc].
- **Adverse events**: Most adverse events occur during titration [^114HnL7K]; slower titration reduces discontinuations [^115Kdikc].
- **Efficacy**: Gradual titration maintains efficacy while improving tolerability [^115Kdikc].

---

## Risks of rapid titration

Rapid titration increases:

- **Cognitive impairment**: Memory, attention, and language difficulties [^111tVQUJ].
- **Neuropsychiatric effects**: Mood changes, depression, anxiety, and psychosis [^114zA2gW].
- **Sedation**: Somnolence and fatigue [^111tVQUJ].
- **Metabolic effects**: Metabolic acidosis and weight loss [^1154GcjZ].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Reduce dose by 50% and titrate slowly [^114mZm3w] [^11526tPf].
- **Elderly patients**: Use caution and titrate slowly due to higher adverse-effect risk.
- **Drug interactions**: Enzyme inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine) may require dose adjustments [^1154GcjZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **slow titration** to improve tolerability and adherence [^113F9ip8]; **individualized dosing** should be guided by clinical response and tolerability [^115b1XgH].

---

## Summary of titration protocols by indication

| **Indication** | **Initial dose** | **Titration schedule** | **Maintenance dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Epilepsy (adjunctive) | 25–50 mg/day | Increase by 25–50 mg/day weekly | 200–400 mg/day |
| Migraine prevention | 25 mg/day | Increase by 25 mg/day weekly | 100 mg/day |
| Pediatric epilepsy | 25 mg/day (1–3 mg/kg/day) | Increase by 1–3 mg/kg/day every 1–2 weeks | 5–9 mg/kg/day (max 400 mg/day) |

---

Topamax **requires titration** to minimize adverse effects and optimize adherence; **slow, individualized titration** is recommended, especially in special populations [^113F9ip8].

Adult Patients With Partial-Onset Seizures

The effectiveness of TOPAMAX as an adjunctive treatment for adults with partial-onset seizures was established in six multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), two comparing several dosages of TOPAMAX and placebo and four comparing a single dosage with placebo, in patients with a history of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondarily generalized seizures.

Patients in these studies were permitted a maximum of two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in addition to TOPAMAX tablets or placebo. In each study, patients were stabilized on optimum dosages of their concomitant AEDs during baseline phase lasting between 4 and 12 weeks. Patients who experienced a pre-specified minimum number of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, during the baseline phase (12 seizures for 12-week baseline, 8 for 8-week baseline or 3 for 4-week baseline) were randomly assigned to placebo or a specified dose of TOPAMAX tablets in addition to their other AEDs.

Following randomization, patients began the double-blind phase of treatment. In five of the six studies, patients received active drug beginning at 100 mg per day; the dose was then increased by 100 mg or 200 mg/day increments weekly or every other week until the assigned dose was reached, unless intolerance prevented increases. In the sixth study (Study 7), the 25 or 50 mg/day initial doses of topiramate were followed by respective weekly increments of 25 or 50 mg/day until the target dose of 200 mg/day was reached. After titration, patients entered a 4, 8 or 12-week stabilization period. The numbers of patients randomized to each dose and the actual mean and median doses in the stabilization period are shown in Table 12.

2.2 Dosing in Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy

Adults (17 Years of Age and Older)

The recommended total daily dose of TOPAMAX as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial onset seizures or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome is 200 to 400 mg/day in two divided doses, and 400 mg/day in two divided doses as adjunctive treatment in adults with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. TOPAMAX should be initiated at 25 to 50 mg/day, followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 to 50 mg/day every week. Titrating in increments of 25 mg/day every week may delay the time to reach an effective dose. Doses above 400 mg/day have not been shown to improve responses in adults with partial-onset seizures.

Pediatric Patients 2 to 16 Years of Age

The recommended total daily dose of TOPAMAX as adjunctive therapy for pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is approximately 5 to 9 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Titration should begin at 25 mg/day (or less, based on a range of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day) nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (administered in two divided doses), to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. The total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg/day.

2.3 Dosing for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine

The recommended total daily dose of TOPAMAX as treatment for patients 12 years of age and older for the preventive treatment of migraine is 100 mg/day administered in two divided doses (Table 3). The recommended titration rate for TOPAMAX for the preventive treatment of migraine is as follows:

Dose and titration rate should be guided by clinical outcome. If required, longer intervals between dose adjustments can be used.

2.1 Dosing in Monotherapy Epilepsy

Adults and Pediatric Patients 10 Years of Age and Older

The recommended dose for TOPAMAX monotherapy in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older is 400 mg/day in two divided doses. The dose should be achieved by titration according to the following schedule (Table 1):

Pediatric Patients 2 to 9 Years of Age

Dosing in patients 2 to 9 years of age is based on weight. During the titration period, the initial dose of TOPAMAX is 25 mg/day nightly for the first week. Based upon tolerability, the dosage can be increased to 50 mg/day (25 mg twice daily) in the second week. Dosage can be increased by 25–50 mg/day each subsequent week as tolerated. Titration to the minimum maintenance dose should be attempted over 5–7 weeks of the total titration period. Based upon tolerability and clinical response, additional titration to a higher dose (up to the maximum maintenance dose) can be attempted at 25–50 mg/day weekly increments. The total daily dose should not exceed the maximum maintenance dose for each range of body weight (Table 2).

Patients With Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

The effectiveness of TOPAMAX as an adjunctive treatment for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 2 years of age and older was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 9), comparing a single dosage of TOPAMAX and placebo (see Table 13).

Patients in Study 9 were permitted a maximum of two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in addition to TOPAMAX or placebo. Patients were stabilized on optimum dosages of their concomitant AEDs during an 8-week baseline phase. Patients who experienced at least three primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures during the baseline phase were randomly assigned to placebo or TOPAMAX in addition to their other AEDs.

Following randomization, patients began the double-blind phase of treatment. Patients received active drug beginning at 50 mg/day for four weeks; the dose was then increased by 50 mg to 150 mg/day increments every other week until the assigned dose of 175, 225, or 400 mg/day based on patients' body weight to approximate a dosage of 6 mg/kg/day was reached, unless intolerance prevented increases. After titration, patients entered a 12-week stabilization period.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^1154zVEV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials established the effectiveness of TOPAMAX in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials (Study 11 was conducted in the U.S. and Study 12 was conducted in the U.S. and Canada) was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either TOPAMAX 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

Patients With Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome

The effectiveness of TOPAMAX as an adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 10) comparing a single dosage of TOPAMAX with placebo in patients 2 years of age and older (see Table 13).

Patients in Study 10 were permitted a maximum of two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in addition to TOPAMAX or placebo. Patients who were experiencing at least 60 seizures per month before study entry were stabilized on optimum dosages of their concomitant AEDs during a 4-week baseline phase. Following baseline, patients were randomly assigned to placebo or TOPAMAX in addition to their other AEDs. Active drug was titrated beginning at 1 mg/kg/day for a week; the dose was then increased to 3 mg/kg/day for one week, then to 6 mg/kg/day. After titration, patients entered an 8-week stabilization period.

The primary measures of effectiveness were the percent reduction in drop attacks and a parental global rating of seizure severity.

In all adjunctive trials, the reduction in seizure rate from baseline during the entire double-blind phase was measured. The median percent reductions in seizure rates and the responder rates (fraction of patients with at least a 50% reduction) by treatment group for each study are shown below in Table 13. As described above, a global improvement in seizure severity was also assessed in the Lennox-Gastaut trial.

Subset analyses of the antiepileptic efficacy of TOPAMAX tablets in these studies showed no differences as a function of gender, race, age, baseline seizure rate, or concomitant AED.

In clinical trials for epilepsy, daily dosages were decreased in weekly intervals by 50 to 100 mg/day in adults and over a 2- to 8-week period in pediatric patients; transition was permitted to a new antiepileptic regimen when clinically indicated.

### Topiramate tablet (Topiramate) [^114mKwu4]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Dosing in patients 2 to < 10 years is based on weight. During the titration period, the initial dose of topiramate tablets should be 25 mg/day administered nightly for the first week. Based upon tolerability, the dosage can be increased to 50 mg/day (25 mg twice daily) in the second week. Dosage can be increased by 25–50 mg/day each subsequent week as tolerated. Titration to the minimum maintenance dose should be attempted over 5–7 weeks of the total titration period. Based upon tolerability and clinical response, additional titration to a higher dose (up to the maximum maintenance dose) can be attempted at 25–50 mg/day weekly increments. The total daily dose should not exceed the maximum maintenance dose for each range of body weight (Table 2).

Adjunctive Therapy Use

Adults 17 Years of Age and Over - Partial Onset Seizures, Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures, or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome

The recommended total daily dose of topiramate tablets as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial onset seizures is 200 to 400 mg/day in two divided doses, and 400 mg/day in two divided doses as adjunctive treatment in adults with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It is recommended that therapy be initiated at 25 to 50 mg/day followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 to 50 mg/day every week. Titrating in increments of 25 mg/day every week may delay the time to reach an effective dose. Doses above 400 mg/day (600, 800 or 1,000 mg/day) have not been shown to improve responses in dose-response studies in adults with partial onset seizures. Daily doses above 1,600 mg have not been studied.

Adult Patients

Cognitive-Related Dysfunction

Rapid titration rate and higher initial dose were associated with higher incidences of cognitive-related dysfunction.

In adult epilepsy adjunctive controlled trials, which used rapid titration (100–200 mg/day weekly increments), and target TOPAMAX doses of 200 mg – 1000 mg/day, 56% of patients in the 800 mg/day and 1000 mg/day dose groups experienced cognitive-related dysfunction compared to approximately 42% of patients in the 200–400 mg/day groups and 14% for placebo. In this rapid titration regimen, these dose-related adverse reactions began in the titration or in the maintenance phase, and in some patients these events began during titration and persisted into the maintenance phase.

In the monotherapy epilepsy controlled trial, the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for TOPAMAX 50 mg/day and 26% for 400 mg/day.

In the 6-month controlled trials for the preventive treatment of migraine, which used a slower titration regimen (25 mg/day weekly increments), the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for TOPAMAX 50 mg/day, 22% for 100 mg/day (the recommended dose), 28% for 200 mg/day, and 10% for placebo. Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed during titration and sometimes persisted after completion of titration.

Psychiatric/Behavioral Disturbances

Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g., depression, mood) were dose-related for both the adjunctive epilepsy and migraine populations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Somnolence/Fatigue

Somnolence and fatigue were the adverse reactions most frequently reported during clinical trials of TOPAMAX for adjunctive epilepsy. For the adjunctive epilepsy population, the incidence of fatigue, appeared dose related. For the monotherapy epilepsy population, the incidence of somnolence was dose-related. For the migraine population, the incidences of both fatigue and somnolence were dose-related and more common in the titration phase.

### Topiramate treatment of alcohol use disorder in clinical practice [^115Bm8wR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Topiramate is an anticonvulsant medication with increasingly strong evidence, supporting its use for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) based on clinical trials. These clinical cases summarize the initiation and titration of topiramate in AUD treatment. The core issues of patient selection, consideration of comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions, side-effect profile, safety and effectiveness are reviewed. Addiction physicians should take a leading role in using topiramate to treat AUDs, working with patients to balance the benefits of topiramate with the risk.

### Topiramate titration and tolerability [^115Kdikc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of two titration rates for topiramate initiated as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in a multicenter, double-blindtrial.

Methods

After a two-week baseline phase, 188 patients were randomized to either a 50/50 titration schedule (initial dosage 50 mg/d increased in 50-mg/d increments at weekly intervals; n = 95) or to a 100/200 titration schedule (initial dosage 100 mg/d increased by 100–200 mg/d at weekly intervals; n = 93). The maximum dosage of 400 mg/d was therefore achieved in eight weeks or three weeks, respectively.

Results

Compared with the 100/200 titration rate, the 50/50 titration rate significantly reduced the cumulative incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to changes in topiramate therapy (ie., dosage reductions, interruptions or discontinuations of therapy) (p = 0.048) and significantly reduced treatment interruptions or withdrawals due to TEAEs (p = 0.040). Mild or moderate effects involving the central nervous system were the most frequent adverse events. At the final visit, therapeutic responses were comparable in the 50/50 and 100/200 titration groups: median percent seizure reduction was 42% vs. 33%, proportion of patients with 250% seizure reduction was 42% vs. 38%, and proportion of patients with no seizures during double-blind treatment was 14% vs. 10%, respectively. Seizure frequency was substantially reduced from baseline during topiramate titration. At day 22, with the 50/50 titration group receiving 150 mg/d and the 100/200 titration group receiving 400 mg/d, the mean percent seizure reduction was 51% and 54%, respectively.

Conclusions

Gradual initiation of topiramate therapy can significantly enhance patient tolerability without delaying therapeutic response.

### Topiramate for migraine prevention: a randomized controlled trial [^114SnZFH]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Small open-label and controlled trials suggest that the antiepileptic drug topiramate is effective for migraine prevention.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate for migraine prevention in a large controlled trial.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted during outpatient treatment at 52 North American clinical centers. Patients were aged 12 to 65 years and had a 6-month history of migraine (International Headache Society criteria) and 3 to 12 migraines a month but no more than 15 headache days a month during a 28-day prospective baseline phase.

Interventions

After a washout period, patients meeting entry criteria were randomized to topiramate (50, 100, or 200 mg/d) or placebo. Topiramate was titrated by 25 mg/wk for 8 weeks to the assigned or maximum tolerated dose, whichever was less. Patients continued receiving that dose for 18 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine frequency. Secondary efficacy measures included responder rate (proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine frequency), reductions in mean number of monthly migraine days, severity, duration, and days a month requiring rescue medication, and adverse events. The month of onset of preventive treatment action was assessed.

Results

Of 483 patients randomized, 468 provided at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment and comprised the intent-to-treat population. Mean monthly migraine frequency decreased significantly for patients receiving topiramate at 100 mg/d (-2.1, P = 0.008) and topiramate at 200 mg/d (-2.4, P < .001) vs placebo (-1.1). Statistically significant reductions (P < .05) occurred within the first month with topiramate at 100 and 200 mg/d. The responder rate was significantly greater with topiramate at 50 mg/d (39%, P = 0.01), 100 mg/d (49%, P < .001), and 200 mg/d (47%, P < .001) vs placebo (23%). Reductions in migraine days were significant for the 100-mg/d (P = 0.003) and 200-mg/d (P < .001) topiramate groups. Rescue medication use was reduced in the 100-mg/d (P = 0.01) and 200-mg/d (P = 0.005) topiramate groups. Adverse events resulting in discontinuation in the topiramate groups included paresthesia, fatigue, and nausea.

Conclusion

Topiramate showed significant efficacy in migraine prevention within the first month of treatment, an effect maintained for the duration of the double-blind phase.

Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age

In five, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine, most adverse reactions occurred more frequently during the titration period than during the maintenance period. Among adverse reactions with onset during titration, approximately half persisted into the maintenance period.

In four, fixed-dose, double-blind clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine in TOPAMAX-treated pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age, the most common adverse reactions with TOPAMAX 100 mg that were seen at an incidence higher (≥ 5%) than in the placebo group were: paresthesia, upper respiratory tract infection, anorexia, and abdominal pain (see Table 9). Table 9 shows adverse reactions from the pediatric trial (Study 13 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]) in which 103 pediatric patients were treated with placebo or 50 mg or 100 mg of TOPAMAX, and three predominantly adult trials in which 49 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years of age) were treated with placebo or 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg of TOPAMAX. Table 9 also shows adverse reactions in pediatric patients in the controlled migraine trials when the incidence in a TOPAMAX dose group was at least 5% or higher and greater than the incidence of placebo. Many adverse reactions shown in Table 9 indicate a dose-dependent relationship. The incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., allergy, fatigue, headache, anorexia, insomnia, somnolence, and viral infection) was dose-related and greater at higher than recommended TOPAMAX dosing (200 mg daily) compared to the incidence of these adverse reactions at the recommended dosing (100 mg daily).

In the double-blind placebo-controlled studies, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 8% of placebo patients compared with 6% of TOPAMAX-treated patients. Adverse reactions associated with discontinuing therapy that occurred in more than one TOPAMAX-treated patient were fatigue (1%), headache (1%), and somnolence (1%).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

2.1 Epilepsy

It is not necessary to monitor topiramate plasma concentrations to optimize topiramate tablets therapy.

On occasion, the addition of topiramate tablets to phenytoin may require an adjustment of the dose of phenytoin to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Addition or withdrawal of phenytoin and/or carbamazepine during adjunctive therapy with topiramate tablets may require adjustment of the dose of topiramate tablets.

Because of the bitter taste, tablets should not be broken.

Topiramate tablets can be taken without regard to meals.

Monotherapy Use

Adults and Pediatric Patients 10 Years and Older

The recommended dose for topiramate monotherapy in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older is 400 mg/day in two divided doses. Approximately 58% of patients randomized to 400 mg/day achieved this maximal dose in the monotherapy controlled trial; the mean dose achieved in the trial was 275 mg/day. The dose should be achieved by titration according to the following schedule(Table 1):

Children Ages 2 to < 10 Years

Dosing of topiramate as initial monotherapy in children 2 to < 10 years of age with partial onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures was based on a pharmacometric bridging approach [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

After titration, patients entered an 8-week stabilization period.

Patients With Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures

The effectiveness of topiramate as an adjunctive treatment for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 2 years old and older was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, comparing a single dosage of topiramate and placebo.

Patients in this study were permitted a maximum of two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in addition to topiramate or placebo. Patients were stabilized on optimum dosages of their concomitant AEDs during an 8-week baseline phase. Patients who experienced at least three primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures during the baseline phase were randomly assigned to placebo or topiramate in addition to their other AEDs.

Following randomization, patients began the double-blind phase of treatment. Patients received active drug beginning at 50 mg/day for four weeks; the dose was then increased by 50 mg to 150 mg/day increments every other week until the assigned dose of 175, 225, or 400 mg/day based on patients' body weight to approximate a dosage of 6 mg/kg/day was reached, unless intolerance prevented increases. After titration, patients entered a 12-week stabilization period.

2.2 Dosing in Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy

Adults (17 Years of Age and Older)

The recommended total daily dose of topiramate as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome is 200 mg/day to 400 mg/day in two divided doses, and 400 mg/day in two divided doses as adjunctive treatment in adults with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Topiramate should be initiated at 25 mg/day to 50 mg/day, followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 mg/day to 50 mg/day every week. Titrating in increments of 25 mg/day every week may delay the time to reach an effective dose. Doses above 400 mg/day have not been shown to improve responses in adults with partial-onset seizures.

Pediatric Patients 2 to 16 Years of Age

The recommended total daily dose of topiramate as adjunctive therapy for pediatric patients 2 years to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is approximately 5 mg/kg/day to 9 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Titration should begin at 25 mg/day (or less, based on a range of 1 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day) nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day (administered in two divided doses), to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. The total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg/day.

2.3 Dosing for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine

The recommended total daily dose of topiramate as treatment for patients 12 years of age and older for the preventive treatment of migraine is 100 mg/day administered in two divided doses (Table 3). The recommended titration rate for topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine is as follows:

TOPAMAX Sprinkle Capsules may be swallowed whole or may be administered by carefully opening the capsule and sprinkling the entire contents on a small amount (teaspoon) of soft food. This drug/food mixture should be swallowed immediately and not chewed. It should not be stored for future use.

2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment

In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min/1.73 m²), one-half of the usual adult dose of TOPAMAX is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.6 Dosing in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis

To avoid rapid drops in topiramate plasma concentration during hemodialysis, a supplemental dose of TOPAMAX may be required.

### Topiramate titration to response: analysis of individualized therapy study (TRAITS) [^111nmVMb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the relationship between baseline seizure frequency and stabilized topiramate dosage and the effect of individualized treatment on tolerability in adults with partial-onset seizures receiving other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

Methods

In this 20-week, open-label trial, dosages of medications were adjusted according to clinical response. Dosage and seizure response data were analyzed for 2 groups defined by baseline seizure frequency: < 4 and ≥ 4 seizures per month.

Results

In the outcome evaluable population (n = 471), the mean ± SEM stable topiramate dosage was 303 ± 139 mg/d when baseline seizure frequency was < 4 seizures/month and 341 ± 153 mg/d when baseline seizure frequency was ≥ 4 seizures/month (p = 0.005). The most common adverse events were somnolence (8.5%), fatigue (7.3%), nausea (5.3%), and dizziness (5.0%). Cognitive complaints were reported by < 3% of patients. When concomitant AED dosages were reduced, 14% of patients discontinued topiramate due to adverse events compared with 23% if the concomitant AED dosage was unchanged or increased.

Conclusions

When clinicians individualize topiramate dosage according to clinical response, the stabilized topiramate dosage as add-on therapy is influenced by baseline seizure frequency. Topiramate tolerability is improved when dosages of concomitant AEDs are reduced.

### Topiramate reduces headache days in chronic migraine: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112zZKoW]. Cephalalgia (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate for the prevention of chronic migraine in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Chronic migraine is a common form of disabling headache presenting in headache subspecialty practice. Preventive treatments are essential for chronic migraine management, although there are few or no controlled empirical trial data on their use in this patient population. Topiramate is approved for the prophylaxis of migraine headache in adults. Patients (18–65 years) who experienced chronic migraine (defined as ≥ 15 monthly migraine days) for ≥ 3 months prior to trial entry and had ≥ 12 migraine days during the 4-week (28-day) baseline phase were randomized to topiramate or placebo for a 16-week, double-blind trial. Topiramate was titrated (25 mg weekly) to a target dose of 100 mg/day, allowing dosing flexibility from 50 to 200 mg/day, according to patient need. Existing migraine preventive treatments, except for antiepileptic drugs, were continued throughout the trial. The primary efficacy measure was the change in number of migraine days from the 28-day baseline phase to the last 28 days of the double-blind phase in the intent-to-treat population, which consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had one outcome assessment during the double-blind phase. Health-related quality of life was evaluated with the Migraine Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ, Version 2.1), the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaires, and tolerability was assessed by adverse event (AE) reports and early trial discontinuations. Eighty-two patients were screened. Thirty-two patients in the intent-to-treat population (mean age 46 years; 75% female) received topiramate (mean modal dose ± SD = 100 ± 17 mg/day) and 27 patients received placebo. Mean (± SD) baseline number of migraine days per 4 weeks was 15.5 ± 4.6 in the topiramate group and 16.4 ± 4.4 in the placebo group. Most patients (78%) met the definition for acute medication overuse at baseline. The mean duration of treatment was 100 and 92 days for topiramate- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Study completion rates for topiramate- and placebo-treated patients were 75% and 52%, respectively. Topiramate significantly reduced the mean number of monthly migraine days (± SD) by 3.5 ± 6.3, compared with placebo (-0.2 ± 4.7, P < 0.05). No significant intergroup differences were found for MSQ and HIT-6. MIDAS showed improvement with the topiramate treatment group (P = 0.042 vs. placebo). Treatment emergent adverse events were reported by 75% of topiramate-treated patients (37%, placebo). The most common AEs, paraesthesia, nausea, dizziness, dyspepsia, fatigue, anorexia and disturbance in attention, were reported by 53%, 9%, 6%, 6%, 6%, 6% and 6% of topiramate-treated patients, respectively, vs. 7%, 0%, 0%, 0%, 0%, 4% and 4% of placebo-treated patients. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrates that topiramate is effective and reasonably well tolerated when used for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine, even in the presence of medication overuse.

2.1 Dosing in Monotherapy Epilepsy

Adults and Pediatric Patients 10 Years of Age and Older

The recommended dose for topiramatemonotherapy in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older is 400 mg/day in two divided doses. The dose should be achieved by titration according to the following schedule (Table 1):

Table 1

Monotherapy Titration Schedule for Adults and Pediatric Patients 10 years and older

Pediatric Patients 2 to 9 Years of Age

Dosing in patients 2 to 9 years of age is based on weight. During the titration period, the initial dose of topiramateis 25 mg/day nightly for the first week. Based upon tolerability, the dosage can be increased to 50 mg/day (25 mg twice daily) in the second week. Dosage can be increased by 25 mg/day to 50 mg/day each subsequent week as tolerated. Titration to the minimum maintenance dose should be attempted over 5 weeks to 7 weeks of the total titration period. Based upon tolerability and clinical response, additional titration to a higher dose (up to the maximum maintenance dose) can be attempted at 25 mg/day to 50 mg/day weekly increments. The total daily dose should not exceed the maximum maintenance dose for each range of body weight (Table 2).

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^1154GcjZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Antiepileptic Drugs

Concomitant administration of phenytoin or carbamazepine with TOPAMAX resulted in a clinically significant decrease in plasma concentrations of topiramate when compared to TOPAMAX given alone. A dosage adjustment may be needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Concomitant administration of valproic acid and TOPAMAX has been associated with hypothermia and hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy. Examine blood ammonia levels in patients in whom the onset of hypothermia has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12, 5.14), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Other Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors

Concomitant use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with any other carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., zonisamide or acetazolamide) may increase the severity of metabolic acidosis and may also increase the risk of kidney stone formation. Therefore, patients given TOPAMAX concomitantly with another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor should be monitored particularly closely for the appearance or worsening of metabolic acidosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 CNS Depressants

Concomitant administration of TOPAMAX and alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Because of the potential of topiramate to cause CNS depression, as well as other cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric adverse reactions, TOPAMAX should be used with extreme caution if used in combination with alcohol and other CNS depressants.

7.4 Contraceptives

The possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy and increased breakthrough bleeding may occur in patients taking contraceptive products with TOPAMAX. Patients taking estrogen-containing or progestin-only contraceptives should be asked to report any change in their bleeding patterns. Contraceptive efficacy can be decreased even in the absence of breakthrough bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.5 Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)

Topiramate Cmaxand AUC increased when HCTZ was added to TOPAMAX. The clinical significance of this change is unknown. The addition of HCTZ to TOPAMAX may require a decrease in the TOPAMAX dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Topiramate slow dose titration: improved efficacy and tolerability [^115hmQ2s]. Pediatric Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Topiramate is an effective treatment for several types of seizures. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of slow topiramate dose titration as add-on therapy in childhood epilepsy. This investigation is a prospective open-label, single-center, add-on study in 22 children with a diagnosis of refractory epilepsy. Topiramate (dose 0.5–2 mg/kg/day) was titrated at 2-week intervals up to the recommended dose of 6–12 mg/kg/day. Seizure frequency rate reduction was significant, declining from 23 ± 5.1 seizures/week (mean ± S.E.M.) at baseline phase to 3.5 ± 1.2 seizures/week at the end of the 16-week stabilization phase (P < 0.001). After 16 weeks of stabilization, 19 patients (86%) had more than 50% seizure reduction. Seven patients (31%) were 100% seizure-free. Two patients (9%) manifested no improvement; only one patient (5%) did not tolerate the added drug and discontinued topiramate. One patient manifested severe side effects, whereas 21 patients experienced mild to moderate side effects mostly represented by somnolence, nervousness, and anorexia with or without weight loss. We conclude that slow dose titration improves efficacy and tolerability of topiramate as add-on therapy in the treatment in refractory epilepsy.

### Analysis of safety and tolerability data obtained from over 1, 500 patients receiving topiramate for migraine prevention in controlled trials [^113jibgz]. Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Topiramate is an effective and generally well-tolerated migraine preventive therapy, as shown in three large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled registration trials. Based upon efficacy/tolerability, topiramate 100 mg/day (50 mg BID) is the recommended target dose for most patients with migraine. To further assess the safety and tolerability of topiramate for migraine prevention, we analyzed safety data from 1,580 patients who participated in the three pivotal registration trials or an earlier pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Methods

The safety population consisted of all patients who took ≥ 1 dose of study medication during the double-blind phase (topiramate 50 mg/day [N = 235], 100 mg/day [N = 386], 200 mg/day [N = 514], or placebo [N = 445]). Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) reports, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests.

Results

Paresthesia was the most common topiramate-associated AE (35%, 51%, and 49% of patients receiving topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, or 200 mg/day, respectively [6% on placebo]). The most common topiramate-associated AE were generally mild or moderate in severity and occurred at consistently higher rates during the titration period, compared with the maintenance period of the double-blind phase. AEs leading to withdrawal from the recommended dose of topiramate 100 mg/day included paresthesia (8%), fatigue (5%), nausea (2%), and difficulty with concentration (2%). Serious AEs were infrequent, occurring in 2% of 1,135 topiramate-treated patients and 3% of 445 placebo-treated patients. Patients on topiramate experienced significant decreases in mean body weight compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Topiramate is generally safe and reasonably well tolerated for the prevention of migraine in adults. The most common topiramate-associated AEs were mild or moderate in severity and occurred more frequently during titration to target doses.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^112NbtZF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Topiramate produced a dose-related increased incidence of hyperammonemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

Treatment with topiramate for up to 1 year was associated with reductions in Z SCORES for length, weight, and head circumference [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6)].

In open-label, uncontrolled experience, increasing impairment of adaptive behavior was documented in behavioral testing over time in this population. There was a suggestion that this effect was dose-related. However, because of the absence of an appropriate control group, it is not known if this decrement in function was treatment-related or reflects the patient's underlying disease (e.g., patients who received higher doses may have more severe underlying disease) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

In this open-label, uncontrolled study, the mortality was 37 deaths/1000 patient years. It is not possible to know whether this mortality rate is related to topiramate treatment, because the background mortality rate for a similar, significantly refractory, young pediatric population (1–24 months) with partial epilepsy is not known.

2.2 Dosing in Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy

Adults (17 Years of Age and Older)

The recommended total daily dose of topiramate as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial onset seizures or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome is 200 to 400 mg/day in two divided doses, and 400 mg/day in two divided doses as adjunctive treatment in adults with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Topiramate should be initiated at 25 to 50 mg/day, followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 to 50 mg/day every week. Titrating in increments of 25 mg/day every week may delay the time to reach an effective dose. Doses above 400 mg/day have not been shown to improve responses in adults with partial-onset seizures.

Pediatric Patients 2 to 16 Years of Age

The recommended total daily dose of topiramate as adjunctive therapy for pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is approximately 5 to 9 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Titration should begin at 25 mg/day (or less, based on a range of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day) nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (administered in two divided doses), to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. The total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg/day.

2.3 Dosing for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine

The recommended total daily dose of topiramate as treatment for patients 12 years of age and older for the preventive treatment of migraine is 100 mg/day administered in two divided doses (Table 3). The recommended titration rate for topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine is as follows:

Dose and titration rate should be guided by clinical outcome. If required, longer intervals between dose adjustments can be used.

2.4 Administration Information

### Topiramate for alcohol dependence [^112Rybus]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence for the use of topiramate for alcohol dependence.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-June 2008) and Cochrane Database (2008, Issue 1) searches were conducted using the search terms alcohol dependence and topiramate. Bibliographies of selected articles were examined for additional data sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language, randomized, controlled trials evaluating topiramate for treatment of alcohol dependence in humans were selected for review. Three randomized controlled trials and 2 reanalyses were identified. Findings pertaining to efficacy and safety were extracted.

Data Synthesis

Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. These mechanisms may be significant in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Controlled trials have described the use of topiramate, titrated up to 300 mg daily, for alcohol dependence, and have reported decreases in drinking behavior and improvements in quality of life. Adverse effects associated with topiramate included abnormal skin sensation, dizziness, taste perversion, anorexia, pruritus, and difficulty with memory and concentration. In one of the reviewed trials, adverse effects did not account for an increased withdrawal rate. However, in another, when topiramate was titrated over a shortened time period, an increased withdrawal rate was seen. Recently, topiramate has been reported to increase suicide risk, primarily in patients with epilepsy. No cases of suicide were recorded in the alcohol dependence trials.

Conclusions

Results of published trials are promising, showing efficacy for drinking outcomes and quality of life as well as general safety. However, additional larger, longer-term trials are needed to establish the optimal patient type that would benefit most from topiramate treatment in addition to dosing, duration of treatment, and tolerability of topiramate for alcohol dependence. At this time, data are insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence.

Topiramate and naltrexone — alcohol use disorder pharmacotherapy — are supported for reducing alcohol consumption outcomes with distinct tolerability and implementation considerations. While topiramate is not approved for AUD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is recommended because of the moderate quality evidence for a significant reduction in heavy drinking and promotion of abstinence, and a pilot RCT in Veterans with AUD and co-occurring PTSD showed benefit associated with topiramate in reducing alcohol consumption, craving, and PTSD symptom severity. Side effects associated with naltrexone tend to be minimal with options for monthly injection or once-daily dosing, whereas topiramate may cause dizziness, negative cognitive effects, or weight loss. Oral naltrexone and topiramate are available as low cost generics, but injectable naltrexone has higher cost and feasibility concerns; topiramate may require multiple visits for adequate titration and tolerability assessment, and naltrexone's opioid blockade effect may preclude use in patients who require opioid pain medications. Despite these minor concerns and given the positive efficacy evidence for these medications, the Work Group decided upon a Strong for recommendation.

### Time course of adverse events most commonly associated with topiramate for migraine prevention [^114HnL7K]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The efficacy, safety and tolerability of topiramate has been demonstrated in three large multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. To characterize the time course of adverse events (AEs) that led to treatment discontinuation in ≥ 2% of patients who received topiramate 100 mg/day during three pivotal, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and 26-week trials. The pooled population comprised all randomized patients who reported safety data during the double-blind phase (topiramate 100 mg/day, n = 386; placebo n = 372), which consisted of a 4-week titration period and a 22-week maintenance period. Incidence, time to onset, and cumulative mean rate of AEs were assessed. Overall, AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 24.9% of patients receiving topiramate 100 mg/day and 11.0% receiving placebo (P < 0.001). AEs leading to discontinuation during the double-blind phase in ≥ 2% of patients included paresthesia (8.0% discontinued), any cognitive symptoms (7.3% discontinued), fatigue (4.7% discontinued), insomnia (3.4% discontinued), nausea (2.3% discontinued), loss of appetite, anxiety, and dizziness (2.1% discontinued because each AE). Most AEs began during the titration period. Paresthesia, any cognitive symptoms, nausea, and loss of appetite occurred at a higher rate in the topiramate group than in the placebo group (P < 0.01). AEs leading to discontinuation of topiramate are probably to occur during dose titration. If a patient has not experienced one of these AEs within the first 6 weeks of initiating topiramate 100 mg/day, these AEs are unlikely to occur.

### Topiramate in the treatment of chronic migraine [^116sxSFJ]. Cephalalgia (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of chronic migraine. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel-group study. Patients suffering from chronic migraine with analgesic overuse were randomly assigned in a 1: 1 ratio to receive topiramate or placebo. Following a baseline phase of eight weeks, the study drug was titrated in 25-mg increments over one week to 50 mg daily. Titration phase was followed by a 8-week maintenance phase. Number of days with headache during a 28-day period was the efficacy variable. At baseline, there was no difference in the number of days with headache between patients treated with topiramate and those treated with placebo (mean ± SD: 20.9 ± 3.2 and 20.8 ± 3.2, respectively). During the last 4 week-maintenance phase, topiramate-treated patients experienced a significantly lower 28-day headache frequency in comparison to those treated with placebo (mean number of days with headache ± SD: 8.1 ± 8.1 vs. 20.6 ± 3.4, P < 0.0007). Topiramate at low doses proved to be an effective therapeutic approach to reduce headache frequency in patients with chronic migraine and analgesic overuse.

### Phentermine and topiramate [^1118RJeH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Recommended Dosage and
Administration

The recommended dosage, titration, and administration of phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules are as follows:

Take phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules orally once daily in the morning with or without food. Avoid administration of phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules in the evening due to the possibility of insomnia.
The recommended starting dosage of phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules is one capsule (containing 3.75 mg of phentermine and 23 mg of topiramate) (3.75 mg/23 mg) taken orally once daily for 14 days; after 14 days increase to the recommended dosage of phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules 7.5 mg/46 mg orally once daily.
After 12 weeks of treatment with phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules 7.5 mg/46 mg, evaluate weight loss for adults or BMI reduction for pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. If an adult patient has not lost at least 3% of baseline body weight or a pediatric patient has not experienced a reduction of at least 3% of baseline BMI, increase the dosage to phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules 11.25 mg/69 mg orally once daily for 14 days; followed by an increase in the dosage to phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules 15 mg/92 mg orally once daily.
After 12 weeks of treatment with phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules 15 mg/92 mg, evaluate weight loss for adults or BMI reduction for pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. If an adult patient has not lost at least 5% of baseline body weight or a pediatric patient has not experienced a reduction of at least 5% of baseline BMI, discontinue phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)], as it is unlikely that the patient will achieve and sustain clinically meaningful weight loss with continued treatment.
Monitor the rate of weight loss in pediatric patients. If weight loss exceeds 2 lbs (0.9 kg)/week, consider dosage reduction.

### Topiramate monotherapy in the treatment of newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy [^111ptLpa]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of topiramate (TPM) as an adjunctive treatment for epilepsy has been established in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Clinical trials of antiepileptic monotherapy usually evaluate low and high doses of study drug or compare study drug with another active agent.

Objective

This article reviews available evidence for the use of TPM as monotherapy in patients with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy.

Methods

A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, SCISEARCH, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (all years) for reports of controlled trials of TPM monotherapy in patients with recently diagnosed (within the previous 3 years) epilepsy was conducted in January 2008 using the terms topiramate, epilepsy, newly diagnosed, recently diagnosed, and monotherapy. Identified trials were included in the review if they were published in peer-reviewed journals and enrolled ≥ 20 patients.

Results

Three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials met the criteria for inclusion in the review. In a comparison of TPM 50 and 500 mg/d, the higher dose was associated with significantly greater freedom from seizures at 6 months compared with the lower dose (54% vs 39%, respectively; P = 0.02). The time to first seizure was significantly associated with mean plasma TPM concentrations (P = 0.015). In a comparison of TPM 50 and 400 mg/d, the time to first seizure was significantly longer with the higher dose compared with the lower dose (P < 0.001, Kaplan-Meier analysis), and the probability of 12-month seizure freedom was significantly higher (76% vs 59%, respectively; P = 0.001). Again, the time to first seizure was significantly associated with mean plasma TPM concentrations (P = 0.029). In a comparative study of TPM 100 and 200 mg/d, carbamazepine 600 mg/d, and valproate 1250 mg/d, there was no significant difference in rates of 6-month seizure freedom with TPM 100 and 200 mg/d (49% and 44%, respectively), carbamazepine (44%), and valproate (44%). Adverse events in the 3 studies were similar between TPM dose groups, although the incidence generally increased with increasing doses, occurred early in treatment, and decreased with prolonged therapy. In a pooled analysis of the 3 trials, the most commonly occurring adverse events during dose titration were paresthesia (25%), fatigue (16%), dizziness (13%), somnolence (13%), and nausea (10%); the most frequent adverse events during maintenance therapy were headache (20%), decreased appetite (11%), and weight loss (11%).

Conclusion

In the 3 studies reviewed, TPM monotherapy was effective and generally well tolerated in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^1173gmxD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients

In pediatric epilepsy trials (adjunctive and monotherapy), the incidence of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was generally lower than that observed in adults. These reactions included psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, speech disorders/related speech problems, and language problems. The most frequently reported cognitive/neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric epilepsy patients during adjunctive therapy double-blind studies were somnolence and fatigue. The most frequently reported cognitive/neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric epilepsy patients in the 50 mg/day and 400 mg/day groups during the monotherapy double-blind study were headache, dizziness, anorexia, and somnolence.

In pediatric migraine patients, the incidence of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was increased in TOPAMAX-treated patients compared to placebo.

The risk for cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was dose-dependent, and was greatest at the highest dose (200 mg). This risk for cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was also greater in younger patients (6 to 11 years of age) than in older patients (12 to 17 years of age).

The most common cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reaction in these trials was difficulty with concentration/attention. Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed during titration and sometimes persisted for various durations after completion of titration.

The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was administered to adolescents (12 to 17 years) to assess the effects of topiramate on cognitive function at baseline and at the end of the Study 13 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Mean change from baseline in certain CANTAB tests suggests that topiramate treatment may result in psychomotor slowing and decreased verbal fluency.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate controlled release in the treatment of obese type 2 diabetic patients [^1138wr49]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study of the weight-loss efficacy and safety of a controlled-release (CR) formulation of topiramate in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with metformin.

Research Design and Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes, BMI ≥ 27 kg/m², A1C > 6.5 and < 11.0%, treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with metformin monotherapy were enrolled. Patients were randomized to placebo or topiramate CR titrated up to 175 mg/day. Treatment consisted of a 7-week titration phase followed by a 9-week maintenance phase.

Results

A total of 111 subjects were randomized and analyzed. By the end of week 16, patients in the placebo and topiramate groups lost 2.5 and 6.0 kg, which represented 2.3 and 5.8%, respectively, of their baseline body weight (P < 0.001 vs. placebo). A1C improved from a baseline of 7.4% in the placebo and 7.6% in the topiramate groups to 7.1 and 6.7%, respectively, representing a 0.4 and 0.9% reduction from baseline, respectively (P < 0.001 vs. placebo). Topiramate also significantly reduced blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion. Adverse events were predominantly neuropsychiatric or central and peripheral nervous system related.

Conclusions

Topiramate CR treatment produced significant weight loss and meaningful improvements in A1C and blood pressure in obese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and exercise or in combination with metformin. However, the central nervous system and psychiatric adverse event profile of topiramate CR makes it unsuitable for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^113rYKGo]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline — cocaine use disorder: topiramate is an anticonvulsant medication that is FDA-approved for the treatment of epilepsy and migraine, and the evidence for topiramate in cocaine use disorder outcomes is mixed; a meta-analysis demonstrated a higher rate of continuous stimulant abstinence over three weeks with topiramate versus placebo. For patients with cocaine use disorder, clinicians can consider prescribing topiramate to reduce cocaine use (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation), and clinicians can give topiramate additional consideration for patients with co-occurring alcohol use disorder (AUD), as this medication can also reduce alcohol consumption (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation), supported by the note that topiramate has been shown to reduce alcohol use and is utilized off-label for treatment of AUD. Safety and tolerability considerations include that the desirable effects of topiramate are somewhat offset by known side effects (eg, cognitive effects, paresthesia) and variable tolerability, which can be improved by slow titration, and that topiramate can cause appetite suppression, which is an important consideration when treating patients who are underweight or at risk of being underweight.

### Topiramate (trokendi XR) [^111ahgtr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials conducted in US (Study 11) or the US and Canada (Study 12) established the effectiveness of immediate-release topiramate in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, opthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventative medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either immediate-release topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day (twice the recommended daily dosage for migraine prophylaxis) or placebo, and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period.). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

### Randomized, concentration-controlled trial of topiramate in refractory focal epilepsy [^117CaF9n]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish the concentration response of topiramate in patients with refractory focal epilepsy.

Methods

Sixty-five patients with more than eight seizures during an 8-week baseline were randomized to three prespecified plasma levels (low, 6 micromol/L [2 mg/L]; medium, 31 micromol/L [10.5 mg/L]; and high, 56 micromol/L [19 mg/L]). Topiramate treatment was titrated to one of the prespecified plasma levels during an 8-week titration period, followed by a 12-week observation period.

Results

The overall median (25th to 75th percentile) reduction in seizures during the observation compared with baseline was 50% (9.5 to 90%). In the individual groups, the median reduction was as follows: low, 39% (13 to 70%); medium, 85% (41 to 96%); and high, 39% (2.0 to 81%). The primary outcome of the trial was the comparison of seizure reduction (Mann-Whitney U test) between the low and the medium group (p = 0.03). Comparisons between the other groups were as follows: medium vs high (p = 0.05) and low vs high (p = 0.81). Psychiatric adverse events and adverse events related to the CNS were the most frequently encountered. Most adverse events showed concentration response, particularly between low and medium levels.

Conclusions

Patients assigned to the medium plasma level (31 micromol/L [10.5 mg/L]) had the best seizure outcome. Patients in the medium and high groups experienced more adverse events than patients in the low group. Optimal treatment response is thus most likely found at plasma concentrations higher than 6 micromol/L (2 mg/L), but no further increase in efficacy seems to occur at concentrations above 31 micromol/L (10.5 mg/L).

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^116FY9Gv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Along with guidelines on how to titrate and when to stop using phentermine/topiramate ER, the FDA also impose a Risk Evaluation Management Strategy programme, intended to help ensure that the medication is used properly 38. This is because of the teratogenic risk associated with topiramate: foetuses exposed to topiramate in the first trimester have an increased risk of oral clefts (cleft lip with or without cleft palate) 38. Phentermine/topiramate ER is contraindicated in pregnancy (category X) 38. It is only available through certified pharmacies, which ensure recipients are aware of the risk and take appropriate precaution.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has raised concerns regarding the long‐term safety of phentermine/topiramate ER because of potential adverse cardiovascular, psychiatric, cognitive and teratogenic effects 36.

Lorcaserin

In 2012, lorcaserin (brand name Belviq®), a 5‐hydroxytriptamine (serotonin; 5‐HT) 2C receptor agonist, was also approved for weight management in the United States. Lorcaserin is used at a dose of 10 mg twice daily and taken independently of meals 39. In contrast to phentermine/topiramate ER, no dose titration of lorcaserin is required and no Risk Evaluation Management Strategy programme is in place for this medication. There is a recommended time point in clinical management to discontinue the medication if it has not been effective for an individual. If the recipient has not lost ≥ 5% of their weight 3 months after having initiated lorcaserin, they are considered a non‐responder and the medication should be stopped, as it is unlikely they will achieve and sustain clinically meaningful weight loss with continued treatment 39.

2.1 Dosing in Monotherapy Epilepsy

Adults and Pediatric Patients 10 Years of Age and Older

The recommended dose for EPRONTIA monotherapy in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older is 400 mg/day in two divided doses. The dose should be achieved by titration according to the following schedule (Table 1):

Pediatric Patients 2 to 9 Years of Age

Dosing in patients 2 to 9 years of age is based on weight. During the titration period, the initial dose of EPRONTIA is 25 mg/day nightly for the first week. Based upon tolerability, the dosage can be increased to 50 mg/day (25 mg twice daily) in the second week. Dosage can be increased by 25–50 mg/day each subsequent week as tolerated. Titration to the minimum maintenance dose should be attempted over 5–7 weeks of the total titration period. Based upon tolerability and clinical response, additional titration to a higher dose (up to the maximum maintenance dose) can be attempted at 25–50 mg/day weekly increments. The total daily dose should not exceed the maximum maintenance dose for each range of body weight (Table 2).

### Efficacy and tolerability of topiramate 200 mg / D in the prevention of migraine with / without aura in adults: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week pilot study [^113M363b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Several large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have found topiramate (TPM) to be effective and generally well tolerated as a preventive therapy for migraine.

Objective

This paper evaluates efficacy and safety data from a pilot study of TPM 200 mg/d as preventive therapy in adult subjects with a history of migraine with or without aura.

Methods

The pilot study had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive TPM 200 mg/d or placebo. The double-blind treatment phase consisted of an 8-week titration period (25 mg/d for the first week, followed by weekly increases of 25 mg) and a 12-week maintenance period. The primary efficacy measure was the change in mean monthly migraine frequency. Additional measures were the median percent reduction in monthly migraine frequency and the proportion of responders (those with ≥ 50%, ≥ 75%, or 100% reduction in monthly migraine frequency).

Results

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 211 subjects (138 TPM, 73 placebo; mean [SD] mean weight, 76.7 [18.7] kg). Of 45 subjects who discontinued the study in the TPM group, 21 discontinued during the titration period, compared with 3 of 13 subjects who discontinued in the placebo group. When the efficacy data were assessed using the per-protocol, analysis-of-covariance model, TPM 200 mg/d was not associated with a significant reduction in mean monthly migraine frequency compared with placebo. A post hoc analysis using a Poisson regression model in the ITT population suggested that TPM significantly reduced mean monthly migraine frequency compared with placebo (P = 0.04). A significantly larger proportion of TPM-treated subjects had a ≥ 75% reduction in monthly migraine frequency compared with placebo (P = 0.03). At least 1 adverse event was reported by 90.0% and 69.9% of the TPM and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects in the TPM group were paresthesia (45%), dizziness (16%), fatigue (16%), nausea (14%), and weight loss (14%). Most treatment-emergent AEs were rated mild or moderate in severity. Of 3 serious AEs (depression, abdominal pain, leg pain) occurring during the trial, none were considered related to either TPM or placebo.

Conclusion

In this pilot study, mean monthly migraine frequency did not differ significantly between TPM and placebo.

### Topiramate in posttraumatic stress disorder: preliminary clinical observations [^112oCKBz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious and debilitating mental condition that affects a significant proportion of the general population at some time in their lives. To date, however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved only 1 pharmacologic treatment for this indication. Additional effective therapies are urgently required to control the destructive symptoms experienced by individuals with PTSD. This article reviews the effects of the novel antiepileptic drug topiramate on 3 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for chronic PTSD. In these previously treatment-refractory patients, topiramate had a marked effect: reducing and even eliminating trauma-related intrusive memories and nightmares and normalizing depressed mood. Adverse events were effectively controlled with careful drug titration and discontinuation of concomitant therapies. These findings, together with observations in more than 30 additional patients (reported elsewhere), suggest that further study of topiramate as a treatment for PTSD is warranted.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^113YbGyQ]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Phentermine–topiramate extended-release (ER) — special clinical considerations and dosing: Phentermine–topiramate ER is available in capsules with doses of 3.75 mg/23 mg, 7.5 mg/46 mg, 11.25 mg/69 mg, and 15 mg/92 mg; initiation uses the starter dose of 3.75 mg/23 mg taken once daily for 14 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 7.5 mg/46 mg daily; after 12 weeks, if the patient has not lost at least 3% of their body weight, consider discontinuation or further dose escalation; for escalation, titrate up to 11.25 mg/69 mg daily for 14 days, followed by the maintenance maximum dose of 15 mg/92 mg daily; although 7.5 mg/46 mg is considered the standard dose, our analysis demonstrated superior efficacy for the 15 mg/92 mg option, and we recommend this as the target dose, as long as the balance of benefit and risk is favorable for a given individual patient. Caution is advised and phentermine–topiramate ER should be avoided in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension; pivotal phase 3 trials enrolled subjects up to the age of 70 years with no high-quality data to guide geriatric use; it should also be avoided in patients treated with, or within 14 days, of monoamine oxidase inhibitors; due to concerns for arrhythmias and seizures, medications with phentermine should not be used in patients with untreated hyperthyroidism. For pregnancy-related safety, fetal exposure to topiramate during the first trimester is associated with an increased risk of oral clefts, patients with child-bearing potential should be counseled on teratogenic risks and contraception, and monitoring with monthly pregnancy tests can be considered. Because topiramate has carbonic anhydrase inhibitor properties that can induce metabolic acidosis and urine pH changes, there may be an increased risk of kidney stones; caution is advised in patients with a history of significant nephrolithiasis, and consideration should be given to periodic monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels during long-term treatment. Due to the potential for insomnia, it is recommended that phentermine–topiramate ER be taken early in the day; commonly reported adverse effects include cognitive impairment, constipation, dry mouth, palpitations, paresthesias, dysgeusia, and irritability; and phentermine–topiramate ER is classified as a schedule IV-controlled substance.

### Topiramate monotherapy in epilepsy and migraine prevention [^112YDNVy]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purposes of this review were to assess the efficacy of topiramate as monotherapy for epilepsy and migraine prevention, describe how it should be used, and give clinical advice on how to manage the practical aspects of dosing, titration, and possible adverse events in these 2 indications.

Methods

We searched the PubMed and BIOSIS databases using the key words topiramate, epilepsy, and migraine from the year 1987 onward, and subsequently focused the search on larger controlled trial studies of topiramate as monotherapy.

Results

Studies have evaluated the use of topiramate as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset and generalized seizures and in the prevention of migraine. In a randomized study, 75% of epilepsy patients treated with 400 mg/d topiramate remained seizure free at 1 year. Patients in the same study treated with a lower dose of topiramate (50 mg/d) also experienced notable seizure reductions, with 59% of patients free of seizures at 1 year. A comparison trial of topiramate (100 or 200 mg/d), valproate, and carbamazepine found that topiramate was associated with a similar time to first posttreatment seizure as the other 2 agents (P = NS). Trials of topiramate monotherapy in migraine prevention found that 100 mg/d was associated with a ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine frequency in 49% to 54% of patients. The migraine prevention trials typically used a starting dose of 25 mg/d, with weekly increases of 25 mg and an initial monotherapy target dose of 100 mg/d. The most common adverse events associated with topiramate are paresthesia, weight loss, and other centrally mediated symptoms, many of which may be ameliorated by proper titration and dosing and by good communication between physician and patient.

Conclusions

Data from controlled trials suggest that 100 mg/d topiramate as monotherapy is effective in the treatment of partial-onset and generalized seizures and in the prevention of migraine.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Headache — topiramate for prevention of episodic and chronic migraine — We suggest topiramate for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine (Weak for). Evidence from systematic reviews showed statistically significant improvements in monthly migraine days, including -1.11 in episodic migraine (n = 1,903) with a number needed to treat (NNT) of seven (50% responder rate) and number needed to harm (NNH) of 12, and -2.30 in chronic migraine compared with placebo; studies compared various doses (50–200 mg per day across studies), examined the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQL) and ≥ 50% responder rate, and had a mean duration of 19 weeks, with topiramate significantly reducing the frequency of headaches and improving the ≥ 50% responder rate. Compared with placebo, topiramate has greater odds of adverse events (AEs), including nausea, dizziness, and somnolence (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.06–1.73) and withdrawal because of AEs (OR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.56, 2.78); providers are encouraged to titrate slowly when starting a patient on topiramate to reduce the risk of side effects, including cognitive side effects. Comorbidity considerations are noted: topiramate might be effective for patients with concurrent obesity, epilepsy, or alcohol use disorder, but might be less appropriate for patients with renal calculi, low weight, eating disorders, and baseline cognitive difficulties; topiramate also has a risk of causing metabolic acidosis.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) — Topiramate (Topamax) is FDA approved ≥ 2y for epilepsy and ≥ 12 y for migraines and is used off label for weight management, with titration of 1st wk: 25 mg PO daily, then increase to 50 mg/day and 50 mg BID, with possible increases by 25 mg per dose. Pediatric weight effect includes 4.9% on topiramate 75 mg daily for at least 3 months. Pediatric MASLD reports include a case where ALT improved from 159 to 47 after 14 months on topiramate 50 mg BID with lifestyle management and total weight loss of 9.1 kg with BMI z-score improvement of 0.25; a multicenter cohort of 32 children reported significant BMI z-score and transaminase decreases after 3–6 months, with 43% achieving liver disease regression defined as ALT normalization or ≥ 50% ALT reduction from baseline. Adverse effects include paresthesia, dysgeusia, fatigue, difficulty with concentration/attention and memory, metabolic acidosis, with cautions including acute myopia, secondary angle closure glaucoma, suicidal behavior/ideation, and metabolic acidosis.

### Topiramate tablet (Topiramate) [^11725hfX]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

In the add-on epilepsy controlled trials (using rapid titration such as 100–200 mg/day weekly increments), the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 42% for 200 mg/day, 41% for 400 mg/day, 52% for 600 mg/day, 56% for 800 and 1,000 mg/day, and 14% for placebo. These dose-related adverse reactions began with a similar frequency in the titration or in the maintenance phase, although in some patients the events began during titration and persisted into the maintenance phase. Some patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions in the titration phase had a dose-related recurrence of these reactions in the maintenance phase.

In the monotherapy epilepsy controlled trial, the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg/day and 26% for 400 mg/day.

Psychiatric/Behavioral Disturbances

Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (depression or mood) were dose-related for the epilepsy population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Somnolence/Fatigue

Somnolence and fatigue were the adverse reactions most frequently reported during clinical trials of topiramate for adjunctive epilepsy. For the adjunctive epilepsy population, the incidence of somnolence did not differ substantially between 200 mg/day and 1,000 mg/day, but the incidence of fatigue was dose-related and increased at dosages above 400 mg/day. For the monotherapy epilepsy population in the 50 mg/day and 400 mg/day groups, the incidence of somnolence was dose-related (9% for the 50 mg/day group and 15% for the 400 mg/day group) and the incidence of fatigue was comparable in both treatment groups (14% each).

2.2 Dosing in Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy

Adults (17 Years of Age and Older)

The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome is 200 mg to 400 mg orally once daily, and with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures is 400 mg orally once daily. Initiate therapy at 25 mg to 50 mg once daily followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg every week. Titrating in increments of 25 mg/day every week may delay the time to reach an effective dose. Doses above 400 mg/day have not been shown to improve responses in adults with partial-onset seizures.

Pediatric Patients 2 to 16 Years of Age

The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as adjunctive therapy for pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is approximately 5 mg/kg to 9 mg/kg orally once daily. Begin titration at 25 mg once daily (or less, based on a range of 1 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day) given nightly for the first week. Subsequently, increase the dosage at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. The total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg/day.

2.3 Dosing for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine

The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as treatment for the preventive treatment of migraine in patients 12 years of age and older is 100 mg once daily. The recommended titration rate for QUDEXY XR for the preventive treatment of migraine is as follows:

Dose and titration rate should be guided by clinical outcome. If required, longer intervals between dose adjustment can be used.

2.4 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment

In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min/1.73 m²), one-half of the usual adult dose of QUDEXY XR is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Topiramate — posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related nightmares in adults — has observational evidence detailing dosing and outcomes: titration began at 12.5 to 25 mg daily with increases of 25 to 50 mg every 3 to 4 days until response or intolerance; among full responders, 91% had a final dosage of 100 mg/day or less (range 12.5 to 500 mg/day), and nightmares were reduced in 79% with full suppression in 50%, while nine patients discontinued for adverse effects. In a 12-week case series of 33 civilian outpatients with PTSD using the same titration, Ninety-four percent of patients with nightmares at baseline reported full cessation at the end of week 4, with full cessation at dosages ≤ 200 mg/day and partial responses at dosages ≤ 50 mg/day; although there were no serious adverse events, 21% discontinued due to significant adverse events. In 29 male subjects with combat-related PTSD receiving adjuvant topiramate starting at 50 mg/day, the proportion with nightmares decreased to 60% at 8 weeks (P < .001), and nightmare frequency declined from 3.97 ± 2.10 nights/week to 2.07 ± 2.28 nights/week (P = 0.0043); two serious adverse events occurred and five patients had other transient side effects.

2.2 Dosing in Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy

Adults (17 Years of Age and Older)

The recommended total daily dose of EPRONTIA as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial onset seizures or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome is 200 to 400 mg/day in two divided doses, and 400 mg/day in two divided doses as adjunctive treatment in adults with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. EPRONTIA should be initiated at 25 to 50 mg/day, followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 to 50 mg/day every week. Titrating in increments of 25 mg/day every week may delay the time to reach an effective dose. Doses above 400 mg/day have not been shown to improve responses in adults with partial-onset seizures.

Pediatric Patients 2 to 16 Years of Age

The recommended total daily dose of EPRONTIA as adjunctive therapy for pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is approximately 5 to 9 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Titration should begin at 25 mg/day (or less, based on a range of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day) nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (administered in two divided doses), to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. The total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg/day.

2.3 Dosing for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine

The recommended total daily dose of EPRONTIA as treatment for patients 12 years of age and older for the preventive treatment of migraine is 100 mg/day administered in two divided doses (Table 3). The recommended titration rate for EPRONTIA for the preventive treatment of migraine is as follows:

Dose and titration rate should be guided by clinical outcome. If required, longer intervals between dose adjustments can be used.

2.4 Administration Information

EPRONTIA can be taken without regard to meals.

A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device.

### Topiramate in the prophylaxis of pediatric migraine: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^116vCgs3]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Several large, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of topiramate in migraine prophylaxis in adults. However, there are limited data about the use of topiramate in migraine prophylaxis in children. We conducted this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate in the prophylaxis of migraine in children. A total of 44 children with migraine were randomized using random number tables to receive topiramate (n = 22) or placebo (n = 22). The total duration of treatment was 4 months, including a baseline period of 1 month during which topiramate was titrated weekly in 25-mg increments to 100 mg/d in 2 divided doses or to the maximum tolerated dose. The titration was followed by a 12-week maintenance phase during which topiramate was given in 2 divided doses. The primary outcome measures were the reduction in the mean migraine frequency and severity of headache. Secondary outcome measures included the number of times analgesics were required for a month for acute attacks and functional disability. Functional disability was measured by comparing school absenteeism and Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (PedMIDAS). The decrease in mean (± SD) monthly migraine frequency from 16.14 (± 9.35) at baseline to 4.27 (± 1.95) at the end of the study in the topiramate group was significantly greater as compared with a decrease from 13.38 (± 7.78) to 7.48 (± 5.94) at the end of the study in the placebo group (P = 0.025). The difference in number of rescue medications used for topiramate and placebo was not statistically significant (P = 0.059). There was a statistically significant decrease in the PedMIDAS score from 50.66 (± 32.1) to 10.42 (± 6.39) at the end of the study in the topiramate group compared with a decrease from 42.66 (± 27.5) to 23.7 (± 19.1) at the end of 4 months in the placebo group (P = 0.003). The decrease in school absenteeism was significant with topiramate compared with placebo (P = 0.002). Weight loss, decreased concentration in school, sedation, and parasthesias were important side effects with topiramate. Most of these side effects were mild to moderate and were not significant enough to cause dropout from the study.

### Topiramate monotherapy in newly diagnosed epilepsy in children and adolescents [^112SG1CS]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

A double-blind, dose-controlled study evaluated topiramate as monotherapy in 470 patients with newly diagnosed (≤ 3 months) epilepsy or epilepsy relapse in the absence of therapy. In addition to having at least 2 lifetime-unprovoked seizures, patients had 1 or 2 partial-onset seizures or generalized-onset tonic-clonic seizures during a 3-month retrospective baseline. The trial included a large cohort (N = 151, 32%) of children and adolescents 6 to 15 years of age. Eligible patients were randomized to treatment groups in which topiramate was titrated to target maintenance dosages of either 400 mg/day (n = 77) or 50 mg/day (n = 74). Patients were followed for at least 6 months. Based on Kaplan-Meier analyses, the primary efficacy endpoint of time to first seizure favored the higher topiramate dose in both the overall population and the cohort of children/adolescents. The probability that children/adolescents remaining in the study were seizure free at 6 months was 78% in the 50-mg target dose group and 90% with the higher dose. At 12 months, the probability of being seizure free was 62% and 85%, respectively. The incidence of treatment-limiting adverse events was 4% in the 50-mg target dose group and 14% in the group assigned to 400 mg as a target dose. The most common adverse events, excluding typical childhood illnesses, were headache, appetite decrease, weight loss, somnolence, dizziness, concentration/attention difficulty, and paresthesia. As shown in this subset analysis, topiramate is effective and well tolerated as monotherapy in children and adolescents.

Adult Patients

Cognitive Related Dysfunction

Rapid titration rate and higher initial dose were associated with higher incidences of cognitive-related dysfunction.

In adult epilepsy adjunctive controlled trials, which used rapid titration (100 to 200 mg/day weekly increments) and target immediate-release topiramate doses of 200 mg to 1000 mg/day, 56% of patients in the 800 mg/day and 1000 mg/day dose groups experienced cognitive-related dysfunction compared to approximately 42% of patients in the 200 to 400 mg/day groups and 14% for placebo. In this rapid titration regimen, these dose-related adverse reactions began in the titration or in the maintenance phase, and in some patients these events began during titration and persisted into the maintenance phase.

In the monotherapy epilepsy-controlled trial conducted with immediate-release topiramate, the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg per day and 26% for 400 mg per day.

In the 6-month controlled trials for the preventive treatment of migraine, which used a slower titration regimen (25 mg/day weekly increments), the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg/day, 22% for 100 mg/day (the recommended dose), 28% for 200 mg/day, and 10% for placebo. Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed during titration and sometimes persisted after completion of titration.

Psychiatric/Behavioral Disturbances

Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g., depression, mood) were dose-related for both the adjunctive epilepsy and migraine populations treated with topiramate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Somnolence/Fatigue

Somnolence and fatigue were the adverse reactions most frequently reported during clinical trials of topiramate for adjunctive epilepsy. For the adjunctive epilepsy population, the incidence of fatigue appeared dose-related. For the monotherapy epilepsy population, the incidence of somnolence was dose-related. For the migraine population, the incidences of both somnolence and fatigue were dose-related and more common in the titration phase.

### Efficacy and safety of topiramate in combination with metformin in the treatment of obese subjects with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115AU6Sw]. International Journal of Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of topiramate in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin.

Design

This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All subjects received a non-pharmacological program of diet, exercise and behavioral modification throughout the study; the assigned diet was 600 kcal/day less than the subject's individually calculated energy expenditure. After a 6-week single-blind placebo run-in, subjects were randomized to placebo, topiramate 96 mg/day or topiramate 192 mg/day. Following an 8-week titration period, subjects remained on their assigned dose for 52 weeks. However, the sponsor ended the study early in order to develop a new controlled-release formulation with the potential to enhance tolerability and simplify dosing in this patient population. A total of 646 obese men and women (age: 18–75 years, body mass index: 27–50 kg/m(2)) with an established history of type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled by metformin monotherapy were randomized. Efficacy was assessed in a pre-determined modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population of 307 subjects whose randomization date would have allowed them to complete 24 weeks on study medication before the announcement of study termination.

Measurements

Joint primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in weight and change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) from baseline to week 24.

Results

Subjects in the placebo, topiramate 96 mg/day and topiramate 192 mg/day groups lost 1.7%, 4.5% (P < 0.001) and 6.5% (P < 0.001), respectively, of their baseline body weight and had absolute decreases in HbA(1c) of 0.1%, 0.4% (P < 0.001) and 0.6% (P < 0.001) (MITT, last observation carried forward). Topiramate-treated subjects also experienced statistically significant decreases in systolic blood pressure. Most common adverse events were paresthesia and events related to the central nervous system.

Conclusions

Topiramate was effective for weight reduction and improvement in glycemic control in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin monotherapy. Further study in obese diabetics is warranted.

Methods and Procedures

Design overview

A double-blind, parallel-group design was used with three arms: placebo (n = 514), PHEN/TPM CR 3.75/23 mg (n = 241), and PHEN/TPM CR 15/92 mg (n = 512). After screening, all eligible patients underwent a blinded 4-week postrandomization titration period and 52 weeks at randomized dose. All interventions were added to a standardized lifestyle program. Total treatment duration was 56 weeks.

Settings and participants

Subjects were enrolled beginning in November 2007 at 91 US sites, consisting of clinical practices, clinical trial sites, and academic centers. The last subject completed all study visits in May 2009. At every site, institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Eligibility criteria included age 18–70 years, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² (no upper limit), triglycerides ≤ 200 mg/dl with treatment of 0–1 lipid-lowering medication, BP ≤ 140/90 mm Hg with treatment of 0–2 antihypertensive medications, and fasting serum glucose level ≤ 110 mg/dl. For detailed entry criteria, see Supplementary Appendix 3 online.

Randomization and interventions

Patients were randomized and stratified by gender via a pseudo-random number generator constrained to a 2:1:2 allocation ratio. This allocation ratio was designed to increase the power of the safety analysis by having more patients receive placebo and by having the highest dose used. All study participants, study physicians, site staff, and sponsor representatives involved in the study conduct were blinded to patient assignment until after the trial was complete. There was an independent, unblinded data and safety monitoring board. The study drug and placebo were visually indistinguishable. Treatment was initiated with a 4-week blinded titration period (typically recommended with clinical topiramate use to minimize AEs), starting with PHEN/TPM CR 3.75/23 or matched placebo and thereafter increased weekly by 3.75/23 mg increments to the assigned dose. Following titration to assigned dose, patients were evaluated for an additional 52 weeks with monthly clinic visits. All patients were provided with standardized lifestyle counseling, based on the LEARN Manual and advised to follow a 500-kcal daily reduction in dietary intake, increased water consumption, and increased physical activity.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^113Tukfe]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

There are four separate doses available for phentermine/topiramate ER combination therapy, but only two are recommended for long‐term treatment (7.5 mg phentermine/46 mg topiramate ER once daily and 15 mg/92 mg once daily). The remaining two doses of 3.75 mg/23 mg and 11.25 mg/69 mg once daily are titration doses 38. When prescribing this drug, a 2‐week course of 3.75 mg/23 mg is recommended before the recipient is placed on a 'mid‐range' maintenance dose of 7.5 mg/46 mg. It is recommended that the drug is either discontinued or escalated where people have not lost 3% of their body weight after 3 months on 7.5 mg/46 mg. At the mid‐dose of 7.5 mg/46 mg, the medication can simply be stopped without titration. At the maximum dose of 15 mg/92 mg, drug discontinuation should be tapered by taking a dose every other day for ≥ 1 week before stopping treatment (in those who have not lost 5% body weight with the maximum dose 38). The concept of identifying responders and non‐responders and acting accordingly is relatively new in the obesity field, and phentermine/topiramate ER was the first obesity medication for which the FDA incorporated non‐responder recommendations into the package insert. The Endocrine Society guidelines also include recommendations that alternative weight loss treatments are considered for non‐responders or in the case of safety or tolerability issues 18.

### Cessation versus continuation of 6-month migraine preventive therapy with topiramate (PROMPT): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116dr8zQ]. The Lancet: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of preventive therapy for migraine is often recommended for only 6–9 months, but no randomised, placebo-controlled trials have investigated migraine frequency after the end of prophylaxis. We assessed the effects of discontinuation of topiramate after a treatment period of 6 months.

Methods

818 patients who have migraines were enrolled from 88 clinics in 21 countries. After a 4–8-week lead-in period, patients received topiramate in a 26-week open-label phase. Daily dose was increased from 25 mg to 100 mg in steps of 25 mg every week; the dose could be adjusted further in the range 50–200 mg/day, but was stable for the final 4 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to continue this dose or switch to placebo for a 26-week double-blind phase. The primary endpoint was the difference in number of days with migraine during the last 4 weeks of the double-blind phase compared with the last 4 weeks of the open-label phase. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2005–000321–29.

Findings

559 patients (68.3%) completed the open-label phase; 514 entered the double-blind phase and were assigned to topiramate (n = 255) or placebo (n = 259). The mean increase in number of migraine days was greater in the placebo group (1.19 days in 4 weeks, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.66; p < 0.0001) than in the topiramate group (0.10, -0.36 to 0.56; p = 0.5756; mean difference between groups -1.09, -1.75 to -0.43; p = 0.0011) Patients in the placebo group had a greater number of days on acute medication than did those in the topiramate group (mean difference between groups -0.95, -1.49 to -0.41; p = 0.0007). Quality of life, as assessed by the MIDAS questionnaire, fell in the placebo group but remained stable in the topiramate group. Patients were more satisfied with the efficacy of topiramate than with that of placebo, whereas satisfaction with tolerability was similar in both treatment groups.

Interpretation

Sustained benefit was reported after discontinuation of topiramate, although number of migraine days did increase. These findings suggest that patients should be treated for 6 months, with the option to continue to 12 months in some patients.

Adult Patients

Cognitive-Related Dysfunction

Rapid titration rate and higher initial dose were associated with higher incidences of cognitive-related dysfunction.

In adult adjunctive epilepsy controlled trials, which used rapid titration (100–200 mg/day weekly increments), and target immediate-release topiramate doses of 200 mg – 1000 mg/day, 56% of patients in the 800 mg/day and 1000 mg/day dose groups experienced cognitive-related dysfunction compared to approximately 42% of patients in the 200–400 mg/day groups and 14% for placebo. In this rapid titration regimen, these dose-related adverse reactions began in the titration or in the maintenance phase, and in some patients these events began during titration and persisted into the maintenance phase.

In the monotherapy epilepsy controlled trial conducted with immediate-release topiramate, the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg per day and 26% for 400 mg per day.

In the 6-month controlled trials for the preventive treatment of migraine with immediate release topiramate using a slower titration regimen (25mg per day weekly increments), the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg per day, 22% for 100 mg per day (the recommended dose), 28% for 200 mg per day and 10% for placebo. Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed during titration and sometimes persisted after completion of titration.

Psychiatric/Behavioral Disturbances

Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g., depression, mood) were dose-related for both the adjunctive epilepsy and migraine populations treated with topiramate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Somnolence/Fatigue

Somnolence and fatigue were the adverse reactions most frequently reported during clinical trials of topiramate for adjunctive epilepsy. For the adjunctive epilepsy population, the incidence of fatigue was dose-related. For the monotherapy epilepsy population, the incidence of somnolence was dose-related. For the migraine population, the incidences of both somnolence and fatigue were dose-related and more common in the titration phase.

### Effect of cotherapy reduction on tolerability of epilepsy add-on therapy: a randomized controlled trial [^112kBBsk]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Adverse effects are the most common cause for failure of an antiepileptic drug (AED), especially when an AED is added to existing therapy. With the increased drug load, it may not be possible to titrate the newly added AED to effective doses. Reducing the dosage of AED cotherapy as the new drug is introduced may improve tolerability.

Objective

To evaluate reduction of AED cotherapy as a strategy to improve tolerability and patient retention when a new AED is added to existing therapy.

Methods

In a 20-week, randomized, open-label study, topiramate was initiated as add-on therapy in adults and adolescents (≥ 12 y of age) with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures. Patients were randomized to receive treatment in which adverse events could be managed by adjustments in AED cotherapy (flex-dose group) or treatment in which AED cotherapy dosages remained fixed (fixed-dose group). Topiramate could be adjusted as needed in both groups. In the flex-dose group, patients exited randomized treatment when topiramate was discontinued. In the fixed-dose group, patients exited when AED cotherapy was reduced due to adverse events or when topiramate was discontinued. The primary study outcome was the percentage of patients exiting randomized treatment due to adverse events.

Results

The flex-dose group comprised 297 patients; 302 patients were in the fixed-dose group. Significantly fewer patients in the flex-dose group exited the study due to adverse events (16% vs 23% in the fixed-dose group; p = 0.02). In the flex-dose group, 10% (17 of 168) of patients discontinued topiramate due to adverse events after AED cotherapy was reduced versus 22% (29 of 129) when AED cotherapy was not reduced.

Conclusions

Reduction of AED cotherapy is a useful strategy to improve tolerability and retention when topiramate is initiated as adjunctive therapy.
