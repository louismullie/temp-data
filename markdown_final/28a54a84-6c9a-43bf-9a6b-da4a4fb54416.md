## Question

anca screen with reflex negative meaning

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "ANCA screen with reflex negative" means on a lab report and how to interpret it in the context of suspected ANCA-associated vasculitis and related differentials. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the laboratory algorithm behind ANCA screening and what triggers reflex testing. Then, I should verify how different labs implement IIF versus high-quality antigen-specific immunoassays. Next, I will interpret what a negative reflex cascade implies for disease probability, including sensitivity and specificity limits. After that, I should consider clinical context and pre-test probability to guide next steps, including when biopsy is indicated. Finally, I will review pitfalls, seronegative disease, and when repeat or alternative testing is reasonable, ensuring all of this is anchored to current consensus recommendations and performance data.

> Let me first confirm the testing framework. Traditionally, an ANCA screen refers to indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on ethanol-fixed neutrophils to detect a c-ANCA or p-ANCA pattern, with reflex antigen-specific assays for PR3 and MPO performed only if the screen is positive, but the 2017 international consensus now allows high-quality PR3- and MPO-specific immunoassays to be used as primary screening in appropriately selected patients, which some laboratories have adopted as their standard algorithm [^117SH3tP] [^112QW8Xx] [^111vG1Pn].

> Wait, let me verify the phrase itself. "ANCA screen with reflex negative" most commonly means the initial screen was negative and therefore no PR3/MPO confirmatory assays were triggered, resulting in an overall negative interpretation for clinically significant ANCA, although I should acknowledge that some laboratories report "screen positive, PR3/MPO negative" as "atypical ANCA" or "unconfirmed" when minor antigens are suspected, which is a different scenario than what is implied here [^117SH3tP] [^112QW8Xx] [^114PT9Fc].

> Hold on, I should map the algorithm explicitly to avoid confusion. If the IIF screen is negative, the cascade stops and the report reads negative; if the IIF screen is positive, reflex PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA immunoassays are performed, and concordant PR3/MPO positivity supports AAV, whereas a discordant IIF-positive with PR3/MPO-negative pattern is generally labeled "atypical" and is weak evidence for AAV by itself, particularly when formalin-fixed neutrophils fail to reproduce a typical pattern and antigen assays remain negative [^117SH3tP] [^112QW8Xx] [^111K4rK5].

> Let me think about test performance so I don't overstate a negative result. ANCA (PR3/MPO) are detected in roughly 85–95% of active GPA/MPA and pauci-immune crescentic GN, but up to about 10% of biopsy-proven AAV are ANCA-negative, so a negative screen reduces but does not eliminate the possibility of AAV, especially when clinical suspicion is high [^112MvxvR] [^114MJxFX].

> I should double-check rare discordant configurations. On occasion, PR3- or MPO-ANCA can be detectable by immunoassay despite a negative IIF, but this seldom leads to a new vasculitis diagnosis in real-world cohorts, highlighting that isolated low-level antigen positivity without IIF corroboration is often nonspecific outside the right clinical setting [^115kbFvM] [^111K4rK5].

> Next, I should review clinical interpretation and pre-test probability. In patients with a low pre-test probability, a negative ANCA effectively rules out AAV and helps redirect the workup; in contrast, in patients with high pre-test probability features such as pulmonary–renal syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, RPGN, or multisystem small-vessel involvement, a negative ANCA should not delay specialty referral or tissue confirmation because diagnosis remains clinical and histologic, not serologic alone [^114MJxFX] [^1129Asaz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what do current guidelines advise when serology is negative but suspicion persists. EULAR and CanVasc recommend pursuing tissue biopsy to establish a new diagnosis or evaluate suspected relapse when the clinical picture suggests AAV, even if serology is negative or inconclusive, with site selection guided by the most accessible, involved organ system such as kidney, skin, ENT, or lung [^113DQEAj] [^114r4uGW] [^113c5oKL].

> I will now examine nuanced pitfalls so we do not misinterpret a "negative". Seronegativity can reflect early disease, treated or quiescent disease, or specific phenotypes such as EGPA where only about 38–40% are ANCA-positive; atypical IIF patterns can reflect antibodies to minor antigens like elastase or lactoferrin and are generally not included in standard PR3/MPO reflex panels and often lack strong clinical specificity for AAV [^117XrH7t] [^114PT9Fc] [^117SH3tP].

> But wait, what if an institution uses antigen-first testing rather than IIF-first. EULAR 2024 supports obtaining high-quality PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA as the primary tests when AAV is suspected, so in those laboratories "screen with reflex" may mean a primary antigen immunoassay with reflex to IIF or alternate platform confirmation; the clinical interpretation of a negative primary antigen screen is similar — it lowers the likelihood of AAV — but tissue confirmation remains key when pre-test probability is high [^111vG1Pn] [^113iNWTe].

> Let me reconsider whether repeat testing is helpful. Indiscriminate repeats are low-yield and can add noise; repeating ANCA is reasonable if clinical manifestations evolve toward higher pre-test probability or if there is a new organ-threatening syndrome, and using quantitative antigen assays interpreted with result-specific likelihood ratios can improve diagnostic reasoning when repeated in an appropriate context [^1129Asaz] [^117GyYd6].

> I need to ensure we address alternative diagnoses when ANCA is negative. In the right clinical settings, consider anti-GBM disease, immune complex vasculitides such as IgA vasculitis, infection, malignancy, drug-induced vasculitis, and pulmonary or renal mimics; guideline-directed evaluation and, when feasible, timely biopsy help resolve these differentials and prevent delays in definitive therapy [^114MJxFX] [^111HAXho] [^11167eog].

> Hmm, wait a minute — am I over-relying on MPO-ANCA results in isolation. Contemporary data caution that MPO-ANCA performance is modest when used indiscriminately, underscoring that test ordering should be gated by compatible clinical features to maintain positive predictive value and avoid false positives in low pre-test settings [^115nsGPp] [^114BLdeF].

> Final interpretation summary: "ANCA screen with reflex negative" indicates no detectable ANCA on the lab's initial screen, no PR3/MPO confirmatory testing was triggered, and the overall result lowers the probability of ANCA-associated vasculitis but does not exclude it in a high-suspicion presentation; if pre-test probability is high, proceed with expedited specialty referral and consider biopsy of an involved organ to secure the diagnosis and guide treatment, consistent with current consensus recommendations [^117SH3tP] [^111K4rK5] [^113DQEAj] [^114r4uGW].

An "ANCA screen with reflex negative" means the initial ANCA screen was negative, so **no reflex PR3/MPO testing was performed** [^111K4rK5]. This result makes ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) **less likely but does not exclude it**, especially if clinical suspicion is high or the patient is already on immunosuppression [^114MJxFX]. If suspicion persists, **repeat ANCA testing**, **tissue biopsy**, or alternative diagnostics should be considered [^113DQEAj] [^114r4uGW] [^11167eog].

## ANCA screening and reflex testing

ANCA screening detects **ANCAs associated with AAV (GPA, MPA, EGPA)** [^114MJxFX] [^111vG1Pn]. Reflex testing means that when the screen is positive, the laboratory automatically performs **PR3/MPO assays** to confirm and characterize the antibodies [^111K4rK5] [^117SH3tP].

---

## Interpretation of "ANCA screen with reflex negative"

Negative screen indicates **no detectable ANCAs** on the initial assay [^111K4rK5]; **No reflex** means PR3/MPO testing is not performed [^115kbFvM].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Reduced likelihood**: a negative screen lowers the probability of AAV but does not exclude it [^11167eog].
- **False negatives**: can occur due to early disease, low titers, or immunosuppression [^117SH3tP] [^117GFwLW].
- **Clinical context**: interpretation must consider symptoms, signs, and other tests [^114MJxFX] [^11167eog].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay variability**: different assays have varying sensitivity/specificity [^111K4rK5] [^117SH3tP].
- **ANCA-negative AAV**: some patients have AAV despite negative ANCA [^114MJxFX] [^117MbasC].
- **Repeat testing**: consider if suspicion remains high [^111vG1Pn] [^11167eog].

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Clinical correlation**: reassess symptoms, signs, and labs [^114MJxFX] [^11167eog].
- **Repeat ANCA**: if suspicion persists, repeat testing [^111K4rK5] [^111vG1Pn].
- **Tissue biopsy**: consider to confirm or exclude AAV [^113DQEAj] [^114r4uGW].
- **Alternative diagnoses**: evaluate other causes of symptoms [^114MJxFX] [^111HAXho].

---

An "ANCA screen with reflex negative" means the initial screen was negative and no further PR3/MPO testing was done; this reduces but **does not eliminate the likelihood of AAV**, so **further evaluation is warranted** if clinical suspicion remains [^111vG1Pn].

### ANCA associated vasculitis [^114MJxFX]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Investigations can further support a diagnosis of AAV and refute the major differential diagnoses of infection and cancer. As in the case study, urinalysis can rapidly screen for renal involvement in a multi-system disease. Patients with haematuria or proteinuria in this context have a high probability of having AAV. This probability is approximately 2% if the dipstick findings occur in isolation, rising to 85% if there is concomitant sinus and pulmonary disease.

ANCA testing improves diagnostic certainty for patients with a high pre-test probability of disease. However, up to 10% of patients with small vessel vasculitis clinically test negative for ANCA. Conversely, false positive results can occur in the general population and in association with infections, malignancy, and autoimmune gastrointestinal and renal disease. Given this complexity, ANCA tests are not usually requested in primary care. Kidney or lung biopsies may be taken by specialty services to confirm a diagnosis of AAV or exclude differential diagnoses such as cancer.

### Disease assessment in systemic vasculitis [^116iBoW4]. Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitides are complex multi-system disorders with many overlapping clinical features. Their outcome has been transformed by effective immunosuppression, preventing death in over 70% of cases. The quality of survival is affected by the disease course, which is characterized by a significant likelihood of relapse in 38%, chronic effects from the disease and its treatment, as well as emerging or worsening comorbidity, all of which contribute to the patient's clinical condition and outcome. Whilst imaging and laboratory testing including histology are important aspects of diagnosis, they are of limited value in assessing response to therapy or subsequent disease course.

We have developed standardized validated clinical methods to quantify disease activity and damage; we are developing effective measures of patient experience to complement these procedures. This approach provides a rational basis for clinical management as well as being essential in the conduct of clinical trials and studies in vasculitis by providing reproducible definitions of relapse, remission, and response to therapy for patients with systemic vasculitis. Clinical assessment remains the gold standard for evaluating disease progress but requires regular training to ensure standardization. The development of biomarkers in the future may produce a more accurate description of disease and identify potential targets for therapy as well as predictors of response to drugs.

### Utility of repeat extractable nuclear antigen antibody testing: A retrospective audit [^11256GV5]. Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

The utility of extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) antibody testing in diagnosing autoimmune connective tissue diseases is frequently evaluated without specific guidelines for repeat test ordering. This study aimed to assess the utility of repeat ENA testing following an initial negative result.

A retrospective study was conducted in a single, multicentre tertiary health network in Melbourne, Australia. Results from all ENA tests were extracted from the hospital laboratory information system. Clinical data on patients with a change in ENA result from negative to positive, concerning a new diagnosis of an ANA-associated rheumatic disease (AARD), were obtained from hospital records.

A total of 23,438 ENA tests were performed on 19,603 patients from 29 July 2013 to 28 September 2020. Overall, 20,918 tests (89.2%) were negative, with 215 tests (0.9%) being equivocal. Of the 2,305 positive tests, the most common ENA auto-antibody specificity detected was anti-Ro52, accounting for 1,185 cases (51.4%). In total, 2,636 of the 19,603 patients (13.4%) underwent more than one ENA test during the study period. Among these, most patients (2,523, 95.7%) had stable ENA results with no change since the first test. Only 53 patients (2.2%) experienced a change in ENA result from negative to positive. Excluding patients with pre-existing rheumatic conditions and those under 18, five new AARDs were diagnosed among the remaining 34 patients.

The study concludes that repeat ENA test results rarely change or lead to a new diagnosis of an AARD, suggesting that repeated testing is only warranted if there is a change in clinical manifestations.

### What is needed to move toward single-step diagnosis of current HCV infection [^117MX4YD]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The implementation of reflex HCV RNA testing, where a test for HCV RNA is automatically performed when a test returns positive for HCV antibody, has been an important advance. In regions lacking reflex testing, between 20% and as many as 50% of people who test HCV antibody positive do not have a follow-up HCV RNA test performed, which constitutes one of the major drop-offs in the HCV cascade of care. When Quest Diagnostics, a large commercial laboratory in the United States, adopted reflex HCV RNA testing, the rate of follow-up HCV RNA testing within 30 days of a positive HCV antibody test increased from 40% to 95%. Similarly, Spanish data showed that the rate of RNA testing increased from 52% to 91% with the introduction of reflex testing. Even with reflex testing, challenges such as inadequate sample volume or sample mishandling prevent laboratories from achieving universal HCV RNA testing for all antibody-positive samples.

Although reflex testing is an important step and should be standard practice globally, its implementation is limited in many regions, including high-income countries, particularly in rural and remote communities. Laboratories have cited challenges in moving samples from the serology section of a laboratory to the site of nucleic acid testing, especially if these tests are not conducted in the same location. This should be weighed against the inconvenience and cost to a patient required to return to a provider and provide a second sample for follow-up testing.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) comprises heterogeneous, multisystem disorders characterized by inflammation and necrosis of small and medium-sized blood vessels with unknown etiology. Three distinct clinico-pathological syndromes have been identified: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). These are associated with autoantibodies directed against neutrophil granular proteins, such as proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. These conditions are uncommon, with incidence and prevalence rates of approximately 25 per million population and 200 per million, respectively. Despite significant advances in treatment, mortality rates remain elevated, at 2.3 times that of the general population. Early diagnosis, swiftly instituting appropriate immunosuppression, and limiting toxicity from treatment are key strategies to mitigate mortality and damage from AAV.

### Current and emerging techniques for ANCA detection in vasculitis [^117SH3tP]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Detection of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) is a well-established diagnostic test used to evaluate suspected necrotizing vasculitis of small blood vessels. Conditions associated with these antibodies, collectively referred to as ANCA-associated vasculitides, include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). The diagnostic utility of ANCA testing depends on the type of assay performed and on the clinical setting. Most laboratories worldwide use standard indirect immunofluorescence tests (IFT) to screen for ANCA and then confirm positive IFT results with antigen-specific tests for proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO).

Developments such as automated image analysis of immunofluorescence patterns, so-called third-generation PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA ELISA, and multiplex technology have improved the detection of ANCAs. However, challenges in routine clinical practice remain, including methodological aspects of IFT performance, the diverse antigen-specific assays available, the diagnostic value of testing in clinical settings, and the prognostic value of serial ANCA monitoring in the prediction of disease relapse. This review summarizes the available data on ANCA testing, discusses the usefulness of the various ANCA assays, and advises on the clinical indications for the use of ANCA testing.

### Negative commercial screening test for paraneoplastic antibodies in a case of opsoclonus [^115RYFiY]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS) is challenging as it comprises a group of clinically heterogeneous entities, all related to a coexistent, but sometimes occult, malignancy. The detection of paraneoplastic antibodies aids the clinician in establishing the diagnosis of a PNS. Paraneoplastic antibodies are screened through immunohistochemistry or indirect immunofluorescence on cerebellar slices. Cerebellar substrates that can be used for screening for paraneoplastic antibodies are commercially available.

Such commercial screening was applied to the serum and CSF of a 48-year-old woman presenting with a subacute onset of oscillopsia and diplopia. No family history of neurologic diseases was present. Two months prior, she experienced the initial symptoms of anorexia, nausea, and balancing problems. Two weeks before admission, she noticed the first signs of multidirectional binocular diplopia and oscillopsia. Neurologic examination revealed a normal mental and cognitive status. Ocular motility showed full-range eye movements. The patient reported binocular diplopia on lateral gaze and downgaze. Initially, bursts of ocular flutter were noticed and confirmed by video-oculography, which evolved over time into a constant opsoclonus. This opsoclonus caused significant visual impairment, with a drop of visual acuity to logMAR 0.7. She had a normal motor and sensory examination. The osteotendinous reflexes were brisk without pathological reflexes. Gait was broad-based ataxic, without overt appendicular ataxia. In a later phase, she mentioned infrequent shock-like sensations.

In summary, the diagnosis of vasculitis is not easy; it requires extensive clinical experience and access to immunological and histopathological tests. Appropriate treatment, both inductive and supportive, is even more challenging. The absence of markers unequivocally correlating with disease activity and differentiating it from other clinical conditions makes management difficult. We expect that the results of the presented study will serve for a better interpretation of the available laboratory tests.

### Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs): Role in diagnosis, disease monitoring, and prognosis [^117GFwLW]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare and potentially fatal autoimmune disorder characterized by pauci-immune necrotizing vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized blood vessels. The pathogenic role of ANCAs in AAV is supported by both clinical and experimental evidence, and when used in the proper clinical setting, ANCA testing is highly specific for AAV. Testing with both indirect immunofluorescence assay and enzyme immunoassay may increase sensitivity for AAV; however, testing with a high-quality enzyme immunoassay may be used alone. Nonvasculitic conditions and drugs can cause ANCA positivity without manifestations of AAV. We review ANCA testing itself, performance characteristics and specific conditions for the laboratory test, and various conditions when ANCA testing is useful in diagnosis, disease monitoring, and selecting treatment.

### Anca associated vasculitis [^116fTe6y]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

- **How is it diagnosed?**: The diagnosis of ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) is clinical, supported by serological and histological data. There are many possible presenting symptoms — none more important than another for making the diagnosis — and no isolated discriminating symptoms of AAV. The key to diagnosis is prompt recognition of an inflammatory disease pattern when multiple symptoms emerge, especially if more than one organ system is implicated, or in combination with chronic systemic symptoms. Therefore, when two or more of these symptoms develop concurrently, the index of suspicion should be high.

- **Clinical scenarios**: Two clinical scenarios pose particular diagnostic difficulty. The first is alveolar haemorrhage, which can be hard to recognize and is devastating if missed. Alveolar haemorrhage may present with haemoptysis, but this symptom is absent in up to half of cases. Some patients with extensive airspace bleeding will report only shortness of breath or cough and have a near normal chest examination. Patients with haemoptysis plus other features of AAV warrant same day hospital assessment to rule out pulmonary haemorrhage without further primary care investigations if these would delay referral. All other patients with suspected vasculitis and dyspnoea or cough should have a full blood count; if there is a recent drop in haemoglobin (or a low haemoglobin with no historic comparator), then it is advised to urgently discuss the possibility of pulmonary haemorrhage with a specialty service.

### A multicentre study to improve clinical interpretation of proteinase-3 and myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies [^1129Asaz]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this multicentre study was to enhance the clinical interpretation of PR3- and MPO-ANCAs as an adjunct for diagnosing ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). This was achieved by defining thresholds and test result intervals based on predefined specificities and by calculating test result interval-specific likelihood ratios (LRs).

Eight different PR3- and MPO-ANCA immunoassays from seven companies were evaluated using 251 diagnostic samples from AAV patients and 924 diseased controls. Thresholds for antibody levels were determined based on predefined specificities (95, 97.5, 99, and 100%) and used to delimit test result intervals. Test result interval-specific LRs were determined. For all assays, the LR for AAV increased with increasing antibody levels. For all but one immunoassay, high antibody levels (associated with LR > 55) were found in a substantial fraction (> 65%) of patients. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics analysis of a diagnostic approach, in which positive results were confirmed by IIF or another immunoassay, was not substantially higher than the AUC of performing an immunoassay only. The highest AUC was found when an immunoassay was combined with another immunoassay or with IIF.

To diagnose AAV based on PR3- and MPO-ANCA, it is useful to define thresholds for antibody levels and to assign test result interval-specific LRs. Higher antibody levels are associated with a higher likelihood of disease. Such information improves clinical interpretation.

### Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis: where to go [^113K6ENA]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Enormous progress has been made during the last 25 years in understanding the aetiopathogenesis of the anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV). This has led to improvements in early diagnosis, treatment, and secondary prevention of these diseases. Nevertheless, there are still unmet needs in the AAV.

With respect to diagnosis and follow-up, sensitive biomarkers that reflect disease activity, including during smouldering disease, are needed. In the field of aetiopathogenesis, genetic and epigenetic studies are being performed, not only directed at the autoimmune response but also at the expression of, possibly modified, autoantigens. Environmental factors, in particular microbial factors, are also being explored. This will enable the analysis of gene-environment interactions in the AAV, further elucidating their aetiopathogenesis.

Explaining the differences in clinical presentation between proteinase 3 (PR3)-associated AAV and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-associated AAV requires an adequate animal model for PR3-ANCA disease, which is currently lacking. Although many large randomized controlled trials have built a base for a rational therapeutic approach in the AAV, late morbidity and mortality remain significant. The availability of new biologicals and the development of sensitive biomarkers for disease activity could further improve the prognosis for patients suffering from AAV.

### Anca-mpo: is this a useful test [^115nsGPp]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

ANCA-MPO may not accurately predict ANCA-associated vasculitis and drug-induced vasculitis. ANCAs bind proteins expressed in neutrophils responsible for vascular inflammation. ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a type of small-vessel vasculitis characterized by necrotizing vasculitis, with few or absent immune deposits. This classification includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).

Positive staining of ANCA has three main patterns by IIF: p-ANCA, c-ANCA, and atypical. The last pattern includes all the other neutrophil or monocyte-specific immunofluorescent reactivity, resulting from a mixture of cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining that can be present in other inflammatory diseases. The immunoassay detects antibodies against PR3 and MPO, which are strongly associated with c-ANCA and p-ANCA, respectively.

### Assessment of the correlation of commonly used laboratory tests with clinical activity, renal involvement and treatment of systemic small-vessel vasculitis with the presence of ANCA antibodies [^11311nj1]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

The most important cause of death in the active phase of AAV is infectious complications, and the increase in inflammatory markers (leukocytosis, ESR, CRP) is equally typical for vasculitis and severe infection. Repeated measurements of procalcitonin concentrations have proven to be very helpful in the differentiation of bacterial infections, and their effectiveness in diagnostics has been demonstrated in many clinical studies.

In the presented study, procalcitonin concentration was significantly higher in active vasculitis than in remission. The highest values were found in patients with severe AAV, who developed respiratory failure, alveolar bleeding, and required mechanical ventilation or NIV-assisted respiration. In all of these patients, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was used. Two patients from this population eventually died from septic shock.

The correct procalcitonin concentration of < 0.5 ng/ml is likely to exclude significant bacterial infection. In patients with AAV during the period of disease activity, results are often observed in the so-called gray zone (0.5–1.0 ng/ml), despite the absence of infectious symptoms, which may be due to a generalized inflammatory reaction. In the presented study, similarly to other clinical trials, procalcitonin concentration above 1.0 ng/ml was strongly associated with infectious complications, severe lower respiratory tract involvement, and an increased risk of death.

Numerous studies have shown an increased risk of venous thrombosis in the course of active AAV. The relationship of the markers stimulating the coagulation system and…

### Diagnosing and treating ANCA-associated vasculitis: An updated review for clinical practice [^11167eog]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) are a group of rare, primary, systemic necrotizing small-vessel vasculitides. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis account for approximately 80–90% of all AAV. Exposure to silica dust, farming, and chronic nasal Staphylococcus aureus carriage are associated with an increased risk of developing AAV.

When a diagnosis of AAV is suspected, as in patients with multisystem organ dysfunction or those with features such as chronic rhinosinusitis, cavitated lung nodules, palpable purpura, or acute kidney injury, appropriate further investigations are needed, including ANCA testing. In this scenario, a structured clinical assessment should be conducted. Evaluating all organs possibly involved, and tissue biopsy may be necessary for confirmation of the diagnosis.

Therapeutic algorithms vary based on the severity of AAV, the clinical diagnosis/ANCA specificity, and the patient's age, weight, comorbidities, and prognosis. Recent data favor rituximab as a preferable option for both induction and maintenance of remission. Additionally, regimens with fewer glucocorticoids are equally effective and safer in inducing remission compared to conventional regimens, and avacopan is an effective glucocorticoid-sparing option.

In contrast, there is not compelling evidence to support the routine use of plasma exchange in addition to standard remission-induction therapy in AAV. ANCA and other biomarkers can be helpful in association with clinical assessment to guide diagnosis and treatment decisions. Patients should be frequently evaluated.

### Assessment of the correlation of commonly used laboratory tests with clinical activity, renal involvement and treatment of systemic small-vessel vasculitis with the presence of ANCA antibodies [^1143M7tL]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

The study analyzed the results of laboratory tests at different stages of AAV disease and treatment. The course of the disease is very variable; the assessment of the patient is based on experience and extensive differential diagnosis. The clinical activity scales BVAS v3 and BVAS/WG have a documented value for assessing the severity of the disease, but the classification of symptoms depends on the experience of the doctor.

The study population was characterized by high disease activity; more than 78% of patients were diagnosed with the generalized and severe form. Renal involvement was confirmed in 75% of patients, with initially high creatinine levels, which in most patients did not return to normal despite treatment. The studies by Houben et al. and Hanaoka et al. showed that the increased concentration of creatinine and the decrease in GFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m² at the time of diagnosis are late indicators of AAV activity in the kidneys, which is consistent with the presented work. Despite treatment, a significant proportion of patients remain in the advanced stage of chronic kidney disease, which significantly worsens the long-term prognosis.

### Antiproteinase 3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and disease activity in Wegener granulomatosis [^115gcXR9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The utility of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels to guide the management of patients with Wegener granulomatosis remains controversial.

- **Objective**: To determine whether pro-proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA levels are a better measure of disease activity than mature-PR3-ANCA levels, whether decreases in either level are associated with a shorter time to remission, and whether increases are followed by relapse.

- **Design**: Prospective, observational cohort study.

- **Setting**: Eight United States medical centers that participated in a treatment trial for Wegener granulomatosis.

- **Patients**: 156 patients with Wegener granulomatosis enrolled during periods of active disease.

- **Measurements**: PR3-ANCA levels (by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and disease activity (by the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener granulomatosis).

- **Results**: The ANCA levels were only weakly associated with disease activity across patients. The longitudinal association within patients was stronger, but changes in ANCA levels explained less than 10% of the variation in disease activity. Decreases in mature- and pro-PR3-ANCA levels were not statistically significantly associated with a shorter time to remission. Increases in mature-PR3-ANCA levels (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.8 [95% CI, 0.4 to 1.9]; P = 0.67) and pro-PR3-ANCA levels (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.0 [CI, 0.5 to 2.1]; P = 0.99) were not associated with relapse. The proportion of patients who had relapse within one year of an increase in PR3-ANCA levels was 40% for mature-PR3 (CI, 18% to 56%) and 43% for pro-PR3 (CI, 22% to 53%).

### Anca-associated vasculitis: Core curriculum 2020 [^116pbTAX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation and destruction of small- and medium-sized blood vessels, along with the presence of circulating ANCA. Clinical disease phenotypes include granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and renal-limited vasculitis. Serologic classification of AAV into proteinase 3-ANCA disease and myeloperoxidase-ANCA disease correlates with several disease characteristics.

AAV has a predilection for the kidney, with more than 75% of patients experiencing renal involvement characterized by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The cause and pathogenesis of AAV are multifactorial, influenced by genetics, environmental factors, and responses of the innate and adaptive immune system. Randomized controlled trials over the past two decades have refined AAV therapy, transforming it from a fatal disease to a chronic illness with a relapsing course and associated morbidity.

This article, part of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology series, provides a detailed review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and advances in the management of AAV.

### Twenty-five years of European Union collaboration in ANCA-associated vasculitis research [^114Ke7nq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

This special edition reviews the progress in understanding systemic vasculitis associated with autoantibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens (ANCA). European research groups have significantly contributed to this area, including the original observations of the association between ANCA and vasculitis. Areas of interest include classification and epidemiology, genetics and pathogenesis, disease assessment, histology, and long-term outcomes. Clinical trials conducted by the European Vasculitis Study Group have helped to define the standard of care for the treatment of patients with vasculitis, providing a platform for investigating newer therapies. The prognosis of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis has improved over this period due to facilitated diagnosis and the development of consensus, evidence-based treatment recommendations. The ANCA story exemplifies the power of a biomarker in influencing a disease area, inspiring research, and equipping physicians with better tools to treat patients with these disorders.

### Anca-mpo: is this a useful test [^115a2xpP]. Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

Specialties who most frequently requested the test were those managing the common symptoms of AAV: renal, pulmonary (including upper respiratory tract), and dermatological features.

In addition to AAV and drug-induced vasculitis, 200 additional diagnoses were noted among those for whom the test was requested. Our study supports previous data describing a positive ANCA test in non-vasculitic conditions. This is due to indiscriminate testing in patients with a low pre-test probability of AAV or drug-induced vasculitis, increasing the frequency of false-positive results obtained. Although the 2017 consensus statement recommends testing with high-quality MPO-ANCA assays rather than screening with IIF, this has serious cost implications. We suggest that internal policies should guide the use of this test so that it is only requested when clinically appropriate.

The main limitations of our study are that it is a single-centre and retrospective study, but the detailed assessment of the clinical diagnosis in over 600 patients in whom the test was performed provides significant compensation.

In conclusion, our results indicate that the ability of ANCA-MPO to predict AAV or drug-induced vasculitis is limited.

### Are antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies a marker predictive of relapse in Wegener's granulomatosis? A prospective study [^116Jfi8F]. Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

To investigate the predictive value of testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in 55 patients with systemic Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), a randomized, prospective trial was conducted comparing corticosteroids and oral or pulse cyclophosphamide.

All patients received corticosteroids, and a cyclophosphamide pulse of 0.7 g/m² was administered at diagnosis. Following the first pulse, patients were randomly assigned to receive either pulse or oral cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day), independent of ANCA results. ANCA were detected using an immunofluorescence assay, and efforts were made to correlate them with WG relapse. ANCA levels were monitored throughout the study.

At diagnosis, 48 patients (87%) tested positive for ANCA, with a cytoplasmic labeling pattern in 44 and a perinuclear pattern in four. Follow-up ANCA data were available for 50 patients. ANCA disappeared in 34 patients and persisted in nine. The clinical course improved with ANCA disappearance and deteriorated with persistence or increased titer in 79% of patients. Among initially ANCA-positive patients, 23 relapses occurred, more frequently when ANCA remained positive or reappeared [13/19 ANCA-positive patients vs. 3/29 ANCA-negative patients (P < 0.01)]. Nine relapses (39%) occurred in patients with persistent ANCA, and ANCA reappearance preceded relapse in eight (35%). The mean time between inclusion and relapse did not differ between patients who became ANCA-negative and those who were persistently ANCA-positive.

### Anca-GBM dot-blot: Evaluation of an assay in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis [^1145jgx7]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2004).

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is characterized by a rapid and progressive loss of renal function and the presence of crescentic glomerulonephritis (CGN). Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are mandatory to prevent death and renal failure. We have evaluated an ANCA-GBM dot-blot diagnostic test in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and inter-observer effect in consecutive patients with RPGN (n = 82). Control sera (n = 34) included healthy and relevant disease controls. Dot-blots were independently evaluated by nine observers.

Proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA, myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA, and both were detected by ELISA in 36, 32, and 3 samples of 71 patients with pauci-immune CGN, respectively. Two additional samples were ANCA-negative. The dot-blot revealed a sensitivity of 92–95% for PR3-ANCA and 80–86% for MPO-ANCA. The specificity of the dot-blot for PR3- and MPO-ANCA was 100%. In the patients with anti-GBM nephritis (n = 9), anti-GBM was detected by both ELISA and dot-blot (sensitivity: 100%). The specificity of the anti-GBM dot-blot was 91–94%. However, the inter-observer effect was relatively high for the detection of anti-GBM antibodies (24%).

In conclusion, the ANCA-GBM dot-blot is a useful screening tool in situations where conventional ANCA testing is not readily available. It shows excellent performance for PR3-ANCA detection but less optimal sensitivity for MPO-ANCA and specificity for anti-GBM detection. Therefore, it is recommended to include the following advises in the report to physicians: 1) patients with a high clinical suspicion for MPO-ANCA-as…

### Anca-mpo: is this a useful test [^114BLdeF]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

The ANCA screen test, performed in 476 patients (77.5%), was positive in 43.2%. Among them, 25.7% and 23.4% showed a p-ANCA and atypical p-ANCA pattern, respectively. The most frequent pattern was atypical c-ANCA (29.8%). The ANCA-MPO test was positive in 2.0%.

The performance of the ANCA-MPO test as a predictor of AAV or drug-induced vasculitis was assessed through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.59 (95% CI 0.5, 0.7). The Youden index was determined to establish the cut-off value with the highest validity of the ANCA-MPO test. The optimal cut-off was 0.3, with a sensitivity of 40.0% and a specificity of 79.0% (Youden index 0.2). Calibration was verified through the Hosmer–Lemeshow test. The ANCA screen result did not correlate with the ANCA-MPO result [odds ratio (OR) 7.4; P-value 0.059; 95% CI 0.9, 58.7]. No correlation was also identified with p-ANCA (OR 3.8; P-value 0.05, 95% CI 0.1, 14.7) or atypical p-ANCA (OR 0.9; P-value 0.933; 95% CI 0.2, 4.6).

AAV is uncommon, with diverse clinical features. Guchelaar et al. compared the diagnostic value of ANCA IIF and immunoassay for diagnosing AAV. The sensitivity obtained for ANCA-MPO with immunoassay was 58.1%, and the specificity was 95.6%. Although the ANCA test is considered relevant for AAV diagnosis, our data showed the discriminatory ability of the test is unsatisfactory, as the AUC is < 0.6. With a Youden index close to zero, the ANCA-MPO test showed little ability to discriminate between patients with AAV and those with drug-induced vasculitis.

### Hypotheses on the etiology of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody associated vasculitis: The cause is hidden, but the result is known [^111hDgjp]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The first description of what is now known as antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated necrotizing vasculitis appeared more than 140 years ago. Since then, many aspects of the pathogenic pathway have been elucidated, indicating the involvement of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies. However, why antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies are produced in the first place remains unknown. Over the years, many hypotheses have emerged addressing the etiology of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody production, but no exclusive factor or set of factors can so far be held responsible. In this review, the most influential hypotheses regarding the causes of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis are discussed, with the aim of placing these hypotheses within an epidemiologic context, focusing on environmental and genetic influences.

### A dual-fixed neutrophil substrate improves interpretation of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence [^112QW8Xx]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

To determine whether the addition of a formalin-fixed neutrophil substrate could improve interpretation and prediction of autoantigenic specificity in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing, routine diagnostic samples sent for ANCA testing were analyzed prospectively on a dual substrate of both ethanol- and formalin-fixed neutrophils. Positive samples on ethanol-fixed neutrophils were deemed "typical" if formalin-fixed neutrophils also stained, and "atypical" if not. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) results were correlated with antimyeloperoxidase (MPO) and anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) results using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Of the 1,426 samples, 201 from unique patients were ANCA-positive (200 on IIF, 1 on ELISA alone). Thirty-two (45%) of 71 typical ANCA staining patterns were positive for either anti-MPO or anti-PR3 antibodies, whereas only one (0.8%) of 129 atypical patterns was ELISA-positive in a patient without systemic vasculitis. Only one (3%) of 34 ELISA-positive samples had a negative IIF-ANCA (1/1,426 patients, 0.07%), and this patient did not have vasculitis.

Concomitant staining on formalin fixation of IIF-positive ethanol-fixed ANCA samples improves the interpretation of ANCA testing and is predictive of vasculitis autoantigens MPO and PR3.

### Maintenance of remission and risk of relapse in myeloperoxidase-positive ANCA-associated vasculitis with kidney involvement [^117WBGxc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Proposal for the clinical use of MPO-ANCA status for remission-maintenance guidance in MPO-ANCA–associated vasculitis with GN:

- **Suggested interval of serial MPO-ANCA determinations**: The interval is based on the observed time to reappearance of MPO-ANCA after turning negative on treatment (median 5.5 [interquartile range 3.1–15.5] months).

- **Timing to start maintenance immunosuppression**: This will depend on risk factors, such as age, baseline eGFR, previous relapses, and the higher risk of progression to kidney failure.

- **Recommended treatment for remission maintenance**: In accordance with guidelines based on randomized controlled trial results, rituximab is recommended as the treatment of choice, supported by the relapses occurring on treatment with conventional disease-modifying drugs observed in our cohort.

ANCA-associated vasculitis is a relapsing-remitting disease. The risk of relapse has been correlated with suboptimal remission-maintenance treatment, such as using immunosuppressants in subtherapeutic doses or their premature discontinuation. Hence, there is an implicit need for ongoing appropriate and effective remission-maintenance treatment. We showed here that about 42% of the patients in whom relapses occurred during remission-maintenance treatment received doses that are considered subtherapeutic, and 60% of these were persistently MPO-ANCA–positive. By contrast, it is unclear if the length of remission-maintenance treatment has implications for minimizing relapse rates. The extension of remission maintenance with azathioprine beyond 18 months did not affect relapse-free survival in patients.

### Key advances in the clinical approach to ANCA-associated vasculitis [^1134WZJ3]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The updated nomenclature for vasculitis defines this varied group of disorders by aetiology, specific features of pathogenesis, and clinical symptoms; diagnostic and classification criteria for clinical practice are in development. Here, I review some important advances in the management of vasculitis within the category of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), which encompasses microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).

The clinical approach to the management of the patient with AAV should include testing for ANCA specificity; proteinase 3 (PR3)-specific ANCAs are most often associated with GPA, whereas myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCAs are usually associated with MPA. Also important to the management of AAV is an assessment of the disease stage and severity, to enable tailored treatment based on an algorithm derived from controlled-trial data.

Remaining questions pertain to the dosage and duration of corticosteroid treatment, the selection of patients for, and duration of, maintenance treatment after induction of remission, and the identification of safer and more effective therapies than are currently in use. Outcome measures should assess not only disease activity but also damage and quality of life. Infections, cardiovascular events, and malignancies also contribute to outcome, and their prevention should therefore be part of the clinical approach to managing patients with AAV.

### Syphilis [^1146BUgA]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Inconclusive results generally arise in early infection or from waning antibody levels in late infection. The most common combinations are:

- **Positive RPR with negative treponemal screening (EIA/CLIA)**: A confirmatory test (TPPA) suggests that the RPR result is a false positive.
- **Positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with negative confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR**: This is likely a false positive but could indicate early infection.
- **Positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with indeterminate confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR**: This could represent waning antibody levels following a previous, treated infection or a new infection.

When results are inconclusive, clinicians should inquire about previous syphilis infection and treatment. If early syphilis is possible, retesting in two to four weeks is advisable. If results remain unchanged, interpretation is based on history, considering possibilities such as late untreated infection, treated infection, or non-venereal treponemal disease in adults from endemic countries in South and Central America, South-East Asia, and Africa.

### Assessment of the correlation of commonly used laboratory tests with clinical activity, renal involvement and treatment of systemic small-vessel vasculitis with the presence of ANCA antibodies [^113hZj9P]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

At the time of diagnosis of active AAV, the ANCA concentration was significantly increased. The mean value was 68.16 IU/ml, and the median was 51.0 IU/ml. The administered treatment decreased ANCA in the majority of patients; however, the mean value remained high at 25.68 IU/ml (p < 0.001). In one patient, the concentration of antibodies increased from 88 IU/ml to 177 IU/ml during complete clinical remission, while in another, the concentration increased from 51 IU/ml to 78 IU/ml. In the remaining four patients, despite the low initial ANCA concentrations of 2.2–5.2 IU/ml, high clinical activity of the disease was observed. Three patients were diagnosed with severe disease, and one with generalized disease. ANCA antibodies showed no correlation with the severity of GPA/MPA (p = 0.68).

### Anca-associated vasculitis - clinical utility of using ANCA specificity to classify patients [^115dX4Ka]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are a heterogeneous group of rare syndromes characterized by necrotizing inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels and the presence of ANCAs. Several clinicopathological classification systems exist that aim to define homogeneous groups among patients with AAV, the main syndromes being microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and eosinophilic GPA (EGPA).

Two main types of ANCA can be detected in patients with AAV. These ANCAs are defined according to their autoantigen target, namely leukocyte proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Patients with GPA are predominantly PR3-ANCA-positive, whereas those with MPA are predominantly MPO-ANCA-positive, although ANCA specificity overlaps only partially with these clinical syndromes. Accumulating evidence suggests that ANCA specificity could be better than clinical diagnosis for defining homogeneous groups of patients, as PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA are associated with different genetic backgrounds and epidemiology.

ANCA specificity affects the phenotype of clinical disease, as well as the patient's initial response to remission-inducing therapy, relapse risk, and long-term prognosis. Thus, the classification of AAV by ANCA specificity rather than by clinical diagnosis could convey clinically useful information at the time of diagnosis.

### Value of ANCA measurements during remission to predict a relapse of ANCA-associated vasculitis — a meta-analysis [^111RN7L6]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

The value of repeated ANCA measurements among patients with an established diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to explore whether either of the two distinct patterns of ANCA values during remission — a rise in ANCA or persistently positive ANCA — predicted future relapse.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE and EMBASE searches were performed. Studies with at least 10 subjects with AAV, from which both sensitivity and specificity of a rise in ANCA and/or persistent ANCA for future disease relapse could be calculated, were included. Likelihood ratios were calculated for each study and pooled to arrive at summary estimates. I(2)-values were calculated as a measure of heterogeneity, and meta-regression was used to explore sources of heterogeneity.

- **Results**: Nine articles on a rise in ANCA and nine articles on persistent ANCA were included. The summary estimates for positive likelihood ratio (LR(+)) and negative likelihood ratio (LR(-)) of a rise in ANCA during remission on subsequent relapse of disease were 2.84 (95% CI 1.65, 4.90) and 0.49 (95% CI 0.27, 0.87) respectively. The summary estimates for LR(+) and LR(-) of persistent ANCA during remission for subsequent disease relapse were 1.97 (95% CI 1.43, 2.70) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.50, 1.06) respectively. There was substantial between-study heterogeneity, which was partially explained by the frequency of ANCA measurements.

- **Conclusion**: Among patients with AAV, a rise in or persistence of ANCA during remission is only modestly predictive of future disease relapse. There is limited utility in relying solely on ANCA measurement trends for predicting relapses.

### Position paper: Revised 2017 international consensus on testing of ANCAs in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis [^111K4rK5]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) are valuable laboratory markers used for the diagnosis of well-defined types of small-vessel vasculitis, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). According to the 1999 international consensus on ANCA testing, indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) should be used to screen for ANCAs, and samples containing ANCAs should then be tested by immunoassays for proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCAs and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCAs. The distinction between PR3-ANCAs and MPO-ANCAs has important clinical and pathogenic implications.

As dependable immunoassays for PR3-ANCAs and MPO-ANCAs have become broadly available, there is increasing international agreement that high-quality immunoassays are the preferred screening method for the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis. The present consensus statement proposes that high-quality immunoassays can be used as the primary screening method for patients suspected of having the ANCA-associated vaculitides GPA and MPA without the categorical need for IIF, and presents and discusses evidence to support this recommendation.

### Antibodies to selected minor target antigens in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) [^114PT9Fc]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

In patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, indirect immunofluorescence (IF) distinguishes between cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) and perinuclear (P-ANCA) neutrophil staining patterns. In patients with primary systemic vasculitis such as Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome, these IF staining patterns broadly correspond with antibodies to the two major antigens: the C-ANCA pattern is generally associated with antibodies to serine protease 3 (PR3), and the P-ANCA pattern with antibodies to myeloperoxidase (MPO). However, some sera positive for ANCA by IF are negative for anti-PR3 and anti-MPO antibodies, suggesting the presence of antibodies to minor antigens of PMN granules.

We tested sera from a previously well-defined clinical cohort of patients for antibodies to four possible minor antigens: bactericidal permeability increasing protein, elastase, cathepsin G, and lactoferrin. IF-positive (+) sera had significantly higher antibody frequencies to the minor antigens than did the IF-negative (-) sera (P < 0.01). Patients with IF(+) PR3(-)MPO(-) sera showed the most varied reactivity to the minor antigens. Among the IF(+) groups, the IF(+) PR3(+)/MPO(-) sera showed the lowest reactivity to the minor antigens. Patients with well-defined ANCA specificities, such as the PR3-ANCA response associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, are less likely than other patient subsets to have antibodies to minor antigen targets. Autoantibodies to these minor antigens contribute to the overall pattern of ANCA identified.

The need for urgent antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) results when assessing patients with acute renal failure, pulmonary renal syndrome, or mononeuritis multiplex has led to the development of a rapid qualitative ELISA screening assay for antibodies to myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3).

- **Aims**: To report the use of a rapid qualitative ELISA screen for PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA in a regional immunology laboratory and its correlation with standard indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and quantitative ELISA for PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA.

- **Methods**: Over 12 months, 103 samples requiring urgent ANCA testing were screened by a rapid qualitative ELISA. The results were compared with IIF and quantitative ELISA assays for PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA.

- **Results**: There was an excellent correlation between the rapid qualitative ELISA and standard ANCA IIF and a routine ELISA for MPO/PR3-ANCA, with sensitivities ranging from 82% to 100%. There were two false negatives, which gave weak to moderately positive values as determined by routine ELISA; however, the clinical relevance of these two cases is doubtful.

- **Conclusions**: The rapid ELISA for anti-MPO and anti-PR3 correlates well with quantitative ELISA and IIF ANCA, and urgent management decisions in patients with suspected small vessel vasculitis can be based with confidence on this test.

### Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and the Churg-Strauss syndrome [^117XrH7t]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Since testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) became available for routine evaluation, no large homogeneous cohort of patients with the Churg-Strauss syndrome has been studied.

- **Objective**: To define the clinical and biological characteristics of newly diagnosed Churg-Strauss syndrome, according to the presence or absence of ANCA.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional analysis of manifestations of participants who were enrolled in treatment trials between December 1995 and December 2002.

- **Setting**: Multicenter study in 63 clinical centers in France, Belgium, Latvia, and the United Kingdom, coordinated by the French Vasculitis Study Group.

- **Participants**: 112 patients with recently diagnosed Churg-Strauss syndrome based on classifications.

- **Measurements**: The authors compared principal demographic, clinical, and laboratory features according to ANCA status at diagnosis.

- **Results**: The authors detected ANCA in 43 (38%) patients. Positive ANCA status at diagnosis was associated with renal involvement, peripheral neuropathy, and biopsy-proven vasculitis, whereas negative ANCA status was associated with heart disease and fever.

- **Limitations**: The authors assessed ANCA by immunofluorescence but did not assess ANCA centrally or systematically retest if ANCA was undetected at diagnosis.

- **Conclusions**: Phenotypically, ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative Churg-Strauss syndrome might differ. The association of ANCA positivity with clinical symptoms that indicate inflammation and necrosis of small vessels might characterize a predominantly vasculitic.

### Disease heterogeneity in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: Implications for therapeutic approaches [^112MXH5h]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

In recent decades, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis has transformed from an almost uniformly fatal disease to a treatable form of primary systemic vasculitis. Substantial disease heterogeneity exists within ANCA-associated vasculitis, and the increasing understanding of this heterogeneity has implications for guiding treatment decisions. Approaches to induction and maintenance therapy vary depending on disease severity, clinical manifestations, and patient-specific factors. This narrative review examines how disease heterogeneity in ANCA-associated vasculitis, concerning disease severity, clinical presentations, and ANCA specificity, influences therapeutic decision-making. Many questions regarding therapeutic strategies in ANCA-associated vasculitis remain unanswered, and these should guide future research in this complex group of diseases.

### The effect of a symptom related "gating policy" on ANCA requests in routine clinical practice [^117GyYd6]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Most positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) results are associated with non-vasculitic conditions, and guidelines have been proposed for the judicious use of this test. The outcome of applying similar guidelines in a routine laboratory is reported.

- **Methods**: All immunology requests (6,500) over six months were selected. Those requesting ANCA were studied for the appropriateness of the clinical data supporting the request, the presence of ANCA in those samples tested, and the final diagnosis. Antibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence.

- **Results**: ANCA testing was requested in 287 samples. Application of a "gating policy", which refuses analysis on requests not supported by clinical data suggestive of systemic vasculitis, made clinicians more selective about the patients for whom they requested ANCA testing. The percentage of "appropriate" screens for systemic vasculitis was relatively high (212 of 287 requests: 72.5%). Only one of the remainder, for whom ANCA testing was initially refused, developed an ANCA-related systemic vasculitis in the two years after the study. However, the delay in reporting her positive ANCA was only two days. Most of the samples tested were negative (155 of 212), but most (42 of 57) of the patients with positive ANCA results were found to have a systemic vasculitis.

- **Conclusions**: A gating policy to select requests supported by clinical data suggestive of systemic vasculitis makes ANCA testing more clinically relevant and cost-effective. Studies where guidelines can be proposed and their effects measured are essential.

### Acute ANCA vasculitis and asymptomatic COVID-19 [^117TzWVw]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

We describe the presentation and diagnosis of a child with newly diagnosed antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis and associated diffuse alveolar hemorrhage who was positive for coronavirus disease 2019 immunoglobulin G antibodies, indicative of a previous asymptomatic infection. Results of multiple polymerase chain reaction tests coinciding with the start of symptoms were negative, indicating that acute infection was not the cause of the patient's symptoms. Coronavirus disease 2019-induced autoimmune diseases have been described in adults, but this case report represents the first case described in a pediatric patient.

### Anca-mpo: is this a useful test [^114SJDys]. Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

We revisited the question of the usefulness of the ANCA-MPO assay and, in particular, whether it is of value in diagnosing AAV and drug-induced vasculitis. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients whose ANCA-MPO test was performed between July and December 2022 at University College London Hospital. The following secondary goals were defined:

- **Assessing specialties**: Identify which specialties most frequently request this test.
- **Diagnoses made**: Identify the diagnoses made.
- **Frequency of positive tests**: Determine the frequency of positive ANCA-MPO tests.
- **Correlation with ANCA screen test**: Evaluate whether the ANCA screen test, including the atypical p-ANCA and p-ANCA patterns, correlated with the ANCA-MPO test.

The principles of the Declaration of Helsinki were observed during the study period.

The ANCA-MPO test was performed on 614 patients: 64.8% females and 35.2% males. Among the patients whose ethnicity was confirmed, 54.4% were Caucasians, 13.2% Asians, and 13.2% Afro-Caribbeans. The test was most frequently requested by specialties in Rheumatology (38.1%), Neurology (17.4%), Respiratory (6.5%), Dermatology (6.4%), Nephrology (5.5%), and ENT (5.4%). Forty patients had a diagnosis of AAV or cocaine-induced vasculitis. Other noted diagnoses included LN (4.3%), RA (3.7%), SLE (3.5%), and interstitial lung disease (2.8%). No diagnosis had been reached in 18.6% of patients, and clinical diagnosis was inconclusive in 2.9%. GPA was established in 2.4%; EGPA in 0.9%; AAV in 1.6%; and cocaine-induced vasculitis in 0.4%. No patients tested had a diagnosis of MPA.

### Myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA) and proteinase 3-ANCA without immunofluorescent ANCA found by routine clinical testing [^115kbFvM]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Testing for serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and by antiproteinase 3 (PR3)/antimyeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody assays may identify patients with PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA despite a negative IF (IF-negative MPO/PR3-positive); however, the significance of this result is not clear. We sought to determine whether IF-negative, MPO/PR3-positive results identified any cases of clinically meaningful systemic vasculitis at our institution.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all IF-negative, MPO/PR3-positive patients identified at our institution over a 2-year period.

- **Results**: Of the 2345 samples tested over 2 years, 1998 were IF-negative. Among these IF-negative samples, 49 samples (2.5%) derived from 38 patients tested positive for MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA. Only 1 IF-negative, MPO/PR3-positive patient was subsequently diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Eleven IF-negative, MPO/PR3-positive patients (29%) had been previously diagnosed and treated for AAV, all with positive IF and antibody tests prior to treatment. Four patients had evidence of cutaneous vasculitis not attributed to AAV, while several of the remaining IF-negative, MPO/PR3-positive patients had other immunologic disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (5 patients) and inflammatory bowel disease (3 patients).

- **Conclusion**: In this real-life cohort assayed simultaneously by IF and multiplexed bead assays, the detection of MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA without a positive IF rarely led to a new diagnosis of systemic vasculitis.

### Diagnosing renal involvement in connective tissue disease: Interpretation of anti-nuclear autoantibody tests [^112P8k9f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Renal involvement is common in connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and leads to a range of glomerular, tubulointerstitial, and vascular pathologies. Autoantibody testing can be an important diagnostic tool for patients with multisystem symptoms accompanied by renal impairment or dipstick abnormalities. However, the clinical utility of these tests depends on a reasonably high pre-test probability of disease, as serological tests are generally not effective screening tools in wider populations.

Close collaboration with the immunology laboratory can be beneficial in evaluating patients, especially when the clinical presentation and serological test results are discordant. In some cases, conducting tests for extended autoantibody panels can assist in reaching a more definitive diagnosis. Alternatively, unexpected serological test results may indicate other diagnoses.

We summarize the diagnostic performance of ANA and ENA tests in Table 1.

### Anca negative pulmonary vasculitis: A challenging diagnosis [^117MbasC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A man in his 40s with end-stage kidney disease due to IgA nephropathy, who was receiving peritoneal dialysis, presented with a 1-week history of breathlessness, cough, and nosebleeds. A CT scan of the chest revealed ground-glass changes, while blood tests indicated elevated inflammatory markers and a negative vasculitis screen, including negative ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies. Initial treatment for suspected atypical pneumonia with antibiotics yielded no clinical improvement. Over the course of the admission, his symptoms progressively worsened, leading to oxygen dependency with an FiO2 of 40% and episodes of haemoptysis. Suspicions of pulmonary vasculitis arose due to clinical deterioration, prompting consultation with a tertiary vasculitis centre. It was subsequently concluded that the clinical and radiological findings correlated with ANCA-negative pulmonary vasculitis or a rare case of IgA-associated pulmonary capillaritis. Treatment with methylprednisolone and rituximab led to significant improvement, allowing rapid oxygen withdrawal. The patient was discharged with a tapering prednisolone regimen.

### Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies [^112MvxvR]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Much like other autoantibodies, such as anti-double stranded DNA in systemic lupus erythematosus or antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies in Goodpasture's syndrome, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) have provided doctors with a useful serological test to assist in the diagnosis of small-vessel vasculitides. These include Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and their localized forms, such as pauci-immune necrotising and crescentic glomerulonephritis.

Approximately 85–95% of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and pauci-immune necrotising and crescentic glomerulonephritis have serum ANCA. ANCA directed to either proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase are clinically relevant, yet the relevance of other ANCA remains unknown. Besides their diagnostic potential, ANCA might also be valuable in disease monitoring. In addition, data seem to confirm the long-disputed pathogenic role of these antibodies.

Present treatments for ANCA-associated vasculitis are not free from side effects, and as many as 50% of patients relapse within 5 years. An accurate understanding of the key pathogenic points of ANCA-associated vasculitis can undoubtedly provide a more rational therapeutic approach.

### Addendum to the international consensus statement on testing and reporting of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Quality control guidelines, comments, and recommendations for testing in other autoimmune diseases [^114aaJRy]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) tests are used to diagnose and monitor inflammatory activity in Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and its renal-limited variant (pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis), and Churg-Strauss syndrome. The International Consensus Statement on testing and reporting of ANCA states that ANCA is most readily demonstrated in these conditions by using a combination of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) of normal peripheral blood neutrophils and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that detect ANCA specific for proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase. The group that produced the International Consensus Statement has developed guidelines for the corresponding quality control activities, examples of comments for various IIF patterns and ELISA results, and recommendations for ANCA testing when inflammatory bowel disease and other non-vasculitic ANCA-associated autoimmune diseases are suspected.

### Prediction of relapses in PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis by assessing responses of ANCA titres to treatment [^117L5Kfe]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective evaluation of whether c-ANCA titres (indirect immunofluorescence) and anti-proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA levels (ELISA) at diagnosis and following immunosuppressive treatment are predictive of relapse of ANCA-associated vasculitis.

- **Methods**: Patients diagnosed with PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis between 1991 and 2002, with at least 2 years of follow-up, and treated with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids only (1991–1996) or switched to azathioprine after induction of remission with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids (1997–2002) were included. ANCA were assessed by immunofluorescence and direct PR3-specific ELISA at diagnosis and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after diagnosis. Actuarial relapse-free survival was analyzed with the log-rank test.

- **Results**: We studied 87 patients positive for PR3-ANCA: 46 were on cyclophosphamide maintenance therapy and 41 switched to azathioprine. Overall actuarial relapse-free survival was 72% at 2 years and 34% at 5 years. Relapse-free survival did not differ between patients on cyclophosphamide maintenance and those switched to azathioprine maintenance (P = 0.34). Patients who became and stayed negative for c-ANCA (immunofluorescence) or PR3-ANCA (ELISA) until 24 months after diagnosis had a lower risk of relapse (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). Positive c-ANCA (immunofluorescence) titres at 3 months [relative risk (RR) 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–3.8], 12 months (RR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1–3.3), 18 months (RR 2.9; 95% CI 1.3–4.6), and 24 months (RR 2.6; 95% CI 1.2–5.0) were significantly associated with relapse within 5 years.

### Assessment of the correlation of commonly used laboratory tests with clinical activity, renal involvement and treatment of systemic small-vessel vasculitis with the presence of ANCA antibodies [^1141ddTR]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

In the studied population, the mean initial concentration of creatinine was high, amounting to 3.39 mg/dl (mean GFR 33.17 ml/min/1.73 m²), and after 6 months of treatment, it decreased only to 2.86 mg/dl (mean GFR 37.87 ml/min/1.73 m²) [Table 2]. The difference was not statistically significant.

- **Laboratory test results - assessment of kidney involvement**:
	- Only in 4 patients (14.3%) did the GFR value increase above 60 ml/min/1.73 m². In 11 patients (39.3%), it remained below 30 ml/min/1.73 m². Among them, 3 patients (10.7%) had to continue renal replacement therapy, and 3 patients (10.7%) with advanced renal failure died. The amount of daily proteinuria did not show a significant correlation with AAV activity (p = 0.275), and the percentage of patients in remission with daily protein excretion above 150 mg was as high as 62.5% [Tables 2 and 3].

### Automatic laboratory-initiated reflex testing to identify patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^1156YiHZ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical usefulness of automatic laboratory-initiated testing for patients with recent-onset normocytic anemia to diagnose autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is uncertain. During a 28-month period, we performed 784,185 complete blood count (CBC) tests. Patients without a history of anemia had reticulocyte count testing if hemoglobin values were less than or equal to 10 g/dL. Of the 784,185 CBC results, 3,841 (0.49%) revealed recent-onset normocytic anemia, with 424 (11.04%) showing reticulocyte counts of 2% or more. Of those with elevated reticulocyte counts, 52 (12.3%) had positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) results. Patient information was available for 40 patients, and physicians were unaware of the existence of AIHA in 33 (83%) of them. Among these 40 patients, 11 (28%) were treated with steroids, 6 (15%) were hospitalized, and in 2 patients (5%), medications were stopped because they were suspected to have caused the hemolytic anemia. Automatic laboratory testing for patients with recent-onset normocytic anemia ensures adherence to recommended practices, potentially saves physician visits, and, for some patients, results in more timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Simple, readily available clinical indices predict early and late mortality among patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis [^115J1LRC]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The early identification of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) who are at increased risk for inferior clinical outcomes at the time of diagnosis might help to optimize the immunosuppressive therapy. In this study, we aimed to determine the predictive value of simple clinical characteristics, which may be applicable for early risk stratification of patients with AAV.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 101 consecutive patients with AAV receiving a protocolized immunosuppressive therapy. Baseline Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) and non-vasculitic comorbidities were computed, then predictors of early (90 days) mortality, infectious death, relapse, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) were evaluated.

- **Results**: The baseline comorbidity score independently predicted early mortality (HR 1.622, CI 1.006–2.614) and showed association with infectious mortality (HR 2.056, CI 1.247–3.392). Patients with BVAS at or above the median (= 21) had worse early mortality in univariable analysis (HR 3.57, CI 1.039–12.243) [p = 0.031], and experienced more frequent relapses [p = 0.01] compared to patients with BVAS below the median.

- **Conclusions**: Assessing baseline comorbidities, besides clinical indices characterizing the severity and extent of AAV, might help clinicians in risk stratification of patients. Future prospective studies are needed to investigate whether therapies based on risk stratification could improve both short-term and long-term survival.

### Clinical impact of subgrouping ANCA-associated vasculitis according to antibody specificity beyond the clinicopathological classification [^114LgvTW]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

In ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), classifications have emerged to individualize homogeneous clinical and outcomes patterns, including the recently defined anti-MPO granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) subgroup. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the impacts of reclassification based on clinicopathological criteria and/or ANCA specificity.

A retrospective monocentric study conducted at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of PR3 or MPO-ANCA AAV patients from January 2000 or September 2011, respectively, to June 2016. Eosinophilic GPA patients were excluded. AAVs were thereby also classified either as GPA or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) according to the European Medicines Agency vasculitis algorithm.

A total of 150 AAV patients were included (94 GPA, 56 MPA; 87 anti-PR3 and 63 anti-MPO patients). GPA patients exhibited a worse relapse-free survival but a better renal survival (P < 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively) than MPA patients. Overall, relapse-free and renal survival rates were similar between anti-PR3 and anti-MPO patients (P = 0.35, 0.17, and 0.15, respectively). Similarly, the prognosis was identical between anti-MPO MPA patients and anti-PR3 MPA patients (P = 0.33, 0.19, and 0.65, respectively), and between anti-MPO GPA patients and anti-PR3 GPA patients (P = 0.06, 0.99, and 0.64, respectively). Moreover, anti-PR3 GPA and anti-MPO GPA patients exhibited no differences in clinical manifestations or BVAS score.

Clinicopathological classification appeared to be the strongest criterion for distin.
