## Question

A 4-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents due to loud snoring, witnessed apneas, and restless sleep. On examination, he has 3+ tonsillar hypertrophy but otherwise appears healthy. His BMI is at the 98th percentile for age. The parents report significant daytime sleepiness and behavioral issues. The otolaryngologist is considering tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing.

According to the AAO-HNSF guideline, what is the appropriate next step regarding preoperative evaluation for this patient, and why?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the appropriate next step is for preoperative evaluation in a 4-year-old with suspected obstructive sleep-disordered breathing, loud snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sleep, 3+ tonsillar hypertrophy, BMI at the 98th percentile, daytime sleepiness, and behavioral issues, and whether polysomnography is indicated before tonsillectomy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnosis and whether this presentation fits obstructive sleep apnea. Then, I should verify which AAO-HNSF guideline elements apply, especially the indications for preoperative polysomnography. Next, I will check how obesity modifies preoperative testing and perioperative risk. After that, I should review conflicting guidance from other societies and reconcile them. Finally, I will outline the practical next steps, including what to do if polysomnography is not available and how to counsel the family about expectations and risks.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture. Loud snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness with behavioral problems in a child with 3+ tonsillar hypertrophy strongly suggest obstructive sleep-disordered breathing, and obesity at the 98th percentile is a major risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea in children, with prevalence substantially higher than in normal-weight peers, so I should not jump to conclusions without considering severity and perioperative risk stratification [^1460d9fc] [^8a584044].

> Wait, let me verify the AAO-HNSF stance on preoperative polysomnography. The 2019 AAO-HNSF update recommends obtaining polysomnography before tonsillectomy in children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing who have specific risk factors, including obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses, and also advocates for polysomnography when the need for surgery is uncertain or there is discordance between tonsillar size and symptom severity, which fits this case given obesity and the severity of symptoms reported by the parents [^472b38f5] [^a5458c05] [^b64c0666].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for ordering polysomnography in obese children. Obesity increases the likelihood of severe obstructive sleep apnea and reduces the chance of cure after tonsillectomy, so preoperative polysomnography helps quantify severity, guide anesthesia and postoperative planning, and set expectations; importantly, many obese children have severe OSA that is not predicted by clinical assessment alone, which is why the AAO-HNSF recommends polysomnography in this scenario [^9a33c501] [^ac61bb03] [^1460d9fc].

> I need to check perioperative implications tied to severity. The AAO-HNSF also recommends overnight inpatient monitoring after tonsillectomy for children under 3 years old or those with severe OSA, defined as apnea–hypopnea index 10 or more events per hour or oxygen saturation nadir less than 80 percent; knowing the preoperative AHI and nadir from polysomnography directly informs whether inpatient monitoring is warranted, which strengthens the case for obtaining the study preoperatively in this child [^770bf450] [^ab3d3f87] [^7d10aba4].

> But wait, what if other guidelines conflict with this approach. The British Thoracic Society suggests not obtaining routine preoperative sleep monitoring in children older than 2 years without comorbidities if severe OSA is not suspected, yet they also recommend considering preoperative sleep monitoring in children with comorbidities such as obesity; this is not truly contradictory, as it reflects a risk-stratified approach, and in a child with obesity and significant symptoms, many experts would still favor polysomnography to confirm diagnosis and plan care, aligning with AAO-HNSF [^ecaf25d4] [^82977175].

> Let me consider alternatives if polysomnography is unavailable or delayed. Home cardiorespiratory polygraphy or overnight oximetry can be considered when access to in-laboratory polysomnography is limited, but these modalities have lower diagnostic yield and cannot fully replace polysomnography for severity stratification; if objective testing is not obtained, clinicians should adopt a presumptive OSA approach with heightened perioperative vigilance and a lower threshold for inpatient monitoring, especially in obesity [^d63a8512] [^d1f06d6e].

> I should double-check counseling points for the family. Tonsillectomy improves obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in many children, but cure is less likely in obesity, with reported resolution around 20 to 30 percent in obese children compared with higher rates in normal-weight children, so families should be counseled that symptoms may persist or recur and that additional therapies such as weight management or continuous positive airway pressure may be needed [^2fe679e9] [^00004cd5] [^25ff716f].

> Putting this together, the appropriate next step per AAO-HNSF is to obtain preoperative polysomnography in this 4-year-old with obesity and clinically significant symptoms of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing, because obesity is a designated risk factor and objective severity assessment will guide surgical decision-making, anesthesia planning, and postoperative disposition; if polysomnography is not available, consider alternative testing and manage with presumptive OSA precautions, but the preferred course is in-laboratory polysomnography when feasible [^472b38f5] [^a5458c05] [^d63a8512].

---

Per the AAO-HNSF guideline, the next step is to **obtain polysomnography (PSG)** [^472b38f5] because the child has obesity (BMI 98th percentile) and symptoms of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. PSG is indicated preoperatively in children with obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial anomalies, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses [^a5458c05], or when the need for surgery is uncertain or there is discordance between tonsillar size and symptom severity [^b64c0666]. PSG will confirm the diagnosis, assess severity, and guide perioperative planning, including the need for **postoperative inpatient monitoring** if severe OSA is found [^770bf450] [^ab3d3f87].

---

## Indications for preoperative polysomnography according to AAO-HNSF guidelines

The AAO-HNSF provides clear recommendations on when to obtain **preoperative PSG** in pediatric patients with suspected OSA:

- **High-risk conditions**: Children with obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses should undergo PSG before tonsillectomy [^472b38f5] [^a5458c05].

- **Uncertainty or discordance**: PSG is recommended when the need for surgery is uncertain or when there is discordance between tonsillar size on physical examination and the reported severity of symptoms [^472b38f5] [^3fd8c2de].

- **Severe symptoms**: Children with severe symptoms such as witnessed apneas, restless sleep, daytime sleepiness, and behavioral issues should undergo PSG to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for obtaining polysomnography in this patient

In this 4-year-old boy, several factors warrant **preoperative PSG**:

- **Obesity**: BMI at the 98th percentile significantly increases the risk of OSA and its severity [^1460d9fc].

- **Severe symptoms**: Witnessed apneas, restless sleep, daytime sleepiness, and behavioral issues are classic manifestations of OSA [^8a584044].

- **Tonsillar hypertrophy**: Although 3+ tonsillar hypertrophy is a strong clinical indicator of OSA, PSG is still recommended in obese children to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity [^472b38f5] [^a5458c05].

---

## Benefits of preoperative polysomnography

Obtaining PSG before tonsillectomy provides several **clinical benefits**:

- **Confirm diagnosis**: PSG is the gold standard for diagnosing pediatric OSA, differentiating it from primary snoring or other sleep disorders [^4a00f1f7].

- **Assess severity**: PSG quantifies the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen saturation nadir, which are critical for perioperative planning and postoperative monitoring decisions [^770bf450].

- **Guide anesthesia management**: Knowledge of OSA severity allows anesthesiologists to tailor intraoperative and postoperative care, including airway management and analgesic choices [^d1f06d6e].

- **Identify comorbidities**: PSG can reveal additional sleep-related disorders or comorbidities that may influence surgical outcomes and necessitate further evaluation or management [^ac61bb03].

---

## Potential risks of not obtaining polysomnography

Failing to obtain preoperative PSG in high-risk patients such as this child may lead to **underestimation of OSA severity**, increasing the risk of perioperative complications, including respiratory compromise, hypoxemia, and the need for emergency intervention. It may also result in inadequate postoperative planning, as severe OSA may require overnight inpatient monitoring and specialized care [^770bf450] [^ab3d3f87]. Additionally, without objective data, there is a risk of overtreatment or undertreatment, leading to persistent symptoms and the need for further interventions [^5017ef26].

---

## Alternative diagnostic options if polysomnography is unavailable

If PSG is unavailable or delayed, **alternative diagnostic options** may be considered, although they are less comprehensive:

- **Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT)**: Limited availability and validation in pediatric populations, but may be considered in select cases [^notfound].

- **Clinical assessment and questionnaires**: Tools such as the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) can aid in screening but cannot replace PSG for definitive diagnosis or severity assessment [^e14c5d27].

- **Observation and empirical treatment**: In some cases, clinicians may proceed with tonsillectomy based on strong clinical suspicion, but this approach carries inherent risks and should be reserved for exceptional circumstances [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

According to the AAO-HNSF guideline, the appropriate next step for this 4-year-old boy with suspected OSA, obesity, and severe symptoms is to **obtain preoperative polysomnography** [^472b38f5]. This will confirm the diagnosis, assess severity, and guide perioperative management, including anesthesia planning and postoperative monitoring. If PSG is unavailable, alternative diagnostic options may be considered, but they are less reliable and should be used cautiously [^d63a8512].

Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT02562040 Sleep-disordered breathing includes a spectrum of disorders ranging from habitual snoring to frequent episodes of obstructive breathing during sleep. The disorder affects 6% to 17% of children, with a higher prevalence among children from racially minoritized or low-income backgrounds. 1-3 Consequences of untreated SDB potentially include behavior problems; daytime sleepiness; impairment of growth, neurodevelopment, and quality of life; and increased prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
4. Eligible children were aged 3 to
12.

9 years, had tonsillar hypertrophy and mild SDB, and were considered appropriate candidates for adenotonsillectomy by an otolaryngologist. Exclusion criteria included recurrent tonsillitis, a z score based on the body mass index of 3 or more, and severe comorbidities. All participants received supportive care that included standardized education on healthy sleep and lifestyle and referral for untreated allergies or asthma. Participants were randomly assigned to early adenotonsillectomy or watchful waiting with supportive care.

Among the sample, 169 children were overweight or obese, 108 had a history of asthma, 282 had tonsils that occupied more than 50% of the oropharyngeal width, 19 and 331 had an AHI less than 1. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were balanced between groups. Behavioral problems are common parental concerns and can negatively affect children’s psychosocial, emotional, and academic functioning. 32-34 At baseline, 28% of children in this study had clinically elevated behavioral problem scores, which suggests a high prevalence of behavioral comorbidity in children with mild SDB.

### Snoring and obstructive sleep apnea in children (...) [^1dd35b34]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Much lower apnea indexes and shorter apneas than those considered acceptable for adults2 have been recognized as indicators of OSAS in children. 5, 6 However, the natural history of mild OSAS and primary snoring, ie, snoring with obstructive symptoms but nonpathologic polysomnography findings, is not well known. 7 The most common cause for snoring and OSAS in normal children is adenotonsillar hypertrophy.
3. This follow-up study was designed to study children with symptoms suggestive of OSAS, the presumptive cause of the symptoms being adenotonsillar hypertrophy. These signs and symptoms were related to the overnight polysomnographic findings. The effect of adenotonsillectomy as a treatment of the syndrome was evaluated in a repeated study 6 months later in the cases with a PSG finding indicative of OSAS. The children with PS who underwent no therapeutic interventions also received a follow-up examination 6 months later.

We reviewed all referrals from primary health care sites to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology in the Oulu University Hospital for adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, or both, for children aged 3 to 10 years from 1994 to 1997. Parents of children with reported snoring, apneas, or difficult nighttime breathing completed a detailed questionnaire regarding their child's nighttime and daytime symptoms. Children with known upper airway anomalies, an underlying disease predisposing to upper airway obstruction, asthma, or perennial allergy were excluded at this point. Based on the questionnaire responses, the children with obstructive symptoms underwent an ear, nose, and throat evaluation. Where recognized, upper airway anomalies and abnormal facial morphologic characteristics led to exclusion. After the patient history had been thoroughly updated and the questionnaire responses checked, 78 children fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The constancy of snoring and the frequency of nights when the parents had detected apneas differed between the OSAS and PS groups. Only the habitual snoring, apneas, and restless sleep detected by the parents were significantly more common in the OSAS than the PS group.

### Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in children-AAFP (...) [^c471bf9f]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

A subcommittee for the American Academy of Pediatrics recently developed an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis and management of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in children. This guideline was published in the April 2002 issue of Pediatrics. The AAP guideline focuses on uncomplicated obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in otherwise healthy children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and/or obesity who are being treated by primary care physicians. The subcommittee prepared an algorithm for the diagnosis and management of the syndrome in these patients. Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome The American Thoracic Society defines obstructive sleep apnea syndrome as “a disorder of breathing during sleep characterized by prolonged partial upper airway obstruction and/or intermittent complete obstruction that disrupt normal ventilation during sleep and normal sleep patterns. ” The syndrome needs to be distinguished from primary snoring. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome occurs in children of all ages, but it is thought to be most common in preschool-aged children. Risk factors include adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity, neuromuscular disease, and craniofacial anomalies. The AAP guideline discusses the first two risk factors. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea syndrome can result in serious complications. Reported sequelae have included neurocognitive impairment, behavior problems, failure to thrive, cor pulmonale, and death. Early diagnosis and treatment have reduced the incidence of severe complications. The diagnostic evaluation should be thorough. The history and physical examination have been shown to be poor in differentiating between primary snoring and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

Polysomnography is the diagnostic method of choice; it is the only test that quantifies sleep and ventilatory abnormalities. Other screening techniques, such as videotaping, audiotaping, nocturnal pulse oximetry, and daytime nap polysomnography, may be helpful if the results are positive. Risk factors for complications after adenotonsillectomy in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome include age younger than three years, cardiac complications of the syndrome, severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome determined by polysomnography, failure to thrive, obesity, prematurity, recent respiratory infection, craniofacial anomalies, and neuromuscular disorders.

### Preoperative identification of children at high risk of obstructive sleep apnea [^dde0a7e9]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a common childhood disorder which can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Enlarged adenoid and tonsils are the commonest causes, and adenotonsillectomy is the recommended first line of treatment. Obstructive sleep apnea poses as an anesthetic challenge, and it is a well-known risk factor for perioperative adverse events. The presence and severity of an obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis will influence anesthesia, pain management, and level of monitoring in recovery period. Preoperative obstructive sleep apnea assessment is necessary, and anesthetists are ideally placed to do so. Currently, there is no standardized approach to the best method of preoperative screening for obstructive sleep apnea. Focused history, clinical assessments, and knowledge regarding the strengths and limitations of available obstructive sleep apnea assessment tools will help recognize a child with obstructive sleep apnea in the preoperative setting.

### Practice guidelines for the perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^d1f06d6e]. Anesthesiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)—preoperative evaluation and presumptive diagnosis—states that “in the absence of a sleep study, a presumptive diagnosis of OSA may be made” using criteria including “a weight or body mass index greater than 95th percentile for age (pediatric patients)” and that “observed apnea during sleep is an additional criterion.” Anesthesiologists should work with surgeons to develop a protocol so patients suspected of OSA are “evaluated long enough before the day of surgery,” and a preoperative evaluation “should include a comprehensive review of previous medical records,” an interview with the patient and/or family, and a physical examination, with records review including “a history of airway difficulty with previous anesthetics, hypertension or other cardiovascular problems,” and other conditions. The interview “should include focused questions related to snoring, apneic episodes, frequent arousals during sleep,” morning headaches, and daytime somnolence, and the physical examination “should include an evaluation of the airway, nasopharyngeal characteristics, neck circumference, tonsil size, and tongue volume.” If features suggest OSA, the anesthesiologist and surgeon “should jointly decide whether to (1) manage the patient perioperatively based on clinical criteria alone or (2) obtain sleep studies, conduct a more extensive airway examination, and initiate indicated OSA treatment in advance of surgery,” and if evaluation occurs on the day of surgery they “may elect for presumptive management based on clinical criteria or a last-minute delay of surgery.” For safety, clinical criteria “should be designed to have a high degree of sensitivity (despite the resulting low specificity),” and perioperative risk stratification should consider that “the severity of the patient’s OSA, the invasiveness of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, and the requirement for postoperative analgesics should be taken into account,” and “The patient and his or her family as well as the surgeon should be informed of the potential implications of OSA on the patient’s perioperative course.”

### Society of anesthesia and sleep medicine guidelines on preoperative screening and assessment of adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^023f18b9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious condition characterized by repeated episodes of complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway. These episodes are accompanied by varying degrees of arterial oxygen desaturation and sympathetic activation. They are usually terminated by brief cortical arousals or, occasionally, awakenings. Resultant sleep disruption is responsible for the commonly associated symptom of excessive daytime sleepiness. Habitual snoring usually coexists. Apart from these symptoms, which can be very intrusive, OSA can lead to adverse health outcomes, including cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disorders (eg, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and congestive heart failure), metabolic syndrome, depression, and increased risk of accidents. – Numerous factors including alcohol consumption, smoking, obesity, increased neck circumference, male sex, advanced age, tonsillar and adenoidal hypertrophy, macroglossia, nasal obstruction, and craniofacial abnormalities increase the risk of OSA. –

Age and sex are important influences. Twenty-seven percent of women and 43% of men ages 50 to 70 years old are estimated to have OSA versus 9% of women and 26% of men in the 30- to 49-years category. Up to 90% of individuals with moderate-to-severe OSA may remain undiagnosed. Importantly, OSA is common in patients who present for surgery, with estimates ranging from the prevalence of the general population to as high as 70% in select populations (eg, bariatric surgical patients). Similar to the general population, most patients with OSA remain undiagnosed at the time of surgery. The diagnosis of OSA is confirmed by observing the number of apnea and/or hypopnea episodes per hour (the apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) on an overnight polysomnography. Cutoffs for AHI have been used to define the severity of OSA. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines mild OSA as AHI 5 to <15 events/h, moderate OSA as AHI 15 to 30 events/h, and severe OSA as AHI >30 events/h.The severity of OSA as measured by the AHI may worsen in OSA patients during the postoperative period. Studies on several large databases, including millions of patients and 2 meta-analyses of 13 and 17 studies, respectively, have found that patients with OSA are at increased risk of postoperative complications. –

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^3fd8c2de]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children—additional recommendations for polysomnography (PSG): The clinician should advocate for polysomnography (PSG) prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) in children without any of the comorbidities listed in Key Action Statement 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of oSDB. Recommendation based on observational and case-control studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B, with a randomized controlled trial plus observational and case-control studies, and the level of confidence in evidence is medium with uncertainty about the specific role in the children specified here. Benefits include selection of appropriate candidates and avoidance of surgery when not indicated, while risks and costs include delay in treatment, procedural cost, and indirect cost of missed work. Based on expert consensus, there are circumstances in which PSG will improve diagnostic certainty and help inform surgical decisions, and the panel decided to advocate rather than recommend PSG to avoid setting a legal standard for care and to recognize individualized decisions. Policy level: Recommendation.

### Prevalence of severe obstructive sleep apnea in pediatric adenotonsillectomy patients [^cf011116]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To determine the prevalence of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a pediatric population who underwent indicated surgery for sleep disordered breathing (SDB).

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of patients aged 2 to 18 years who underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy over a 4-year period. Indications for preoperative polysomnography (PSG), PSG results, and perioperative complications were recorded.

Results

Two hundred and thirty-five patients were included in the final analysis. Of these, 160 patients had preoperative PSG performed. The overall prevalence of severe OSA was 38%. The prevalence in patients for whom preoperative PSG was indicated or for which it should have been advocated according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) clinical practice guideline was 45% and 40%, respectively, whereas the prevalence in patients with no indication for preoperative PSG was 34%. There was no significant difference between groups (P = 0.39). The overall complication rate was 11%, with the rate being significantly lower (P = 0.0022) in patients who did not have preoperative PSG performed (0%) when compared to those who did (16%).

Conclusions

The prevalence of severe OSA in this pediatric population was high. Specifically, a significant percentage of children who would not have received preoperative PSG under the AAO-HNS recommendations had severe OSA and were consequently admitted for overnight observation. Our results suggest that preoperative PSG should be obtained for all pediatric patients with sleep disordered breathing.

### Polysomnography before tonsillectomy in children: who and when? [^fb780f6e]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing in children has centered around polysomnography (PSG). While PSG is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in children, the need for PSG before adenotonsillectomy is widely debated. An evidence-based clinical practice guideline on the use of PSG in children before tonsillectomy has recently been published. The recommendations contained in this guideline are discussed, emphasizing the appropriate indications for PSG as well as the limitations of existing evidence for the use of PSG and diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing in children.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^5017ef26]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Polysomnography (PSG) to guide pediatric obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) management is emphasized for situations with uncertainty or discordance between symptoms and tonsil size, noting that even when a clinician strongly suspects oSDB, some families require objective information to facilitate a clinical decision and in these situations PSG should be requested to provide objective information that helps direct care and minimize the risk of overtreating or failing to accurately diagnose oSDB. When hypertrophy is absent but symptoms are present, normal PSG results would lead to reassessing the need for surgery and a recommendation for observation, whereas abnormal PSG results would support the need for surgery; PSG may also detect OSA in a child with markedly hypertrophic tonsils and mild symptoms that may otherwise be overlooked and could be improved after tonsillectomy. The potential long-term impact of untreated disease is highlighted by multiple studies in younger children with oSDB showing an intelligence quotient (IQ) loss of >5 points, compared with the perspective that exposure to lead-based paint is associated with an average IQ point loss of <4 points, and treatment of oSDB has been shown to improve behavior, attention, quality of life (QOL), neurocognitive functioning, enuresis, parasomnias, and restless sleep.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children [^227cd21d]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with more than 530,000 procedures performed annually in children younger than 15 years. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil including its capsule by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Depending on the context in which it is used, it may indicate tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy, especially in relation to sleep-disordered breathing. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years old under consideration for tonsillectomy. In addition, this guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children 1 to 18 years of age who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based guidance in identifying children who are the best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary objectives are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasize the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improve counseling and education of families of children who are considering tonsillectomy for their child, highlight the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reduce inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care.

Results

The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should administer a single, intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made a strong recommendation against clinicians routinely administering or prescribing perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made recommendations for (1) watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been fewer than 7 episodes in the past year or fewer than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years or fewer than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years; (2) assessing the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergy/intolerance, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis, or history of peritonsillar abscess; (3) asking caregivers of children with sleep-disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, and behavioral problems; (4) counseling caregivers about tonsillectomy as a means to improve health in children with abnormal polysomnography who also have tonsil hypertrophy and sleep-disordered breathing; (5) counseling caregivers that sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management; (6) advocating for pain management after tonsillectomy and educating caregivers about the importance of managing and reassessing pain; and (7) clinicians who perform tonsillectomy should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy hemorrhage at least annually. The panel offered options to recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and 1 or more of the following: temperature >38.3°C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A β-hemolytic streptococcus.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^d63a8512]. Pediatrics (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guideline—childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children and adolescents: The guideline focuses on uncomplicated childhood OSAS associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and/or obesity in an otherwise healthy child who is being treated in the primary care setting. All children/adolescents should be screened for snoring. Polysomnography should be performed in children/adolescents with snoring and symptoms/signs of OSAS; if polysomnography is not available, then alternative diagnostic tests or referral to a specialist for more extensive evaluation may be considered. Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as the first-line treatment of patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. High-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively. Patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether further treatment is required. Objective testing should be performed in patients who are high risk or have persistent symptoms/signs of OSAS after therapy. Continuous positive airway pressure is recommended as treatment if adenotonsillectomy is not performed or if OSAS persists postoperatively. Weight loss is recommended in addition to other therapy in patients who are overweight or obese. Intranasal corticosteroids are an option for children with mild OSAS in whom adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated or for mild postoperative OSAS.

### Is GRADE the right choice for clinical practice guidelines developed by the American academy of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery foundation? [^6d8cfb68]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), developed to inform clinicians, patients, and policy makers about what constitutes optimal clinical care, are one way of increasing implementation of evidence into clinical practice. Many factors must be considered by multidisciplinary guideline panels, including strength of available evidence, limitations of current knowledge, risks/benefits of interventions, patient values, and limited resources. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) is a framework for summarizing evidence that has been endorsed by many national and international organizations for developing CPGs. But is GRADE the right choice for CPGs developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF)? In this commentary, we will introduce GRADE, discuss its strengths and limitations, and address the question of what potential benefits GRADE might offer beyond existing methodology used by the AAO-HNSF in developing CPGs.

### Referral of adults with obstructive sleep apnea for surgical consultation: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^f16607fa]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surgical treatment as initial therapy in adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and major upper airway anatomic abnormality—recommendation and scope: We suggest that clinicians recommend positive airway pressure (PAP) as initial therapy for adults with OSA and a major upper airway anatomic abnormality prior to consideration of referral for upper airway surgery (CONDITIONAL). Major upper airway anatomic abnormalities considered by the task force included tonsillar hypertrophy and maxillomandibular abnormalities. While data suggest a clinically significant benefit from surgical intervention in these populations, PAP should be recommended as initial treatment as it carries minimal risk relative to surgery. The decision to discuss referral for initial surgical therapy should be based on the clinician’s judgment of the patient’s medical history and assessment of upper airway anatomy. The conditional recommendations do not preclude discussion of surgical referral prior to the initial PAP trial if the health care provider deems it an appropriate management discussion point. However, this recommendation is for initial treatment of OSA and does not address management of patients who have previously trialed PAP, as detailed in Recommendations 1–3.

### Ambulatory tonsillectomy for children with severe obstructive sleep apnea without risk factors [^8975d5fd]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Recommendations for polysomnography (PSG) in pediatric sleep disordered breathing (SDB) vary between the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). We determined the rates of preoperative PSG in children without risk factors outlined in the AAO-HNS Clinical Practice Guidelines and described the postoperative course of those patients following T&A.

Methods

Patients aged 3-17 undergoing T&A for SDB or OSA who did not have an indication for preoperative PSG were included. We conducted retrospective review to describe the rate, type, and timing of respiratory complications for patients with and without PSG following T&A, and discuss cases where disposition was changed due to PSG results.

Results

1135 patients without risk factors underwent T&A for SDB or OSA. 196 (17%) had a preoperative PSG, of whom 85 (43.3%) had AHI >10 and 38 (24.8%) had an O 2 nadir <80%. 69 (85%) patients with PSG-diagnosed severe OSA were admitted overnight. Of the entire cohort, 5 patients (0.44%) had hypoxemia requiring blow-by oxygen or repositioning. 4 (0.43%) patients without PSG experienced respiratory events and were converted to overnight stay. The timing of respiratory events for all children ranged from immediately following extubation in the operating room to 3 h postoperatively.

Conclusion

PSG in children without risk factors results in admission of otherwise healthy patients following T&A who would have otherwise undergone ambulatory surgery. PSG alone in pediatric patients with no AAO-HNS risk factors should not influence postoperative disposition. These patients should be monitored for 3 h post-T&A and discharged in the absence of complications.

### Clinical practice guideline: diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^61d6285b]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline, intended for use by primary care clinicians, provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The Section on Pediatric Pulmonology of the American Academy of Pediatrics selected a subcommittee composed of pediatricians and other experts in the fields of pulmonology and otolaryngology as well as experts from epidemiology and pediatric practice to develop an evidence base of literature on this topic. The resulting evidence report was used to formulate recommendations for the diagnosis and management of childhood OSAS. The guideline contains the following recommendations for the diagnosis of OSAS: 1) all children should be screened for snoring; 2) complex high-risk patients should be referred to a specialist; 3) patients with cardiorespiratory failure cannot await elective evaluation; 4) diagnostic evaluation is useful in discriminating between primary snoring and OSAS, the gold standard being polysomnography; 5) adenotonsillectomy is the first line of treatment for most children, and continuous positive airway pressure is an option for those who are not candidates for surgery or do not respond to surgery; 6) high-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively; 7) patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether additional treatment is required. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the evaluation of children with OSAS. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for diagnostic decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to establish a protocol for all children with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to this problem.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^ef2775d9]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This revised clinical practice guideline, intended for use by primary care clinicians, provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children and adolescents. This practice guideline focuses on uncomplicated childhood OSAS, that is, OSAS associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and/or obesity in an otherwise healthy child who is being treated in the primary care setting.

Methods

Of 3166 articles from 1999-2010, 350 provided relevant data. Most articles were level II-IV. The resulting evidence report was used to formulate recommendations.

Results and Conclusions

The following recommendations are made. (1) All children/adolescents should be screened for snoring. (2) Polysomnography should be performed in children/adolescents with snoring and symptoms/signs of OSAS; if polysomnography is not available, then alternative diagnostic tests or referral to a specialist for more extensive evaluation may be considered. (3) Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as the first-line treatment of patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. (4) High-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively. (5) Patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether further treatment is required. Objective testing should be performed in patients who are high risk or have persistent symptoms/signs of OSAS after therapy. (6) Continuous positive airway pressure is recommended as treatment if adenotonsillectomy is not performed or if OSAS persists postoperatively. (7) Weight loss is recommended in addition to other therapy in patients who are overweight or obese. (8) Intranasal corticosteroids are an option for children with mild OSAS in whom adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated or for mild postoperative OSAS.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^7d3dc3fd]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Statement 7—tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) documented by polysomnography (PSG): Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with OSA documented by overnight PSG, with the policy level listed as a Recommendation. The aggregate evidence quality is Grade B, the level of confidence in evidence is Medium, and the benefits–harm assessment is a Preponderance of benefit over harm. The action profile highlights a quality improvement opportunity to promote appropriate use of tonsillectomy for children with documented OSA and reduce morbidity by encouraging timely and effective intervention. Value judgments state that although PSG results are not the only factor and may not correlate with clinical symptoms, PSG is still the most objective study for diagnosis, and there is consensus that children with untreated OSA are at risk for future morbidity or impaired health status. Intentional vagueness is acknowledged because diagnostic criteria and definitions of severity for OSA are not specified; the role of patient preferences is Moderate; exclusions include children who are high-risk surgical candidates, have significant comorbidities, or are interested in nonsurgical options; and differences of opinions are None.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^825da532]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults—preoperative evaluation and selection specify that the diagnosis of OSA should be established prior to surgery and the severity determined by objective testing (Consensus). This evaluation should include an anatomical examination with assessment of medical, psychological or social comorbidities and the patient’s desire for surgery, and the patient should be counseled on surgical options, likelihood of success, goals of treatment, risks and benefits, possible side effects, complications, and alternative treatments (Consensus). Evaluation for primary surgical treatment can be considered in patients with mild OSA who have severe obstructing anatomy that is surgically correctable (Consensus). Surgical procedures can be considered as a secondary treatment when PAP is intolerant or unable to eliminate OSA, and may also be considered when OA outcomes are inadequate or the patient is intolerant (Consensus). Surgery may also be considered as an adjunct therapy when obstructive anatomy or functional deficiencies compromise other therapies or to improve tolerance of other OSA treatments (Consensus).

### Clinical practice guideline: polysomnography for sleep-disordered breathing prior to tonsillectomy in children [^a65ac907]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides otolaryngologists with evidence-based recommendations for using polysomnography in assessing children, aged 2 to 18 years, with sleep-disordered breathing and are candidates for tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy. Polysomnography is the electrographic recording of simultaneous physiologic variables during sleep and is currently considered the gold standard for objectively assessing sleep disorders.

Purpose

There is no current consensus or guideline on when children 2 to 18 years of age, who are candidates for tonsillectomy, are recommended to have polysomnography. The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve referral patterns for polysomnography among these patients. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of anesthesiology, pulmonology medicine, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Results

The committee made the following recommendations: (1) before determining the need for tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they exhibit certain complex medical conditions such as obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (2) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in statement 1 for whom the need for surgery is uncertain or when there is discordance between tonsillar size on physical examination and the reported severity of sleep-disordered breathing. (3) Clinicians should communicate polysomnography results to the anesthesiologist prior to the induction of anesthesia for tonsillectomy in a child with sleep-disordered breathing. (4) Clinicians should admit children with obstructive sleep apnea documented on polysomnography for inpatient, overnight monitoring after tonsillectomy if they are younger than age 3 or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index of 10 or more obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir less than 80%, or both). (5) In children for whom polysomnography is indicated to assess sleep-disordered breathing prior to tonsillectomy, clinicians should obtain laboratory-based polysomnography, when available.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^ac61bb03]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Polysomnography (PSG) before tonsillectomy in high‑risk pediatric obstructive sleep‑disordered breathing (oSDB) is used to avoid unnecessary or ineffective surgery in children with primarily nonobstructive events by identifying primarily nonobstructive events or central apnea that may not have been suspected prior to the study and may not benefit from surgery, to confirm obstructive events that would benefit from surgery because the increased morbidity of surgery in high‑risk children requires diagnostic certainty before proceeding, and to define the severity of oSDB to assist in preoperative planning since children with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may require preoperative cardiac assessment, pulmonary consultation, anesthesia evaluation, or postoperative inpatient monitoring in an intensive care setting; PSG also provides a baseline for comparison after surgery and documents baseline severity, recognizing that persistent OSA despite surgery is more common in high‑risk patients than in otherwise healthy children and that high‑risk patients are more prone to complications of surgery or anesthesia.

### Assessing the need for adenotonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing in a community setting: a secondary outcome measures analysis of a randomized controlled study [^ab5c8f2f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess whether children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) symptom severity above a certain level, measured by a validated questionnaire, improve after adenotonsillectomy (AT) compared to no intervention.

Methods

Children with snoring and tonsillar hypertrophy (4 to 10-years old), who were candidates for AT, were randomly assigned to two evaluation sequences (baseline and 3-month follow-up): (a) evaluation immediately before AT and at 3 months postoperatively (AT group); or (b) evaluation at the initial visit and at the end of the usual 3-month waiting period for surgery (control group). Outcomes were (a) Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire sleep-related breathing disorder scale (PSQ-SRBD); (b) modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale (mESS); and (c) proportion of subjects achieving PSQ-SRBD <0.33 (low-risk for apnea-hypopnea index ≥5/h) if they had score ≥0.33 at baseline.

Results

Sixty-eight children were assigned to the AT and 72 to the control group and two-thirds of them had PSQ-SRBD ≥0.33. The AT group experienced significantly larger improvement between follow-up and baseline than controls (between-group difference [95% CI] for PSQ-SRBD: -0.31 [-0.35 to -0.27]; and mESS: -2.76 [-3.63 to -1.90]; P<.001 for both). Children with baseline PSQ-SRBD ≥0.33 in the AT group had an eight-times higher probability of achieving PSQ-SRBD <0.33 at follow-up than controls with similar baseline score (risk ratio [95% CI]: 8.33 [3.92-17.54]; P<.001).

Conclusion

Among children with snoring, tonsillar hypertrophy, and clinical indications for AT, those with preoperative PSQ-SRBD score ≥0.33 show measurable clinical benefit postoperatively.

When comparing the management of TAP‐related obstruction with similar obstructive etiologies such as tonsillar and adenoid hypertrophy, a similar stepwise approach is observed. Initial clinical assessment followed by fiberoptic evaluation helps characterize obstruction patterns by otolaryngologists.Medical management with nasal corticosteroids is considered for mild symptoms (snoring, rhinorrhea, mouth breathing, and cough) and demonstrates short‐term success, with varying degrees of efficacy.PSG remains the gold standard for diagnosing sleep‐disordered breathing in these patients and informing subsequent surgical intervention like T&A.Interestingly, preoperative PSG can aid in identifying children at a greater risk of persistent OSA following T&A, as a high preoperative AHI was associated with increased risk for residual sleep‐disordered breathing following surgery.Similarly, preoperative AHI in our study was also clinically useful for predicting the likelihood of requiring further interventions post‐TAP, as children with higher preoperative AHI scores were more likely to experience severe obstructive symptoms that necessitated surgical management. This predictive capability of preoperative PSG may warrant standardized inclusion in the evaluation and treatment planning for pediatric patients undergoing TAP.

Our study is limited by its retrospective nature and small sample size. Additionally, there were inconsistencies in the timing intervals of PSG, and not every patient had both preoperative and postoperative PSG for comparison. The scope findings and patient report outcomes were subjective and not consistently reported with variable time intervals, further limiting the study's generalizability. The average time from TAP to the onset of obstructive symptoms in our cohort was 113 days, with patients presenting up to 321 days postoperatively. Although obstruction is often expected to manifest earlier, delayed presentation may result from a combination of progressive tissue changes, scarring, and barriers to healthcare access. Potential changes in fat volume over time could also contribute to gradual airway narrowing.We included syndromic patients to ensure this important cohort was represented; however, given the additional risk factors, future studies could isolate this group to reduce variability. Future studies could also investigate the timing of interventions and proper follow‐up to address postoperative obstruction. Standardized postoperative follow‐up protocols may mitigate variable patient‐reported outcomes. Additionally, studies may consider prospective analysis of post‐TAP outcomes and the utility of preoperative PSG in predicting postoperative risks.

Undesirable consequences and their magnitude

The undesirable consequences of supraglottoplasty (dysphagia) are usually transient and considered small. None of the studies reported on long-term adverse outcomes, such as supraglottic stenosis.

Values and preferences

For dysphagia, different populations (e.g. those at high risk of aspiration) may not benefit from supraglottoplasty. This complication was reported to be transient because of the surgery and should be part of shared decision making before obtaining consent. Cough is transient and should not be considered a reason to not proceed with a supraglottoplasty.

Cost/implementation

Costs are unknown. The authors believe that the cost of supraglottoplasty is comparable to tonsillectomy. Decisions regarding the need and environment for postoperative monitoring are determined by each institution. Access to a pediatric ICU or step-down unit/intermediate care may be required for high-risk patients (i.e. those with severe OSA or significant comorbidities or known preoperative hypercarbia).

The procedure does not require significant additional ear, nose, and throat expertise beyond initial training.

Safe swallowing ability should be assessed before discharge (may need speech swallow evaluation if persistent).

What others are saying

After considering the balance of benefit, surgical risk, and cost, supraglottoplasty is acceptable to key stake holders.

Remarks/future research opportunities

There is a need for:
• Data on the use of supraglottoplasty in children with persistent OSA.
• Studies of children with persistent OSA in whom supraglottoplasty is performed as the sole procedure rather than as part of a multilevel approach.
• Information on treatment outcomes in specific subgroups, such as children with comorbidities.
• Investigation of the effect of the procedure on cognitive function and behavior, daytime sleepiness, and QOL.
• Cost and cost-effectiveness studies of supraglottoplasty.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^25ff716f]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy and obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB)—caregiver counseling emphasizes causes, testing, outcomes, and potential need for additional interventions. Enlarged tonsils are the most common reason that children develop oSDB, but oSDB is not solely due to enlarged tonsils; muscle tone also plays a role, and obesity plays a major role in oSDB. Polysomnography (PSG) is considered the best test to confirm that a child has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that would benefit from surgery and to provide baseline information, yet PSG is not necessary in all cases and may be limited by availability and coverage; for an otherwise healthy child with a strong history, daytime symptoms, and enlarged tonsils, PSG is typically not performed unless parents want confirmation. The success of tonsillectomy is variable and depends on age, weight, ethnicity, OSA severity, and medical conditions; younger, normal-weight, non–African American children may have a resolution of oSDB of 80%, whereas for obese children complete resolution occurs <50% of the time. Caregivers need to be aware that their children may require additional interventions to cure their oSDB, which can vary from weight loss, medications, or wearing a special mask while sleeping that will keep their airway open, and some children may be candidates for more advanced sleep surgery procedures.

Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) for polysomnography (PSG) if they are <2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. The clinician should advocate for polysomnography (PSG) prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) in children without any of the comorbidities listed in Key Action Statement 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of oSDB. Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) documented by overnight polysomnography (PSG).

### Society of anesthesia and sleep medicine guidelines on preoperative screening and assessment of adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^56b09b7f]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

This guideline focuses on the preoperative screening and preparation of adult surgical patients scheduled for elective surgery, including implementation of CPAP therapy in the preoperative and postoperative period. The specific aims were to (1) summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of OSA on perioperative outcomes; (2) determine the appropriate preoperative assessments to identify patients with suspected or diagnosed OSA scheduled for elective surgery; and (3) evaluate the current evidence informing best practices in preoperative management of diagnosed OSA, treated; diagnosed OSA, partially treated/untreated; and suspected OSA. In areas lacking sufficient published evidence, the task force sought to establish expert consensus. Patients affected by sleep-disordered breathing unrelated to OSA were not considered in this guideline, because there is insufficient evidence on which to base recommendations regarding preoperative management for these disorders. These include hypoventilation syndromes, periodic breathing, and central sleep apnea unrelated to OSA.

### Sleep-disordered breathing-year in review 2024 [^5a7d49d2]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 GUIDELINES FOR THE RECOGNITION OF CHILDREN WITH OSDB NEEDING TREATMENT

Two expert recommendations published in 2023 identify a group of children with a history and clinical examination consistent with oSDB who can be treated without the need for overnight recording.

A French Consensus focused on recommendations for children with “oSDB type 1,” defined as occurring in young, nonobese children with no associated comorbidities, where oSDB is generally due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The experts conclude that significant oSDB‐1 is suspected when several nighttime respiratory symptoms related to upper airway obstruction are present in the clinical history. They emphasize that “the diagnosis is above all clinical and OSA severity should also be evaluated on the basis of all the clinical signs.” A specialized otolaryngologist examination is considered essential.

They further state that questionnaires can be used to collect clinical history, especially by non‐experts. Hence, a score less than 0.3 at the Sleep‐Related Breathing Disorder Scale of the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire has good predictive value for mild OSA with potential spontaneous normalization, allowing for watchful waiting. Conversely, a score greater than 2.72 on the Spruyt and Gozal Severity Questionnaire indicates a high likelihood of moderate OSA (sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 81%) and suggests that treatment should be considered. In addition, it is stated that a sleep study is not mandatory before surgery for a child with oSDB‐1 if at least two nighttime symptoms (including snoring) and significant tonsil hypertrophy are present. If a sleep study is required, full nocturnal PSG in hospital (the gold standard) or cardiorespiratory polygraphy—performed in hospital or at home depending on the child's needs and availability—should be performed.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^13769fa8]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children <15 years of age based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been <7 episodes in the past year, <5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or <3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of >1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are <2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of oSDB. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are <3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir <80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥1 of the following: temperature >38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

(1)Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. (2)There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. (3)Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. (4)Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). (5)Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). (6)Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. (7)Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.

Polysomnography before tonsillectomy—supporting guidance and implementation: The purpose of this statement is to help clinicians decide when to request PSG prior to tonsillectomy in children without any of the conditions in Key Action Statement 5. Advocating for PSG refers to encouraging or arguing in favor of using PSG to assist in decision making when the need for surgery is uncertain or there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of oSDB. Although this test alone does not predict the severity of OSA, one is less certain of the diagnosis when tonsil hypertrophy is absent. The clinician may fulfill the requirement of advocating for PSG by (1) documenting in the medical record that PSG was discussed and encouraged, (2) providing an informational brochure or handout that describes the benefits and rationale of PSG in this circumstance, or (3) referring the patient for PSG or to a sleep specialist. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends obtaining PSG in all patients undergoing tonsillectomy for oSDB, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends obtaining PSG for children undergoing tonsillectomy for oSDB; in circumstances when the service is not readily available, it recommends referral to an otolaryngologist or a sleep medicine specialist.

### Cognitive and behavioral outcomes of snoring among adolescents [^534c6d16]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Snoring results from impaired airflow through the upper airway during sleep and is the most consistently observed symptom of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children.The most common factors associated with increased risk for snoring in children are adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obesity. While snoring in otherwise healthy children was historically considered benign, nearly all clinical societies advocate for the early evaluation and management of snoring. The recommended management of snoring varies by location. Clinical societies in the US uniformly recommend a proactive approach toward habitual snoring, defined as snoring 3 or more nights per week. For example, recognizing that habitual snoring is not benign, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends polysomnography or referral to an otolaryngologist or sleep medicine physician for further management.The American Academy of Sleep Medicine also emphasizes this position.However, the American Academy of Otolaryngology reserves polysomnography only for children at high risk of adenotonsillectomy-related complications or those with less certain diagnoses, leaving room for a preference-sensitive approach to adenotonsillectomy as a potential management of habitual snoring and SDB.The European Respiratory Society also recommends further evaluation of snoring using polysomnography.Other recommendations from China,Australia,and India,and combined data from the Asia-Pacificalso emphasize the need for further evaluation and management of habitual snoring.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^2fe679e9]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) in children—caregiver education—explains that oSDB is airway obstruction during sleep that can be caused by enlarged tonsils/adenoids and obesity with daytime sleepiness, behavioral problems, poor school performance, nighttime bed wetting, and growth failure. The best test for diagnosing oSDB is a sleep study or polysomnography, but it is not always needed and is performed in a sleep laboratory where a technician measures heart rate, body movements, blood oxygen levels, and airflow through the mouth and nose. Tonsillectomy is not curative in all cases, especially in children with obesity; it is effective for oSDB in 80% of normal-weight children with tonsillar hypertrophy and in only 20% to 30% of obese children.

Diagnostic Evaluation of SDB and OSA Syndrome

Diagnosis

According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO–HNS), polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosing sleep‐disordered breathing in children, including OSA.Polysomnography is recommended before tonsillectomy in children with SDB who have conditions that increase their risk for complications of surgery, such as obesity, Down syndrome,,craniofacial abnormalities (eg, Pierre‐Robin sequence and cleft palate),,,neuromuscular disorders (eg, muscular dystrophy), sickle cell disease (SCD), or mucopolysaccharidoses.Children with Down syndrome have adenotonsillar hypertrophy, midface and mandibular hypoplasia, relative macroglossia, glossoptosis, generalized muscular hypotonia, and obesity, increasing their risk for airway obstruction. Younger children with syndromes resulting in craniofacial malformations are at a particularly high risk for OSA.Polysomnographic criteria for diagnosing OSA include (1) ≥1 obstructive events (obstructive or mixed apnea or obstructive hypopnea) per hour of sleep or (2) obstructive hypoventilation (eg, end‐tidal CO 2 >50 mm Hg for >25% of the tested sleep time) coupled with snoring, paradoxical chest and abdominal wall movement, or flattening of the nasal airway waveform.SDB includes primary snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, obstructive hypoventilation, and OSA syndrome,but, excluding primary snoring, OSA is the most common.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by repeated episodes of prolonged airway obstruction during sleep, is a common condition in pediatric patients ages 2 to 6. Polysomnography (PSG) testing can be used to assess the severity of OSA or obstructive sleep-disordered breathing prior to adenotonsillectomy. The article "Characteristics and Frequency of Children With Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea Undergoing Elective Polysomnography" by Bains et al. notes the variability in guidelines regarding indication for PSG amongst professional societies, making it difficult for physicians to determine which patients require PSG. The purpose of this commentary is to emphasize and elaborate on the potential benefit for preoperative PSG in all patients considering adenotonsillectomy as presented by the aforementioned article. With broader use of preoperative PSG, providers would have a more accurate assessment of OSA severity and to aid in surgical decision-making and postoperative planning.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^3b692272]. Pediatrics (2012). Medium credibility.

Adenotonsillectomy—first-line therapy for children with OSAS with adenotonsillar hypertrophy specifies that if a child is determined to have OSAS, has adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and no contraindication to surgery, the clinician should recommend adenotonsillectomy as the first line of treatment; if the child does not have adenotonsillar hypertrophy, other treatment should be considered; this carries Evidence Quality: Grade B and Recommendation Strength: Recommendation. Adenotonsillectomy is described as very effective in treating OSAS, with postoperative polysomnography typically showing a major decrease in the number of obstructive events although some obstructions may still be present; although obese children may have less satisfactory results, many will be adequately treated, and the benefits-harms assessment notes a preponderance of benefit over harm with a low role of patient preferences since continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an option but involves prolonged, long-term treatment as compared with a single, relatively low-risk surgical procedure.

### Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea: preoperative and neurocognitive considerations for perioperative management [^f6968ea4]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects up to 7.5% of the pediatric population and is associated with a variety of behavioral and neurocognitive sequelae. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is critical to halting and potentially reversing these changes. Depending on the severity of the OSA and comorbid conditions, different treatment paradigms can be pursued, each of which has its own unique risk:benefit ratio. Adenotonsillectomy is first-line recommended surgical treatment for pediatric OSA. However, it carries its own perioperative risks and the decision regarding surgical timing is therefore made in the context of procedural risk versus patient benefit. This article presents the seminal perioperative and neurocognitive risks from pediatric OSA to aid with perioperative management.

The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in children requires clinical suspicion supplemented with the use of specific diagnostic tests. Polysomnography remains the key to diagnosis, and helps to assess the need for treatment, the risk for perioperative respiratory compromise, and the likelihood of persistent OSAS after treatment. Adenotonsillectomy is the mainstay of treatment, although children with complex medical conditions that affect upper airway anatomy and tone may require additional treatment.

Pediatric obesity—obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) overview: OSA is “characterized by prolonged partial upper airway obstruction and/or intermittent complete obstruction that disrupts normal ventilation during sleep,” is associated with cardiovascular complications, neurocognitive impairment, and decreased quality of life, and has higher prevalence in children with obesity—45% compared with 9% among children with healthy weight; one study indicated that a 1‑unit increase in the BMI SD score increased the odds of OSA by a factor of 1.9; evaluation is based on history and examination with higher risk in children with obesity, tonsillar hypertrophy, craniofacial anomalies, trisomy 21, and neuromuscular disorders, and diagnosis is made by polysomnography with an apnea‑hypopnea index of 1 or more episodes per hour in children; common symptoms include frequent snoring, gasps or labored breathing during sleep, disturbed sleep, daytime sleepiness, inattention and/or learning problems, nocturnal enuresis, and headaches, and examination findings may include tonsillar hypertrophy, adenoidal facies, micro‑ or retrognathia, high‑arched palate, and elevated BP; because of limited availability of pediatric sleep centers, referral to a pediatric otolaryngologist may be needed.

2.3. Question: What Is the Clinical Value of Performing Additional Preoperative Tests?

Recommendation 2.3.1: There Is Insufficient Evidence to Support Canceling or Delaying Surgery to Perform More Advanced Screening Techniques or Sleep Testing to Diagnose OSA in Those Patients Identified as Being at High Risk of OSA Preoperatively, Unless There Is Evidence of an Associated Significant or Uncontrolled Systemic Disease or Additional Problems With Ventilation or Gas Exchange (Level of Evidence: Low. Grade of Recommendation: Weak for)

Because screening instruments perform better in patients with greater OSA severity, screen-positive patients with greater threshold values should be assumed to have moderate-to-severe OSA in the absence of diagnostic polysomnography., The inclusion of preoperative serum bicarbonate level may improve the predictive accuracy of the screening instrument.Although AHI is the most commonly used metric of OSA severity,other parameters such as oxygen desaturation index, or cumulated duration of oxygen desaturation <90% may improve prediction of postoperative complications.Further research in this area will help to better define which patients with diagnosed or suspected OSA are at most risk of postoperative complications.

Table 7. 
Summary of Recommendations for Screening to Identify Patients With Suspected OSA

The aforementioned recommendation does not relate to procedures in which polysomnography is performed as part of the accepted preoperative management, usually because of a high prevalence of OSA (eg, bariatric surgery, tonsillectomy, or upper airway surgery for OSA). Summaries of the different recommendations for screening of surgical patients for OSA are listed in Table 7.

### Abstract (...) [^e843350f]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The majority of these children have mild symptoms, and many outgrow the condition. OSA often results from adenotonsillar hypertrophy, neuromuscular disease, and craniofacial abnormalities. Sleep-disordered breathing refers to a pathophysiologic continuum that includes snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome, obstructive hypopnea syndrome, and OSA. Sleep-disordered breathing in children is a timely public health concern, given the increasing rates of obesity and hyperactivity in this population. As demonstrated in one study, 5 a large percentage of children with hyperactivity or inattentive behaviors had underlying sleep-disordered breathing. These children would be cared for more effectively with appropriate recognition and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing than with the use of stimulant medications. 6–8 However, many children with documented adenotonsillar hypertrophy never have symptoms of OSA.

This finding suggests that the etiology of OSA in children may result from a complex interplay between adenotonsillar hypertrophy and loss of neuromuscular tone. Children with craniofacial syndromes have fixed anatomic variations that predispose them to airway obstruction, while in children with neuromuscular disease, obstruction is caused by hypotonia. Children five years and older commonly exhibit enuresis, behavior problems, deficient attention span, and failure to thrive, in addition to snoring. Compared with adults, fewer children with OSA report excessive daytime somnolence, with the notable exception of obese children. 9 In extreme cases of OSA in children, cor pulmonale and pulmonary hypertension may be the presenting problems. The physical examination must include a neurologic survey for hypotonia and an assessment for obesity.

If examination findings do not correlate with the reported severity of snoring and apnea, children should be evaluated for less common causes of sleep-disordered breathing. Reduction of post-infectious lymphoid hyperplasia relieves the obstruction. Even small reductions in adenotonsillar size can eliminate snoring and OSA. An established pattern of recurrent infections accompanied by sleep disturbance may warrant consideration of adenotonsillectomy. In obese children, weight loss is an excellent therapeutic measure, but it can be a difficult process. Allergy testing and treatment of rhinitis are important in children with OSA secondary to nasal obstruction.

### Diagnosis and perioperative management in pediatric sleep-disordered breathing [^3492c76c]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing has a prevalence of 12% in the pediatric population. It represents a spectrum of disorders encompassing abnormalities of the upper airway that lead to sleep disruption, including primary snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation. Sleep-disordered breathing is the most common indication for adenotonsillectomy, one of the most common procedures performed in children. In recent years, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists have crafted guidelines to help safely manage children with sleep-disordered breathing. Each organization recommends in-laboratory polysomnography for definitive diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in certain cases. However, because this test is both costly and inconvenient, there has been significant interest in alternative methods for diagnosing clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing. Accurate diagnosis is critical because sleep-disordered breathing confers certain perioperative risks and increased mortality in some instances. Recent studies have elucidated the danger of anesthesia and opioids in worsening obstructive sleep apnea, and recommendations for alternative analgesia are being created. In addition, determining the most appropriate level and duration of monitoring in the postoperative period is actively being evaluated. This article presents an overview of the recent literature on the perioperative care of pediatric patients with sleep-disordered breathing. It highlights innovative modalities and limitations in diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea, the importance of a tailored anesthetic/analgesic approach to children with obstructive sleep apnea, and the need for postoperative monitoring. It also brings to focus that further studies on the perioperative care of these children are necessary.

### Sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^e14c5d27]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Additional measures used for diagnosing OSA in children and adolescents include questionnaires validated to assess signs and symptoms associated with OSA. These questionnaires are useful as screening but not as diagnostic tools and may be best suited for research purposes. An example is the Sleep‐Related Breathing Disorder scale from the well‐validated Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire.The Sleep‐Related Breathing Disorder scale has been shown to have a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 87% for polysomnography‐defined OSA.It is effective as a screen to identify children at high versus low risk for OSA.,,Another validated questionnaire used in the evaluation of sleepiness, but not OSA, in children and adolescents is the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for Children and Adolescents (ESS‐CHAD). The ESS‐CHAD is a reliable and an internally valid measure of daytime sleepiness in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age.

Children undergoing evaluation for OSA should also be screened for conditions that may reflect associated morbidity, including those affecting the cardiovascular system such as hypertension and metabolic syndrome (MetS).An assessment of the central nervous system and screening for comorbid behavioral disorders is also recommended.

Because snoring or other nonubiquitous OSA symptoms are often used to identify subjects eligible for pediatric polysomnography, underestimation of OSA prevalence may occur, especially if there is a failure to recognize symptoms of OSA by parents or if clinical signs are absent. Finally, complete laboratory‐based polysomnography remains a resource‐intensive procedure, and therefore the sample sizes of children studied with polysomnography are relatively small.In conclusion, diagnosing OSA in children and adolescents requires a high index of suspicion and, although the diagnosis may be made on the basis of clinical findings, polysomnography is considered to be the gold standard by the American Thoracic Society, AAP, and American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and AAO–HNS. However, according to the AAO–HNS, the premise for the need for polysomnography before tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in children 2 to 18 years of age is if the indication for surgery is SDB, and the child has conditions that increase risk for complications from surgery, such as obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, SCD, or mucopolysaccharidoses.

Tonsillectomy in children—oSDB/OSA outcomes and counseling notes that improvement in obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) occurs in most children but cure in 60% to 70% of subjects, and in a large multicenter study 27% of children had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) cure (AHI <1 event/hour) after tonsillectomy. Cure was less likely with asthma, age >7 years, obesity, or more severe baseline disease, and multiple studies report a variable success rate for tonsillectomy at curing OSA, so counseling families that oSDB may persist or recur after tonsillectomy is important. Especially for children at high risk for residual OSA, one should have a low threshold to perform postoperative polysomnography (PSG).

Summary of the evidence

We identified two published studies that met the inclusion criteria: Chan and colleagues and Digoy and colleagues, including a total of 60 children (aged 6–55 mo) and four outcomes of interest (Table E5). Both studies reported a reduction in AHI after surgery. Chan and colleagues reported a decrease in mean AHI from 14.9 ± 2.8 to 4.9 ± 1.1, with 21/24 children (88%) showing an improvement in AHI. Digoy and colleagues reported a decrease in mean AHI from 13.3 ± 12.9 to 4.1 ± 5.0 (P = 0.001), with 33/36 children (92%) showing a decrease in AHI. Neither study specifically reported resolution of OSA as an outcome.

Chan and colleagues reported a mean oxygen saturation from 88% ± 1.2% at baseline to 88.8% ± 0.6% postoperatively. Digoy and colleagues reported a mean increase in oxygen saturation from 83.0% ± 8.6% to 86.5% ± 4.9% postoperatively (P = 0.015); 58% of patients experienced an increase in saturation. These improvements may be especially clinically relevant if the child has medical complexity, including cardiopulmonary comorbidity.

Snoring improvement was reported by Digoy and colleagues in 25/29 children (86%), with resolution in 15 and improvement in 10.

Outcomes of daytime sleepiness, QOL, cognitive function, behavioral changes, and mood were not reported.

Adverse effects were only reported by Digoy and colleagues, with postoperative dysphagia in seven children, transient dysphagia in five, and dysphagia for >6 months in two others. Postoperative coughing and throat clearing were reported in three children.

Recommendation 5: We suggest that children with sleep-dependent laryngomalacia and persistent OSA may be considered candidates for supraglottoplasty (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the estimates of the effect).

Justification and implementation

This recommendation places a high priority on the need to identify obstruction at the level of the supraglottis (sleep-dependent or congenital laryngomalacia) using DISE in children with persistent OSA.

Desirable consequences and their magnitude

The magnitude of the desirable consequences is difficult to judge, because we only identified two small, retrospective studies. Both studies reported an improvement in OSA severity (AHI and oxygen saturation) after supraglottoplasty.

Outcome modifiers and patient selection considerations in pediatric OSA: Tonsillectomy can improve sleep outcomes in the majority of children versus observation, with effects most clear in healthy, normal-weight children; benefits may be modified by comorbid craniofacial, neuromuscular, genetic, or metabolic disorders, and data are limited for significant comorbidities such that first-line status in these children, especially with mild OSA, remains unknown. Obesity can be associated with more severe baseline OSA, less robust response, and potential postoperative weight gain concerns.

Tonsillectomy in children—postoperative inpatient monitoring: Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are <3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA; apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir <80%, or both). Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Children aged <3 years with oSDB symptoms are at increased risk of respiratory compromise after tonsillectomy as compared with older children, including a review of 2315 children aged <6 years in which 9.8% of children aged <3 years experienced a respiratory complication postoperatively as compared with 4.9% of older children, and a study of >300 children in which those <3 years of age had a major respiratory complication 29.2% of the time. Postoperative care should include continuous pulse oximetry and the availability of more intensive levels of care, including respiratory support (intubation, supplemental O2, CPAP). The literature suggests that the following children may benefit from observation in an inpatient setting: children with complicated medical histories, obese children (BMI >95th percentile for age/sex) without PSG to quantify OSA severity, and children with behavioral factors that predict poor oral intake or difficult pain management postoperatively. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with a medium level of confidence.

Tonsillectomy in children—research priorities on outcomes and perioperative care include determining if the 12-month watchful waiting period causes unnecessary morbidity based on QoL and school performance measures, defining the optimal follow-up schedule for oSDB after tonsillectomy, specifying when postoperative polysomnogram is indicated after tonsillectomy for oSDB and when a preoperative polysomnogram is indicated, determining the percentage of patients with full resolution, partial resolution, or no resolution of OSA posttonsillectomy in the short and long term, assessing how future weight gain or obesity play a role in failure to respond following tonsillectomy for OSA, assessing the immunologic role of the tonsils and when the benefits of tonsillectomy exceed the harm using a biomarker approach, determining the cost-effectiveness (direct and indirect) of different tonsillectomy techniques, evaluating and comparing oral postoperative pain medications, developing a unified set of core outcomes important to children and caregivers, determining the optimal regimen for treating PONV in children who have received dexamethasone, and encouraging self-monitoring of postoperative bleeding rates yearly.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^9a33c501]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Obesity and tonsillectomy in children—obesity is defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥95th percentile, with categories of normal weight (BMI, 5th to <85th percentile), overweight (BMI, 85th to <95th percentile), and obese (BMI, ≥95th percentile); recommendations are directed at obese children, for example an 8‑year‑old boy, height 4 ft 10 in / 1.44 m, would have to weigh ≥100 lb / ≥45 kg, not overweight children. The prevalence of obstructive sleep‑disordered breathing (oSDB) in obese children is unknown, but in reported cohorts 41% of the obese children had severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and between 33% and 76% had evidence of persistent but improved OSA following tonsillectomy. Because clinical assessment is a poor predictor and many obese children have severe OSA, it is prudent to admit any obese child following a tonsillectomy if PSG has not been obtained to quantify the severity of oSDB, even though currently many pediatric otolaryngologists are not performing PSG prior to tonsillectomy in obese children.
