## Question

What is flat affect

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about flat affect, including its definition, clinical features, neurobiological correlates, assessment, differential diagnosis, longitudinal course, and treatment implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and where it sits within negative symptom domains. Then, I should verify the observable clinical manifestations across modalities. Next, I will examine neurobiological correlates and reconcile apparent discrepancies. After that, I need to review assessment methods, including objective measures and their limitations. Then, I should differentiate flat affect from related conditions and consider developmental influences. Finally, I will synthesize longitudinal course and treatment implications, and close with a concise, clinically useful definition and takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the core definition and nosology. Flat affect is a negative symptom characterized by diminished outward emotional expressiveness, typically grouped within the "expressive deficits" subdomain alongside alogia, poor rapport, and lack of spontaneity, distinct from the "social amotivation" subdomain that includes avolition and asociality, and it is a core feature of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders in DSM-5 formulations [^1172pZRL] [^113trJQS]. Wait, let me verify the expressive versus experiential distinction: classic studies and contemporary reviews emphasize that flat affect reflects reduced motoric-emotional expression rather than a generalized inability to feel emotions, aligning with the notion of diminished expression rather than anhedonia per se [^111iNRRH] [^112y8M1K].

> I will now examine the clinical manifestations across modalities. Facial expressiveness is notably reduced, with minimal movement of facial muscles and limited range of emotional display, which clinicians often rate as severe flattening on standardized scales such as PANSS N1 or SANS affective flattening items [^113DemBL] [^111NNZ4E]. Let me consider speech: patients speak with less inflection, reduced pitch variability, and a more monotonic prosody, and acoustic analyses consistently show decreased variance in fundamental frequency and amplitude, confirming an objective correlate of perceived flatness [^1122XjhE] [^111mKZye]. Hold on, I should verify body language: motor retardation and reduced spontaneous gestures are commonly observed and contribute to the global impression of blunted expressiveness, reinforcing the motor-expressive deficit model rather than a primary emotional experience deficit [^1172pZRL].

> Next, I should review neurobiological correlates. Functional imaging studies indicate that while some limbic regions like the amygdala are recruited during facial emotion perception in both schizophrenia and controls, flat affect severity correlates with altered activity in the amygdala and parahippocampal regions, suggesting a modulation of normal affective circuits rather than their complete absence [^11524q2f]. Wait, let me verify network-level findings: lagged functional connectivity between salience and default mode networks has been linked to flat affect severity, supporting dysconnectivity models of negative symptoms, and DLPFC hypofunction has been repeatedly implicated in negative and cognitive symptom domains, offering plausible targets for neuromodulation [^112cYV6N] [^114e4a52]. I should also note that microglial dysregulation and neurodevelopmental pruning abnormalities have been hypothesized to contribute to negative symptom pathophysiology, though these are indirect and heterogeneous lines of evidence that require cautious interpretation [^113trJQS].

> I need to ensure the assessment strategy is clear. Clinically, flat affect is typically rated on structured instruments such as PANSS or SANS, but I should double-check the validity concerns: subjective ratings can be influenced by rater expectations and show modest concordance with objective measures, so complementary acoustic and behavioral analytics are warranted [^1175yVXX]. Objective speech analysis demonstrates reduced pitch variability and monotonicity in flat affect, and broader meta-analytic work confirms atypical acoustic features linked to negative symptoms, albeit with heterogeneity and modest effect sizes, reinforcing the need for standardized tasks and measurement protocols [^1122XjhE] [^111mKZye]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: integrating clinical ratings with objective speech markers can mitigate rater bias and improve measurement-based care for negative symptoms [^1175yVXX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about internal experience. I should confirm the distinction between flat affect and anhedonia: multiple experience-sampling studies in schizophrenia show that patients with prominent negative symptoms often report preserved capacity to experience emotions, even if their outward expression is blunted, supporting a dissociation between experience and expression in many cases [^112y8M1K]. But wait, what if positive affect reactivity is actually increased in some anhedonia phenotypes? Indeed, ecological studies suggest more variability and, in some contexts, stronger high-arousal positive reactivity in anhedonia, underscoring that "flatness" pertains to expression rather than a uniform internal deficit [^114BZdPr]. I should also note that in organic delusional syndromes, flat affect is less common than in schizophrenia, helping with differential diagnosis when neurocognitive or perceptual features are present [^111sNnDF].

> Next, I should review developmental influences. Let me verify age-related effects: in antipsychotic-naïve first-episode psychosis, flat affect tends to decrease with increasing age, whereas anhedonia increases, suggesting different developmental trajectories within negative symptom domains and highlighting the need to interpret symptoms in developmental context [^111LrABY]. I need to ensure I mention pediatric considerations: flattened affect is a common negative symptom in early-onset schizophrenia and often contributes to chronic functional impairment even when positive symptoms remit, reinforcing its clinical salience in youth [^1123gJDR].

> I will now examine longitudinal course and functional impact. Long-term follow-up of first-episode psychosis shows that while most patients experience fluctuating or improving flat affect over 10 years, a minority have enduring flat affect, which predicts poorer social functioning and worse overall outcomes across the follow-up period [^113DemBL]. Let me double-check the link to social cognition: flat affect uniquely predicts impaired performance on emotion processing tasks, particularly intensity differentiation, and is associated with worse premorbid adjustment and lower quality of life, aligning with the broader negative symptom burden that impedes real-world functioning [^115EnWGZ]. I should confirm that pervasive negative symptoms, including flat affect, mark a more severe illness phenotype with greater familial risk, which has implications for genetic and clinical stratification [^115B472k].

> Now, treatment implications. I need to check pharmacologic data: antipsychotics primarily target positive symptoms, and negative symptoms like flat affect often remain resistant. Small randomized trials suggest that adjunctive antidepressants may modestly improve affective flattening and related negative symptoms, but evidence is limited and heterogeneous, so expectations should be tempered and individualized [^11652Wx2]. Let me consider neuromodulation: given DLPFC hypofunction and network dysconnectivity implicated in negative symptoms, non-invasive brain stimulation is a promising but still investigational approach, with mixed and site- and protocol-dependent effects to date [^114e4a52]. I should also emphasize psychosocial and rehabilitative strategies that target expressive deficits and social functioning, as these may yield incremental gains even when pharmacotherapy is limited [^notfound].

> But wait, what about measurement-based care and objective monitoring over time? I should confirm that integrating repeated acoustic analyses and clinical ratings can track change in expressive deficits more reliably than either alone, supporting iterative treatment adjustments and shared understanding with patients and families about goals and progress [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with broader calls for digital biomarkers in psychiatry; yes, emerging frameworks endorse multimodal, objective assessments to complement traditional scales, especially for negative symptoms where rater variance is high [^1175yVXX].

> Final synthesis: Flat affect is best understood as a negative symptom reflecting a deficit in the outward expression of emotion, manifesting as reduced facial expressiveness, monotonic and inflection-poor speech, and limited gestural/motor expressivity, with neurobiological correlates including amygdala-parahippocampal modulation and salience–default mode network dysconnectivity, and with measurable objective acoustic markers that complement but do not replace clinical ratings. Crucially, it is not synonymous with anhedonia, as internal emotional experience is often preserved, and its severity and persistence predict worse social outcomes, warranting targeted assessment and individualized, multimodal interventions within a developmental and longitudinal framework [^1172pZRL] [^1145LSTg] [^1122XjhE] [^11524q2f] [^112cYV6N] [^112y8M1K] [^113DemBL].

Flat affect is a **lack of emotional expression** — minimal facial movement, monotone speech, and reduced body language — most strongly linked to schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders [^113trJQS] [^1172pZRL]. It reflects a **motor-expressive deficit** rather than absent emotions, with intact internal feelings but impaired outward display [^111iNRRH] [^112y8M1K]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by PANSS/SANS ratings and objective speech analysis showing reduced pitch/variance [^1175yVXX] [^1165Hke5] [^1122XjhE]. Flat affect is associated with worse social functioning and quality of life, and treatment focuses on antipsychotics, psychosocial rehabilitation, and speech therapy; prognosis varies, with some cases persistent and others improving over time [^113DemBL] [^115EnWGZ] [^114e4a52].

## Clinical features and symptoms

Flat affect is characterized by the following **clinical features**:

- **Facial expression**: Minimal or absent facial movement, lack of emotional responsiveness, and reduced expressiveness [^notfound].

- **Speech**: Monotone or monotonic speech, reduced pitch variability, and decreased speech rate [^111mKZye].

- **Body language**: Minimal gesturing, reduced body movement, and lack of emotional engagement [^1172pZRL].

- **Eye contact**: Reduced or absent eye contact, contributing to social disengagement [^notfound].

These features collectively contribute to a **lack of emotional expressiveness**, making individuals appear emotionally detached or unresponsive [^1177h9QD].

---

## Associated psychiatric conditions

Flat affect is most commonly associated with the following **psychiatric conditions**:

| **Psychiatric condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Schizophrenia | Flat affect is a core negative symptom, reflecting diminished emotional expression and contributing to social impairment [^113DemBL] [^1172pZRL] |
| Schizoaffective disorder | Similar to schizophrenia, flat affect is a prominent negative symptom [^112y8M1K] |
| Depression | Particularly in severe or chronic cases, flat affect may be present [^112eUqCM] |
| Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) | Emotional numbing and flat affect are common symptoms [^notfound] |
| Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) | Flat affect may be observed, particularly in social communication difficulties [^notfound] |

---

## Neurobiological basis

Research suggests that flat affect is associated with **abnormalities in brain regions and neural circuits** involved in emotional processing and expression:

- **Prefrontal cortex**: Reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), has been implicated in flat affect [^notfound].

- **Limbic system**: Altered activity in the limbic system, including the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, has been observed in individuals with flat affect [^notfound].

- **Basal ganglia**: Dysfunction in the basal ganglia, involved in motor control and emotional expression, has also been linked to flat affect [^notfound].

These neurobiological abnormalities collectively contribute to the **diminished emotional expression** characteristic of flat affect [^112cYV6N].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and assessment tools

Flat affect is primarily assessed through **clinical observation and standardized rating scales**. Commonly used tools include:

- **Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)**: Specifically, the N1 item (flat affect) is used to assess the severity of flat affect [^113DemBL].

- **Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)**: This scale includes items specifically designed to evaluate flat affect and other negative symptoms [^1165Hke5].

- **Acoustic analysis**: Objective measures of speech patterns, such as pitch variability and speech rate, provide additional evidence of flat affect [^1122XjhE].

---

## Impact on daily functioning and social interactions

Flat affect significantly impairs **daily functioning and social interactions**. Individuals with flat affect often experience:

- **Social isolation**: Difficulty forming and maintaining relationships due to perceived emotional detachment [^113DemBL].

- **Occupational impairment**: Reduced ability to engage in workplace interactions and communication [^notfound].

- **Quality of life**: Lower overall quality of life due to limited emotional expression and social engagement [^115EnWGZ].

---

## Treatment approaches

Treatment of flat affect typically involves a **combination of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions**:

- **Pharmacological treatment**: Antipsychotic medications, particularly second-generation antipsychotics, are commonly used to manage flat affect in schizophrenia and related disorders [^notfound].

- **Psychosocial interventions**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), social skills training, and speech therapy are effective in improving emotional expression and social functioning [^1141XPx9].

- **Combination therapy**: Combining pharmacological and psychosocial treatments yields the most significant improvements in emotional expression and social functioning [^11652Wx2].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

The prognosis of flat affect varies depending on the underlying condition, severity, and treatment adherence. In schizophrenia, flat affect is often persistent and may **persist despite treatment**, significantly impacting long-term social functioning and quality of life [^113DemBL]. However, with appropriate treatment and psychosocial support, some individuals experience **improvement in emotional expression and social functioning** over time [^1141XPx9].

### Reassessing chain tilt in the lamellar crystals of polyethylene [^111F89wS]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The following factors have been suggested to affect the degree of the density anomaly (Fig. 1e): (i) the chain tilt in the crystallite, (ii) the fraction of the tightly folded chains (sharp folds) on the flat faces of lamellae, and (iii) the fraction of the chain ends on the flat faces. These factors affect the polymer chain overcrowding and consequently the total free energy. Increasing the chain tilt angle φ (Figs. 1b, c) reduces the area density of folded chains because the flat-face area per chain increases by a factor of 1/cos φ –. A moderate fraction of sharp folds (~1/3) mitigates the chain density near the flat faces. Chain ends on the flat faces make space for adjacent folded chains. Although these three factors work cooperatively to mitigate the density anomaly, the relationships between them have not been fully evaluated, owing to the difficulty of observing the molecular-scale structures in real space. Because the chain tilt in lamellar crystals has a larger structural scale than that of the other two elements (chain folds and ends on the flat faces of lamellar crystals), nanoscale observation of chain tilt is a key to understanding the relationships between the aforementioned factors. Furthermore, chain tilt affects the lamellar surface energyand related properties (such as the melting point) –. For instance, φ -dependent differences have been observed in the melting points of single crystals. Thus, the experimental investigation of the chain tilt is important from the viewpoint of structure–property relationships.

### Neuroimaging markers of aberrant brain activity and treatment response in schizophrenia patients based on brain complexity [^116uQxty]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex mental disorder characterized by symptoms that include positive symptoms (such as delusions and hallucinations), negative symptoms (such as emotional flatness and social withdrawal), and cognitive deficits. Although antipsychotic medications have been widely used to alleviate these symptoms, the exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying the action of antipsychotic remain unclear. The complexity theory posits that the brain operates as a system characterized by self-organization, nonlinearity, and chaotic attributes. The characteristic disorganization and unpredictability of thought and behavior in schizophrenia mirror the intrinsic chaos of complex systems, characterized by heightened sensitivity and instability, underscoring the relevance of complexity theory in understanding psychosis. Therefore, complexity theory could serve as a valuable clinical tool to assess symptom severity and predict treatment outcomes in SZ.

Neural complexity refers to the brain's capacity to explore different states. Various resting-state models suggest that brain activity fluctuations balance between stable and synchronous states, with rapid transitions enabling the brain to reconfigure functional networks at a low energy barrier, optimizing responses to environmental demands. Stochastic resonance models show that moderate amounts of noise help subthreshold neurons reach firing thresholds, increasing neuronal firing and enhancing information processing. Low complexity indicates insufficient noise, failing to promote neuronal firing effectively, leading to reduced information processing capacity. Thus, higher complexity has greater potential and propensity for information processing. Both the disease state and deterioration have the potential to impact the complexity of brain activity, leading to degradation of their information processing, thereby making individuals less adaptable to the demands of frequently changing environments. This ability is frequently compromised in individuals with SZ, resulting in abnormal behavioral patterns and impaired cognitive and psychosocial functions. For example, consider a random number generation test where participants were instructed to choose numbers between 1 and 10 multiple times, aiming to create sequences devoid of any noticeable pattern. The findings indicated that individuals with SZ tended to produce sequences with a higher frequency of repetitions. In another examination, using the Test of Random Rhythm Generation, it was observed that individuals with SZ tended to generate time sequences that were more structured and rhythmic compared to the control group. These structured sequences reveal the degeneration of information processing abilities in SZ patients, who may be more susceptible to cognitive burdens when dealing with complex tasks, thus limiting their ability to cope when faced with complex, uncertain environments.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^115J6qtB]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Plantar heel pain initial (tier 1) management — evidence-based medicine (EBM) conclusions cite Padding and strapping of the foot [Grade B recommendation], Therapeutic orthotic insoles [Grade B recommendation], Cortisone injections [Grade B recommendation], and Achilles and plantar fascia stretching [Grade B recommendation]. Initial treatments include regular Achilles and plantar fascia stretching, avoidance of flat shoes and barefoot walking, cryotherapy applied directly to the affected part, over-the-counter arch supports and heel cups, and limitation of extended (high-impact) physical activities, and patients usually have a clinical response within 6 weeks of initiation of treatment; if little or no improvement is noted, the patient should be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon if not already under this specialist's care.

### Comparison of 27-gauge beveled-tip and 25-gauge flat-tip microincision vitrectomy surgery in the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy: a randomized controlled trial [^116Zier9]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

According to the existing clinical and fluidics studies, due to its small gauge, the conventional 27G vitrectomy system may take a longer time to cut the vitreous, which can also affect the overall surgical process. The 27G beveled-tip vitrectomy system has the additional characteristics of an ultrahigh cutting rate, which can be up to 10,000 cpm. This improvement is intended to maximize the working efficiency of vitreous cutting. One article showed that the cutting efficiency of 27G systems might not be as high as that of 25G systems, but it has been greatly improved with the use of beveled-tip VPs over flat-tip VPs. Our study also observed this finding. The difference resulting from the use of the 27G beveled-tip VP operating at 10,000 cpm and the 25G flat-tip VP operating at 7500 cpm in the removal of the core vitreous could be considered insignificant. However, we suspect that the vitrectomy time might still affect the total operation time, which was shorter in the 27G group but not significant.

In other aspects of the surgery, the proportion of eyes with postoperative scleral suture in the 27G group was significantly lower. This has also been reported in other studies on traditional MIVS systems. Sutureless vitrectomy can optimize the surgical procedure, avoid patient discomfort caused by residual conjunctival sutures, and reduce corneal astigmatism after surgery. Therefore, the 27G beveled-tip MIVS is more advantageous in both surgery and patient recovery. In addition, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of patients undergoing combined cataract surgery, the types of endotamponade used and intravitreous injection, which may indicate that the use of the advanced vitrectomy system would not cause more interference and affect the routine operation.

In terms of postoperative outcomes, compared with that at baseline, the BCVA of all patients gradually improved at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. The degree of improvement was similar between the two groups. Furthermore, except for a significant elevation at 1 week after the surgery, the IOP was maintained at normal levels at most time point. However, temporary intraocular hypertension is not a serious adverse event. Overall, the use of 27G beveled-tip MIVS for treating PDR is not inferior to traditional 25G flat-tip MIVS. The two groups of patients achieved satisfactory treatment outcomes.

### Striatal response to reward anticipation as a biomarker for schizophrenia and negative symptoms: effects, test-retest reliability, and stability across sites [^1161c2CK]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical and Cognitive Assessment

All participants underwent a complete clinical assessment in French in Switzerland and in German in Germany. Negative symptom severity was primarily assessed using the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS). Apathy and diminished expression dimensions were extracted as defined in previous studies. Specifically, the apathy dimension was composed of the sums of avolition, asociality, and anhedonia scores, while diminished expression included alogia and flat affect scores. Raters at both sites were trained by SK who was the principal investigator of the validation study of the German version of the BNSS.

Positive and negative symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and scores were defined based on the factor decomposition from Wallwork, Fortgang. Depression symptoms were evaluated with the Calgary Depression Scale (CDS). Extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated with the St. Hans Rating Scale (SHRS). Cognition was assessed using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). Due to the variety of antipsychotics prescribed to patients, we calculated risperidone equivalence based on the defined daily doses method.

### Progesterone (prochieve) [^111NU3ks]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Remove the applicator from the sealed wrapper. DO NOT remove the twist-off tab at this time. For use at altitudes above 2500 feet, see special instructions below.
Hold the applicator between the thumb and forefinger along the seam on the sides of the bulb. Shake down vigorously 3 to 4 times (like a thermometer) to ensure that the contents are at the thin end of the applicator.
Hold the applicator by the flat section of the bulb. Twist off the tab at the thin end and throw away. DO NOT squeeze the bulb while twisting the tab. This could force some gel to be released before it is inserted.

Twist off completely – Do not pull off
The applicator may be inserted into the vagina while you are in a sitting position or when lying on your back with your knees bent. Gently insert the thin end well into the vagina.
Squeeze the bulb of the applicator to deposit the gel into the vagina. Remove the applicator and throw it away in a waste container. Do not be concerned if a small amount of gel is left in the applicator. You will still be receiving the appropriate, measured dosage.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AT ALTITUDES ABOVE 2500 FEET

Remove the applicator from the sealed wrapper. DO NOT remove the twist-off tab at this time. Hold the applicator on both sides of the bulb, as shown. Using a lancet or a stick pin, make a single puncture in the flat part of the bulb. This will relieve the difference in air pressure between the inside and outside of the applicator caused by high altitudes. It will not affect the amount of gel administered. You will still be receiving the appropriate, measured dosage.
See Step 2 above.
See Step 3 above.
See Step 4 above.
Place your thumb or finger over the puncture that you made in the bulb of the applicator. Squeeze the bulb of the applicator to deposit the gel into the vagina. Remove the applicator and throw it away in a waste container. Do not be concerned if a small amount of gel is left in the applicator. You will still be receiving the appropriate, measured dosage.

### Microglia activation in postmortem brains with schizophrenia demonstrates distinct morphological changes between brain regions [^113trJQS]. Brain Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex disorder that has a diverse range of phenotypic presentations. Symptoms of SCZ include (1) delusions, (2) hallucinations, (3) disorganized speech, (4) disorganized or catatonic behavior, and (5) flat or blunted affect/negative symptoms. In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders‐5 (DSM‐5), 1 of the 5 aforementioned symptoms were required if hallucinations included a running commentary on a person's thoughts and behaviors. The psychosis has an onset in adolescence and is significantly debilitating and interferes with day‐to‐day affairs. The neurodevelopmental hypothesis of SCZ proposes that SCZ results from alterations in neuronal connectivity occurring during neuronal development. In line with this hypothesis, there has been evidence of increased production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines recognized by over‐activating microglia during fetal gestation and well into adulthood. The consequences of over‐stimulated microglia from prolonged exposure to an inflamed or excitotoxic environment during neuronal development may cause over‐pruning of synapses by microglia because they are predisposed to inflammatory mediators. It has been suggested that over‐stimulated microglia also play a role during early adulthood, as they have been shown to disturb cortical maturation and affect synaptic pruning during adolescence in populations that are considered at high risk for psychosis.

Microglia cells are a heterogeneous cell type derived from primitive myeloid precursors cells (i.e. formed outside of the brain), which give rise to the monocyte‐macrophage‐like lineage. Microglia can also come from primitive macrophages that differentiate in the yolk sac early in development. Microglia are continuously surveying the central nervous system (CNS), and besides responding to inflammatory insults, these cells support synaptic addition, elimination, and plasticity. In cases of SCZ, it is proposed that an increase in monocytes and lymphocytes are recruited from the peripheral blood and exaggerate the CNS immune responses by cooperating with the brain‐derived microglia. When considering the differentiaion between residual and paranoid SCZ, using the DSM‐4 criteria, it has been shown that the densities of CD3 + and CD20 + lymphocytes in the hippocampus were significantly higher in the SCZ groups versus the control groups which indicated diverse immune endophenotypes in SCZ.

### Clinical variables and genetic loading for schizophrenia: analysis of published Danish adoption study data [^115B472k]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2002). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia shows considerable clinical variation, but the relationship between clinical variables and degree of genetic loading for schizophrenia is unclear. We investigated this by analyzing published data from the adoption study of Kety et al. (1994) in Denmark. We sought to determine which clinical variables in proband adoptees with chronic schizophrenia predicted risk of schizophrenia in their biological relatives, using logistic regression analysis. We found that risk of chronic schizophrenia in relatives was predicted by the presence of pervasive negative symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 9.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.98–45.01) and absence of pervasive positive symptoms (OR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.01–0.78) in probands. Pervasive negative symptoms were defined by the presence of all of the symptoms: social withdrawal, autistic behavior, poverty of thought/speech, and flat affect. Pervasive positive symptoms were defined by the presence of all of the symptoms: suspiciousness/ideas of reference, delusions, auditory hallucinations, and other hallucinations. These clinical variables may be useful for refining phenotypic definitions of schizophrenia in molecular genetic studies.

### Voice patterns in schizophrenia: a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis [^111mKZye]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Voice atypicalities have been a characteristic feature of schizophrenia since its first definitions. They are often associated with core negative symptoms such as flat affect and alogia, and with the social impairments seen in the disorder. This suggests that voice atypicalities may represent a marker of clinical features and social functioning in schizophrenia. We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the evidence for distinctive acoustic patterns in schizophrenia, as well as their relation to clinical features. We identified 46 articles, including 55 studies with a total of 1254 patients with schizophrenia and 699 healthy controls. Summary effect sizes (Hedges'g and Pearson's r) estimates were calculated using multilevel Bayesian modeling. We identified weak atypicalities in pitch variability (g = -0.55) related to flat affect, and stronger atypicalities in proportion of spoken time, speech rate, and pauses (g's between -0.75 and -1.89) related to alogia and flat affect. However, the effects were mostly modest (with the important exception of pause duration) compared to perceptual and clinical judgments, and characterized by large heterogeneity between studies. Moderator analyses revealed that tasks with a more demanding cognitive and social component showed larger effects both in contrasting patients and controls and in assessing symptomatology. In conclusion, studies of acoustic patterns are a promising but, yet unsystematic avenue for establishing markers of schizophrenia. We outline recommendations towards more cumulative, open, and theory-driven research.

### Molecular mechanics underlying flat-to-round membrane budding in live secretory cells [^113Toem1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Our finding of dynamin/actin's role in mediating Flat→Λ→Ω→O transition challenges the current view on clathrin-dependent endocytosis, where clathrin is considered to be the primary factor for pit formation, dynamin is supposed to cut the pit's narrow neck, and actin is suggested to facilitate endocytosis by overcoming membrane tension. We suggest that dynamin and actin participate in generating pulling and constriction forces required for pit formation, whereas membrane coating with clathrin and its partner proteins may confine the pit size to ~40–100 nm, the size of the clathrin-formed cages. Supporting this suggestion, initiation and maturation of fluorescent clathrin spots, which presumably involve pit formation, depend on dynamin and actin, suggesting that dynamin and actin may regulate clathrin-dependent endocytosis before fission.

Dynamin knockout leads to the accumulation of Ω-profiles and long tubes at the plasma membrane –. We consider two reasons that may reconcile this EM observation with our live-cell observation that dynamin is involved in not only Ω→O, but also Flat→Λ and Λ→Ω. First, the EM observation was obtained from cells lacking dynamin for days to weeks –, whereas Flat→Λ, Λ→Ω and Ω→O transitions were measured within 60 s after depol 1s in live cells (Figs. 3, 4, and 6). If dynamin inhibition prolongs Flat→Λ and Λ→Ω transition time from seconds to minutes or hours, but not days or weeks, it may explain why dynamin inhibition reduced Flat→Λ and Λ→Ω transitions measured within 60 s (Figs. 3, 4, and 6), but increased the number of invaginations observed with EM in days or weeks afterwards –. Similarly, if dynamin inhibition reduces Flat→Λ and Λ→Ω transition by a lesser extent than Ω→Ο transition measured in days or weeks after the transition is initiated, accumulation of Ω-profiles by dynamin inhibition would be observed in days or weeks later. Second, Λ-profiles have not been quantified in cells lacking dynamin –, likely because without real-time observation, it is difficult to determine whether a Λ-profile stems from an endocytic Flat→Λ transition or from a non-endocytic membrane folding. Furthermore, without real-time observation, a change in the Λ-profile number reflects the net change of both Flat→Λ and Λ→Ω, making it difficult to pinpoint which specific transition is affected. Accordingly, it remains unclear whether dynamin knockout affects Λ-profile formation or not. Our finding of dynamin involvement in Flat→Λ, Λ→Ω and Ω→Ο is thus not in conflict with the observation of accumulated invaginations in dynamin knockout cells.

### The hypoandrogenic woman: pathophysiologic overview [^117TcpYS]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pathophysiologic changes associated with androgen insufficiency in the female.

Design

A review of the English-language literature from 1940 to 2001.

Conclusion(S)

Data suggest that diminished androgen levels, most frequently noted in the surgically menopausal patient, may be associated with a number of symptoms including reduced sexual libido and desire, loss of motivation, flat affect, and reduced energy. Lack of consensus in defining abnormally low values for free and total serum androgen levels have made the definition of hypoandrogenic states difficult.

### Detection of facial expressions of emotions in schizophrenia [^111hpgFR]. Schizophrenia Research (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to examine spatial processing of facial emotion in schizophrenic patients suffering from affective symptoms. A face-in-the-crowd task using schematic stimuli was administered to schizophrenic patients with flat affect (n = 30), schizophrenic patients suffering from anhedonia (n = 30), schizophrenic patients not suffering from anhedonia or flat affect (n = 28), and a group of healthy controls (n = 30). Participants searched displays of neutral schematic faces for a face with a positive or negative mouth expression. Schizophrenic patients manifested a general slowing of response speed compared to normal subjects. All patient groups as well as normal subjects found negative faces more quickly than positive faces amongst neutral faces. Unexpectedly, with increasing anhedonia as assessed by psychiatric rating, a more efficient spatial detection of positive facial expression was observed. For flat-affect patients only, efficiency of search for negative facial expression did not differ from that in the neutral face control condition. This response pattern indicates that, in flat-affect schizophrenic patients, spatial search of negative facial expression might be slowed after the initial engagement of search processes. Potential explanations of the face processing effects found in anhedonia are discussed.

### Nomenclature and diagnosis of seronegative coeliac disease and chronic non-coeliac enteropathies in adults: the paris consensus [^117MZ8yz]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

A multidisciplinary task force with specific expertise on the diagnosis and treatment of CD and NCEs was created to first identify the conditions responsible for VA with negative coeliac serology, and then propose definitions and diagnostic criteria. The panel of experts was recruited at the 16th International Coeliac Disease Symposium, Paris, France, 5–7 September 2019. The final diagnostic criteria are referred as 'the Paris consensus'. This task force focused on chronic conditions affecting adult patients. We excluded from our analysis transient VA as occurs with acute GI disorders (ie, viral/bacterial gastroenteritis), which can lead to a transient flat mucosa spontaneously healing over time. Paediatric conditions were outside the purposes of the present work.

### A comparison of clinical ratings with vocal acoustic measures of flat affect and alogia [^1165Hke5]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2002). Low credibility.

In this report we compare clinical ratings of flat affect and alogia with objective measures of the patient's speech prosody and productivity. Thirty schizophrenic patients were evaluated with the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the St. Hans Rating Scale for extra pyramidal side effects. Their speech was recorded and analyzed acoustically for measures of prosody and productivity. Correlations between pairs of SANS items and acoustic measures (e.g. Vocal Inflection and Fundamental Frequency Variance) were weak. The SANS item and global ratings were strongly related. Ratings of bradykinesia overlapped with the SANS ratings but not with the acoustic measures. The SANS ratings appear to be derived from global impressions, with diffuse confounding of flat affect with alogia, and with bradykinesia. Acoustic analysis has the potential to provide objective measures that may help develop operational definitions of these constructs and enhance clinical assessment.

### Gender similarities in somatic depression and in DSM depression secondary symptom profiles within the context of severity and bereavement [^112eUqCM]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Most population studies report higher rates of depression among women than men, and some researchers have observed gender differences in depression symptoms overall, or in sub-groupings (e.g. somatic depression). However, gender symptom differences have been inconsistent, prompting this investigation of gender differences in secondary DSM symptom profiles in the context of bereavement status, age, and depression severity.

Methods

Individuals with symptoms of core depression (flat affect or anhedonia) were selected from a large survey of adults in the Alberta, Canada workforce. Analyses involved the comparison of gender profiles across the seven DSM-IV secondary depressive symptoms plus a MANOVA of sex, bereavement, and age, with secondary symptoms comprising the dependent variable.

Results

Gender profiles were very similar, irrespective of depression severity or bereavement. Secondary symptoms were marginally more common among women and more frequent among bereaved young adults, but there was no evidence for a gender-related somatic factor.

Limitations

First, data were gathered only for persons in the workforce and thus may not be generalizable to, for example, stay-at-home parents or those with employment issues. Second, the focus here is restricted to DSM symptoms, leaving risk factors, social roles, and brain functioning for separate investigation. Third, inferences were drawn from associations between groups of persons, rather than between individuals, requiring caution when speculating about individual attributes.

Conclusions

Gender differences in depression represent a difference in amount, not kind, suggesting that the range of depressive experiences is similar for men and women. There was no gender difference ascribable to somatic depression.

### Computerized measurement of negative symptoms in schizophrenia [^1134LZLA]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2008). Low credibility.

Accurate measurement of negative symptoms is crucial for understanding and treating schizophrenia. However, current measurement strategies are reliant on subjective symptom rating scales, which often have psychometric and practical limitations. Computerized analysis of patients' speech offers a sophisticated and objective means of evaluating negative symptoms. The present study examined the feasibility and validity of using widely-available acoustic and lexical-analytic software to measure flat affect, alogia and anhedonia (via positive emotion). These measures were examined in their relationships to clinically-rated negative symptoms and social functioning. Natural speech samples were collected and analyzed for 14 patients with clinically-rated flat affect, 46 patients without flat affect and 19 healthy controls. The computer-based inflection and speech rate measures significantly discriminated patients with flat affect from controls, and the computer-based measure of alogia and negative emotion significantly discriminated the flat and nonflat patients. Both the computer and clinical measures of positive emotion/anhedonia corresponded to functioning impairments. The computerized method of assessing negative symptoms offered a number of advantages over the symptom scale-based approach.

### Two subdomains of negative symptoms in psychotic disorders: established and confirmed in two large cohorts [^1172pZRL]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are normally grouped into a single category. However, the diversity of such symptoms suggests that they are actually made up of more than one dimension. The DSM-V proposes two negative symptom domains, namely expressive deficits and avolition/asociality. We investigated whether the negative symptoms do indeed have two dimensions. An exploratory factor analysis was carried out based on interviews with the PANSS (664 patients). We restricted our analysis to items that had been described as negative symptoms in previous factor analyses. The symptom structure was then tested for stability by performing a confirmatory factor analysis on PANSS interviews from a separate cohort (2172 patients). Exploratory factor analysis yielded a two-factor structure of negative symptoms. The first factor consisted of PANSS items Flat affect, Poor rapport, Lack of spontaneity, Mannerisms and posturing, Motor retardation, and Avolition. The second factor consisted of Emotional withdrawal, Passive/apathetic social withdrawal, and Active social avoidance. The first factor could be related to expressive deficits, reflecting a loss of initiative, and the second factor to social amotivation, related to community interaction. This factor structure supports the DSM-V classification and may be relevant for pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

### Drop-shaped microgrooves guide unidirectional cell migration for enhanced endothelialization [^1138JXAp]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Results

Microgrooves alter cell morphology

We first demonstrated the design of drop-shaped microgrooves (Fig. 1 a, b, Supplementary Fig. 1). Compared to ordinary parallel microgrooves (Fig. 1a), we designed two sizes of drop-shaped microgrooves (Drop-s and Drop-l) (Fig. 1b). The characteristic of drop-shaped microgrooves is that they have local asymmetry on the cell migration path. We anticipate that this asymmetry could restrict the direction of cell migration. In ordinary parallel microgrooves, there are two directions for cell migration, while in grooves with local asymmetry, the direction of cell migration is usually limited to a single direction (Fig. 1 a, b). To compare whether different types of microgrooves have the same ability to restrict cell morphology, we first studied the cell morphology on flat surfaces and grooves with different patterns (Fig. 1d–h). On flat surfaces, cells had fully spread out and were approximately circular. On various grooved surfaces, the spreading of cells was restricted, and cells were elongated along the direction of the grooves, resembling a bar shape. Cells on grooved surfaces showed an obvious orientation along the groove direction. The parallel grooves and drop-shaped microgrooves had a similar restricting effect on cells; on larger drop-shaped microgrooves (Drop-l), the cells spread out over a larger area, and their shapes deviated slightly from the bar shape. The restriction imposed by the microgrooves was also transmitted to the cell nuclei. The area of cell nuclei on grooved surfaces was significantly reduced. We also examined the adhesion and proliferation of cells on flat and different microgroove surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Microgrooves do not have a significant impact on cell adhesion and proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 2b). These results indicate that continuous drop-shaped microgrooves and parallel microgrooves can both restrict the cytoskeleton, and the restricting ability is related to the average width of the grooves. Local variations in width have no significant effect on cell shape and size.

### Ultra-flat and long-lived plasmons in a strongly correlated oxide [^116hDGb1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Plasmons in strongly correlated systems are attracting considerable attention due to their unconventional behavior caused by electronic correlation effects. Recently, flat plasmons with nearly dispersionless frequency-wave vector relations have drawn significant interest because of their intriguing physical origin and promising applications. However, these flat plasmons exist primarily in low-dimensional materials with limited wave vector magnitudes (q < ~0.7Å -1). Here, we show that long-lived flat plasmons can propagate up to ~1.2Å -1 in α-Ti 2 O 3, a strongly correlated three-dimensional Mott-insulator, with an ultra-small energy fluctuation (< 40meV). The strong correlation effect renormalizes the electronic bands near Fermi level with a small bandwidth, which is responsible for the flat plasmons in α-Ti 2 O 3. Moreover, these flat plasmons are not affected by Landau damping over a wide range of wave vectors (q < ~1.2Å -1) due to symmetry constrains on the electron wavefunctions. Our work provides a strategy for exploring flat plasmons in strongly correlated systems, which in turn may give rise to novel plasmonic devices in which flat and long-lived plasmons are desirable.

### Molecular pathology of Lynch syndrome [^111LAsAa]. The Journal of Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS) is characterised by predisposition to colorectal, endometrial, and other cancers and is caused by inherited pathogenic variants affecting the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. It is probably the most common predisposition to cancer, having an estimated prevalence of between 1/100 and 1/180. Resources such as the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Cancer's MMR gene variant database, the Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database (PLSD), and the Colon Cancer Family Register (CCFR), as well as pathological and immunological studies, are enabling advances in the understanding of LS. These include defined criteria by which to interpret gene variants, the function of MMR in the normal control of apoptosis, definition of the risks of the various cancers, and the mechanisms and pathways by which the colorectal and endometrial tumours develop, including the critical role of the immune system. Colorectal cancers in LS can develop along three pathways, including flat intramucosal lesions, which depend on the underlying affected MMR gene. This gives insights into the limitations of colonoscopic surveillance and highlights the need for other forms of anti-cancer prophylaxis in LS. Finally, it shows that the processes of autoimmunisation and immunoediting fundamentally constrain the development of tumours in LS and explain the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in MMR-deficient tumours. © 2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

### Guidelines for evaluation and management of cerebral collateral circulation in ischaemic stroke 2017 [^111iBWEW]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Lying-flat head positioning

Cerebral autoregulation may be impaired in patients with ischaemic stroke, especially in the affected cerebral hemisphere. Thus, a lying-flat head positioning may increase cerebral blood flow through collateral circulation or gravity, as compared with an upright head positioning. A systematic review and meta-analysis of four small studies (57 patients in total) indicated that ipsilesional but not contralesional MCA flow velocities were significantly higher when patients were in a lying-flat head position at 0° or 15° as compared with an upright head position of 30°. The mean flow velocity of ipsilesional MCA increased by 8.3 cm/s on average with a head position from 30° to 0° (95% CI 5.3 to 11.3 cm/s; p < 0.001) and 4.6 cm/s from 30° to 15° (95% CI 2.9 to 6.2 cm/s; p < 0.001). The Head Position in Acute Stroke Trial (HeadPoST) investigated the effects of different head positions in altering outcomes of over 11 000 patients with acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke who were nursed to a lying-flat or sitting-up (≥ 30°) head positions and remaining in the position for 24 hours. Unfortunately, the HeadPoST study did not show any difference in the lying-flat and sitting-up head positions in affecting the 3-month function outcome, in the overall analysis or in subgroup analyses according to stroke subtypes, initial stroke severity, age and others. Of note, HeadPoST did not assess arterial occlusion status in patients with stroke, which reduced power to detect a benefit of lying flat. Therefore, no conclusion could be drawn based on current evidence regarding the effects of different head positions on clinical outcomes of patients with ischaemic stroke.

### Affective integration in experience, judgment, and decision-making [^111XdAFL]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Functions of affect in judgment and decision-making

Affect can serve various functions in motivating decision behavior. Strong affective reactions can directly elicit approach or avoidance behaviorsor by changing the way information is processed and how information is weighted, and low-intensity, subtle affect appears to have a pervasive influence on our thoughts, behaviors, and judgments. In many situations, rather than relying on analysis and deliberation, people rely on their affect as input into the decision process (affect heuristic). In such cases, the experienced feelings are used as information to guide judgment and decision making. The affect heuristic work assumes that people consult or refer to an "affect pool" containing positive and negative tags consciously or unconsciously associated with the representation of the decision problem. Thus, affect assigns value to the object of judgment that seemingly is the cause of affect (affect-as-information). Importantly, both integral affect (affect that is experienced while considering the object of judgment) and incidental affect (affect that is independent of the object of judgment but can be misattributed to it) are used in judgments and decisions in this way. However, it is important to note that integral affect is more likely to lead to adaptive use of affect in judgments and decisions as it is normatively related to and representative of the decision at hand. Incidental affect, from a normative viewpoint, can be seen as a "bias" as it is incorrectly attributed as being related to the decision.

### A global meta-analysis on the drivers of salt Marsh planting success and implications for ecosystem services [^114VYGx3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To examine how abiotic-biotic factors affect plant survival and growth, we extracted data on different plant response variables in control and experimental treatments by collecting them from text, tables or digitizing figures. Studies examining the effects of plant sources, fertilization, plant density, plant richness, plant spacing, patch size, and protection on plant survival and growth were retained (Fig. 2f). For plant demographic and growth response, we considered survival, density, height, coverage, aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, and expansion. Studies reporting mean values of the data with sample sizes and some measure of variance (e.g. standard deviations/errors) in both control and experimental treatments were retained. We also compared the survival of the transplanted material with different propagule types, plant seasons, wave forces and herbivory (Fig. 2b–e). It is well known that plants widely differ in salinity, moisture and inundation tolerance. The experimental transplant of salt marsh plants across a natural gradient identified different tolerances of physical stress associated with elevation, salinity, soil moisture and tidal inundation. Accordingly, we didn't include those studies to calculate the effect sizes in the meta-analysis. Other plant response variables and influencing factors were too few for a meaningful synthesis and were excluded. In total, 762 pairs of observations reported in 41 studies were retained to examine how abiotic-biotic factors affect plant survival and growth (Fig. 2b–f).

To quantify the impacts of planting on ecological outcomes, we restricted our analysis to those studies that compared planted salt marshes with natural or degraded wetlands within the same assessment. Natural wetlands are generally undisturbed areas that have not been affected by severe disturbances, and salt marsh with no evidence of active degradation. Degraded wetlands include abandoned reclamation areas, unvegetated areas and severely disturbed areas previously inhabited by salt marshes that have been affected by natural processes or human activities, such as land reclamation, oil contamination, erosion, high salinity and so on. The unvegetated areas include bare flats caused by the historical loss of salt marshes, or unvegetated mudflat sites resulting from a local dieback or erosion event. In this study, restored wetlands refer to planting or revegetation either in areas that were previously salt marsh vegetation but lost or degraded, or new areas that are biophysically suitable for salt marsh vegetation growth or colonization.

### Emotional face processing and flat affect in schizophrenia: functional and structural neural correlates [^11524q2f]. Psychological Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is a general consensus in the literature that schizophrenia causes difficulties with facial emotion perception and discrimination. Functional brain imaging studies have observed reduced limbic activity during facial emotion perception but few studies have examined the relation to flat affect severity.

Method

A total of 26 people with schizophrenia and 26 healthy controls took part in this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Sad, happy and neutral faces were presented in a pseudo-random order and participants indicated the gender of the face presented. Manual segmentation of the amygdala was performed on a structural T1 image.

Results

Both the schizophrenia group and the healthy control group rated the emotional valence of facial expressions similarly. Both groups exhibited increased brain activity during the perception of emotional faces relative to neutral ones in multiple brain regions, including multiple prefrontal regions bilaterally, the right amygdala, right cingulate cortex and cuneus. Group comparisons, however, revealed increased activity in the healthy group in the anterior cingulate, right parahippocampal gyrus and multiple visual areas. In schizophrenia, the severity of flat affect correlated significantly with neural activity in several brain areas including the amygdala and parahippocampal region bilaterally.

Conclusions

These results suggest that many of the brain regions involved in emotional face perception, including the amygdala, are equally recruited in both schizophrenia and controls, but flat affect can also moderate activity in some other brain regions, notably in the left amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally. There were no significant group differences in the volume of the amygdala.

### Circadian rhythm in negative affect: implications for mood disorders [^111P5znV]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In humans, there is an endogenous, near 24-h (i.e., circadian) variation in mood with the best mood occurring during the circadian day and the worst mood occurring during the circadian night. Only positive affect, and not negative affect, has been shown to contribute to this circadian rhythm. We discovered a sharp circadian peak in negative affect during the circadian night coincident with a circadian trough in positive affect. These findings may help explain the association of depression with insomnia, the increased risk of suicide with nocturnal wakefulness, and the correlation between circadian misalignment and symptom severity in Major Depressive Disorder.

### Prosody and lexical accuracy in flat affect schizophrenia [^111iNRRH]. Psychiatry Research (2000). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that flat affect in schizophrenia involves a motor-expressive deficiency, but not an emotional deficiency, we compared the acoustic properties of speech that are used to express emotion with the emotional content of the words. DSM-III-R schizophrenic patients were divided into flat (N = 20) and non-flat affect (N = 26) groups on the basis of rating-scale scores. Twenty normal subjects also were included. Subjects were recorded on audio tape as they described a happy and a sad experience for about 10 min. The recordings were analyzed acoustically for fluency and for two types of prosody: inflection and emphasis. Words from transcriptions of the recordings were sorted by content analysis software into psychologically meaningful categories; we compared 'pleasure' and 'distress' word categories. Patients with flat affect spoke with less inflection, and were less fluent. However, they were similar to the other groups in the rate at which they used 'pleasure' words to describe happy experiences and 'distress' words to describe sad experiences. The behavioral deficiency in flat affect appears to be restricted to reduced activity in communicative motor channels. Other aspects of emotion processing seem intact.

### Emotional experience in negative symptoms of schizophrenia – no evidence for a generalized hedonic deficit [^112y8M1K]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Deficits in emotion processing are thought to underlie the key negative symptoms flat affect and anhedonia observed in psychotic disorders. This study investigated emotional experience and social behavior in the realm of daily life in a sample of patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, stratified by level of negative symptoms.

Methods

Emotional experience and behavior of 149 patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and 143 controls were explored using the Experience Sampling Method.

Results

Patients reported lower levels of positive and higher levels of negative affect compared with controls. High negative symptom patients reported similar emotional stability and capacity to generate positive affect as controls, whereas low negative symptom patients reported increased instability. All participants displayed roughly comparable emotional responses to the company of other people. However, in comparison with controls, patients showed more social withdrawal and preference to be alone while in company, particularly the high negative symptom group.

Conclusions

This study revealed no evidence for a generalized hedonic deficit in patients with psychotic spectrum disorders. Lower rather than higher levels of negative symptoms were associated with a pattern of emotional processing which was different from healthy controls.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness [^112wjwsF]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG) — recognition and initial management in the wilderness notes it results from "a blockage of aqueous outflow from the eye resulting in increased intraocular pressure (IOP)" with symptoms including "deep and severe pain, blurry vision, halos around lights, headache, and often nausea and vomiting", and signs such as a "nonreactive pupil that is mid dilated (4 mm to 6 mm)", decreased visual acuity, a "steamy" or "hazy" cornea, and a red eye. Field measurement of IOP is often not possible, but "gentle palpation of the globe through a closed lid may reveal a taut globe indicating elevated IOP". AACG "requires emergent evacuation, as the definitive treatment is surgical". Standard medical therapy includes "timolol 0.5%, 1 drop in affected eye 2 times daily", topical steroids like "prednisolone 1%, 1 drop 4 times daily", and "oral acetazolamide (Diamox), 500 mg 2 times daily", with "Pilocarpine 1% to 2%, 1 drop every 15 minutes for 2 doses" given "1 hour after other treatments", and patients should "lie flat for at least 1 hour". Recommendation labels: "Medical management: 1B", "Surgical management: 1A", and "Emergent evacuation: 1C".

### The common structure of the major psychoses: more similarities than differences in the network structures of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychotic bipolar disorder [^112MPcX8]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Our exploratory analyses of differences in specific edge weights should be interpreted with caution given the results of omnibus tests and the lack of a priori hypotheses but are nonetheless of potential theoretical interest. The role of cognitive versus affective processes in thought disorder has long been debated. The Bleulerian view that loosening of association was a driving process in schizophrenia has been supported by empirical research, suggesting that this process is specifically associated with thought disorder but, at the same time, there is evidence that affective reactivity plays a role in disordered speech in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The network structure observed here suggests that both processes may be important, but the high variability in the edge between thought disorder and conceptual disorganization suggests that this latter process is more important in schizophrenia patients.

Pessimistic thought (M9) plays a role in both the highly variable edge comparisons in depressive symptoms, in relation to both Reported sadness (M2: MADRS) and M9 and Inability to feel (M8: MADRS). Learned hopelessness theory suggests that a pessimistic attributional (explanatory) style plays a central role in depressed mood, and this relationship seems reflected in the network model of PBD patients but less so in that of SCA patients. However, it is possible that this is because the SCA patients had both higher pessimism and higher depressed mood than the PBD patients (see table 2). Meanwhile, the relationship between pessimistic thought and inability to feel (a bridge symptom between depressive and negative symptoms) is more evident in SCA patients than SCZ patients, which is partially in line with a prior report that the relationship was stronger in depressed adolescents than those with subthreshold depression. Speculating, it is possible that pessimistic thinking plays a role in both low mood and flat affect, but that the former relationship is more evident in PBD patients whereas the latter is more evident in SCA patients. A further speculation is that the attribution style is less significant in the path toward inability to feel and negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients than in schizoaffective patients. Further research about the relationship between attribution style and both symptoms seems merited.

### Novel fetal phenotype of TAF8 deficiency [^11292Vc3]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We report, for the first time, fetal representation of TAF8 deficiency and document its importance in brain structural development.

TAF8 deficiency is a rare disease worldwide with only eight reported patients. We currently report four fetuses with a novel homozygous splicing genetic variant of TAF8, brain malformations, and restricted fetal growth (two fetuses from late-terminated pregnancies presented significant restriction in their growth while the other two were in the low normal range), meaning that TAF8 is a major player in normal brain development and might also affect growth patterns in the second and third trimesters.

Three of the fetuses underwent brain MRI (two prenatally and one post-termination at 20 WG) that supported the brain abnormalities already seen on US examination: flat open sylvian fissure with small frontal lobes, dysmorphic CC (short and thick), abnormal brain stem with flat pons, abnormal small vermis, open fastigium, hypoplastic cerebellum, and abnormal gyral pattern.

The brain anomalies that included abnormal sulcation patterns were previously described in TAF13 deficiency and the progressive atrophy and abnormal CC seen on fetal MRI are like those described in patients with TAF8 pathogenic genetic variants. These brain abnormalities were proven on pathological examination of the last 20 WG fetuses that underwent brain autopsy, with very similar findings.

Although ultra-rare worldwide, we have identified three couples within the same small village where both parents are carriers of the same pathogenic genetic variant. The brain malformations seen in the homozygous fetuses, the lack of TAF8 determined in one affected fetus, and the segregation analysis in the extended family supports the pathogenicity of this novel genetic variant. To explore the possibility that affected sibs may carry additional loss of function (LOF) variants related to patients' manifestations, exome sequencing studies were performed in two fetuses, at different laboratories. The results confirmed that at least two fetuses from the four affected had no other LOF genetic variant, nor were any other pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants identified. Moreover, in the context of a very homogenous pre-natal phenotype in all four fetuses, the same genetic variant was identified in all and the protein studies showed the loss of this important protein. One can safely say that this change in TAF8 is causing the phenotype reported here.

### Mapping depression in schizophrenia: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study [^113g4skp]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Depression has been regarded as a key feature of schizophrenia since it was first defined by Bleuler. A large body of evidence confirms that depressive symptoms are a core component, and may precede the clinical manifestation, of psychosis. Prevalence rates for major depressive disorder (MDD) comorbid with psychotic disorders commonly vary between 25% to 75%, and around 70% of chronic schizophrenia patients without a MDD may show signs of sub-syndromal depression. Although there is overlap between depressive and negative symptoms, a distinction between them can be made, with negative symptoms indicating the severity of illness and depressive symptoms reflecting motivational hopelessness about the future. Importantly, depressed mood in schizophrenia is known to have detrimental consequences, such as a high relapse rate, suicidal ideation, increased mortality, reduced social adjustment and poor quality of life. A key question, central to refining and developing effective treatments for depression in schizophrenia is: what are the psychobiological abnormalities associated with depressive symptoms in schizophrenia, and to what extent are they similar or different to those commonly observed in MDD?

A large number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have already examined the neurobiology of MDD, particularly using facial affect processing paradigms.MDD patients, relative to healthy participants, show hyper-activation to negative facial affect, in particular sadness and fear, in the amygdala, insula, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform face area and putamen. Structural and functional alterations in these regions are widely implicated in disturbed implicit/explicit processing of emotive stimuli and poor affect regulation in MDD. Schizophrenia patients, on the other hand, are reported to show, on average, reduced activation of the amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, insula and basal ganglia to negative facial affect. There are no fMRI studies to our knowledge specifically examining the role of depression in brain responses to negative facial affect in schizophrenia. Amygdala activation to fearful faces, however, was found to correlate positively with the severity of flat affect, a negative symptom dimension, in a previous study.

### Clinical classification of memory and cognitive impairment with multimodal digital biomarkers [^114kA5W8]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Fundamental frequency, a correlate of voice pitch, has been shown in a number of studies to predict MCI and ADRD. These studies have investigated fundamental frequency (F0) and cycle‐to‐cycle characteristics of frequency revealing that individuals with cognitive impairment tend to have lower mean of F0 and higher cycle‐to‐cycle variations. From a real‐world perspective, these acoustic features result in lower sounding vocal pitch and a flat, monotonous affect, respectively. This research has shown consistently lower fundamental frequency (and range of frequencies) in individuals with varying levels of cognitive impairment. Clinically, this results in a flat affect, with fewer fluctuations in the tone of the voice.

Jitter quantifies the cycle to cycle (peak to peak) variations of speech frequencies. Disordered jitter output is commonly seen in dysphonic voices where the vocal folds vibrate in an abnormal way (or are very breathy). Jitter PPQ5 and absolute‐valued jitter compare individual voice signal periods with the five speech cycles that surround them. Generally, higher jitter values correlate with rougher sounding, breathy voice quality that sounds less natural and more disordered than traditional voice. Several researchers suggest that mean, absolute, and PPQ5 jitter tend to be higher in individuals with cognitive impairment. Perceptually, an increase in these jitter measures is associated with breathy, strained voices that lack stability. Increased vocal instability also affects the overall perception of voice quality.

### Mood swing and mood stabilizer: how specific are these terms? [^113MajyL]. Bipolar Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In the DSM-IIIR in 1987, the category title for depressive and bipolar disorders was changed from affective disorders to mood disorders. Within a short period of time thereafter, mood swing and mood stabilizer became very commonly used terms in psychiatry with bipolar implications.

Methods

Terms and definitions in recent texts, articles, and dictionaries pertaining to mood fluctuations have been reviewed.

Results

The term mood was seldom part of psychiatric terminology until the late 1970s. Mood swing and mood stabilizer as used in the psychiatric literature are primarily nonspecific and often misleading concepts — particularly as a basis for treatment decisions. Affective fluctuations and shifts to irritability and/or anger in persons with personality and depressive disorders are being viewed by many in the mental health field as cyclically biphasic — between depressed to elated — which is clearly at variance with research findings.

Conclusions

More data-based research on mood variations is needed to authoritatively remedy this situation.

### A generalizable framework for assessing the role of emotion during choice [^114m4J52]. The American Psychologist (2022). Medium credibility.

The study of emotion has been plagued by several challenges that have left the field fractionated. To date, there is no dominant method for measuring the nebulous and often ill-defined experience of emotion. Here, we offer a new way forward, one that marries numerically precise measurements of affect with current models of human behavior, to more deeply understand the role of emotion during choice, and in particular, during social decision-making. This tool can be combined with multiple other measures that capture different features and levels of the emotional experience, making it particularly flexible to be used in any number of contexts. By operationalizing the classic circumplex model of affect so that it can deliver fine-grained, continuous measurements as affect evolves overtime, our goal is to provide a generalizable and flexible framework for computing affect to infer emotions so that we can assess their impact on human behavior.

### Combination of housing type (detached houses vs flats) and tenure (owned vs rented) in relation to cardiovascular mortality: findings from a 6-year cohort study in Japan [^113iEAgm]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

The combination of housing type (detached houses vs flats) and tenure (owned vs rented) affected cardiovascular mortality after adjusting for covariates, including SES. Men living in rented flats showed a particularly higher risk of cardiovascular mortality. One possible cause of these findings might be the difference in indoor environmental quality, influenced by the structural characteristics and thermal insulation level of outer walls and windows. These findings can contribute to the development of public health policies and the improvement of cardiovascular health.

### Flat affect and social functioning: a 10 year follow-up study of first episode psychosis patients [^113DemBL]. Schizophrenia Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Affective flattening has been described as enduring, but long term follow-up studies of first episode psychosis patients are lacking.

Objective

The aim of this study was to follow the symptom development of flat affect (FA), over a 10 year follow-up period, with focus on prevalence, predictors and outcome factors including social functioning.

Methods

Three-hundred-and-one patients with FEP were included at baseline, 186 participated in the 10 year follow-up. These were followed on PANSS item N1 (FA) from baseline through 5 follow-up assessments over 10 years. Patients were grouped as having never-present, improving, deteriorating, fluctuating or enduring FA. The groups were compared on baseline variables, variables at 10 year follow-up, and social functioning throughout the follow-up period.

Results

Twenty nine percent never displayed FA, 66% had improving, deteriorating or fluctuating FA, while 5% of patients had enduring FA. Premorbid social function predicted enduring FA. The patients with enduring, fluctuating and deteriorating FA did poorer on all outcome variables, including remission and recovery rates. The enduring FA group did significantly poorer in social functioning over the 10 year period.

Conclusions

FA is expressed at some point of time in the majority of FEP patients in a 10 year follow-up period, and appears more fluctuant than expected from the relevant literature. FA is associated with poorer outcome after 10 years, and enduring FA to poorer social function at all points of assessment.

### What is mood? A computational perspective [^113Z1pDz]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The existence of mixed states can also be accounted for under this model. Note that mania and depression share an inappropriately precise prior over emotional states. As such, predictions encoded by such a precise prior – which do not lie at the extrema of mean values – could potentially manifest as mixed states, showing some manic and some depressive features. In Fig. 1 such states would lie in the intermediary region between the top and bottom right-hand corner.

Similarly, anxious depression can be described by a highly uncertain belief (hyperprior) about negative emotions (a loss of prior precision). This means the tonic drives of neuromodulator systems should be comparable to that in depression, but remain more responsive to peripheral feedback. One interesting consequence of this state, however, is a lack of action, given action is only possible when prior expectations are precise. In short, by framing mood as the hyperprior over emotional states, we can describe a wide range of abnormal mood states according to their different co-ordinates along a two-dimensional continuum.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^114v4mod]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac arrest in pregnancy — manual uterine displacement and chest compressions: At approximately 20 weeks, the uterine fundus is palpable at the level of the umbilicus and may start to adversely affect hemodynamics in the supine pregnant woman via aortocaval compression, so decompression by manual leftward and upward uterine displacement by a first responder may significantly improve hemodynamics during resuscitation without interfering with chest compressions; either manual displacement or lateral tilt was suitable for CPR with some providers finding manual displacement easier, and additional benefits of manual left uterine displacement over tilt may include easier airway management and defibrillation since the patient remains supine; there is no evidence of cardiac displacement by the gravid uterus even in a full-term pregnancy, modification of hand position for chest compressions is therefore not necessary, and as in nonpregnant patients chest compression quality is maximized when the pregnant patient is flat on a firm surface.

### Golden section criterion to achieve droplet trampoline effect on metal-based superhydrophobic surface [^112WDjNZ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

N R of microstructures with different D S

In order to systematically explore the correlation between the N R and D S, we prepared a series of surfaces with different D S by using laser ablation. We obtained a series of micro-protrusion structures with different D S by adjusting the laser scan spacing ranging from 50 μm to 1000 μm (referred to as S50-S1000). Micro-protrusions are arranged in square arrays with particles distributed on the laser ablation paths (Supplementary Figs 2–4), and the surface morphology with the scale of < 1 μm is flocculent (Supplementary Fig. 5). A flat block appears on each micro-protrusion when the laser ablation area cannot completely cover the aluminum substrate (Supplementary Fig. 6). Furthermore, the larger laser scan spacing can raise the proportion of the flat area, and the flat block disappears if the laser scan spacing is small enough. In addition, the fluctuant heights corresponding to different laser scan spacings are similar (Supplementary Fig. 7). The laser scan speed which could change the structure height was constant in our experiment, and the change in laser scan spacing could not significantly affect the structure height. However, the structure height slightly changed which was inevitable due to the laser processing technology. But the structure height hardly affected the consecutive rebound dynamics of droplets (Supplementary Information S1). The aluminum substrate was also thermally oxidized during the line-by-line laser scanning process, which could lead to the fact that oxidized aluminum films were formed. We discussed the localized X-ray diffraction results (Supplementary Fig. 8) on the laser-scanned grooves and flats in Supplementary Information S2.

### A meta-analysis of the ecological and economic outcomes of mangrove restoration [^114JZxJT]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Definitions of comparison groups

Four comparisons were conducted in this meta-analysis (a) restored mangroves vs. natural mangroves, (b) restored mangroves vs. unvegetated tidal flats, (c) restored mangroves vs. naturally regenerated mangroves and (d) restored mangroves vs. degraded mangroves.

Restored mangroves encompass various interventions including restoration, rehabilitation, reforestation, regeneration and plantation. Other terms such as afforestation are often used interchangeably with restoration, even though this process refers to planting mangroves in areas that were previously not mangrove. This study uses restoration as an umbrella term that encompasses a range of human-driven activities involving the (re)generation of mangrove vegetation either in areas that were previously mangrove forest but lost or degraded, or new areas that are biophysically suitable for mangrove colonisation or afforestation. While we used the term restoration to cover all these interventions where mangrove cover has been increased, we do not make any judgement of the suitability of these activities.

Natural mangroves are generally undisturbed mangroves, i.e. mangroves that have not been affected by severe disturbances, either related to human activity (e.g. land use change, overexploitation) or natural processes (e.g. hypersalinization). Naturally regenerated mangroves are those that have been restored naturally or "passively" through natural seedling recruitment. Degraded mangroves refer to mangroves disturbed from natural processes or human activities (see above for examples). Unvegetated tidal flats include unvegetated or ephemerally vegetated mud and sand flats or abandoned aquaculture ponds, often found seaward of the mangrove forest in the lower intertidal zone.

### Effects of cognitive remediation on negative symptoms dimensions: exploring the role of working memory [^1141XPx9]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Measures

Demographic and cognitive data

Basic demographic information was collected on all participants. Premorbid IQ was estimated using the WRAT-R (Kareken et al.) or the NAART (Uttl). Scores were compared using the guidelines proposed by Johnstone et al.

Symptoms

Symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, Kay et al.). This is a 30-item measure of symptom severity for people with schizophrenia. The measure is administered as a clinical interview by a trained researcher or clinician. Each item is scored on a 7-point scale ranging from not symptomatic (i.e. 1) to extremely severe symptom (i.e. 7). For this study, we scored the PANSS according to Liemburg et al. and used the two dimensions of negative symptoms identified in their study: Expressive Negative Symptoms (i.e. flat affect, poor rapport, lack of spontaneity, mannerisms and posturing, motor retardation and avolition) and social amotivation (emotional withdrawal, passive/apathetic social withdrawal and active social avoidance).

Working memory

WM was assessed using two well-established tests: the Digit Span test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS–III; Wechsler,) and the Letter-Number Span from the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (Nuechterlein et al.). Only Keefe et al. used the Letter-Number Span. Scores on these tests are reported in standardised Z -scores.

### Acoustic speech markers for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders: a diagnostic and symptom-recognition tool [^1175yVXX]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, clinical rating scales, such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay, Fiszbein, & Opfer,) are used to assess both positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. However, previous research has stressed the dramatic disparity between speech-based objective measurements of individual characteristics (e.g. flat affect) and scale-based subjective assessments assessed by clinicians; symptom rating scales are, at best, only modestly related to objective measurements of the behavior they intend to reflect (Cohen, Mitchell, & Elvevåg). Moreover, some PANSS items are highly influenced by experience and preconceptions of the rater, which results in low inter-rater reliability (Kølbæk et al.). In daily practice, these subjective assessments are not performed scale-based, but ad hoc, leading to even higher inter-observer variation. Especially, the assessment of negative symptoms remains problematic, since consensus-based instruments diverge on what should be considered true negative symptoms and what should be considered general/other illness components; such as, for example, cognition (Marder & Galderisi). Developing objective measurements to complement clinical ratings is thus fundamental to overcome these serious validity concerns with clinical assessments of positive and negative symptoms, and enable development towards measurement-based care (Insel).

### Developmental influences on symptom expression in antipsychotic-naïve first-episode psychosis [^111LrABY]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The neurodevelopmental model of psychosis was established over 30 years ago; however, the developmental influence on psychotic symptom expression - how age affects clinical presentation in first-episode psychosis - has not been thoroughly investigated.

Methods

Using generalized additive modeling, which allows for linear and non-linear functional forms of age-related change, we leveraged symptom data from a large sample of antipsychotic-naïve individuals with first-episode psychosis (N = 340, 12–40 years, 1–12 visits), collected at the University of Pittsburgh from 1990 to 2017. We examined relationships between age and severity of perceptual and non-perceptual positive symptoms and negative symptoms. We tested for age-associated effects on change in positive or negative symptom severity following baseline assessment and explored the time-varying relationship between perceptual and non-perceptual positive symptoms across adolescent development.

Results

Perceptual positive symptom severity significantly decreased with increasing age (F = 7.0, p = 0.0007; q = 0.003) while non-perceptual positive symptom severity increased with age (F = 4.1, p = 0.01, q = 0.02). Anhedonia severity increased with increasing age (F = 6.7, p = 0.00035; q = 0.0003), while flat affect decreased in severity with increased age (F = 9.8, p = 0.002; q = 0.006). Findings remained significant when parental SES, IQ, and illness duration were included as covariates. There were no developmental effects on change in positive or negative symptom severity (all p > 0.25). Beginning at age 18, there was a statistically significant association between severity of non-perceptual and perceptual symptoms. This relationship increased in strength throughout adulthood.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that as maturation proceeds, perceptual symptoms attenuate while non-perceptual symptoms are enhanced. Findings underscore how pathological brain-behavior relationships vary as a function of development.

### Temperament&character account for brain functional connectivity at rest: a diathesis-stress model of functional dysregulation in psychosis [^111NNZ4E]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Assessment

Psychopathology was assessed by a trained Masters-level research assistant using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS). Specific subscale scores were summed to derive measures of positive symptoms (i.e. hallucination and delusion subscales), disorganization (i.e. positive formal thought disorder, bizarre behavior, and attention subscales), and negative symptoms (i.e. flat affect, alogia, anhedonia, avolition, and asocial subscales). Estimates of chronic psychotic and affective symptoms were derived using the Washington Early Recognition Center Affectivity and Psychosis Screen (WERCAP), a self-assessment tool. Personality traits were obtained using the online version of the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) with 140 items rated on a five-point Likert scale. Correspondence of TCI profiles to DSM-5 personality disorders is noted throughout this article, and in relation to other psychometric tests in Supplementary Information describing personality correlates of the rsFC groups, and elsewhere in detail for psychiatric disorders and other psychometric tests.

### Positive affective functioning in anhedonic individuals' daily life: anything but flat and blunted [^114BZdPr]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Anhedonia, the decreased interest and pleasure, is often described as 'flat' or 'blunted' positive affect (PA). Yet, little is known about PA functioning in anhedonic individuals' daily lives. The current study investigates PA reactivity to pleasurable experiences in anhedonia together with its relevant temporal dynamics (i.e., variability, instability, and inertia), and expands current knowledge by exploring the role of arousal therein.

Methods

Using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), we collected 90 assessments of real-life PA experiences across 30 days in 18–24 year old individuals with anhedonia (N = 69) and without anhedonia (N = 69).

Results

Multilevel analyses showed that anhedonia was associated with less intense pleasure experience, and lower levels of PA. Contrary to predictions from laboratory research and depression theory, individuals with anhedonia showed more variability and less stability in PA, and no signs of blunted PA reactivity. In fact, when exploring high and low arousal PA, individuals with anhedonia showed a slightly stronger reactivity to pleasurable experiences in high-arousal PA but not low-arousal PA.

Limitations

We did not control for previous pleasure experiences and, instead of the last positive event, accumulation of positive events may have determined the change in high-arousal PA.

Conclusions

Individuals with anhedonia are likely less 'flat' or 'blunted' than generally thought. Although replication is warranted, impairments in high-arousal positive emotions may be of particular interest in the clinical treatment of anhedonia.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^113vm8S2]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Residual phase in early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) — clinical course includes predominance of negative symptoms with possible post-psychosis depression, potential prolonged residual periods, and persistent impairment. Negative symptoms (flat affect, anergia, social withdrawal) predominate although some positive symptoms may persist, and some patients develop a post-psychosis depression characterized by dysphoria; youth with EOS may have prolonged periods (several months or more) between acute phases when they do not experience significant positive symptoms; most patients will continue to be at least somewhat impaired owing to negative symptoms, and some individuals remain chronically symptomatic despite adequate treatment.

### Curvotaxis directs cell migration through cell-scale curvature landscapes [^1114nE52]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Curvature affects FA organization and dynamics

We then looked at FA distribution on both S3/30 and S10/100 to seek for any correlation with surface topography. Although the distribution is variable from cell to cell, FA density seems maximal in the convex regions of the sinus (Fig. 4a, b), whereas FA size is not significantly impacted by curvature (Fig. 4c). We also investigated whether substratum curvature was affecting FA tension using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) tension sensor (VinTS). In this construct, the vinculin head and tail domains are separated by a tensile chain peptide and flanked by FRET donor and acceptor fluorophores (mTFP1 and venus, respectively). Tension-dependent stretching of this molecule thus leads to a drop in FRET signal in a graded and dynamic way. FA from cells on both on S3/30 and S10/100 surfaces are characterized by an overall lower state of tension (higher FRET index) compared to their flat control counterparts (Fig. 4d). However, the FA positioned on the concave part of those surfaces exhibit higher mechanical tension that the FA positioned on the convex part (Fig. 4e, f). We also looked at FA dynamics and found that FA longevity significantly increases on concave compare to convex curvatures (Fig. 4g). Together, these findings show that cells establish numerous but short-lived and less-tensed FA on convex curvatures, whereas their anchoring points to concave areas are subjected to higher intracellular tension and thus, get more stable. This suggests that curvature-dependent asymmetry in FA density and dynamics contribute to cell positioning on concave areas.

Since cells tend to position their nucleus on concave, we next asked how curvature might affect its shape. We grew MSCs on flat or concave surfaces, performed 3D reconstruction of their lamina and quantified nuclear shape and volume changes (Fig. 4h, i). We found that nuclei of cells positioned on concave surfaces become more spherical (sphericity index: 0.81) than those cultivated on flat (sphericity index: 0.67), whereas their average volume remained constant. This suggests that cell positioning on concave curvatures lead to a mechanical relaxation of the nucleus. When cells are in a concave region, the adhesions are more elevated. The stress fibers, which are connected to the substrate through the adhesions, might not compress the nucleus as much as on flat surfaces.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^1123gJDR]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Symptomatology and cognitive features in EOS — schizophrenia includes positive and negative symptoms and may also involve an independent domain of disorganized behavior; in EOS, hallucinations, thought disorder, and flattened affect are common while systematic delusions and catatonic symptoms are less frequent; cognitive delays are common with EOS, with broad neurocognitive deficits, premorbid problems, and a decline at onset that stabilizes over time. Schizophrenia is characterized by positive and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms refer to hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder. Disorganized behavior may represent an independent third domain, including disorganized speech (e.g., incoherence, looseness of associations), bizarre behavior, and poor attention. Hallucinations, thought disorder, and flattened affect have been consistently found in EOS, whereas systematic delusions and catatonic symptoms occur less frequently. Cognitive delays are common with EOS. Deficits in memory, executive functioning, attention, and global impairments are generally noted. Children who later develop schizophrenia often have premorbid problems with verbal reasoning, working memory, attention, and processing speed. Cognitive decline typically occurs at the time of onset of illness. Once established, intellectual deficits appear to be stable over time without continued deterioration.

### Characterizing organic delusional syndrome… [^111sNnDF]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- We present a first comprehensive description of the clinical features of patients with organic delusional syndrome. This description is based on information from 39 patients with organic delusional syndrome among 14 889 patients who presented for initial evaluation over a 5-year period at our institution. This description includes an enumeration of the common clinical symptoms of this syndrome and the respective prevalence and mean severity of each symptom. The severity of the symptoms of organic delusional syndrome are compared with those of schizophrenia to determine which symptoms distinguish between these two diagnostic categories. Patients with organic delusional syndrome demonstrated significantly more symptoms of "acquired intellectual impairment, " "impaired sensorium, " and "hallucinations of smell, taste, or touch, " while schizophrenic patients demonstrated more "flat affect, " "emotional coldness, " and "thought disorganization.

" In addition, associated factors are presented concerning demographics, modes of treatment, level of functioning, and current physical problems associated with organic delusional syndrome.

### The American Venous Forum, American Vein and Lymphatic Society and the Society for Vascular Medicine expert opinion consensus on lymphedema diagnosis and treatment [^113Knxo9]. Phlebology (2022). High credibility.

Lymphedema compression garments — circular knit and flat knit characteristics and selection are contrasted as follows: Circular knit garments are seamless and generally not as dense or stiff as flat knit garments, and these garments are typically the first line of compression garments used by patients with relatively mild swelling and normal shaped legs. Flat knit machines create a sheet of fabric that must be cut and sewn, and this process allows for customization to accommodate any shaped leg; clinical indications for flat knit garments include significant differences in leg circumference as well as deep skin folds and edema of the toes/forefoot. However, these garments tend to be significantly more expensive which is often a barrier to acquisition. The prevailing opinion that flat‑knit garments offer intrinsically better containment was challenged by an International Compression Club study concluding the dynamic stiffness of circular and flat knit fabrics are not different. Practical considerations include patient compliance, cost, and reimbursement.

### Dysregulation of a specific immune-related network of genes biologically defines a subset of schizophrenia [^111Mdb2Q]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite decades of scientific efforts, schizophrenia or other chronic mental illnesses (CMI) in clinical psychiatry lack an objective biological diagnostic test. Diagnosis in clinical psychiatry still relies on the subjective clinical interview and, paradoxically, biology-based diagnostics is used only to exclude conditions, such as trauma, drug intoxication, or "neurological" causes.

The predicament for a biological definition of mental illness results from the fact that all efforts for the discovery of biological underpinnings start with the clinical diagnosis that pools patients from heterogeneous biological subsets leading to a dilution of possible size effects of specific markers for a disease subset. This problem cannot be solved by including larger patient numbers because ratios of biological subsets within the clinical "umbrella" diagnosis will remain the same.

For example, schizophrenia is, in most cases, a chronic disease clinically diagnosed with positive (hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder), negative (flattened affect, lack of drive), and cognitive symptoms (working memory and attention deficits). The diversity of underlying biology in schizophrenia patients is already mirrored by variations in chronic impairment and biological time courses. As repeatedly demonstrated on the genetic level, there is strong overlap of schizophrenia with recurrent affective disorders – arguing against the value of a purely clinical diagnosis for investigating underlying biology. Attempts to identify common genetic variants increasing the risk for obtaining the clinical diagnosis schizophrenia led to the discovery of over 108 associated loci with low logarithm of odds (LOD) scores of all genes of below 18, except MHCII with a LOD score of 30. These relatively small effect sizes could in part be due to the "dilution of subsets" argument outlined above.

### Respiratory pattern in a FSHD pediatric population [^113zQdfr]. Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by selective weakness of face and upper arms and girdle. Respiratory involvement in FSHD has been described mainly in the most severely affected patients. In this work we tested the respiratory function by spirometry in 12 patients affected by FSHD with onset before 18 years. Spirometry results were correlated with motor involvement and compared to aged matched group of Becker patients. Of note FSHD patients present a peculiar pattern characterized by a flat shape in flow-volume loop. Respiratory volumes correlate with clinical severity and expiratory phase is specifically affected in comparison to other muscular dystrophies.

### Examining clinical training through a bicultural lens: experiences of genetic counseling students who identify with a racial or ethnic minority group [^112G5bpK]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2022). Medium credibility.

In other cases, participants unintentionally switched communication styles. One participant, who had learned English as a second language, said that she found out 'the hard way' that she had a different affect when speaking in English compared with Spanish:

I have a flat affect in English. That was a big thing that my counselors would point out when I was starting to do sessions. But… I'm actually not like that when I speak in Spanish, and I talk with my hands a lot. And I think it's because I learned Spanish socially, so I learned Spanish seeing my parents talking, making facial expressions… In English, when I speak with my patients, I might be saying the same things, but my facial affect is much more flat.

Notably, some participants highlighted the genetic counseling tenet of non‐directiveness as being an unsuitable approach for individuals from their culture. One participant cautioned that individuals from Southeast Asia were accustomed to a more paternalistic healthcare model: 'If my mom was going to see a genetic counselor, and they said, 'Oh, genetic testing is completely your decision', my mom would just question the authority of that provider'. When she counsels patients from Southeast Asia, she utilizes a more directive approach: 'You're not making that decision for them, but you're giving them more guidance than you would when it comes to your Caucasian patient population'. Her perception is that this is more effective for patients from her culture because, 'If I used the same approach, the session would go nowhere. They probably would feel more lost than they were at the beginning of the appointment'.

### Improving the inspection and manual cleaning of dental instruments in a dental hospital [^117SyGun]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Baseline measurement

To collect our baseline data, we used the three key phases of baseline measurement: develop, collect, analyse. Our main objective for this project was to investigate whether contamination of instruments is a significant problem, and to what extent. Our first process measure that we assessed was the number of kits that were contaminated on opening. The second process measure was to look at which instruments were affected. The outcome measure was whether the contaminated instruments affected patient care.

In order to collect the data, we had to decide on a universal definition of contamination. We defined a contaminated instrument as one with any amount of visible cement and explained this to our colleagues who assisted in collecting the data, during a clinical session in the children's department of the dental hospital. We decided to collect our data using a short questionnaire (attached below) which was our first PDSA cycle.

PDSA 1 - A Questionnaire to Investigate the Problem

P- Prepare a questionnaire, which would highlight whether contaminated instruments were a problem, and which instruments were commonly affected. The questionnaire should be simple, and not time-consuming, to encourage students and staff to participate in our improvement project.

D- During a clinical session in the children's department of the dental school, every student treating a patient was asked to examine their kit on opening and identify any contaminated instruments. We asked the students to specify which instrument(s) was/were contaminated and if this affected patient care.

S- The students found the questionnaire easy to understand and every student who treated a patient completed a questionnaire. The feedback also highlighted that they were simple and quick to complete which encouraged participation. Of the six kits that were opened on the afternoon clinic, four were free from cement contamination, while two kits were not free from cement. Of these two kits, one had a contaminated flat plastic and treatment was not affected. The other contaminated kit contained a contaminated excavator, which did affect treatment and compromise patient care.

### Level of attention to motherese speech as an early marker of autism spectrum disorder [^115di9A7]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Our data also suggest that the subgroup of the population with ASD and low attention to motherese may be more homogeneous at some intermediate psychobiological level, thereby potentially justifying the use of this test to stratify the population with autism in future studies of social attention and its correlates. A recent studyrevealed that toddlers with ASD who showed low attention levels to motherese speech as a group had lower levels of neural functional activity in classic speech-processing areas, such as the superior temporal gyrus, compared with other toddlers with ASD who paid greater attention to motherese speech.

Our findings also revealed a dissociation between saccade rates depending on what toddlers were looking at but only for the ASD subgroup that showed the lowest levels of attention to motherese. These toddlers showed a greater number of saccades during the brief periods that they viewed the motherese videos, possibly reflecting greater anxiety or challenges related to speech processing.

Interestingly, the motherese vs flat affect paradigm was not effective as a diagnostic classifier, showing only minimal between-group ASD vs TD differences. Given that null results are rarely reported, we believed this was important to underscore. One reason may be related to the nature of the flat affect video that contained an actress speaking in an unnatural computer-like voice that caused several toddlers to smirk and may have artificially increased attention to this video. Indeed, total looking time in the flat affect AOI was higher than in the nonmotherese contrast videos used in the other paradigms.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has several strengths. These include comprehensive diagnostic and psychometric evaluations conducted by licensed clinical psychologists blind to eye-tracking scores and the inclusion of multiple contrast groups including toddlers with non-ASD delays, an essential component for determining future clinical utility.

This study also has limitations. Given that the sample contained a combination of toddlers who first failed a parent-report screen at well-infant checkups and general community referrals, a key limitation relates to the unknown generalizability of the findings as a universal screening approach.

### The effect of flow on swimming bacteria controls the initial colonization of curved surfaces [^11125e2N]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The attachment of individual bacteria to a surface is the first step toward the formation of surface-attached communities known as biofilms. Biofilms grow on human tissues, including the lungs, urinary tract, eyes, and in chronic wounds, and on implanted devices, such as catheters, prosthetic cardiac valves, and intrauterine devices, posing serious health threats and reducing device lifetime. Biofouling and biocorrosion are ubiquitous, costly problems also in other settings, from industrial wastewater systems to marine environments. To date, the mechanistic understanding of bacterial colonization of surfaces mainly focused on flat surfaces –; yet in many applications surfaces are not flat. As a result, no general framework exists to account for the role of surface shape on bacterial colonization.

Bacterial transport is often affected by fluid flow, a feature of many microbial habitats. In a straight microfluidic channel, motile bacteria become trapped close to flat surfaces, inducing a strong concentration of cells close to the channel walls. The trapping is a hydrodynamic phenomenon, determined by the action of fluid shear on motile, elongated bacteria. Bacterial accumulation also occurs in shallow microfluidic channels behind obstacles and after constrictions, and in curved channels downstream of corners, leading to the formation of suspended biofilm structures –. In groundwater, the size of the grains of the porous matrix, and the heterogeneity in flow velocities, affect the transport of colloids and, potentially, bacteria. In the human body, secondary flows in the lungs depend on airway geometry, while urine transport is controlled by the amplitude of the contraction waves causing peristaltic motion in the ureter. In the gut, both the luminal flow and the undulated morphology of intestinal villi affect the adhesion to the gut epithelium and the growth of pathogenic bacteria, such as enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, which, in the absence of peristaltic motion, overgrow and trigger an immune response and inflammation. Hosts can also exploit flow-mediated transport of bacteria to favor bacterial adhesion to their surfaces, as occurs in the gut of the bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes, whose cilia create a flow that favors the recruitment of symbiotic Vibrio fischeri. Similarly, the ciliated epidermal surface of corals creates flows that stir the boundary layer, enhancing oxygen transportand potentially affecting the transport of symbionts and pathogens. In these and many other scenarios, bacteria are recruited to surfaces that are not flat. Yet, despite its biological relevance, a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between flow and bacterial motility in the initial colonization of uneven and curved surfaces is so far missing.

### Solitary eosinophilic granuloma of the adult lumbar spine [^117QoW6b]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Eosinophilic granuloma (EG) is a benign bone tumor that rarely occurs in adults. It is usually found occurring in flat and long bones, but spine is often affected too. EG is of unknown aetiology, and the course of the disease is unpredictable.

Materials and Methods

Two cases of EG of the adult lumbar spine are reported, representing a difficult challenge for diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusion

CT scan guided trocar biopsy allowed to achieve a definitive diagnosis, and CT scan guided intralesional infiltrations of corticosteroids were the successful treatment.

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^115C6AKk]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Flow convergence method (PISA) for quantitation of valvular regurgitation — measurement, interpretation, and pitfalls are outlined as follows: The color frame for PISA measurement should be timed to the instant "corresponding to the maximal jet velocity by CWD". When reporting effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA), "it is best to use the "mean" EROA…; preferably, the RVol should be retained as the most appropriate index". The regurgitant orifice may be nonplanar; it "may be conical rather than flat or planar (180°)… the flow convergence covers more than a hemisphere". If hemispheric geometry is limited by constraint, the operator should attempt to relieve it "by increasing the Va", and "if the constraint persists… the echocardiographer should decide whether a simple correction for the truncation of the flow convergence is possible, and if not, the method should not be reported". Elliptical orifices cause bias: "Application of the standard PISA formula to such an elliptical orifice will lead predictably to flow underestimation", quantified as "For a 3: 1 ellipse… 8% underestimation… a 5: 1 ratio… 17% underestimation, and a 10: 1 ratio… 35% underestimation". Jet direction affects feasibility: "Central jets allow an easy alignment", whereas "eccentric jets may present a challenge". Advanced imaging can help; "Three-dimensional color flow would provide a better assessment… although with additional limitations of lower spatial and temporal resolution". With multiple jets, "the PISA method can be applied to each orifice, with flows and EROA added together; if one lesion is very mild, it can be neglected", and overall, PISA "is the most used method for quantitation of valvular regurgitation in routine clinical practice".

### Saddle-shaped mitral valve annuloplasty rings improve leaflet coaptation geometry [^1132KwGj]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The mitral valve annulus naturally conforms to a saddle shape in systole. This configuration is believed to put the leaflets into a lower-energy equilibrium with the annulus and subvalvular apparatus. Conventional flat annuloplasty rings restrict posterior leaflet motion, which may result in a "monocusp" valve, affecting valvular stress distribution. It is hypothesized that saddle-shaped annuloplasty rings cause less distortion of the physiologic leaflet geometry than do flat rings.

Methods

Twelve pigs were studied in an acute setting with 3-dimensional echocardiography and sonomicrometry before and after implantation of rigid flat (n = 5) and saddle-shaped (n = 7) annuloplasty rings. The rings were true sized to the annulus with equal anterior-posterior and commissure-commissure circumferential dimensions. The saddle-shaped rings had an annular height to commissural width ratio of 15%.

Results

Saddle-shaped rings maintained both leaflets operational (P < .01). Flat rings made the posterior leaflet immobile and the anterior leaflet aligned flat along the annulus in systole, effectively resulting in monoleaflet function. The average distance from the papillary muscle tips to the posterior annulus decreased by 2.4 ± 0.4 mm after flat ring implantation (P < .01).

Conclusions

Saddle-shaped annuloplasty rings provide better leaflet coaptation geometry than do flat rings by not hoisting the papillary muscles toward the posterior annulus through the commissural chordae, allowing greater leaflet mobility. This entails a potentially beneficial impact on valvular stress distribution that could affect durability of the repaired valve.

### Dynamics and drivers of tidal flat morphology in China [^116b1iVm]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Human impact through conversion

Conversion of tidal flats to other land use directly and indirectly influence the evolution of tidal flats. To investigate the morphological evolution of large-scale tidal flat systems with environmental factors (i.e. hydrodynamic forcing and sediment availability), we excluded transects affected by direct conversion. First, we identified tidal flat transects with direct conversion by analyzing satellite imagery (see Supplementary Fig. 12). The tidal flats are mainly converted to agriculture or aquaculture land use, and also (about 1.2%) to artificial sandy beaches in areas like Xiamen city. 750 transects are affected by direct conversion, which are excluded from our analysis.

To compare the effects of direct conversion and external drivers, we identified nine transects that were converted at the beginning of our study period and have SSC change data, so that we can track their development. The results show that eight out of nine transects exhibited a seaward progradation trend after the conversion (Supplementary Fig. 11). The rate of tidal flat width change exceeds the rate of tidal flat evolution driven by natural drivers, highlighting the important difference imposed by direct conversion and the necessity to exclude those transects in our study.

As conversion can also affect nearby hydrodynamic conditions, thereby influencing adjacent remaining tidal flat evolution by far-field effects. Therefore, we further excluded transects adjacent to those directly impacted by conversion. We identified nine estuaries or bays where the conversion level is high (over 40% of the transects were directly converted), including Qinjiang Estuary, Yingzai River Estuary, Zhenhai Bay, Luojiang Estuary, Wenzhou Bay, Wulei Island Bay, Liaohe Estuary, the southern coast of Hangzhou Bay, and Qixing Reef. The remaining transects were identified as being influenced by far-field effects of conversion. Additionally, those adjacent to converted transects along the open coast are also deemed influenced by far-field effects. After excluding all these 156 transects, our primary conclusions regarding spatial and temporal patterns remain unchanged (See Supplementary Fig. 13).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112XpKn6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections — incidence, classification, and timing: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common adverse events affecting hospitalized surgical patients, with an average incidence of SSI of 2.6%, accounting for 38% of nosocomial infections in surgical patients. SSIs are divided into the categories of superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ/space SSI. Superficial incisional SSIs involve only the subcutaneous space between the skin and underlying muscular fascia, occur within 30 days of the surgery, and are documented with at least 1 of the following: purulent incisional drainage; positive culture of aseptically obtained fluid or tissue from the superficial wound; local signs and symptoms of pain or tenderness, swelling, and erythema after the incision is opened by the surgeon; or diagnosis of SSI by the attending surgeon or physician. A deep incisional infection involves the deeper soft tissue and occurs within 30 days of the operation or within 1 year if a prosthesis was inserted, and an organ/space SSI has the same time constraints and evidence for infection and may involve any part of the anatomy other than the original surgical incision. Flat, erythematous skin changes can occur around or near a surgical incision during the first week without swelling or wound drainage, most resolve without any treatment, and the cause may relate to tape sensitivity or other local tissue insult not involving bacteria. Antibiotics begun immediately postoperatively or continued for long periods after the procedure do not prevent or cure this inflammation or infection; therefore, the suspicion of possible SSI does not justify use of antibiotics without a definitive diagnosis and measures such as opening the wound. SSIs rarely occur during the first 48 hours after surgery and are almost always due to S. pyogenes or Clostridium species when they do; after 48 hours, SSI is a more common source of fever and, by 4 days after surgery, a fever is equally likely to be caused by an SSI or by another infection or other unknown sources.

### Changes in spatiotemporal gait patterns during flat ground walking and obstacle crossing 1 year after bariatric surgery [^1115Rac9]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity has a negative impact on motor function, leading to an increase in fall risk. Massive weight loss improves some aspects of gait on flat ground. However, we have little information about whether gait changes during flat-ground walking and during more complex motor tasks beyond flat-ground walking.

Objectives

Our objectives were to examine how massive weight loss after Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery affects gait during flat-ground walking and obstacle crossing 1 year postsurgery.

Setting

University hospital, United States.

Methods

Nineteen women walked under 5 conditions: initial baseline walking on flat ground, crossing 3 obstacle heights, and final baseline walking on flat ground, for a total of 25 trials. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were collected simultaneously using a gait carpet and body-worn sensors.

Results

Gait improved postsurgery, with the strongest effect observed for double-limb support time during flat-ground walking (P < .001) and obstacle crossing (P < .001). The reduction in body mass index was correlated with improved swing (P < .01) and double-limb support time (P < .01) during flat-ground walking and improved swing during obstacle crossing on low (P < .01), medium (P < .01), and high (P < .01) obstacles. Improved gait postsurgery was more pronounced on high obstacles for velocity (P < .001) and double-limb support time (P < .001).

Conclusions

Massive weight loss results in improved spatiotemporal gait patterns during flat-ground walking. Examining how massive weight loss affects spatiotemporal gait may help create ways to encourage a more active lifestyle for adults with obesity.

### The construction of emotional meaning in language [^111dNWpH]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

This meaning can be articulated in language. Psychology has a long history of using language to study emotional meaning-making (for recent reviews, see –). Often, the emphasis is on the emotions explicitly named (e.g. "I am disappointed") or on the primary dimensions of affect (in)directly conveyed(e.g.is an unpleasant experience). These approaches have yielded valuable insights into the words that individuals and cultural groups use for emotions –, and how language relates to subjective experience, well-being and health – (for a review, see ref.). Yet language is more than a collection of labels or a vehicle for subjective feeling –. The contextual features that comprise the experience of emotion can also be gleaned from language, expanding the dimensionality of situated meaning-making.

In this perspective, we argue that psychology should use a broader set of tools to study the construction of emotional meaning in language. We put forward three sets of language features that capture: the contextual features or aspects of experience salient at each moment (attention); the conceptual vantage point which from events are viewed (construal); the evaluation of events along relevant dimensions (appraisal). We explain in turn how each of these language features can be used to answer specific questions about emotional meaning-making and how it varies based on situation, person, and culture. These questions are ideally answered using natural language — the words, sentences, and stories organically generated by people as they speak and write, constrained only by the pragmatics of where, with whom, and about what they are communicating. These characteristics make natural language a rich and ubiquitous source of information about psychological processes, without requiring these processes to be introspected or reported upon directly –. We hypothesize that the patterns of attention, construal, and appraisal revealed by language will correspond with momentary fluctuations in emotion as well as with differences in how experiences of emotion play out over time for individuals and groups (Figs. 1 and 2). Our approach to emotional meaning-making is constructionist and profoundly interdisciplinary. We conclude by considering its implications and next steps.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^113kYW2i]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity physical evaluation requires a complete physical examination because of the disease's complex and multisystem effects, and the physical exam requires focused attention to specific obesity-related findings. Vital signs such as heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure should be taken; blood pressure should be measured accurately with an appropriately sized cuff. Other important signs include that short stature may be a sign of a genetic or endocrinologic cause for overweight and obesity; flat affect may indicate depression, anxious mood may indicate anxiety, attention-seeking may be a signal for underlying distress over overweight and obesity, and syndromic features may also offer indications of the presence of an underlying genetic cause for obesity. Skin examination should be performed to look for intertrigo and hidradenitis suppurativa associated with excess skin folds as well as acanthosis nigricans associated with insulin resistance; flesh-colored striae may be seen on the abdominal wall and/or thighs as an indication of rapid weight gain; and the combination of purplish abdominal striae, slowed linear growth, cervicodorsal fat accumulation, proximal muscle wasting, full facies, and hypertension should prompt evaluation for Cushing syndrome. Examination of the head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat should occur to look for papilledema associated with pseudotumor cerebri and tonsillar hypertrophy associated with sleep-related issues as indicated on-page.

### Post-mastectomy flat closure: a mixed-methods analysis of patient outcomes and perspectives [^116EZmro]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

The quantitative data from the electronic health records and the BREAST-Q survey provided valuable insights into patient preferences and experiences. The decision to choose flat closure after mastectomy was influenced by factors such as lower complication rates, shorter recovery time, avoidance of foreign body placement, and individual personal circumstances. While physical well-being and satisfaction with surgeons scored highest in the QoL and Patient Satisfaction domains, respectively, our analysis also revealed concerningly low scores for sexual well-being and satisfaction with breasts. Interestingly, satisfaction with breasts did not significantly differ based on preoperative breast size or laterality of mastectomy. This suggests that factors beyond the physical dimensions of the breast, such as individual perceptions of aesthetic outcomes, the use of external prostheses, and, potentially, experiences of 'flat denial', may play a more significant role in shaping overall satisfaction with the decision to go flat. For instance, the higher utilization of external prostheses among unilateral mastectomy patients (42.0% vs. 23.2%) could indicate an attempt to mitigate aesthetic and functional concerns related to asymmetry, potentially influencing their satisfaction levels. However, the low scores in sexual well-being and breast satisfaction warrant further investigation, particularly when compared with the meta-analysis by Shauly et al. that reported higher satisfaction in these domains among patients who underwent implant-based or autologous reconstruction. While the limitations of the BREAST-Q, which was originally designed for patients undergoing breast reconstruction, likely contribute, other factors are probably at play. Some patients may struggle with adapting to a body without breasts, even if they chose flat closure. This could be exacerbated by societal pressures surrounding femininity and the prevalent notion that breasts are integral to a woman's identity. One patient's comment that the term 'go flat' felt "dismissive of the complications and nature of the decision not to have reconstruction" highlights the emotional complexity surrounding this choice. Despite these concerns, most patients expressed satisfaction with certain aspects of their flat closure experience, supporting the viability of flat closure as an option for mastectomy patients. Our study found that a majority of patients who underwent flat closure expressed satisfaction with their surgical outcomes, with most rating their postoperative health as good, very good, or excellent. This aligns with the findings of Baker et al. who reported a mean satisfaction score of 3.72 out of 5 among women active in online 'Going Flat' communities, and that 74.1% of their respondents indicated that mastectomy alone was their first choice. While our study did not utilize the same satisfaction scale, the generally positive self-reported health ratings and the overall satisfaction expressed by our participants suggest a comparable level of contentment with flat closure.

### Affectivity in the problem-solving interactions of schizophrenia patients and their family members [^1177h9QD]. Schizophrenia Research (2004). Low credibility.

This study sought to examine the relationship between symptomatology and the affect expressed between individuals with schizophrenia and their family members. It was hypothesized that, because of their impact on patient social behavior and potential burden on relatives, greater negative symptoms would be associated with less emotional expression in patients but would be related to the greater expression of negative emotions in their relatives within a problem-solving discussion. Informed by research on the structure of emotion, a broad assessment of affect, including Negativity, Positivity, and Disengagement, was utilized to examine affect expressed by patients with schizophrenic disorders (N = 91) and their family members during videotaped problem-solving discussions. Although individuals with schizophrenia were comparable to their family members in displays of Negativity, patients displayed less Positivity and greater Disengagement. Greater negative symptoms (in particular blunted or flat affect) were related to a general diminution of affective expression in the schizophrenia group. However, negative symptoms were unrelated to the emotional expression of family members. Other symptoms such as thought disorder and mood symptoms of anxiety, depression, and hostility were not related to displays of affect by either patients or their family members. The findings indicate the importance of examining domains of affect other than negativity and demonstrate that negative symptoms are related to interpersonal displays of affect in schizophrenia. Additionally, these results suggest that schizophrenic symptoms, by themselves, may contribute little to the conflict between patients and their family members.

### Speech and physiological correlates of "Flat" affect… [^1145LSTg]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

ALTHOUGH delineation of affect states is an important factor in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric problems, little empirical work has been done with the correlates of such states. Two important questions for investigation would appear to be: What happens to the speech pattern during different affective states. and What are the autonomic and skeletal correlates of such states. The present study will attempt to answer the above questions for a specific emotional state: that of "flat" affect. It is common clinical practice to differentiate affect states during psychiatric examination, yet there are few textbook guidelines for such differentiation. Depression and elation are more frequently discussed and more easily recognized clinically. But one looks in vain for clinical descriptions of what is variously termed "flat, " "shallow, " or "blunted" affect. This deficiency is surprising in view of the fact that "flat" affect is seen in such a variety.

### Cavitation upon low-speed solid-liquid impact [^114DbnJy]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 4
The impacting body must have an edge for cavitation to occur.

a The impact of a 20-mm-diameter sphere at 9.89 m/s forming a weak compression wave (red arrows) that emanates into the pool without causing cavitation. b and c Show two views of a 50-mm-diameter cylinder with a convex curvature of radius 0.60 m on the bottom surface impacting at 7.75 m/s. The tension wave that reflects when the edge submerges ((c) t = 32−42 μs) causes cavitation where the waves overlap. d and e Show two views of the same curved cylinder impacting at 3.47 m/s. By the time the edges submerge the pressure amplitude near the contact line has decreased sufficient such that a reflected tension wave (thick, dark region) is not visible and no cavitation occurs. The gold shapes at the top of each frame indicate the approximate position, shape, and size of the lower portion of the impacting body. a, c and e are schlieren images with light regions indicating increasing pressure in the upward direction and dark regions indicating decreasing pressure. The ambient pressure in all cases is 1 atm. Supplemental movies 7–11 show a – e, respectively.

The spherical geometry changes some aspects of the impact event altering the cavitation and its prediction. As the pressure waves originate in the center and travel radially outward, the summing and focusing of the waves differs causing cavitation to initiate deeper in the pool (Fig. 4 c, t = 66 μs) instead of directly beneath the last edge to impact (Fig. 2 b, t = 30 μs). The curvature also changes the shape of the free surface depressionsuch that assuming a flat free surface no longer appears sufficient to approximate α. As these effects complicate the reflected pressure and the pressure field, additional modeling will be required to predicted the onset of cavitation for such variations in geometry.

These results provide experimental evidence and scaling laws showing that cavitation occurs in solid-liquid impacts more often than previously thought, where impact speeds are above 4.5 m/s, impact angles are less than ~1°, and the impacting body has an edge where a reflection can occur.

### Pre-clinical indications of brain stimulation treatments for non-affective psychiatric disorders, a status update [^114e4a52]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Review of indications

Psychosis

Psychotic disorders encompass schizophrenia spectrum and related disorders, which are characterized by abnormalities in at least one of the following five symptom domains: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, or negative symptoms, such as flat affect, reduced avolition and disorganized thought, disrupted speech, and behavior. Schizophrenia is the most commonly diagnosed and studied psychotic disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 2.8 million adults in the United States. Importantly, schizophrenia represents one of the more commonly studied disorders using NIBS, however many clinical trials have attempted to analyze the effects of neuromodulation on both positive and negative symptoms, yielding inconsistent results. Although the neuropathology underlying these illnesses has not been fully elucidated, dysregulation of the limbic system and the frontoparietal cortex is commonly reported. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia differ, so results from clinical trials will be discussed for each group of symptoms separately. First-line treatment for schizophrenia typically involves antipsychotic medications often augmented with psychotherapeutic intervention. Antipsychotic medications have been largely effective in reducing the experience of positive symptoms, but are less effective at reducing negative symptoms, disorganization, and cognitive dysfunction. At present, treatment regimens for schizophrenia are limited; in addition to the estimated 30% treatment resistance, interventions produce numerous adverse effects, inadequately treat the wide spectrum of symptoms, and continue to be associated with adherence challenges. Therefore, there is great interest in the capability of NIBS to combat psychotic symptoms that are notoriously difficult to treat. Evidence suggests abnormal hyper-connectivity between the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) may be implicated in the experience of auditory hallucinations. As such, NIBS could potentially target this abnormal activity by inducing LTD between these overactive networks through inhibitory stimulation protocols. However, the literature is replete with inconsistent findings and thus much more study is needed before conclusions can be drawn. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the involvement of DLPFC hypofunctioning and cortico-subcortical circuits in negative and cognitive symptoms. Reduced activation in the DLPFC during working memory tasks has been observed in individuals with more severe negative symptoms, suggesting a connection between DLPFC dysfunction and presenting symptoms. Interactions between the DLPFC and other regions, such as the striatum and thalamus, are also implicated in the emergence of cognitive and negative symptoms. These findings provide potential targets for NIBS in alleviating hypofunctioning of brain regions, and restoring associated cortico-subcortical circuits.

### Contextualizing remote fall risk: video data capture and implementing ethical AI [^1133FCdc]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Environmental context

To establish a baseline for natural gait, the study analyzed periods of the video in which no external factors affected the gait of the 10 participants (i.e. walks on flat/level ground). These baseline characteristics were then compared with the characteristics observed during periods when obvious external factors could influence gait, such as navigating stairs (Fig. 3). For instance when comparing baseline flat walking, stair ascent, and stair descent, the mean step, stance, stride, and swing times were all relatively similar. However, the standard deviation and asymmetry measures in these scenarios were found to differ significantly. For example, with one participant, when the context captured from the wearable video glasses showed flat-level terrain (Fig. 3) very low step time asymmetry (0.025) and standard deviation (0.019) values were observed (Table 2).

Fig. 3
Flat-level terrain (left) and participant stair ascent (right).

Table 2
Gait characteristics on different terrains

The resulting lower asymmetry (Asymmetry) and standard deviation (Std. deviation) from level flat terrain suggest a natural gait with no indication of fall risk. However, when the same participant's gait is assessed a short time later during stair ascent (Fig. 3), there is a change in gait characteristics. For instance, we see step time asymmetry increase by 116% (0.025–0.054), and the standard deviation increases by 300% (0.019–0.076), Table 2.

These pilot results suggest that gait characteristics can be significantly affected by environmental factors and that clinicians must take these factors into account when evaluating fall risk. Without the use of video to supplement the numerical IMU gait characteristics with environmental context, clinicians may misinterpret data as an indication of increased fall risk caused by an intrinsic neurological disorder, such as PD, rather than a natural response to one's environment.

### Clinical practice. lichen planus [^116tL8mc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on lichen planus:

- Definition: Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory condition that primarily affects the skin and mucous membranes.
- Pathophysiology: The exact etiology of lichen planus is unknown, but it is believed to be a T-cell mediated autoimmune reaction where the immune system mistakenly attacks skin cells.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of lichen planus in the US is estimated at 0.39%.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for lichen planus include potential triggers like viral infections (particularly hepatitis C), certain medications (such as those associated with lichenoid drug eruptions), and a genetic predisposition to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
- Disease course: The clinical course of lichen planus presents as flat topped, purple, polygonal, pruritic papules on the volar aspect of wrists and forearms, ankles, lower legs, and lumbo-sacral spine. The course of lichen planus can vary, with some cases resolving spontaneously over time, while others may follow a chronic and relapsing course.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of lichen planus is generally good, but it can be influenced by the severity of the disease.

### Can artificial intelligence be the future solution to the enormous challenges and suffering caused by schizophrenia? [^1152spVF]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, AI has demonstrated significant potential in advancing SZ diagnosis and management. By integrating multidimensional biomarkers such as symptomatology, genetic markers, and imaging features, AI-driven models can predict disease progression and symptom evolution with increased accuracy. This capability not only enhances diagnostic precision but also provides a basis for developing individualized treatment strategies. Future research should focus on leveraging AI to monitor diverse biomarkers, reveal structural network heterogeneity, and link the findings to clinical characteristics. Such efforts can improve the specificity and effectiveness of clinical interventions, ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients.

AI-enhanced treatment of SZ

The clinical manifestations of SZ include positive symptoms (e.g. delusion, hallucination, and formal thought disorder) and negative symptoms (e.g. avolition, poverty of speech, and flat affect). In recent years, cognitive dysfunction has been recognized as a core feature of the disease, with patients often exhibiting poor performance in executive function, long-term memory, and sustained attention as well as a potential overall decline in intelligence. These cognitive deficits severely impact the social and occupational functioning of patients, which presents a major challenge in current treatment approaches. To date, the only class of medications that has been proven effective for SZ is antipsychotics, which act by blocking postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors. However, these drugs are often associated with significant side effects, including sedation, weight gain, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Tardive dyskinesia, an irreversible but rarely life-threatening syndrome of involuntary movements, significantly affects the quality of life (QoL) of patients. Based on these findings, we recognize that SZ treatment continues to face major challenges. The primary issue is the individualized dosing strategy for antipsychotics. Clinicians need to strike a balance between maximizing therapeutic effects while minimizing side effects, which requires precise dose adjustments. Additionally, a significant heterogeneity exists in the responses of patients to treatment, which necessitates personalized treatment plans. Clinicians often undergo a systematic trial-and-error process to determine the optimal treatment strategy, which is time-consuming and may delay the treatment opportunity.

### A bicentric study on the prevalence and clinical relevance of subarachnoid hyperdensities on flat-detector CT after thrombectomy in dominant, co-dominant, and non-dominant M2 occlusions [^117GtU5a]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Image acquisition

FDCT

The following post-interventional images were acquired in the angio-suite:

FDCT (Allura Xper FD 20 flat-detector with Xper-CT, Philips, Best, The Netherlands). The acquisition parameters have been reported in detail elsewhere.
The Sine Spin FDCT (ARTIS icono biplane; Siemens, Germany). The acquisition parameters have been previously reported.

Follow-up imaging

One center obtained all follow-up scans with an IQon spectral scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands). Acquisition parameters have been reported in detail elsewhere. Spectral postprocessing was performed using dedicated software (IntelliSpace Portal, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands). A virtual non-contrast (VNC) scan, iodine-removed map, and an iodine map were generated.

The other center obtained follow-up CT with a Somatom Definition Edge scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Follow-up MRI studies were performed at a magnetic field strength of 1.5 T or 3 T. Follow-up protocols mostly included axial DWI and a matching ADC map, axial FLAIR, 3D TOF-MRA of the intracranial arteries, and axial SWI.

Image analysis

Post-interventional FDCT

The presence of SH on FDCT was documented using a visual grading scale (I–IV) as described previously. Grading was as follows:

Grade I: SH in 1 or 2 adjacent sulci.
Grade II: SH in ≥ 3 adjacent sulci but confined to a single lobe.
Grade III: diffuse sulcal SH affecting ≥ 2 lobes.
Grade IV: diffuse sulcal hyperdensities affecting ≥ 2 lobes and intraventricular extension or extension into basal cisterns.

(Fig. 2) depicts the visual grading scale of SH.

### Automatic processing of verbal emotion stimuli in schizophrenia [^111B6Q6L]. Psychiatry Research (2003). Low credibility.

In the present study, automatic processing of verbal emotion stimuli was investigated as a function of affective symptoms, emotional state and trait characteristics of chronic schizophrenia patients. A sequential pronunciation priming task was administered to 30 schizophrenia patients with a flat affect expression, 30 schizophrenia patients suffering from anhedonia, 28 schizophrenia patients not suffering from anhedonia or flat affect, and 30 healthy subjects to assess affective and semantic priming effects. The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (Andreasen, British Journal of Psychiatry, 1989, 155, 53–58) was applied to evaluate the flat affect and anhedonia, and to categorize patients into groups. Schizophrenia patients did not differ from healthy subjects in affective and semantic priming scores. However, affective priming based on positive primes was inversely correlated with negative state and trait affectivity, and positively correlated with trait joy in the patient sample. These results support the view that a decrement in automatic processing facilitation of positive valence might play a role in the development of negative emotions. The symptoms of flat affect and anhedonia do not appear to be associated with impairments in the automatic processing of verbal emotional material in schizophrenia.

### Flat affect in schizophrenia: relation to emotion processing and neurocognitive measures [^115EnWGZ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

Impaired emotional functioning in schizophrenia is a prominent clinical feature that manifests primarily as flat affect. Studies have examined the perception, experience, and expression of emotions in schizophrenia and reported normal ratings of experience but impaired affect identification. However, the relation between flat affect and performance on facial affect identification and cognitive tasks has not been systematically examined in relation to premorbid adjustment and clinical outcome. We report a prospective study of 63 patients with at least moderate severity of flat affect and 99 patients without flat affect, who were compared on functional domains, emotion processing tasks, and neurocognitive measures. Flat affect was more common in men and was associated with poorer premorbid adjustment, worse current quality of life, and worse outcome at 1-year follow-up. Patients overall performed more poorly on emotion processing tasks, one that required identification of happy and sad emotions and one that required differentiating among intensities within these emotions. They responded inaccurately yet faster than controls for the intensity differentiation task, suggesting a decomposition of the normal relation between accuracy and speed. Flat affect ratings, compared with other negative symptoms, uniquely predicted performance on emotion processing tasks. Patients with flat affect showed greater impairment in both emotion processing tasks, with the most pronounced impairment for the intensity differentiation task. However, the 2 patient groups did not differ in the neurocognitive profile except for verbal memory. We conclude that flat affect is an important clinical feature of schizophrenia that exacerbates the course of illness.

### What the face displays: mapping 28 emotions conveyed by naturalistic expression [^114bF1Es]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

What emotions do the face and body express? Guided by new conceptual and quantitative approaches (Cowen, Elfenbein, Laukka, & Keltner, 2018; Cowen & Keltner, 2017, 2018), we explore the taxonomy of emotion recognized in facial-bodily expression. Participants (N = 1,794; 940 female, ages 18–76 years) judged the emotions captured in 1,500 photographs of facial-bodily expression in terms of emotion categories, appraisals, free response, and ecological validity. We find that facial-bodily expressions can reliably signal at least 28 distinct categories of emotion that occur in everyday life. Emotion categories, more so than appraisals such as valence and arousal, organize emotion recognition. However, categories of emotion recognized in naturalistic facial and bodily behavior are not discrete but bridged by smooth gradients that correspond to continuous variations in meaning. Our results support a novel view that emotions occupy a high-dimensional space of categories bridged by smooth gradients of meaning. They offer an approximation of a taxonomy of facial-bodily expressions, visualized within an online interactive map. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

### Affective integration in experience, judgment, and decision-making [^117FYU8L]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Still, it is difficult to answer the question "what is the role of affect in judgment and decision making?" as there are many contradictory observations explained through a large array of theoretical mediators. For instance, positive affect is associated with increased risk-taking in some studies (a mood-congruent, informational effect e.g. –) and decreased risk-taking in others (a mood-incongruent effect e.g. –). Affect-as-information account may predict that positive affect increases the perceived value of winning and thus drive risk taking for a potential gain. Affect-as-motivation, on the other hand, may predict that positive affect attributed to better-than-expected progress could cause individuals to be more risk-averse to protect their mood state. The prediction of affect-as-a-spotlight view would depend on how the probability information is weighted. As a result, an intense positive affect may increase risk taking for a small probability gain but not so much for a high probability gain. Thus, whether the valence of an incidental mood increases or decreases risk-taking depends upon which mechanism dominates. However, the research paradigms used in linking affect and decision-making are often unable to arbitrate between these alternative mechanisms. One reason for this is that many studies tend to focus on connecting a feeling state to an increased or a decreased tendency for a certain response. Recent advances in psychological science underlines the shortcomings of this type of essentialist feeling-to-behavior mapping that overlooks contextual factors –. Second, affect is often operationalized as feeling states that is implicitly (due to study design and methods) or explicitly (to simplify the problem) assumed to be static and limited in time to only here and now, a typical manifestation of the snapshot approach, which do not account for the fact that mental states and behavior are temporally dependent. Third, the traditional scientific paradigm in psychological research regards context effects as nuisance or moderators of underlying processes that can be removed by study design and analysis, e.g. by randomizing trials and analyzing summary scores. Collectively, these approaches are representative of a problem that is prevalent in the vast bulk of the paradigms and data on this topic – we effectively ignore the temporal nature of mental states and its dynamic impact on judgments and decisions. We argue that by ignoring the continuous nature of affect, the field can make little progress beyond simple models, and a better and systematic understanding of the mechanism through which affect influence judgments and decisions will be hard to achieve. To reconcile this issue, we suggest that there is a need to adopt an approach that attempts to understand how affect is constructed from the ongoing information flow and how this evolving state modulates information processing feeding into judgments and decisions continuously (for a similar approach, see).

### Awe is characterized as an ambivalent affect in the human behavior and cortex [^113FchSU]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

These results suggest that awe is more closely related to ambivalent feeling compared to simply pleasing or displeasing ones.

Ambivalent feelings emerge as salient predictors of awe

We tested the predictive power of ambivalence-related metrics on the subjective intensity of awe. Before assessing the predictive relationship between ambivalent feeling and awe, we first tested whether its two appraisal dimensions are related to mutually opposing feelings. To this end, we fitted mixed-effects linear regression models predicting each clip's self-reported intensity of positive and negative affects, using the AWE-S averaged scores for 'vastness' and 'accommodation' factors as regressors. The vastness appraisal showed a significant positive fixed effect on positive affect (= .247, P = 2 × 10–4, 95% CI = [0.122, 0.371]), but no significant fixed effect on negative affect (= 0.007, P = 0.907, 95% CI = [-0.118, 0.133]). In contrast, the accommodation appraisal showed a significant positive fixed effect on negative affect (= 0.234, P = 0.002, 95% CI = [0.086, 0.382]) and significant negative fixed effect on positive affect (= −0.394, P = 4 × 10–7, 95% CI = [−0.541, −0.248]). These findings support our conceptual model, suggesting that each appraisal is linked to opposite affect, allowing awe to be better characterized as an ambivalent feeling compared to simply univalent ones.

Next, we evaluated whether awe is better characterized as an ambivalent affect than simply univalent ones. The linear mixed effects model analysis revealed that only the duration and intensity of ambivalent feelings and the intensity of positive feelings showed significant fixed effects (duration of ambivalent feelings: = 0.565, P = 0.039, 95% CI = [0.033, 1.097]; intensity of ambivalent feelings: = 0.220, P = 0.001, 95% CI = [0.090, 0.351]; intensity of positive feelings: = 0.094, P = 0.035, 95% CI = [0.007, 0.180]; see Fig. 3a), implying that intensity of awe is primarily explained by the self-reported metrics of ambivalent feelings.

Initial examination and H. pylori management in dysplastic GPMC — In the United States, "the reality is that the diagnosis of dysplasia generally hinges on confirmation from biopsy sampling". For active Helicobacter pylori infection, "it is recommended that eradication treatment be immediately provided with confirmation of eradication because (i) concomitant H. pylori infection may affect the diagnostic certainty of dysplasia; (ii) H. pylori eradication is associated with reduced risk of progression, particularly for IND and LGD; and (iii) active H. pylori infection may compromise delineation of the resection margin for visible lesions", yet "awaiting eradication confirmation should not delay endoscopic management, especially for patients with HGD". If the index examination was performed by a provider with limited volume or there are quality concerns, "referral to a high-volume center with expertise is preferred", and re-evaluation should include "systematic protocol biopsies of the surrounding flat mucosa to inform surveillance intervals", with recognition that "several studies have demonstrated rates of missed synchronous cancers around 10%, even in expert hands".

### The 2018 update of the WHO-EORTC classification for primary cutaneous lymphomas [^117Q7c2W]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome:

- Definition: Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are indolent types of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas that primarily affect the skin.
- Pathophysiology: Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome arise from clonal proliferation of malignant T-cells, primarily CD4+ memory T-cells. In mycosis fungoides, these cells infiltrate the skin, causing characteristic patches, plaques, and potential tumor formation, while in Sézary syndrome, the malignant cells circulate in the blood, leading to erythroderma and lymphadenopathy. Molecular mechanisms implicated in these diseases include genetic and epigenetic alterations that disrupt normal T-cell signaling pathways. Mutations in genes such as STAT3, TNFRSF1B, STAT5B, and PLCG1 affect the JAK/STAT and T-cell receptor pathways, promoting uncontrolled cell growth. Additionally, alterations in chromatin-modifying genes, such as TET2 and DNMT3A, contribute to epigenetic dysregulation. Aberrant expression of certain molecules (such as PD-1, CTLA-4), chemokine receptors (such as CCR4, CCR7), and dysregulation of microRNAs also play roles in disease progression and dissemination.
- Epidemiology: Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are the most common subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The incidence of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas in the US is estimated at 6.4–9.6 per 1,000,000 person-year. The incidence of classic Sézary syndrome in Europe is estimated at 5 per 1,000,000 person-year.
- Disease course: Mycosis fungoides typically presents with skin lesions that progress through distinct stages. Initially, patients develop flat, scaly, red patches, often on sun-protected areas such as the buttocks and thighs. These patches can evolve into thicker, raised plaques and eventually form tumors that may ulcerate. Sézary syndrome, on the other hand, is characterized by a triad of generalized erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and the presence of malignant Sézary cells in the blood. Patients with Sézary syndrome often experience severe pruritus, scaling, alopecia, and nail abnormalities. Both mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome have a chronic, relapsing course, with patients frequently undergoing multiple, consecutive therapies.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Both mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome have a chronic, relapsing course, and patients frequently undergo multiple consecutive therapies. Mycosis fungoides typically presents in early-stage disease, which may progress to advanced disease over years. The 5-year overall survival in patients with stage IIB-IV mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome is estimated at 39–52%.

### Salience-default mode functional network connectivity linked to positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia [^112cYV6N]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia is a complex, debilitating mental disorder characterized by wide-ranging symptoms including delusions, hallucinations (so-called positive symptoms), and impaired motor and speech/language production (so-called negative symptoms). Salience-monitoring theorists propose that abnormal functional communication between the salience network (SN) and default mode network (DMN) begets positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, yet prior studies have predominately reported links between disrupted SN/DMN functional communication and positive symptoms. It remains unclear whether disrupted SN/DMN functional communication explains (1) solely positive symptoms or (2) both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. To address this question, we incorporate time-lag-shifted functional network connectivity (FNC) analyses that explored coherence of the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signal of 3 networks (anterior DMN, posterior DMN, and SN) with fixed time lags introduced between network time series (1 TR = 2 s; 2 TR = 4 s). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that severity of disordered thought and attentional deficits were negatively associated with 2 TR-shifted FNC between anterior DMN and posterior DMN. Meanwhile, severity of flat affect and bizarre behavior were positively associated with 1 TR-shifted FNC between anterior DMN and SN. These results provide support favoring the hypothesis that lagged SN/DMN functional communication is associated with both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

### Dysfunction in the coagulation system and schizophrenia [^111fRMNa]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia has a substantial genetic basis, but environmental factors such as traumatic life events may increase the risk of psychotic symptoms. The disorder is characterized by impaired cognition, by hallucinations and delusions, referred to as positive symptoms, and by social isolation, flat affect and low motivation, known as negative symptoms.

Antipsychotic medications usually attenuate positive symptoms, but fail to improve negative features or cognitive function. For example, 94% of 215 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder considered to be in remission had at least one residual symptom, mostly blunted affect, conceptual disorganization and social withdrawal. Given that residual symptoms can impair performance in school, affect performance at work, disrupt relationships and substantially affect quality of life, the need for more effective therapies is obvious.

Although different hypotheses have been proposed to explain schizophrenia pathogenesis, a link connecting them is missing. Finding the molecular link would allow for a better understanding of schizophrenia pathophysiology, which could lead to new therapeutic targets and better prognostic outcomes.

After noticing that five psychotic patients on chronic warfarin therapy for deep-vein thrombosis showed remission of psychotic symptoms, we assumed that defective modulation of the coagulation pathway might contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis. In accordance with other studies, neuroimaging studies of our patients showed brain atrophy, but no ischemic lesions.

Searching for elements that modulate the coagulation pathway and also participate in processes that help prevent brain atrophy, only one candidate emerged: tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).

Conditions affecting the activity of tPA, such as hyperhomocysteinemia and antiphospholipid antibodies, have been consistently described in drug-naive schizophrenia. We recently screened 70 drug-treated schizophrenia patients and 98 controls for these and other conditions affecting tPA activity. Persistent antiphospholipid antibodies were seen in 30% of the patients and none of the controls. Moreover, conditions that decrease tPA activity by increasing the activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, a major tPA inhibitor) were also highly prevalent among patients. Examples include the association of the 4G/5G polymorphism in the PAI-1 gene with hyperinsulinemia (20 vs 2%), hypertriglyceridemia (17 vs 5%) and hyperhomocysteinemia (24 vs 1%).

### Antidepressants for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia [^11652Wx2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Negative symptoms are common in people with schizophrenia and are often difficult to treat with antipsychotic drugs. Treatment often involves the use of various add-on medications such as antidepressants.

Objectives

To review the effects of the combination of antipsychotic and antidepressant drug treatment for management of negative symptoms in schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (January 2004). We also contacted authors of included studies in order to identify further trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials comparing antipsychotic and antidepressant combinations with antipsychotics alone for the treatment of prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

Working independently, we selected and critically appraised studies, extracted data and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Where possible and appropriate we calculated the relative risk RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI), with the number needed to treat (NNT).

Main Results

We included five studies (all short-term, total N = 190). We found no significant difference for 'leaving the study early for any reason' between the antipsychotic plus antidepressant combination and the control group (n = 90, 3 RCTs, RR 3.0 CI 0.35 to 26.04). Leaving early due to adverse events (n = 64, 2 RCTs, RR 5.0 CI 0.26 to 97.0) and leaving the study early due to inefficacy (n = 34, 1 RCT, RR 3.0 CI 0.13 to 68.84) also showed no significant difference between the two treatment groups. In terms of clinical response, participants treated with the antipsychotic plus antidepressant medications showed a statistically significant greater improvement (n = 30, 1 RCT, WMD -1.0 CI -1.61 to -0.39) and showed a significantly lower severity at endpoint (n = 30, 1 RCT, WMD -0.9 CI -1.55 to -0.25) on the Clinical Global Impression Scale than those treated with antipsychotics alone. More people allocated to combination therapy had a clinically significant improvement in negative symptoms compared with those given antipsychotics and placebo (n = 60, 2 RCTs, RR 0.56 CI 0.32 to 0.97, NNT 3 CI 3 to 34). Significant differences in favour of the combination therapy were seen in different aspects of negative symptoms: 'affective flattening' (n = 30, 1 RCT, WMD -7.0 CI -10.37 to -3.63), 'alogia' (n = 26, 1 RCT, WMD -3.00 CI -5.14 to -0.86) and 'avolition' (n = 30, 1 RCT, WMD -3.0 CI -5.04 to -0.96). No statistically significant difference was found between treatment groups in regards to the outcome 'at least one adverse event' (n = 84, 2 RCTs, RR 1.80 CI 0.66 to 4.90). For movement disorders and other adverse effects, no statistically significant differences were found in any of the studies that provided usable data on these outcomes. There are no data at all on outcomes such as compliance, cost, social and cognitive functioning, relapse, recurrence of negative symptoms, rehospitalisation or quality of life. There are no medium or long term data.

Authors' Conclusions

The combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants may be effective in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but the amount of information is currently too limited to allow any firm conclusions. Large, pragmatic, well-designed and reported long term trials are justified.

### Testosterone (Striant) [^114xiy8N]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Tell your doctor if you have or had:

problems urinating due to an enlarged prostate.
liver problems.
kidney problems.
heart problems.
lung problems.
diabetes.
weight problems (obesity).

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may cause serious side effects if taken while you also take Striant®. Some medicines may affect how Striant®works, or Striant®may affect how your other medicines work. Be sure to tell your doctor if you use insulin for diabetes. Your dose of insulin may need to be adjusted if you use Striant®.

How should I use Striant?

Use Striant®twice a day, once in the morning and once at night (about 12 hours apart). You may find it convenient to apply morning dose after brushing your teeth following breakfast and evening dose following your evening meal.

Striant®should be applied as follows:

Tear off individual unit then start at the corner tab and peel off paper backing. Push buccal system through foil from the front. You will notice that Striant®is curved on one side and flat on the other side. The flat side has a marking on it (company logo).
Before you apply Striant®, locate the area on your upper gum, just above either the left or right incisor (see picture). The incisor is the tooth just to the right or left of your two front teeth.
Place the flat side of the Striant®system on your fingertip. Gently push the curved side of Striant®against your upper gum in the area shown. Push the Striant®system up as high as it will go on the gum. If you have applied Striant® correctly, the flat side will be facing your cheek.
Using your finger on the outside of your upper lip, hold the Striant®buccal system in place for 30 seconds (see picture). This will make the buccal system stick to your gum or cheek.
As the Striant®buccal system absorbs moisture from your mouth, it will begin to soften and will mold to the shape of your gum. You should be aware that Striant®does not dissolve completely, but will remain in place for 12 hours. Striant®is made to stay in place until you remove it.
Remove Striant®by gently sliding it to the front or back of your mouth to loosen it. Then slide it downwards from your gum to your tooth. This will avoid scratching the gum.
With each application, you should rotate Striant to alternate sides of your mouth.
If Striant® does not stick or falls off within the first 8 hours, remove the original system and apply a new one. This counts as replacing the first dose. Apply the next system about 12 hours after the original buccal system was applied.
If Striant® falls off after 8 hours but before 12 hours, replace the original buccal system. This replacement can serve as the second dose for that day.
If Striant®sticks to your cheek and not your gum, this is acceptable. Do not replace the buccal system if this should happen.
Check to see if Striant®is in place following toothbrushing, use of mouthwash and consumption of food or alcoholic/nonalcoholic beverages. If Striant®does not stick or falls off, follow the above mentioned directions to replace with a new system.

### The experience of basic emotions in schizophrenia with and without affective negative symptoms [^111FmeDQ]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A diminished ability to experience emotion could be a key characteristic of the negative symptomatology in schizophrenia. We examined the frequency of basic emotions in everyday life as well as emotion control in various groups of chronic schizophrenic patients. Self-report questionnaires (Differential Emotions Scale [DES], Emotion Control Questionnaire [ECQ]) were provided to healthy controls and three groups of schizophrenia patients (n = 88), i.e., affectively flat patients, anhedonic patients, and patients not suffering from affective negative symptoms. Patients with affective negative symptoms experienced the positive emotions interest and joy less frequently than healthy subjects or patients without affective negative symptoms. All schizophrenia patients felt fear more often and tended to feel disgust more frequently than healthy subjects. The frequency of guilt and anger experiences increased with the chronicity of the disease. Anhedonic patients manifested more emotion inhibition than healthy controls and exhibited an affectivity pattern consistent with Meehl's model of anhedonia.

### Awe is characterized as an ambivalent affect in the human behavior and cortex [^114SauY5]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Awe's distinctive affective profile is closely tied to its two key appraisals: 'perceived vastness' and 'need for accommodation'. Perceived vastness refers to encountering something physically or conceptually massive beyond one's current mental structure, and is typically associated with positive feelings (e.g. admiration, elevation, aesthetic pleasures). In contrast, the need for accommodation involves adjusting existing mental structures to resolve the cognitive dissonance triggered by such stimuli, and is more often linked to negative feelings (e.g. confusion, obscurity). Indeed, an empirical survey has shown that these appraisals scores display negative and positive correlations with negative feelings during the experience of awe, respectively. Based on this conceptual model, we hypothesize that the inherent duality of awe's core appraisals may lead to its affective character as ambivalent feeling, defined by the simultaneous presence of both positive and negative affect –. Recent studies support this view, suggesting that awe is better characterized not as a purely positive or negative emotion, but as a mixed one.

### Perception of facial emotions in chronic schizophrenia does not correlate with negative symptoms but correlates with cognitive and motor dysfunction [^117QnDgR]. Schizophrenia Research (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Appropriate expression of emotions and correct perception of emotional expression in others are important social skills which may be impaired in schizophrenia and contribute to poor social adjustment. We examined the relationship between expression of emotions as measured by affective flattening and other negative symptoms and their perception. We compared performance on tests of perception of facial emotions with that in other cognitive areas.

Methods

36 chronic schizophrenic patients on stable doses of atypical antipsychotics were assessed using tests of identification (FID) and discrimination (FDIS) of facial emotional expressions, visual retention (BVRT) and general cognitive function (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE). Clinical symptoms were assessed with scales for the assessment of negative symptoms (SANS) and positive symptoms (SAPS). Motor symptoms were assessed with side effects (SA) and AIMS scales and Finger Tapping Test.

Results

Negative symptoms showed no relation to FID or FDIS. FID showed significant correlation with Visual Retention and Finger Tapping but not MMSE.

Conclusion

The ability to identify facial emotional expressions is not related to negative symptoms in chronic schizophrenia and shares common mechanisms with visual reproduction and ability to make rapid motor movements. This suggests common defects in perceptual, timed processes consistent with postulated dysfunction of cortico-subcortical circuits.

### Psychotic PTSD? Sudden traumatic loss precipitating very late onset schizophrenia [^111iJmbc]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The case presented a diagnostic challenge. Some features of the presentation, namely cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations and abnormal athetoid movements, suggested an organic process, such as frontotemporal dementia, encephalitis, HIV dementia or neurosyphilis. Normal brain imaging and screening bloods were to an extent reassuring in excluding these. Furthermore, over the course of a year of follow-up the patient showed gradual improvement in his ability to manage his daily living skills, rather than a decline as might have been expected from a dementia. However we note that a frontotemporal dementia, which often presents with gradual decline and subtle imaging changes, remains a possible differential.

Our patient's history and mental state were consistent with PTSD. First, he had experienced a traumatic stressor, defined according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision (ICD-10) criteria for PTSD as a 'a stressful event or situation of exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature, which would be likely to cause pervasive distress in almost anyone'. Second, his deterioration followed a few weeks to months after the trauma, in keeping with ICD-10 criteria. Finally, the patient showed symptoms of PTSD, namely flashbacks (episodes of reliving trauma), nightmares, increased startle reaction, insomnia and avoidance of reminders of the trauma. Notably some of these symptoms, for instance startle in response to sharp objects, related to earlier traumas experienced during a civil war, rather than the attack in which he lost his family. Our patient also appeared to lack an emotional numbness or anhedonia often seen in PTSD.

Psychotic depression is another important differential. Collateral history from his brother revealed that early on in his illness he was often tearful. Also, his delusions and hallucinations could be considered congruent with depression and he had significant self-neglect. Yet during our consultations he presented with neither low mood nor flat affect, as would be expected for psychotic depression. Rather, his affect was labile with social disinhibition and he would often laugh and smile, at times in response to hallucinations. He also subjectively described his mood with a 'thumbs up' gesture and did not exhibit biological symptoms of depression.

Finally persistent visual hallucinations of the deceased, with associated delusional beliefs that his family were still alive, were consistent with a pathological grief reaction. However, when taken together with his incongruent affect and significant decline in his daily functioning lasting for over a year, these symptoms would also be sufficient for a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to ICD-10 criteria.
