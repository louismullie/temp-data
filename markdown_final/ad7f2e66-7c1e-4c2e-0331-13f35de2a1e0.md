## Question

Could the patients history of bruxism be contributing to the tinnitus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient's history of bruxism could be contributing to their tinnitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic links between bruxism, temporomandibular disorders, and somatosensory tinnitus. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for causality versus association. Next, I will review guideline positions and treatment recommendations. After that, I need to check for confounders and alternative explanations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable conclusion and plan, making sure I anchor each step to the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Bruxism is a parafunctional habit with repetitive jaw muscle activity during sleep or wakefulness, and it frequently co-occurs with temporomandibular disorders; importantly, tinnitus that is modulated by jaw or neck movements is termed somatosensory tinnitus, which implies a mechanistic link via trigeminal and cervical somatosensory inputs converging on central auditory pathways, so the biological plausibility is strong here [^043d8dd1] [^9f5c38ce].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before jumping to causality. Observational and comparative studies show that patients with tinnitus and TMJ dysfunction are more often female, younger, have better hearing, and can modulate their tinnitus with jaw movements, which supports a causal contribution of TMJ-related mechanisms rather than mere co-occurrence; mediation analysis further suggests that about 35% of the improvement in tinnitus severity after orofacial treatment is explained by reductions in TMD pain, reinforcing a causal pathway from TMJ/bruxism to tinnitus burden [^d78b019a] [^3a350a8c].

> I should confirm what contemporary guidelines say. The VA/DoD tinnitus guideline explicitly recognizes somatosensory tinnitus and recommends a multidisciplinary approach for bothersome tinnitus with TMD or cervical spine dysfunction, citing randomized trials showing benefit from orofacial physical therapy and combined manual therapy; this is a weak-for recommendation, but it reflects convergent evidence and is the most specific guidance available for this subtype [^a149dfad] [^9f5c38ce] [^48e1f510].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about every bruxism case causing tinnitus. I need to check for confounders and alternative etiologies. Bruxism is multifactorial and often coexists with sleep apnea, anxiety, and medication effects; SSRIs and SNRIs can cause both bruxism and tinnitus, so I should review medications carefully and consider dose reduction or switching if temporal relationships suggest a drug effect, even as I still address the TMJ/bruxism component in parallel [^043d8dd1] [^749431bd] [^7111409c].

> Let me think about practical clinical steps to substantiate the link in this patient. I should confirm whether the tinnitus is modulated by jaw movements, clenching, or neck position; document TMJ signs such as joint noises, limited opening, or masticatory muscle tenderness; and screen for sleep disturbance, headaches, and psychosocial stressors that amplify bruxism and tinnitus distress, because these features strengthen the case for somatosensory tinnitus and guide therapy selection [^9f5c38ce] [^d78b019a].

> Next, I should review the treatment implications. If the tinnitus is bothersome and there is coexisting TMD or bruxism, I would suggest non-urgent referral to dental/orofacial providers for splint therapy and bruxism management, consider orofacial physical therapy, and coordinate with audiology for baseline assessment; I should also counsel that while tinnitus loudness may not fully resolve, reducing TMJ pain and parafunction can meaningfully decrease tinnitus burden and improve quality of life, which aligns with guideline-endorsed multidisciplinary care for somatosensory tinnitus [^a149dfad] [^5a8b6d96] [^bb1b7cce].

> But wait, what if the tinnitus is unilateral, pulsatile, or accompanied by asymmetric hearing loss or focal deficits? In that scenario, I should prioritize otolaryngology and imaging pathways rather than attributing symptoms to bruxism, because red flags for secondary tinnitus must be excluded before concluding a somatosensory mechanism is primary [^2397707b] [^b979c26b].

> In summary, I should double-check that my conclusion matches the evidence. Yes, bruxism can contribute to tinnitus, most convincingly via TMD-related somatosensory mechanisms that modulate central auditory processing; the evidence spans biological plausibility, observational associations, and interventional data showing that treating TMJ/bruxism reduces tinnitus severity, with guideline support for multidisciplinary orofacial care in appropriate patients, so I would frame this as a likely contributory cause warranting targeted evaluation and treatment rather than a universal causal explanation [^d78b019a] [^3a350a8c] [^a149dfad] [^9f5c38ce].

Bruxism can contribute to tinnitus through **TMJ dysfunction** and **muscle tension** that modulate somatosensory inputs to the auditory system [^d78b019a] [^9f5c38ce]. Tinnitus linked to bruxism is often **somatosensory** — modulated by jaw or neck movements — and may improve with TMJ-focused care [^9f5c38ce] [^3a350a8c]. Clinicians should screen for bruxism, assess TMJ, and consider multidisciplinary orofacial therapy; **imaging is not indicated** unless red flags are present [^a149dfad] [^2397707b].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking bruxism and tinnitus

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** plausibly link bruxism to tinnitus:

- **Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction**: Bruxism can cause TMJ disorders, including joint inflammation, disc displacement, and muscle hyperactivity, which may modulate somatosensory inputs to the auditory system and precipitate tinnitus [^d78b019a] [^9f5c38ce].

- **Muscle tension and hyperactivity**: Bruxism-related masticatory muscle tension can propagate to adjacent cervical and cranial muscles, altering somatosensory input and potentially triggering tinnitus [^9f5c38ce].

- **Somatosensory modulation of tinnitus**: Tinnitus modulated by jaw or neck movements — termed somatosensory tinnitus — is well recognized and often associated with TMJ disorders and cervical spine dysfunction [^9f5c38ce] [^d78b019a].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies and reviews support a **significant association** between bruxism and tinnitus:

- **Case-control study**: Patients with tinnitus and TMJ disorders were more often female, younger, had better hearing, and could modulate tinnitus with jaw or neck movements, suggesting a causal role of TMJ pathology in tinnitus [^d78b019a].

- **Mediation analysis**: Reductions in TMD pain after orofacial treatment accounted for 35% of the improvement in tinnitus severity, indicating a mediated relationship between TMJ dysfunction and tinnitus [^3a350a8c].

- **Machine learning study**: Bruxism was a strong predictor of chronic TMD, which frequently co-occurs with tinnitus, reinforcing the clinical link [^b03f1739].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize recognizing and managing **somatosensory tinnitus** associated with TMJ disorders:

- **VA/DoD guideline**: Recommends a multidisciplinary approach (audiology, dentistry, physical therapy) for bothersome tinnitus with TMD or cervical spine dysfunction, citing RCTs showing improved outcomes with orofacial physical therapy and manual therapy [^a149dfad] [^9f5c38ce].

- **AAO-HNSF guideline**: Advises a targeted history and physical to identify secondary tinnitus causes, including TMJ disorders, and recommends prompt audiologic evaluation for persistent or bothersome tinnitus [^cd126da4] [^7664f5d1].

---

## Diagnostic approach

When evaluating tinnitus in a patient with bruxism, clinicians should:

- **History**: Document tinnitus characteristics, TMJ symptoms, jaw movement modulation, sleep bruxism, and psychosocial stressors [^641c6e7b] [^f2432a04].

- **Physical examination**: Assess TMJ function, masticatory muscle tenderness, and cervical spine involvement [^ce35d602].

- **Audiologic evaluation**: Obtain comprehensive audiometry to assess hearing status and exclude primary otologic causes [^7664f5d1].

- **Imaging**: Reserve imaging for unilateral, pulsatile tinnitus, focal neurologic deficits, or asymmetric hearing loss, not for routine bruxism-related tinnitus [^2397707b] [^b979c26b].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management of tinnitus related to bruxism involves a **multidisciplinary approach**:

- **Dental interventions**: Occlusal splints, bite adjustments, and management of malocclusion to reduce bruxism and TMJ strain [^1aa8c2df].

- **Physical therapy**: Orofacial physical therapy targeting masticatory and cervical muscles to reduce tension and improve TMJ function [^9f5c38ce].

- **Behavioral therapies**: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and stress management to address bruxism triggers and tinnitus distress [^27234681].

- **Pharmacologic options**: Consider botulinum toxin injections for refractory bruxism, particularly in patients with secondary otalgia or TMJ pain [^927a9652] [^1aa8c2df].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis of tinnitus related to bruxism varies with the severity of TMJ dysfunction, chronicity, and patient adherence. Many patients experience **meaningful improvement** with targeted TMJ and bruxism management, though tinnitus may persist if central sensitization or other factors are present [^3a350a8c] [^9f5c38ce].

---

Bruxism can contribute to tinnitus, particularly via TMJ dysfunction and somatosensory modulation. Clinicians should actively screen for bruxism, assess TMJ involvement, and pursue multidisciplinary orofacial care; **imaging is reserved for red flags** [^a149dfad] [^2397707b].

Case presentation

The patient is a 52 year-old Caucasian woman who presented to the neurology clinic due to worsening migraine symptoms and because she was 'hearing sounds'. The migraines have been recurring for the past 2 months. The migraines are lateralised to her right retroaural region and have a pulsatile nature. She hears a 'whooshing sound' which rises and falls in concordance with her pulse. Motrin temporarily gives temporary relief of her symptoms but they always return. She denies changes in vision, hearing, smell, taste, facial weakness, dysphagia, weakness, paresthesias and numbness. She has no medical or surgical history. She has no contributory family history. She denies use of tobacco or alcohol. She is taking no other medications other than Motrin orally 200 mg pro re nata (PRN). She states she has seen several other providers who were not able to alleviate her symptoms.

On physical exam, the patient has tenderness to palpation in her right retroaural region. During auscultation, there is a distinct bruit on her right retroaural region, which rises and falls according to her pulse. There is no bruit on her left retroaural region. The rest of her neurological exam was benign. The patient was alert and oriented 3×. cranial nerves (CN) I–XII were intact. No carotid bruits were auscultated. Upper and lower extremity reflexes were 2/3. Upper and lower extremities pulses were 2/4. Muscle strength is 5/5.

Background

Our opinion is that it would interest the readership of BMJ Case Reports because it describes an important clinical lesson regarding performing a thorough history and physical before using adjunctive radiographic modalities. Examining the patient is the basis of medicine and should not be forgotten. It is an elementary but significant fact that has long-lasting implications. Our hope is that by urging those in medicine to continue to utilising skills such as auscultation, it will decrease patient costs and improve the quality of healthcare.

Tinnitus — physical examination key details and implications emphasize targeted findings linked to actions. Objective tinnitus is noted as "Rarely, tinnitus can be heard by the clinician as well as the patient", with the implication that "Objective tinnitus may be caused by identifiable diseases, such as vascular abnormalities and myoclonus". Cardiovascular findings such as "Heart murmurs, carotid bruits, or vascular sounds" indicate that "Cardiovascular disease and vascular lesions may cause tinnitus", and that "Treatment of the underlying disease may help tinnitus symptoms" and can "require appropriate evaluation and treatment". "Focal neurologic signs" mean that "Tinnitus patients should undergo neurologic assessment" with "Referral to appropriate specialists… which may include imaging of the central nervous system". "Otorrhea" signifies "Sign of middle ear infection or otitis externa", where "Treatment of otitis media/externa may improve tinnitus as well as associated hearing difficulties". For "Signs of other external or middle ear disease on examination and/or otoscopy", simple problems like "cerumen impaction or otitis media can be detected", and "Appropriate referral can be made… Imaging can be performed when indicated". "Head and neck masses" associated with ipsilateral tinnitus "requires prompt investigation", with "Referral to appropriate specialists; imaging when indicated".

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^9e2f0d2e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Tinnitus is the perception of sound without an external source. More than 50 million people in the United States have reported experiencing tinnitus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10% to 15% in adults. Despite the high prevalence of tinnitus and its potential significant effect on quality of life, there are no evidence-based, multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines to assist clinicians with management. The focus of this guideline is on tinnitus that is both bothersome and persistent (lasting 6 months or longer), which often negatively affects the patient's quality of life. The target audience for the guideline is any clinician, including nonphysicians, involved in managing patients with tinnitus. The target patient population is limited to adults (18 years and older) with primary tinnitus that is persistent and bothersome.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing patients with tinnitus. This guideline provides clinicians with a logical framework to improve patient care and mitigate the personal and social effects of persistent, bothersome tinnitus. It will discuss the evaluation of patients with tinnitus, including selection and timing of diagnostic testing and specialty referral to identify potential underlying treatable pathology. It will then focus on the evaluation and treatment of patients with persistent primary tinnitus, with recommendations to guide the evaluation and measurement of the effect of tinnitus and to determine the most appropriate interventions to improve symptoms and quality of life for tinnitus sufferers.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with nonbothersome tinnitus. The development group made a strong recommendation against obtaining imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus, specifically to evaluate tinnitus that does not localize to 1 ear, is nonpulsatile, and is not associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or an asymmetric hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: Clinicians should (a) perform a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with presumed primary tinnitus to identify conditions that if promptly identified and managed may relieve tinnitus; (b) obtain a prompt, comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (≥ 6 months), or associated with hearing difficulties; (c) distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions about natural history and follow-up care; (d) educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus about management strategies; (e) recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients who have persistent, bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss; and (f) recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The panel recommended against (a) antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; (b) Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements for treating patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; and (c) transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided the following options: Clinicians may (a) obtain an initial comprehensive audiologic examination in patients who present with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status); and (b) recommend sound therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.

Clinical characteristics

The duration of symptoms in acute TMD was 0.77 ± 0.67 months, while in chronic TMD it was 26.75 ± 36.37 months (p < 0.001). The VAS score, reflecting subjective pain intensity, was significantly higher in chronic TMD (4.82 ± 2.47) compared to acute TMD (3.64 ± 2.38, p < 0.001).

Among the six clinical symptoms evaluated, significant group differences between the acute and chronic TMD groups were observed for TMJ noise and bruxism. TMJ noise was more frequently reported in patients with chronic TMD than in those with acute TMD (52.1% vs. 70.5%; p = 0.005). Similarly, bruxism was significantly more frequent in patients with chronic TMD (31.1%) than in those with acute TMD (15.4%; p = 0.006). The most common clinical symptom was TMD pain, which was observed in 77.8% of the acute TMD cases and 78.7% of the chronic TMD cases; however, no significant differences were observed between the two groups (p = 0.877). Tinnitus was present in 33.3% of patients with acute TMD and 27.0% of patients with chronic TMD (p = 0.325). Notably, no significant differences were observed between the two TMD groups in terms of locking, muscle stiffness, or tinnitus. Regarding contributing factors, psychological distress was observed at similar frequencies in both groups (45.3% vs. 44.3%, p = 0.897), as was microtrauma (10.3% vs. 6.6%, p > 0.05) (Table 1).

Introduction

Pain in the ear has an important place in visits made to the otolaryngology polyclinics. Ear pain can be directly related to the diseases of the ear or it may occur as a result of the pathologies of neighboring areas and tissues. Pathologies such as tongue root-laryngeal, nasopharyngeal tumors direct the patient to the physician with ear pain before or simultaneously with the local findings. Due to their close neighborhood, pathologies of the teeth, temporomandibular joint, and chewing muscles may present with ear pain. Temporomandibular joint traumas may also play a role in the formation of ear pain.

Bruxism is a person's teeth grinding or clenching strongly by rubbing their teeth together. These are considered to be parafunctional habits. Bruxism occurs in 8–21% of people. It is more common in females than in males. It can be seen in any age group. Incidence increases in urban life and developed societies. Bruxism can be seen during both day and night. As a result of bruxism, ear pain occurs due to the high pressure of both muscles and joints. In long-term bruxism cases, apart from ear pain, unilateral or bilateral hypertrophy occurs in the chewing muscles. Hypertrophies occurring in masseter muscles can cause the lower half of the face to widen and result in a cosmetically undesirable asymmetrical appearance. As a result of bruxism, flattening and sawing appearance occurs on the chewing surfaces of the teeth, especially the incisors. During chewing, fatigue and pain in the temporal and masseter muscles occur. Tinnitus may occur in the ear. In addition to ear pain, patients also experience headaches, especially in the temporal region. Overgrown masseter muscles can disrupt salivary flow by pressing the muscle towards the parotid canal. As a result, periodic swallowing can cause pain, inflammation, and dry mouth.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^641c6e7b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination in tinnitus — core elements to document — are specified as follows. "The history should include the details of onset of tinnitus, the duration of symptoms, and the effects of the tinnitus on patient QOL". "The characteristics of the tinnitus should be detailed, including laterality and pulsatile nature". "Auditory phenomena such as hallucinations should be excluded". "Symptoms of hearing loss,44 disequilibrium, or other neurologic deficits should be documented". "Ototoxic agents, including common over-the-counter medications such as aspirin (in high doses), can cause tinnitus". "Potential exposure to such ototoxic agents or suspect medications should be discussed". "A history of excessive alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco use should be elicited". Clinicians are advised that "Clinicians who evaluate patients with tinnitus should document the presence or absence of symptoms and conditions that dictate the need for referral to otolaryngology, audiology, and related specialties". Finally, "Although most tinnitus patients will have few relevant positive physical findings, the examination should be directed to identifying secondary tinnitus, with potentially treatable or explainable causes, as well as to find signs of serious disease".

### Tinnitus with temporomandibular joint disorders: a specific entity of tinnitus patients? [^d78b019a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Tinnitus is frequently associated with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction. However, the nature of the relationship is not fully understood. Here the authors compared 30 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of temporomandibular joint dysfunction and tinnitus to a group of 61 patients with tinnitus but without any subjective complaints of TMJ dysfunction with respect to clinical and demographic characteristics.

Study Design

Case-control study.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Subjects

Tinnitus patients with and without TMJ dysfunction presenting at the Department of Prosthetic Dentistry and th: Tinnitus Clinic at the University of Regensburg.

Results

Tinnitus patients with TMJ disorder had better hearing function (P < .0005), lower age (P = 0.001), and lower age at tinnitus onset (P = 0.002) and were more frequently female (P = 0.003). Their subjectively perceived tinnitus loudness was lower (P = 0.01), and more of them could modulate their tinnitus by jaw or neck movements (P = 0.001).

Conclusion

Classical risk factors for tinnitus (age, male gender, hearing loss) are less relevant in tinnitus patients with TMJ disorder, suggesting a causal role of TMJ pathology in the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. Based on this finding, treatment of TMJ disorder may represent a causally oriented treatment strategy for tinnitus.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^f2432a04]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD tinnitus history and symptoms — provider should first rule out transient ear noise, defined as the perception of sound, usually occurring in one ear at a time and described as high-pitched ringing or tone, lasting fewer than five minutes, and sometimes accompanied by a sense of hearing loss and aural fullness; transient ear noise is common and does not generally require clinical management. If transient ear noise is ruled out, the following pertinent information should be obtained (not in any particular order): frequency, laterality, quality (e.g., pulsatile, non-pulsatile), and intensity of tinnitus; circumstance and date of onset of tinnitus; impact of tinnitus on sleep, daily activities, or quality of life (screen the patient with a validated instrument, when indicated); hearing loss (e.g., asymmetric, bilateral, unilateral, sudden, recent); ear pressure or fullness with normal ear exam; presence of co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, stress, depression, insomnia, dental issues (e.g., temporomandibular disorder [TMD]), cervical issues; and history of head or neck injury; blast exposure; noise exposure; hearing difficulties; sound tolerance issues; ear pain, drainage, or both; dizziness or vertigo; or possible ototoxic medication (see Appendix C).

Sample size

The required sample size was calculated using G*Power version 3.1.9.7 (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany). A minimum of 134 participants was needed to achieve a power of 0.95 with an alpha level of 0.05. In total, 239 patients with TMD were recruited, exceeding the minimum requirement. Although the sample size was relatively small for deep learning applications, several strategies were implemented to mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance model generalizability. These strategies included applying dropout regularization in the DNN, employing L2 regularization (weight decay) in logistic regression, and adopting a revised data splitting strategy (60:20:20 for training, validation, and test sets). In addition, 5-fold cross-validation was performed, and the final model parameters were selected based on the epoch with the lowest validation loss. Furthermore, training and validation loss curves were carefully monitored to confirm that no severe overfitting occurred during model training.

Pain intensity

Pain intensity was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS score ranged from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the worst imaginable pain.

Clinical symptoms and contributing factors for TMD

Six clinical symptoms were investigated in the patients with TMD: TMJ noise, TMD pain, locking, muscle stiffness, bruxism, and tinnitus. The presence of each parameter was recorded based on patient reports and assessed dichotomously as either "yes" or "no". The criteria for each significant complaint were as follows: (1) TMJ noise: sounds such as clicking and crepitus originating from the TMJ during both functional and nonfunctional movement of the mandible, (2) TMD pain: pain associated with TMD involving the TMJ structures, (3) Locking: jaw locking with a mouth opening of < 35 mm, indicating limited mouth opening, as reported by the patient, (4) Muscle stiffness: stiffness, heaviness, or discomfort in muscles during function or at rest, (5) Bruxism: clenching or grinding of teeth while awake or sleeping, and (6) Tinnitus: a perception of various sounds, such as ringing or buzzing, without any corresponding external source. The three contributing factors included sleep disturbance, psychological distress, and a history of macro-trauma, with each factor assessed in a dichotomous manner.

The guideline further states that "Clinicians who evaluate patients with tinnitus should document the presence or absence of symptoms and conditions that dictate the need for referral to otolaryngology, audiology, and related specialties" and that "The history should include the details of onset of tinnitus, the duration of symptoms, and the effects of the tinnitus on patient QOL" with characteristics "including laterality and pulsatile nature". It advises that "Auditory phenomena such as hallucinations should be excluded" and that "Ototoxic agents, including common over-the-counter medications such as aspirin (in high doses), can cause tinnitus", with "Potential exposure to such ototoxic agents or suspect medications" and "A history of excessive alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco use" to be discussed or elicited. It adds that "An appropriate clinical evaluation should occur early to direct the need for and the type of additional testing and treatment" and that "the patient encounter should identify any severe coexisting mental illness, such as depression or dementia, as these patients may need expedited referral and management", while noting that "the examination should be directed to identify secondary tinnitus, with potentially treatable or explainable causes, as well as to find signs of serious disease".

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: a report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^232131a4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis of 2613 patients with FMD, we found that 37.2% reported PT as a presenting symptom at FMD diagnosis. There were many clinically relevant differences between patients with and without PT. Patients with PT were more likely women. A possible explanation of this finding is the known difference in FMD distribution by sex; women have a higher rate of carotid involvement with FMD.PT was associated with younger age at time of FMD diagnosis and several neurovascular symptoms/signs including cervical bruit. Indeed, patients with PT were more likely to have FMD involving the extracranial carotid but not of the vertebral artery. Additionally, a history of headache was more common among patients reporting PT. Importantly, we could not identify differences in headache subtypes, likely because of missing data.

The association between FMD and PT has been previously described. The European/International FMD Registry reported PT as a presenting symptom of FMD in 16.9% of patients. We report a > 2‐fold higher rate of PT. The difference likely speaks to the heterogeneity of the FMD population and the differences between the 2 registries, notably the higher prevalence of cerebrovascular FMD among patients in the US Registry. The current study expands upon our understanding of the association between FMD and PT by providing more granular information regarding baseline characteristics, presenting signs/symptoms, and vascular bed involvement. Importantly, it also provides a comparison with patients with FMD who do not have PT.

VA/DoD tinnitus — referrals: Based on the case history, audiological evaluation, and patient needs, the audiologist should develop a follow-up action plan to include specialized audiological testing. Patients may be referred to other appropriate health care providers or services as needed but should be evaluated urgently by an otolaryngology provider or referred to the emergency department if they report sudden onset hearing loss with or without accompanying sudden onset tinnitus. If a medical risk factor is identified or if tinnitus is unilateral or pulsatile, the patient should be referred to an otolaryngology provider, although not all patients with tinnitus require an evaluation by an otolaryngology provider. The otolaryngology provider will obtain a thorough case history, examine the ear (using an otoscope or microscope), and might perform auxiliary examinations to screen hearing status, such as tuning fork tests. Patients who report risk factors for a behavioral/mental health disorder should be referred to a behavioral/mental health provider, and patients who report suicidal ideation should be referred immediately to a behavioral/mental health provider or an emergency department in the absence of available behavioral/mental health support. A non-urgent referral to a dental provider, an orofacial provider, or both is suggested for patients with TMD, and a non-urgent referral to a physical therapist or physiotherapist is suggested for patients with neck complaints or a whiplash-like trauma preceding the onset of tinnitus.

Somatosensory tinnitus — definition and therapy evidence — is described as a subtype in which tinnitus characteristics can be modulated by voluntary movements of the eyes, head, neck, or jaw, and there is no clinical consensus regarding its definition or diagnostic criteria; a hallmark is influence by auditory, somatosensory, and sensorimotor systems, and the evidence for the related recommendation comes from two RCTs and one SR. In patients with bothersome tinnitus and temporomandibular disorder (TMD), an RCT in 2020 showed that orofacial physical therapy improved outcomes and reported a statistically significant reduction in tinnitus severity, emphasizing multidisciplinary care. Another RCT in 2020 investigating cervico‑mandibular manual therapy combined with exercise and education found statistically significant improved outcomes compared with education and exercises alone in tinnitus with co‑occurring TMD. A 2022 systematic review evaluating quality of life (QoL) included three RCTs (Delgado de la Serna 2020, Bonaconsa 2010, Michiels 2016) and suggests that manual therapy combined with home exercises to address cervical spine dysfunction is helpful in reducing tinnitus functional impact, although the evidence was determined to be weak and effects in the 2016 RCT were small.

Results

Of 2814 patients with FMD enrolled in the registry, 2613 (92.9%) had data regarding PT as a presenting symptom of FMD at the time of diagnosis (Table 1). Of these, 972 (37.2%) patients reported PT while 1641 (62.8%) did not. Patients with PT were more often women (98.9% versus 93.8%; P < 0.001) and were younger at time of FMD diagnosis (53.3 versus 55.2 years; P < 0.001). Patients with PT were less likely to have hypertension (56.0% versus 64.9%; P < 0.001) or use antihypertensive medications, including diuretics (19.5% versus 24.9%; P = 0.002), angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (16.4% versus 20.6%; P = 0.011), angiotensin receptor blockers (15.5% versus 20.8%; P = 0.001), beta blockers (30.6% versus 38.0%; P < 0.001), and calcium channel blockers (18.4% versus 22.0%; P = 0.030). A history of headaches (82.5% versus 62.7%; P < 0.001) was more common among patients reporting PT, but there was no difference in headache type, including migraine (56.6 versus 54.5; P = 0.38) and tension (25.7% versus 22.2%; P = 0.084). Patients with PT were more likely to present with a cervical bruit (37.5% versus 15.8%; P < 0.001), cervical artery dissection (19.4% versus 14.1%; P < 0.001), and other neurovascular signs/symptoms including transient ischemic attack (10.8% versus 7.3%; P = 0.003), dizziness (44.9% versus 22.9%; P < 0.001), neck pain (41.3% versus 19.4%; P < 0.001), and nonpulsatile tinnitus (28.5% versus 19.6%; P < 0.001) at the time of FMD diagnosis. There was no difference in presentation with stroke among those without or with PT (7.2% versus 8.4%; P = 0.31).

Machine learning algorithms for chronic TMD

We employed logistic regression model within machine learning to identify significant predictors of chronic TMD and extracted the weight values for each factor, as presented in Fig. 5. This figure shows the variables useful for predicting chronic TMD and highlights their respective weight values. Significant predictors with an absolute weight value ≥ 0.4 were identified in the following order: bruxism (0.6768), VAS (0.5812), sleep problem (0.5230), joint space narrowing (0.5116), TMJ noise (0.4457), ADD (0.4337), and STOP-Bang ≥ 5 (0.4082) (Fig. 5A). Thus, the presence or increase in these factors is associated with a higher likelihood of chronic TMD. Conversely, sleep duration was the only significant negative predictor. As sleep time decreases (weight = −0.5926), the likelihood of developing chronic TMD increases. SHAP analysis identified statistically significant predictors of chronic TMD based on 95% confidence intervals excluding zero. Significant contributors (SHAP > 0) included bruxism (mean SHAP = 0.008), TMJ noise (0.004), muscle stiffness (0.0035), macrotrauma (0.003), and tinnitus (0.0025), indicating increased risk (Fig. 5B).

### Dying art of a history and physical: pulsatile tinnitus [^d0ec1c3d]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Modern medicine often leaves the history and physical by the wayside. Physicians instead skip directly to diagnostic modalities like MRI and angiography. In this case report, we discuss a patient who presented with migraine symptoms. Auscultation revealed signs of pulsatile tinnitus. Further imaging concluded that it was secondary to a type I dural arteriovenous fistula. Thanks to a proper and thorough history and physical, the patient was streamlined into an accurate and efficient work-up leading to symptomatic relief and quality of life improvement. Imaging is a powerful adjunctive technique in modern medicine, but physicians must not rely on machines to diagnose their patients. If this trend continues, it will have a tremendous negative impact on the cost and calibre of healthcare. Our hope is that this case will spread awareness in the medical community, urging physicians to use the lost art of a history and physical.

Did the tinnitus improve when the dose was decreased, or when the medication was withheld? Did the tinnitus return when the medication was restarted? If no connection exists between the timing of changes in tinnitus and changes in medication, stopping any medication or medications prescribed for other conditions is unlikely to change the tinnitus perception, and in these instances, discussing the importance of addressing ways to improve overall health and well-being and how that approach relates to improving QoL with tinnitus is recommended.

### Reduction of somatic tinnitus severity is mediated by improvement of temporomandibular disorders [^3a350a8c]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Successful orofacial treatment can reduce tinnitus severity in patients with somatic tinnitus (ST). However, it is still unclear to what extent the degree of reduction in temporomandibular disorders (TMD) actually contributes to the decrease in tinnitus severity after orofacial treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the mediating effect of reduction in TMD pain on the improvement of tinnitus severity after multidisciplinary orofacial treatment.

Methods

A total of 80 patients with moderate to severe ST attributed to the temporomandibular region, were recruited from a tertiary tinnitus clinic. At baseline, patients were randomly assigned to the orofacial treatment group or to the control group. Both groups received a minimum of information and advice regarding their tinnitus complaints. The orofacial treatment group received orofacial physical therapy complemented with occlusal splints when needed, while the control group received no other treatment. A mediation analysis was performed according to the steps described by Baron and Kenny and the proportion of the mediating effect was calculated for the potential mediator: "change in TMD pain", measured by a one-point decrease in TMD pain screener score.

Results

Our analysis showed that 35% of the observed decrease in tinnitus severity can be attributed to a reduction in TMD pain. A significant total effect of orofacial treatment compared with control on the change in tinnitus functional index (TFI) score was found (B = 0.253 p = 0.025 Cl for B = 1.265–18.576). Orofacial treatment was also significantly related to the change in TMD pain (Exp (B) = 2.800, p = 0.034 Cl for Exp B 1.081–7.251). Additionally, the change in TMD pain screener score was significantly related to the change in TFI score (B = -0.273 p = 0.016 Cl for B = -19.875 to -2.119).

Conclusion

Reduction of TMD pain is a mediating factor in the decrease of tinnitus severity after multidisciplinary orofacial treatment.

Practical Implications

Orofacial treatment can be used to decrease tinnitus severity in patients with TMD related somatic tinnitus.

Persistent tinnitus — classification and rationale for timing: Clinicians should distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions about natural history and follow-up care. Recommendation based on inclusion criteria in RCTs, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, based on inclusion criteria in RCTs, with level of confidence in the evidence Moderate, and benefit-harm assessment Preponderance of benefit. The majority of RCTs of tinnitus therapies enroll subjects with moderate severity tinnitus of at least 6 months' duration, and a review of 89 RCTs yielded only 1 trial with enrollment limited to new onset tinnitus (less than 3 months' duration) and 1 trial of tinnitus less than 6 months' duration. Another reason for distinguishing those with recent onset tinnitus from those with persistent tinnitus is the potential for resolution of tinnitus within 6 months of onset, and value judgments note that 6 months was a reasonable time to conclude that the tinnitus would likely persist, while risks include deferring treatment that may benefit some tinnitus patients who do not have persistent symptoms.

Statistics and reproducibility

Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 26.0; IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). The 19 clinical characteristics and MRI findings used to predict chronic TMD, as opposed to acute TMD, included 15 clinical variables — sex, age, visual analog scale (VAS) score, TMJ noise, TMD-related pain, sleep time, joint locking, muscle stiffness, bruxism, macrotrauma, tinnitus, psychological distress, sleep problems, and STOP-Bang score thresholds (≥ 3 and ≥ 5) — and 4 MRI findings: ADD, TMJ-OA, effusion, and joint space narrowing. Descriptive statistics are reported as mean ± standard deviation or frequencies with percentages, as appropriate. The distributions of categorical data were assessed using the χ² test with Bonferroni correction for equality of proportions. Student's t-tests were used to compare the mean values between the two TMD groups, with false discovery rate control applied to adjust for multiple comparisons among continuous variables. Cramer's V analysis was also used to assess the strength of the associations between the two variables; the statistical values ranged from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a stronger correlation. To predict chronic TMD compared to acute TMD, we identified variables with significant differences in means or percentages between acute and chronic TMD groups using t-tests, χ² tests, and Bonferroni correction. The contribution of each selected variable was further evaluated using a single logistic regression analysis, with the results expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To assess the combined predictive power of these factors for chronic TMD, we performed multiple logistic regression analysis with backward selection. To evaluate the statistical significance of prediction differences between logistic regression and the DNN, McNemar's test was applied to the paired classification outcomes. All analyses were considered statistically significant at a two-tailed p-value of < 0.05. The performance of the prediction model for chronic TMD was evaluated by plotting the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve against the area under the ROC curve (AUC) calculated for each AI model. AUC values were interpreted as follows: AUC = 0.5 (no discrimination), 0.6 ≥ AUC > 0.5 (poor discrimination), 0.7 ≥ AUC > 0.6 (acceptable discrimination), 0.8 ≥ AUC > 0.7 (excellent discrimination); and AUC > 0.9 (outstanding discrimination).

Tinnitus — patient education and counseling for persistent, bothersome tinnitus is a policy level recommendation and should include shared decision making, realistic messaging, key content areas, and referrals. Clinicians should engage the patient or the patient's proxy in decision making with awareness of the natural history, prognosis, and management options, point out that there is no established cure while avoiding statements that may exacerbate negative reactions, emphasize that tinnitus is a symptom and not a dangerous disease with comprehensive assessment to exclude associated conditions, include information on hearing loss associations and lifestyle factors, and encourage follow-up if symptoms persist or worsen. Counseling should also cover discussing the availability and lack of proven benefits of pharmacologic and other medical therapies and complementary and alternative medicine, and include referral to other professionals and to support organizations. Clinicians can inform and educate by providing brochures, suggesting self-help books, and describing counseling and sound therapy options.

### Tinnitus in COVID-19 pandemic [^3fda4f8f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is a symptom that can significantly affect the quality of life of every patient. In patients with tinnitus, one of the most important diagnostic element is medical history data. Patients classify the pitch and loudness of tinnitus graphically using the visual analog scale (VAS). Visual analog scale and similar questionnaires constitute a valuable addendum of the clinical picture in patients with tinnitus. It seems essential, especially in the light of the information presented in the case report on the probability of correlation between tinnitus and stress and depression associated with social isolation infection avoidance. The knowledge about the patient's hearing condition before contracting COVID-19, the early symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the method of diagnosis of the infection, the time and method of isolation of the patient, and the time from the diagnosis of COVID-19 to the appearance of otolaryngological symptoms might enable the reader to gain more knowledge on the correlation between COVID-19 and tinnitus. New research reveals that tinnitus is being exacerbated by COVID-19.

### Bruxism, temporomandibular disorders, and headache: a narrative review of correlations and causalities [^043d8dd1]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The co-occurrence of bruxism, temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), and headache is common in patients. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding whether this association is simply a result of their high prevalence or whether there are indeed causal relationships. This review provides an overview of the current state of research while taking into account the controversies surrounding research methods, particularly in definitions and diagnostic standards. Bruxism-defined as repetitive jaw muscle activity during sleep or wakefulness-is not a painful disorder but may-particularly in co-occurrence with TMD-worsen pre-existing headache. It seems important to differentiate between sleep and awake bruxism because of different impact on pathophysiological processes in different primary headache disorders such as migraine and tension-type headache. Temporomandibular disorder is a heterogenous entity with both myofascial and arthrogenous types of pain in addition to nonpainful disorders. Research suggests a correlation between TMD pain and migraine, as well as between awake bruxism and tension-type headache. However, psychosocial factors may act as confounders in these relationships. Determining causality is challenging because of the limited number of experimental and clinical studies conducted on this topic. The main finding is an apparent lack of consensus on the definition and assessment criteria for bruxism. Treatment wise, it is important to differentiate all 3 conditions because treatment of one condition may have an effect on the other 2 without proving causality. For future research, it is crucial to establish greater consistency and applicability in diagnostic procedures and definitions. In addition, more experimental and clinical studies investigating the question of causality are needed.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^02f13543]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Abbreviations and definitions of common terms — Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external source of the sound. Primary tinnitus is tinnitus that is idiopathic and may or may not be associated with sensorineural hearing loss, whereas secondary tinnitus is tinnitus that is associated with a specific underlying cause (other than sensorineural hearing loss) or an identifiable organic condition. Recent onset tinnitus is less than 6 months in duration (as reported by the patient), and persistent tinnitus is 6 months or longer in duration. Bothersome tinnitus is a distressed patient with affected quality of life and/or functional health status who is seeking active therapy and management strategies to alleviate tinnitus, while nonbothersome tinnitus does not have a significant effect on a patient's quality of life but may result in curiosity about cause or concern about natural history and change over time.

### Tinnitus and mobile phone use [^f4902aa4]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The mechanisms that produce tinnitus are not fully understood. While tinnitus can be associated with diseases and disorders of the ear, retrocochlear diseases and vascular pathologies, there are few known risk factors for tinnitus apart from these conditions. There is anecdotal evidence of an link between mobile phone use and tinnitus, but so far there have been no systematic investigations into this possible association.

Methods

100 consecutive patients presenting with tinnitus were enrolled in an individually matched case-control study. For each case a control subject was randomly selected from visiting outpatients matched for sex and age. The patient's history was obtained and clinical examinations were conducted to exclude patients with known underlying causes of tinnitus. Mobile phone use was assessed based on the Interphone Study protocol. ORs were computed by conditional logistic regression with years of education and living in an urban area as covariates.

Results

Mobile phone use up to the index date (onset of tinnitus) on the same side as the tinnitus did not have significantly elevated ORs for regular use and intensity or for cumulative hours of use. The risk estimate was significantly elevated for prolonged use (≥ 4 years) of a mobile phone (OR 1.95; CI 1.00 to 3.80).

Conclusions

Mobile phone use should be included in future investigations as a potential risk factor for developing tinnitus.

### More than sleepiness: prevalence and relevance of nonclassical symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea [^634373dc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Nightmares, comorbid insomnia, RLS/PLMD and bruxism are common in OSA and can interact reciprocally with the underlying sleep apnea syndrome, leading to additional burden, and complex diagnostic decisions for clinicians, and reduced response to otherwise effective treatment approach. CPAP therapy remains the mainstay of therapy for OSA, and can occasionally improve the symptomatology of these disturbances. Somatic symptoms are also prevalent in OSA. Although a causal relationship is not always obvious, treatment usually leads to less symptoms.

### Bidirectional associations between tinnitus subtypes and psychiatric conditions [^bec15e79]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

We also observed a bidirectional relationship between psychiatric illness and tinnitus. Among patients with tinnitus, those with PT had significantly higher rates of pre‐existing GAD and MD compared to those with NPT, suggesting that psychiatric illness may be more commonly present at the time of PT diagnosis than NPT. One possible explanation is that the medical workup for PT may involve more frequent referrals and diagnostic imaging, resulting in more thorough documentation of psychiatric history. Further investigation is needed to understand better why patients with pre‐existing GAD or MD may be more likely to receive a PT diagnosis despite NPT's established associations with psychiatric morbidity.

The PSM analyses revealed that patients with NPT had significantly higher risks of developing psychiatric comorbidities than those with PT. These differences remained significant across both treated and untreated subgroups of patients with prior psychiatric diagnoses, further supporting a consistently lower risk of developing subsequent GAD or MD among PT patients, even after accounting for treatment status and baseline comorbidities (Figure 1). The higher rate among NPT patients could be related to the absence of definitive treatments or lack of clinician familiarity with options, resulting in GAD or MD from the patient's perception of permanence with no hope for resolution. This perception is erroneous, as demonstrated by Scherer and Formby, where subjects with and without tinnitus retraining therapy both showed improvement over time. This highlights the importance of appropriate counseling so patients are familiar with options for treatment, including cognitive behavioral therapy, and so that they are aware that the natural history of NPT is one of habituation in most cases. These differences may be attributed to central nervous system (CNS) involvement unique to NPT, which has been linked to altered neural activity within the central auditory pathways and broader cortical networks. Aberrant activity in the central auditory pathways can promote maladaptive connectivity within limbic regions, particularly the amygdala and hippocampus — structures central to emotional regulation and memory. Functional MRI studies have demonstrated that increased connectivity between the amygdala and auditory cortex correlates with tinnitus‐related distress, and prolonged tinnitus is associated with enhanced hippocampal‐auditory connectivity, suggesting a potential neural signature for persistent tinnitus perception. Furthermore, structural alterations in the amygdala — such as changes in gray matter volume and functional reorganization — are more pronounced in tinnitus patients with comorbid affective disorders. Additional overlap in affected regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex and parahippocampal cortex, supports a shared pathophysiological mechanism between tinnitus and mood disorders. A genome‐wide association study by Bhatt et al. further supports this connection, identifying susceptibility loci common to both tinnitus and neuropsychiatric conditions. Together, these findings offer a biologically plausible framework for the increased rates of depression and anxiety observed among patients with NPT in our cohort.

Tinnitus is a significant medical problem affecting approximately 50 million Americans, 12 million of them severely. Once a thorough evaluation has been performed by a qualified otolaryngologist, and no life-threatening pathology has been identified, the opportunity for treatment exists. Treatment options are extensive and range from approved protocols to anecdotal remedies. Although tinnitus may not miraculously disappear, many therapeutic options exist that may help to make the tinnitus more manageable.

### Bidirectional associations between tinnitus subtypes and psychiatric conditions [^5c95a342]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Tinnitus is the perception of sound, such as buzzing or ringing, without an external stimulus. It affects nearly 10% of adults, with prevalence increasing among individuals over 60. There is a strong association between tinnitus and hearing loss. In particular, acute noise trauma, chronic noise exposure, auditory cortical hyperactivity, and insult to the central auditory system have been shown to cause maladaptive neuroplasticity, resulting in the perception of tinnitus. Some research indicates that genetic variations may predispose certain individuals to tinnitus; however, other studies have not supported these findings.

While the severity of tinnitus varies, approximately 20% of affected individuals experience significant distress, manifesting as anxiety, depression, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances as a result of the condition. Additionally, tinnitus severity does not always correlate with the levels of distress experienced by the individual patient. These distressing symptoms highlight the interplay between tinnitus and mental health. Tinnitus has been associated with cognitive impairments, including dementia, attention deficits, and insomnia. Such associations further highlight the broader implications of tinnitus on quality of life and mental health, particularly through its link with anxiety and depression.

Tinnitus can be broadly categorized into pulsatile tinnitus (PT) and non‐pulsatile tinnitus (NPT). PT often results from identifiable vascular or muscular changes near the ear, making it more likely to have a treatable cause. In contrast, NPT typically stems from altered neural activity within the central auditory system and frequently persists without an identifiable etiology, often exacerbating psychological distress. Previous studies suggest that in individuals with NPT, rates of anxiety and depression correlate more strongly with tinnitus severity than do those for PT. Although PT and NPT differ in etiology — with PT often attributed to identifiable vascular or structural abnormalities and NPT typically linked to central auditory dysfunction — this distinction remains clinically relevant even after structural causes are ruled out. Both subtypes are commonly encountered in otolaryngology practice and can lead to significant distress and psychiatric comorbidities. A comparative analysis of these groups provides an opportunity to better understand how differing tinnitus mechanisms and diagnostic pathways may influence psychiatric outcomes.

### Association of tinnitus and other cochlear disorders with a history of migraines [^07dab863]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

A headache is a symptom of a migraine, but not all patients with migraine have headaches. It is still unclear whether a migraine might increase the risk of cochlear disorders, even though a migraine does not occur concurrently with cochlear disorders.

Objective

To investigate the risk of cochlear disorders for patients with a history of migraines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study used claims data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 to identify 1056 patients with migraines diagnosed between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2012. A total of 4224 controls were also identified from the same database based on propensity score matching. Statistical analysis was performed from January 23, 1996, to December 28, 2012.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The incidence rate of cochlear disorders (tinnitus, sensorineural hearing impairment, and/or sudden deafness) was compared between the cohorts by use of the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was also used to examine the association of cochlear disorders with migraines.

Results

Of the 1056 patients with migraines, 672 were women and 384 were men, and the mean (SD) age was 36.7 (15.3) years. Compared with the nonmigraine cohort, the crude hazard ratio for cochlear disorders in the migraine cohort was 2.83 (95% CI, 2.01–3.99), and the adjusted hazard ratio was 2.71 (95% CI, 1.86–3.93). The incidence rates of cochlear disorders were 81.4 (95% CI, 81.1–81.8) per 1 million person-years for the migraine cohort and 29.4 (95% CI, 29.2–29.7) per 1 million person-years for the nonmigraine cohort. The cumulative incidence of cochlear disorders in the migraine cohort (12.2%) was significantly higher than that in the matched nonmigraine cohort (5.5%). Subgroup analysis showed that, compared with the nonmigraine cohort, the adjusted hazard ratios in the migraine cohort were 3.30 (95% CI, 2.17–5.00) for tinnitus, 1.03 (95% CI, 0.17–6.41) for sensorineural hearing impairment, and 1.22 (95% CI, 0.53–2.83) for sudden deafness.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this population-based study, the risk of cochlear disorders, especially for tinnitus, was found to be significantly higher among patients with a history of migraines. This finding may support the presence and/or concept of "cochlear migraine".

### Botulinum toxin type A injection near the stylomastoid foramen: a safe and effective therapeutic modality for tinnitus in patients with hemifacial spasm [^4d975193]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

Of these patients, 122 (14.0%) experienced tinnitus, a prevalence lower than the previously reported 25%. This discrepancy could stem from our study's specific focus on tinnitus, whereas previous studies encompassed all acoustic symptoms associated with HFS. Importantly, the proportion of patients with a history of Bell's palsy was similar among those with tinnitus symptoms and those without, suggesting that prior Bell's palsy does not heighten the likelihood of tinnitus symptoms. Furthermore, we observed no significant differences in age or severity of HFS between patients with tinnitus symptoms and those without.

A total of 110 HFS patients with accompanying tinnitus received BTX-A injections. The insertion point was 1 cm above the lower edge of the mastoid process behind the ear, positioned at the midpoint of the line connecting the mastoid process and the mandibular ramus. The injection depth ranged approximately 2.5 to 3 cm. This selection aimed to approach the stylomastoid foramen closely, allowing potential diffusion of BTX-A toward the stapedius muscle. The stapedius muscle resides within the tympanic cavity of the middle ear, connecting the pyramidal eminence of the temporal bone to the posterior aspect of the neck of the stapes. Current literature lacks direct data on the distance from the stapedius muscle to the stylomastoid foramen. However, it is known that the pyramidal eminence is approximately 12.8 ± 1.8 mm away from the stylomastoid foramen. This distance was reported to range from 11.2 to 15.1 mm in another study. Local injection of BTX-A is known to have a diffusion range of approximately 2 to 3 cm. Therefore, from the chosen injection site, BTX-A theoretically has the potential to diffuse to the stapedius muscle.

### Diagnostic approach to patients with tinnitus [^bddc3279]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Tinnitus, a common symptom encountered in family medicine, is defined as the perception of noise in the absence of an acoustic stimulus outside of the body. Because tinnitus is a symptom and not a disease, its underlying cause must be determined to best help patients. Although tinnitus is often idiopathic, sensorineural hearing loss is the most common identified cause. It can also be caused by other otologic, vascular, neoplastic, neurologic, pharmacologic, dental, and psychological factors. More serious causes, such as Meniere disease or vestibular schwannoma, can be excluded during the evaluation. History and physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, and neurologic system guide subsequent evaluation. Almost all patients with tinnitus should undergo audiometry with tympanometry, and some patients require neuroimaging or assessment of vestibular function with electronystagmography. Supportive counseling should begin during the initial evaluation to help patients cope with tinnitus. Counseling may also improve the chances of successful subsequent treatment.

### Application of botulinum toxin in patients with secondary otalgia caused by bruxism [^1aa8c2df]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Many patients visit the otolaryngology outpatient clinic with ear pain. Secondary causes should be considered in patients with normal otoscopic and microscopic ear examinations. Besides the causes of ear pain, there may also be pain that develops due to neighboring tissues and organs. Therefore, bruxism should also be considered in patients with ear pain, among secondary causes. The cause of bruxism has not been established yet. It is generally accepted that it was formed due to multi-factorial reasons. It can occur due to anxiety, emotional stress, hyperactive personality, sleep disorders, head and neck traumas, sleep apnea, teeth closing disorders (malocclusion), headache and ear pain, drug side effects.

In some patients with bruxism, classical treatments such as medical treatments, chewing training, relaxation techniques of the neck and facial muscles, psychological support, psychotropic medication, physical therapy, or dental splint treatments may not produce the desired result. In these patients, the botulinum toxin application can be considered as a treatment option.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^71a2f17b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — research priorities for trials and observational studies emphasize methodological rigor and relevant populations. Future clinical trials should be registered and adhere to reporting standards with adequate power, and future studies of tinnitus should be methodologically enhanced with uniform validated outcomes and both audiologic testing and validated questionnaires that incorporate patient-reported outcomes. Tinnitus trials should include a broader, more representative adult population and control for confounding medications and other therapies, and include global QOL measures. Additional needs include determining which validated tinnitus questionnaire is most effective and most useful for relevant treatment effects, conducting surveys or cohort studies on which clinicians patients approach first and how this differs by provider type, establishing the duration/natural history of recent onset tinnitus and time to spontaneous resolution, documenting common medical and/or psychiatric comorbidities, identifying subsets who respond especially well to specific treatments and incorporating these into subsequent RCTs, and conducting methodologically rigorous research into CAM therapies for tinnitus.

### Medical evaluation of tinnitus [^049d8998]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

It has been estimated that 15% of the population in the United States has tinnitus which lasts greater than 5 minutes. It has also been estimated that 155 million patients have previously sought care for this symptom. It is clear that the incidence of tinnitus increases with age and by 70 years of age at least 25 to 30% of patients experience tinnitus constantly. In addition, noise exposure and noise induced sensorineural hearing loss are most often seen in tinnitus patients. Furthermore, of interest to the physician, 94% of patients who have sought medical care have not been offered treatment for their tinnitus, rather they have been informed that nothing could be done for them, and they should "live with it".

### The current trend in management of bruxism and chronic pain: an overview of systematic reviews [^671eebcc]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Selecting Systematic Reviews for Inclusion

All titles and abstracts retrieved from the search were assessed for eligibility by two review authors independently (ALCM and ACRTH), using the software Rayyan. Potentially relevant SRs were selected for full-text reading, and those that fulfilled the predetermined inclusion criteria were included in this overview. Discrepancies were solved by a third author (SKB).

Data Extraction

Two authors (ALCM and ACRTH) independently extracted data from included SRs and a third author (LM) solved any discrepancies. Data were extracted from SRs using a standardized data extraction form including details on participants' characteristics (total number of participants, age, diagnosis criteria), number and design of primary studies included, intervention(s), comparator(s), outcomes assessed, assessment of methodological quality/risk of bias of primary studies, quantitative outcome data (meta-analysis or a summary of individual studies results) and the assessment of the certainty of evidence (GRADE approach – Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Developments and Evaluations). Missing or inadequately reported data from SRs were collected directly from the underlying primary studies.

Data Synthesis

Data from meta-analyses, or individual RCTs, were summarized narratively as described by SRs. The trials included in each review were mapped to identify the presence of overlap i.e. primary studies included in more than one eligible SR. The number of overlapping trials was summarized and the results from these studies were presented individually to avoid double counting of outcome data. Missing numerical data were collected from underlying RCTs and, when possible (data available), the estimated treatment effects were calculated (mean difference for continuous outcome and risk ratio for dichotomous outcome, with 95% confidence interval), by using the Revman 5.4 software.

Assessing Methodological Quality of Included Systematic Reviews

Two authors (ALCM and SBK) independently assessed the methodological quality and risk of bias of SRs using the AMSTAR-2 tool (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews). AMSTAR-2 provides guidance to rate the overall confidence in the results of a review in critically low (more than one critical failure); low (a critical failure); moderate (more than one non-critical failure) and high (none or non-critical failure). The certainty of the body of evidence was generated through the checklist available on the AMSTAR-2 website.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^0e3479bf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Tinnitus — action statements include a strong recommendation that clinicians distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with nonbothersome tinnitus, and a strong recommendation against obtaining imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus to evaluate tinnitus that does not localize to 1 ear, is nonpulsatile, and is not associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or an asymmetric hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: clinicians should perform a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with presumed primary tinnitus; obtain a prompt, comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (≥ 6 months), or associated with hearing difficulties; distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months); educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus about management strategies; recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients who have persistent, bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss; and recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The panel recommended against antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; against Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements for treating patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; and against transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group also provided options, stating that clinicians may obtain an initial comprehensive audiologic examination in patients who present with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status).

### Chronic tinnitus resulting from head or neck injuries [^ce77f5a5]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The main objectives were 1) to determine the percentage of cases of chronic tinnitus in a specialized clinic that resulted from head or neck injuries; 2) to describe the characteristics of this population; and 3) to compare patients with head or neck trauma with patients whose tinnitus onset was not associated with head or neck injuries.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of tinnitus clinic patient data.

Methods

Detailed questionnaires were mailed to 2400 patients before their initial appointment at the Oregon Health and Science University Tinnitus Clinic (Portland, OR). All of the patients experienced and received treatment for chronic tinnitus. Patient data were entered into a database and later analyzed.

Results

Two hundred ninety-seven patients (214 male and 83 female patients) reported that their chronic tinnitus started as a result of head or neck injuries. Compared with patients whose tinnitus onset was not associated with trauma, patients with tinnitus associated with head or neck trauma were younger; had better hearing thresholds; experienced headaches more frequently; reported greater difficulties with concentration, memory, and thinking clearly; were more likely to experience current depression, but not lifetime depression; rated their tinnitus as louder on a 1-to-10 scale; matched their tinnitus to louder sounds on the right side; and had higher Tinnitus Severity Index scores.

Conclusions

Tinnitus is a significant symptom that commonly occurs as a result of head or neck trauma. The fact that tinnitus resulting from head or neck injuries tends to be more severe (and is often accompanied by a greater number of co-symptoms) than tinnitus resulting from other causes should be taken into account by clinicians treating these patients.

First patient impressions about wearing comfort will be evaluated, chair side. Then the investigators will test the efficiency of the OstiSense biosensor feedback tool in reduction of numbers of bruxism episodes and reduction of the duration of bruxism episodes. These data will be collected also in order to achieve information for a sample size calculation for a larger subsequent clinical trial. The investigators will collect information about self-reported reduced frequency of bruxism episodes. In addition, self-reported reduction in pain is of interest. Visual pain scales and pain questionnaires will be used as validated instruments for subjective pain assessment. Participants will wear the tool with biofeedback turned on during the night/sleep for 8 more weeks.

They will be asked to return for a check after the first week of the 8 weeks to identify any wear issues while the tool is turned on, and for checking the data recording function. At the end of 8 weeks, participants will be invited for a final recall visit 12-week recall). The same questionnaire will be provided, and feedback questions will be asked. All data about bruxism episodes will be collected from the smart device. Outcome Measures
- Change in frequency of bruxism episodesEvaluating how efficient the OstiSense biosensor tool is in changing the number of bruxism episodes
- Change in duration of bruxism episodesEvaluating how efficient the OstiSense biosensor tool is in changing the duration of bruxism episodes.

### Dual-site transcranial direct current stimulation to treat tinnitus: a randomized controlled trial [^c82bd6eb]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tinnitus, defined as the perception of a sound with no corresponding external source, is a highly prevalent symptom present in 12 to 30% of the worldwide adult population. Whereas some subjects suffer from objective tinnitus and perceive sounds generated by physiological events within the body, the large majority of patients experience subjective tinnitus, perceiving a sound without any corresponding sound source. The severity of tinnitus and its accompanying symptoms varies greatly. Subjects suffering from tinnitus may experience one or a combination of a plethora of accompanying non-specific symptoms, such as annoyance, irritability, anxiety, depression, hyperacusis, hearing impairment, insomnia and cognitive difficulties. An estimated 1% of the total population perceives their tinnitus as a significant burden with a considerable impact on quality of life.

There is no curative treatment for tinnitus, and currently, the only evidence-based tinnitus management strategy is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Psycho-social treatment options such as CBT are indeed able to reduce tinnitus-associated distress. However, they cause little or no reduction of the underlying tinnitus loudness, and evidence for their long-term effects is lacking. The success of other tinnitus treatments often depends on the presence and severity of accompanying symptoms. For instance, patients for whom tinnitus is paired with varying degrees of hearing loss may experience significant tinnitus relief when using hearing aids, cochlear implants or auditory brainstem implants. Meanwhile, subjects with concomitant cervical or temporomandibular dysfunctions can achieve beneficial results with physical therapy such as orofacial treatment. Thus, the large heterogeneity in tinnitus presentation requires a personalized, patient-tailored treatment plan. Overall, existing management strategies more often target accompanying symptoms other than the underlying pathophysiology of the tinnitus percept itself.

INTRODUCTION

The "phantom" auditory experience of tinnitus affects 10% to 15% of people in the United Kingdom. It is most clearly associated with noise exposure and ageing and can present with comorbid sleep disturbance, hearing difficulty, social withdrawal, and negative emotional reactions such as anxiety and depression. Although a majority of tinnitus patients are male and present with some form of hearing loss and higher-frequency steeply sloping hearing loss in particular, there is no typical characteristic history or level of distress of the help-seeking tinnitus patient.

In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health issued a Good Practice Guide (GPG) for the commissioning of tinnitus services and for the clinical assessment and management of tinnitus patients. It recommends that tinnitus severity is assessed using either the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)or the Tinnitus Questionnaire. It also recommends that psychological comorbidity is assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventoryor the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). However, questionnaire use in clinical practice is limited.

In terms of management, therapeutic targets include the sound itself (i.e. interrupt the neural signal generating the sound) or the associated symptoms of distress, anxiety, or depression that can accompany tinnitus. The GPG states that tinnitus patients will be given, as appropriate, information/education, hearing aids, counseling and psychological support, relaxation therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with the requisite professional supervision, sleep management (including supervised CBT), sound enrichment therapy, and tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT). The use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and night sedation is also advocated. However, the GPG lacks an evidence base to support these recommendations and is in part based on anecdotal evidence and expert opinion.

This review asked the question, how much high-level evidence exists for the efficacy of the GPG-suggested tinnitus management strategies, and was restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard for evaluating therapeutic interventions. A systematic search was used to identify RCTs that examined tinnitus management strategies and reported validated measures of tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or depression, therefore providing comparable measures of change in patient symptoms. Where possible, meta-analyses were conducted. The outcome of this review provides high-level evidence that supports some, but not all, GPG recommended strategies for tinnitus management in the United Kingdom, and also highlights where further RCTs would be of immediate benefit.

### Medical history in voice professionals [^731b4c10]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

A careful and thoughtful history is extremely important in helping to elucidate the cause of a patient's voice complaints. An understanding of the patient's performance and rehearsal environment and demands is also important in guiding the treatment process. A thorough history helps the clinician understand the vocal problem and how to interpret findings on physical examination that may be contributing to the pathophysiology of the vocal complaint.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^ce35d602]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — general examination approach specifies core components and associated comorbidity assessment. A routine examination of the head and neck, including careful otoscopy, is the focus of such an examination, and a focused neurologic examination should exclude motor and/or sensory deficits as well as cranial nerve issues that may accompany central nervous system lesions. When pulsatile tinnitus is reported, the examination should focus on identification of cardiovascular disease and vascular lesions, and a full head and neck examination, a general cardiovascular examination, and auscultation/palpation of the head and neck, the skull and mastoid prominences, and orbits should be part of this evaluation. The examination may find treatable otologic conditions that cause tinnitus; cerumen impaction or other ear canal obstructions are diagnosed with otoscopy. Tinnitus can occur in patients with middle ear disease, with or without resultant conductive hearing loss, such as that caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction, otitis media, or otosclerosis, and disorders of the cochlear or vestibular apparatus, such as Ménière's disease (endolymphatic hydrops) and superior canal dehiscence, can cause tinnitus. Vestibular schwannoma can cause tinnitus as well, and tinnitus can occur with medical conditions not directly associated with the ear, including vascular tumors, palatal/middle ear myoclonus, intracranial hypertension, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Emotional distress and/or disturbance of sleep are often associated with severe tinnitus, and the initial history and physical examination should also include assessment of possible associated emotional disturbance or psychiatric illness, which is crucial for patients who may be severely depressed.

Appendix B: Routine care — initial evaluation and characterization — Patients who report tinnitus during a clinical evaluation should be asked additional questions regarding initial onset, frequency of occurrence, duration, and laterality, and in some cases such as unilateral or pulsatile tinnitus, the patient should be referred for a medical workup. The provider must also determine whether the patient is bothered by their tinnitus and the extent to which it interferes with daily activities or quality of life (QoL), and when such problems are reported the patient is characterized as having bothersome tinnitus and might need additional evaluation to facilitate appropriate recommendations and referrals.

### Pathophysiology of tinnitus [^7e9d9064]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is not a single entity but a rather diverse group of disorders. Despite symptoms that indicate the ear is the site of the pathology, there is strong evidence that most forms of severe tinnitus are caused by functional changes in the central nervous system. The changes are induced through expression of neural plasticity, some of which may have been caused initially by abnormalities in the ear or the auditory nerve. The involvement of the nonclassical ascending auditory pathway with its subcortical connections to limbic structures (the amygdala) may explain some of the symptoms of some forms of tinnitus including hyperacusis and affective disorders, such as phonophobia and depression, which often accompany severe tinnitus.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^f890a3aa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Patient education — bothersome tinnitus outlines definition, differentiation from transient ear noise, assessment, potential temporariness with noise exposure, medication-related tinnitus, absence of a cure, and current pathophysiology. Tinnitus is described as sound created in the ears or head, a symptom rather than a disease, and may be chronic or intermittent. Transient ear noise is a sudden unilateral whistling with perceived hearing loss that resolves in about a minute and is normal. Clinicians should determine how much of a complaint is due to hearing problems versus tinnitus, with assessment potentially including an audiologic examination and questionnaires. Noise exposure can cause temporary threshold shift and temporary tinnitus that will likely resolve within a few days, but repeated exposure increases the likelihood of permanence. Medications and drug interactions can induce tinnitus, which is usually temporary — typically lasting 1 to 2 weeks postexposure — but can be permanent; examples include aminoglycosides and cisplatin, and drugs such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, loop diuretics, quinine, and certain mental health and sleep medications may trigger or exacerbate tinnitus. There is no cure for primary tinnitus and no method proven to provide long-term suppression, but care can relieve functional effects (sleep disturbance, difficulty concentrating, hearing problems, difficulty relaxing) and patients can learn to manage reactions to improve QOL with compassionate support. Current theory suggests tinnitus results from compensatory adaptation of the central auditory system to hearing loss, there is a near universal association of tinnitus with hearing loss, hearing loss associated with tinnitus can range from minimal to profound and many with hearing loss do not experience tinnitus, and changes in inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters occur throughout the auditory pathway in association with tinnitus.

### Tinnitus in the side with better hearing [^7963fa10]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to confirm the characteristics of patients with tinnitus in the better-hearing side.

Materials and Methods

Among the 778 patients who visited the tinnitus clinic complaining of unilateral tinnitus at a local university hospital between March 2014 and December 2017, we recruited 62 patients who showed tinnitus in the better-hearing side on pure-tone audiometry. The mean hearing threshold was calculated using the arithmetic mean of the pure tone thresholds at 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz. In addition, patients' medical history, tinnitus questionnaires, and other audiologic test results were thoroughly analyzed together for diagnosis.

Results

Fluctuating hearing loss without vertigo or Ménière's disease were the most common etiologies (n = 16, 25.8%), followed by high-frequency hearing loss (n = 13, 21.0%), sudden idiopathic hearing loss (n = 6, 9.7%), and presbycusis (n = 6, 9.7%). Somatosensory tinnitus was also observed in seven patients. Neck pain was associated with tinnitus in five patients (8.1%), and two other patients (3.2%) experienced temporomandibular disorder in the same side as the tinnitus.

Conclusion

Tinnitus was associated with deterioration of hearing even when it occurred in the better-hearing side. Among the possible etiologies, fluctuating hearing loss in the tinnitus side was the most common audiologic finding. Assessment of hearing level at each frequency was more effective in detecting high-frequency hearing loss rather than the use of the mean hearing level. In addition, somatosensory tinnitus should not be ignored.

### Avenue for future tinnitus treatments [^884885f3]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is a common symptom. Standard therapies aim at improving the quality of life and reducing the psychological stress associated with tinnitus. Most interventions have little or no effect on the main symptom. Those affected subjects, however, want such a change and prefer a specific solution, such as pharmacologic therapy to other modalities. Scientific efforts have not yet led to significant improvement in the range of therapies. This article outlines existing efforts and develops ideas on how research for improved tinnitus therapy might look in the future.

### Depression and tinnitus [^1a8fbc2f]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with tinnitus are neither depressed nor seriously bothered by their tinnitus. Patients who complain bitterly of tinnitus, however, are often found to have a MDD. Treatment with tricyclic antidepressant drugs helps these patients, especially those who complain of insomnia. Other types of drugs and psychotherapy may also be helpful.
