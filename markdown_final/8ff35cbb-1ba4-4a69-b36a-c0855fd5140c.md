## Question

What infections are associated with eating oysters?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what infections are associated with eating oysters. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the full spectrum of pathogens linked to oysters, including viruses, bacteria, and any parasites. Then, I should verify the typical clinical syndromes and severity, especially high-risk conditions. Next, I will review outbreak patterns, sources, and contributing factors like wet storage, temperature, and traceability. After that, I need to consider prevention strategies, including cooking and postharvest processing. Finally, I should outline clinician takeaways for diagnosis and management while double-checking any gaps, such as hepatitis A or parasites, to ensure the list is complete and accurate [^112woHuZ] [^1165S8Es] [^115n2vui].

> Let me first confirm the major pathogen categories. Viruses are the most frequent cause of shellfish-associated gastroenteritis, with norovirus predominating, whereas bacterial infections, particularly Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, account for most severe outcomes and hospitalizations, and a small number of outbreaks involve other enteric bacteria such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, while parasites are rarely directly implicated via oysters in the data provided, so I should be careful not to overstate that link without direct isolation evidence [^112woHuZ] [^115n2vui].

> I will now examine viral etiologies, starting with norovirus. Wait, let me verify the recent outbreak evidence and strain diversity. Multiple investigations document large oyster-associated norovirus outbreaks with co-detection of other enteric viruses such as sapovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, and occasionally Aichi virus, and these reports also underscore the challenge that depuration does not reliably remove viruses and that wet storage can introduce contamination, which is a key operational risk to keep in mind [^113SuXzV] [^112Vq5zd] [^1118chPm].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially focused on norovirus and nearly omitted hepatitis A, which would be a mistake; I should correct that now. Hepatitis A has caused the largest recorded shellfish-associated outbreaks historically, so clinicians should think about longer incubation, jaundice, and vaccination status when assessing oyster-related illnesses, even though HAV is less commonly detected than norovirus in contemporary surveillance reports [^1165S8Es].

> Next, I should review Vibrio vulnificus because of its high lethality. I need to ensure I capture the key risk groups and outcomes. V. vulnificus is acquired from raw or undercooked oysters and can cause fulminant septicemia with case-fatality rates exceeding 50% in patients with chronic liver disease, alcohol use disorder, diabetes, hemochromatosis, or immunocompromising conditions, and regulatory actions such as California's 2003 seasonal restriction on raw Gulf Coast oysters were followed by a marked reduction to zero reported oyster-associated cases in that state, highlighting the impact of source control on clinical risk [^114xo3fC] [^111ywrGa] [^116XDTgh].

> Let me consider Vibrio parahaemolyticus next, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity. V. parahaemolyticus typically causes mild-to-moderate watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps after raw oyster consumption, with hospitalization uncommon, yet recent outbreaks demonstrate geographic expansion of pathogenic strains, including introduction of Pacific Northwest lineages to the U.S. Atlantic Coast and large multistate or multinational events, as well as a substantial Australian outbreak in 2021–2022 with genomic confirmation of multiple sequence types linked to oysters [^111xCDCv] [^112dVpQF] [^113oVUvC].

> I should review other bacterial causes and be precise about their linkage to oysters. Non-epidemic Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio alginolyticus can cause gastroenteritis after seafood exposure including oysters, though they are far less frequent than V. parahaemolyticus, and sporadic bacterial events in the broader seafood supply chain such as a 2021 Salmonella Thompson outbreak tied to a distributor's environmental contamination illustrate cross-contamination risks that can implicate multiple seafood items, with occasional case reports linking Campylobacter coli to raw oysters, so I should emphasize that the strength of attribution varies by event and pathogen [^112EoimX] [^111fEvTg] [^114jJmU2].

> But wait, what about parasites; did I miss any oyster-specific ones. Let me reconsider and double-check. The documents summarized here do not provide direct recovery of parasites from oysters causing human disease, and although cystoisosporiasis is a recognized food- and water-borne illness, it is not specifically documented via oysters in these reports, so I should not list it as an oyster-associated pathogen for this evidence set, while acknowledging general enteric parasitic risks from contaminated foods and water in other contexts [^112wUzpC].

> Next, I should review risk factors and contributing conditions in outbreaks to connect exposure to disease severity. Raw or undercooked oysters are the primary hazard, warmer-water harvests elevate Vibrio levels, rapid chilling and cold-chain maintenance are critical postharvest controls, and wet storage in natural waters has been implicated as a contamination point, while on the host side, chronic liver disease, iron overload, diabetes, immunosuppression, and use of acid-suppressing medications increase vulnerability to severe Vibrio disease, so I need to ensure my counseling prioritizes both source and host risk modification [^112dVpQF] [^115R3R8v] [^113oVUvC].

> I should confirm outbreak patterns and geographic sources to inform practical risk advice. Recent norovirus outbreaks in Southern California were traced to separate Mexican harvest regions with evidence for contamination at harvest and potentially during wet storage, and large V. parahaemolyticus outbreaks have been reported in Australia with multi-strain involvement and traceback to South Australian oysters, while earlier U.S. events document spread of Pacific Northwest V. parahaemolyticus strains to Atlantic harvest areas, all underscoring that implicated oysters can originate from diverse regions and that supply-chain mixing complicates traceback [^113SuXzV] [^116BrvUk] [^111xCDCv].

> Next, I should review prevention and control measures and make sure they are specific. Consumers can mitigate risk by thoroughly cooking oysters to an internal temperature of 145°F (62.8°C), and persons at high risk for severe V. vulnificus disease should avoid raw oysters entirely, whereas industry and regulators should prioritize rapid chilling, cold-chain integrity, and validated postharvest processing that reduces Vibrio to nondetectable levels, along with robust traceability using shellfish tags to enable swift recalls when contamination is detected [^114ETcZ9] [^111ywrGa] [^115R3R8v].

> For clinician takeaways, I should confirm diagnostic and management priorities. Suspect vibriosis in patients with acute watery diarrhea after raw oyster ingestion or in those with severe soft-tissue infection after seawater exposure, obtain a careful exposure history, and for suspected V. vulnificus septicemia, initiate prompt empiric therapy that includes doxycycline while arranging for urgent supportive care, recognizing that early treatment is critical given the rapid progression and high mortality in high-risk patients [^116s6WTd] [^114xo3fC] [^113bPUUQ].

> In summary, eating raw or undercooked oysters is associated most commonly with norovirus gastroenteritis and less commonly with bacterial illnesses including Vibrio parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis and, in high-risk hosts, life-threatening Vibrio vulnificus septicemia, with sporadic reports of other bacteria and limited evidence for parasites via oysters in the sources summarized here, so counseling should integrate pathogen risks, harvest and handling factors, and host susceptibility with an emphasis on cooking and avoidance for vulnerable populations [^112woHuZ] [^115n2vui] [^111ywrGa].

Oyster consumption is a well-documented source of infection, particularly when oysters are eaten **raw or undercooked** [^112woHuZ]. The primary pathogens are **Vibrio vulnificus** and **norovirus**: V. vulnificus causes severe, sometimes fatal illness in high-risk individuals [^113VZqKD], whereas norovirus drives large outbreaks of gastroenteritis [^113SuXzV]. Other Vibrio species, Salmonella, and parasites can also be involved [^111xCDCv] [^111fEvTg] [^1165S8Es]. Risk is highest in people with liver disease, immunocompromise, or other chronic conditions, and increases with warm water [^115n2vui], poor handling [^111fEvTg], and inadequate cooking [^112woHuZ]. Prevention relies on **thorough cooking** [^114ETcZ9], maintaining a strict cold chain [^112dVpQF], and avoiding raw oysters in vulnerable groups [^115oefyW].

## Bacterial infections

### Vibrio vulnificus

- **Epidemiology**: Naturally occurs in warm marine/estuarine waters; oysters concentrate V. vulnificus, especially in the Gulf of Mexico during summer [^113VZqKD].

- **Clinical manifestations**: Severe primary septicemia after ingestion, with rapid progression to shock, bullae, and necrotizing fasciitis [^113VZqKD]; mortality > 50% in high-risk patients.

- **Risk factors**: Chronic liver disease [^113VZqKD], alcoholism, diabetes, hemochromatosis, immunocompromise.

- **Prevention**: Avoid raw oysters, especially from warm waters; postharvest processing (freezing, high-pressure, pasteurization) reduces risk [^111ywrGa] [^113VZqKD].

---

### Vibrio parahaemolyticus

Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a common cause of **seafood-associated gastroenteritis** [^112dVpQF], with **outbreaks linked to raw oysters** during warm months [^113qHkHA]. It typically causes watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever [^112dVpQF]; although usually self-limited, illness can be severe in vulnerable hosts [^111xCDCv]. Prevention relies on rapid postharvest cooling, a strict cold chain [^112dVpQF], and thorough cooking [^114ETcZ9].

---

### Salmonella species

Salmonella species are a **less common** [^111fEvTg] but documented cause of outbreaks linked to raw oysters. Illness presents as gastroenteritis with diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain and can be severe in immunocompromised hosts. Prevention depends on **proper cooking** and safe handling [^116GcpCm].

---

## Viral infections

### Norovirus

- **Epidemiology**: Leading cause of oyster-associated gastroenteritis [^1165S8Es]; oysters efficiently concentrate norovirus, and depuration is ineffective [^1118chPm] [^113SuXzV].

- **Clinical manifestations**: Acute onset vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, fever; incubation 12–48 hours [^113SuXzV]; highly contagious [^115K8omD].

- **Prevention**: Thorough cooking [^114ETcZ9]; avoid raw oysters, especially in high-risk groups [^113SuXzV].

---

### Hepatitis A virus

Hepatitis A virus is **less frequent but significant**, with outbreaks linked to raw oysters [^1165S8Es]. Clinical features include jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and fever, and disease is more severe in older adults or those with liver disease. Prevention includes **cooking**, vaccination, and sanitation [^112woHuZ].

---

## Parasitic infections

Parasitic infections from oysters are **rare** [^112woHuZ]. Protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium can be transmitted via contaminated oysters, whereas helminth infections are only rarely reported. Prevention depends on proper cooking and sanitation.

---

## Risk factors and vulnerable populations

**Chronic liver disease** confers the highest risk for severe Vibrio vulnificus infection [^113VZqKD]. Immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk for severe bacterial and viral infections; pregnant women, older adults, and children also have increased susceptibility to severe illness.

---

## Environmental and handling factors

**Warmer water temperatures** [^113qHkHA] increase Vibrio levels in oysters [^112dVpQF]. Poor water quality with fecal contamination elevates viral and bacterial risk [^112pfXL8], while improper handling — including poor hygiene and inadequate refrigeration — further increases risk [^111fEvTg].

---

## Preventive measures and public health recommendations

- **Cooking**: Cook oysters to ≥ 145°F (63°C) for ≥ 15 seconds [^114ETcZ9].

- **Postharvest processing**: Freezing, high-pressure, or pasteurization reduce Vibrio risk [^111ywrGa].

- **Public health advisories**: Warn high-risk groups to avoid raw oysters [^112WjHzH].

- **Regulations**: Harvest area monitoring, recalls, and closures reduce outbreaks [^112SQaai].

---

## Recent outbreaks and trends

Recent large **norovirus outbreaks** have been linked to raw oysters in California [^113SuXzV] and Australia [^116d43Kr]. Vibrio parahaemolyticus outbreaks recur in warm months [^112dVpQF] and are linked to raw oysters [^111xCDCv]. Trends show rising Vibrio infections with warming waters [^115n2vui], and norovirus remains a major cause of oyster-related illness [^1165S8Es].

---

Oyster consumption, especially when raw or undercooked, carries **significant infection risk**, with **Vibrio vulnificus** and norovirus as the primary concerns [^114xo3fC] [^113SuXzV]. Risk is highest in vulnerable hosts and during warm months [^112dVpQF]; **prevention depends on cooking** [^114ETcZ9], maintaining the cold chain, and targeted advisories [^112WjHzH].

### Concurrent norovirus outbreaks associated with consumption of oysters harvested in Mexico - California, December 2023-January 2024 [^113SuXzV]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States. In January 2024, local health jurisdictions and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) identified two concurrent norovirus outbreaks across eight Southern California local health jurisdictions. CDPH was notified in late December 2023 and early January 2024 of gastrointestinal illnesses in persons who consumed raw oysters from food service facilities in San Diego County (outbreak 1). Additional illness reports came from multiple jurisdictions, including Los Angeles County and other areas in Southern California (outbreak 2). In total, approximately 400 persons across eight local health jurisdictions reported gastrointestinal illness after raw oyster consumption.

A multiagency investigation confirmed that outbreaks 1 and 2 were unrelated, and implicated oysters were traced to two separate, nonoverlapping harvest regions in Mexico. A total of 179 outbreak-associated cases, including 24 laboratory-confirmed norovirus cases, were identified. Patient samples from both outbreaks identified norovirus genogroups I and II; other enteric viruses (sapovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, and adenovirus) were also identified from one or both outbreaks. Noroviruses were genetically related by genotype within each outbreak but dissimilar between outbreaks. In outbreak 2, oysters might have been contaminated at a location separate from the original growing area, also known as wet storage. Outbreaks with similar modes of transmission can be unrelated, and the source for each should be carefully investigated.

### Impact of 2003 state regulation on raw oyster-associated Vibrio vulnificus illnesses and deaths, California, USA [^113VZqKD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

A recent review of surveillance data indicated that rates of Vibrio spp. infections in the United States increased from 1996 to 2010, and of the three most commonly reported species, V. vulnificus caused the most hospitalizations and deaths. V. vulnificus is a gram-negative, halophilic bacterium that occurs naturally in marine and estuarine waters. Human infection usually results from exposure to the organism by the consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, usually oysters, or by a wound coming into contact with seawater. Illness typically manifests as primary septicemia (following ingestion) or as a wound infection with or without septicemia (following wound exposure).

Persons at risk for severe V. vulnificus disease are those with preexisting liver disease, alcoholism, diabetes, hemochromatosis, or an immunocompromising condition. Patients with primary septicemia often are in shock when they come to medical attention, and the fatality rate has been reported to be greater than 50%. Most patients with primary septicemia report recent consumption of raw oysters, usually from the Gulf of Mexico.

Most oysters harvested in the United States are from the Gulf Coast region. Surveys regarding raw oysters in the U.S. market have repeatedly found that Gulf Coast oysters have a higher frequency and levels of V. vulnificus bacteria than oysters from the North Atlantic or Pacific Coasts, especially during the summer months. However, raw oysters can be treated with a postharvest processing method to reduce V. vulnificus to "nondetectable" levels, which is defined nationally as the most probable number.

### Vibrio parahaemolyticus foodborne illness associated with oysters, Australia, 2021–2022 [^112x9RWw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The identification of two unrelated STs, ST417 and ST50, within this outbreak indicated the cause to be more relative to environmental factors that influence favorable growth conditions for *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* across the oyster-growing region, rather than to a single temperature-abuse error or a single point source event. The appearance of these two strains could also indicate more than one outbreak occurring simultaneously with common contributing factors. However, multiple strains or types of a pathogen can cause discrete outbreaks and require a common public health investigation and response.

Epidemiologic evidence in this investigation indicated that raw oysters grown in South Australia were the cause of both ST417 and ST50 *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* infections across Australia. Previous *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* outbreaks have reported single-strain infections, predominantly by using traditional O and K serotyping methods. Longitudinal studies in Asia have identified a range of strains within a region, and other reports have highlighted highly virulent pandemic strains (e.g. ST36) detected across a widening international geographic range.

Although minimal data are available in Australia regarding *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* strains linked to locally acquired cases, the recent increased use of genomic methods and practices will likely change that. The emergence of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) characterization in Australia will also contribute to global knowledge regarding emerging and pathogenic strains. The presence of the trh virulence gene in both strains within this outbreak — and the additional tdh gene in the ST50 case isolates — correlates with…

### Immune-suppression by oshv-1 viral infection causes fatal bacteraemia in Pacific oysters [^115A9jPE]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

The experiments were performed using genetically diversified C. gigas oysters. These oysters were 4 months old with a mean individual whole weight of 1 g, corresponding to a flesh weight without the shell of approximately 0.2 g. Additionally, susceptible biparental family H12 C. gigas oysters, also 4 months old, had a mean whole weight of 1.5 g, with a flesh weight without the shell of approximately 0.3 g. The oysters from these genetic backgrounds were 'pathogen-free' and were produced as previously described.

For the experiments, the oysters were anesthetized in hexahydrate MgCl₂ (ACROS, 50 g l⁻¹, 100 oysters l⁻¹) for 2 hours. Subsequently, they were injected with either a 20 µl viral inoculum or a 40 µl bacterial inoculum. This was done using a 26-gauge needle attached to a multi-dispensing hand pipette that injected into the adductor muscle, facilitating the spread into the circulatory system.

The OsHV-1 inoculum (3.88 × 10⁸ OsHV-1 genomic units µl⁻¹) was prepared according to previously described protocols, and injections were administered 24 hours before the start of the experiment. Vibrio crassostreae J2–9 was cultured under agitation at 20°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) + NaCl 0.5 M for 18 hours. The culture was then centrifuged (1000× g, 10 minutes, 20°C), suspended in culture medium to an optical density (OD 600) of 1, and injected (5 × 10⁷ CFU) immediately before the experiment commenced.

The rationalized experimental infections were conducted by exposing 100 recipient oysters to 100 injected donors within 50-liter tanks at 21°C. As a control, a separate experiment was conducted by placing non-injected donors in contact with recipient oysters.

### Aichi virus, norovirus, astrovirus, enterovirus, and rotavirus involved in clinical cases from a French oyster-related gastroenteritis outbreak [^112Vq5zd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Following a flooding event close to a shellfish production lagoon, 205 cases of gastroenteritis were linked to oyster consumption. Twelve stool samples from different individuals were collected. Analysis showed that eight samples were positive for multiple enteric viruses, and one stool sample had seven different enteric viruses.

Analysis of shellfish implicated in the outbreak allowed detection of the same diversity of enteric viruses, with some viral genomic sequences being identical to those obtained from stool sample analysis. Shellfish were contaminated by as many as five different enteric viruses. For the first time in Europe, Aichi virus was identified in oyster samples.

Shellfish samples collected over 3 weeks following the outbreak showed a progressive decline in the level of virus contamination as measured by the virus diversity detected and by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.

### Immune-suppression by Oshv-1 viral infection causes fatal bacteraemia in Pacific oysters [^113qbNCX]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

To characterize the complex dynamics determining the outcome of Pacific oyster mortality syndrome, we produced 15 biparental oyster families with highly contrasted resistance phenotypes regarding the disease. These families were produced from genitors that had experienced different selective filters. The genitors having experienced a high level of natural selection by the disease were either wild oysters collected from farming areas or oysters issued from mass selection programs. The genitors that had experienced low-level natural selection were wild oysters recruited outside farming areas. The juvenile offspring of the 15 biparental families were subjected to a 'natural' experimental infection mimicking disease transmission in the wild. High variability in the dynamics of mortalities and percentages of survival (ranging from 0 to 97.4% at 330 h post-infection) were observed among families. Two families showing highly contrasted phenotypes, Susceptible Family 11 (SF11) and Resistant Family 21 (RF21) (Mantel–Cox log-rank test, p < 0.0001), were selected for the first set of molecular and histological analysis. During the experimental infection, mortality in SF11 oysters began at 66 h and increased dramatically. At the end of the experiment (330 h), only 0.7% of SF11 oysters had survived. In contrast, almost all oysters of the RF21 family (97.4%) survived following exposure to the same infectious environment.

### Caliciviruses and foodborne gastroenteritis, Chile [^115yiP4J]. Emerging infectious diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Human caliciviruses caused 45% of 55 gastroenteritis outbreaks occurring in Santiago, Chile, during 2000–2003. Outbreaks affected 99 or fewer persons, occurred most commonly in the home, and were associated with seafood consumption. Thirteen outbreak strains sequenced were noroviruses, including 8 GII, 2 GI, and 3 belonging to a novel genogroup.

### Clinical overview of vibriosis [^114xo3fC]. CDC (2024). High credibility.

The CDC 2024 guidelines for diagnosing Vibrio vulnificus infection emphasize the importance of obtaining a detailed exposure history. Specifically, they recommend inquiring about a history of consuming raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly oysters. Additionally, it is important to ascertain if there was any exposure of wounds or soft tissue to saltwater, brackish water, raw seafood, or juice or drippings from raw seafood.

### Multistate outbreak of Salmonella Thompson infections linked to seafood exposure - United States, 2021 [^114qoN6Q]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

CDPHE and FDA completed comprehensive traceback and traceforward investigations. The traceback investigation involved requesting invoices from all restaurants where patients reported dining during their exposure period. Records related to tuna, shrimp, salmon, and halibut were reviewed to ascertain common distribution sources.

Investigators identified six subclusters, defined as establishments where two or more patients from separate households reported consuming a variety of seafood items during their exposure period. Detailed build sheets (comprehensive instructional documents for food preparation, storage, and plating) from the six subclusters were collected. Five subcluster establishments were restaurants, including one sushi bar located within a grocery store. Traceback identified a common seafood distributor and processor that directly supplied four of the six subcluster establishments.

CDPHE's Division of Environmental Health Services (DEHS) conducted a traceforward investigation. DEHS collected customer lists and five samples of three unique products from the implicated seafood distributor and processor facility. The outbreak strain was not identified in these five samples.

On September 22, 2021, FDA performed a seafood Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point inspection with environmental sampling at the implicated distributor and processor facility. The outbreak strain was identified in 13 (9.8%) of 132 environmental swabs of the facility's floor and floor drains. The inspection also identified several opportunities for improvement in the facility's sanitary practices.

### Campylobacter coli prosthetic hip infection associated with ingestion of contaminated oysters [^114jJmU2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

This report describes the first reported case of a prosthetic hip joint infection due to Campylobacter coli. The infection presumably resulted from ingestion of contaminated raw oysters. Issues regarding original smear interpretation, culture isolation, and susceptibility testing are presented.

### Epidemic dynamics of Vibrio parahaemolyticus illness in a hotspot of disease emergence, Galicia, Spain [^114eXwWK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Globally, Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the leading bacteriological cause of illness associated with seafood consumption. Infections have undergone a global expansion over the last two decades; cases have suddenly emerged in areas considered environmentally adverse for these pathogens. The causes of this dynamic expansion and emergence in non-disease-endemic areas have remained elusive.

V. parahaemolyticus infections are generally rare and sporadic across all of Europe, with a single exception: Galicia in northwestern Spain. This region has been considered a hotspot for Vibrio infections and an anomaly within the epidemiologic context of V. parahaemolyticus in Europe. Recurring cases of foodborne vibriosis and outbreaks have been reported regularly since the late 1990s. Infections associated with V. parahaemolyticus in Galicia were characterized by sudden outbreaks of illness typically associated with a single genetic variant of the pathogen.

The first sign of change in this epidemiologic pattern was observed in 2012 when three different and genetically unrelated strains of V. parahaemolyticus were identified during a large outbreak in Galicia. Since then, a clear transition in the epidemiology of this pathogen has been observed; sporadic cases scattered throughout the region have been caused by different and unrelated strains, typically associated with the consumption of locally produced shellfish.

We applied whole-genome sequencing for a comprehensive and high-resolution insight into pathogenic populations identified in clinical sources associated with the major episodes.

### Digital PCR for quantifying norovirus in oysters implicated in outbreaks, France [^112pfXL8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

Although we obtained some norovirus sequences from six implicated batches, confirming the specificity of the dPCR, we believe that the development of technology such as next-generation sequencing will provide more detailed information on the full range of strains present in samples. Obtaining more accurate information on strain diversity and quantification will be valuable for molecular epidemiology studies and management.

In France, oysters are a popular dish, especially during December–April, when they are in the optimal low-fat condition for consumption. They are opened just before consumption and eaten raw; intravalvular seawater is tipped out, thus eliminating food handler contamination. Because this is the highest period for potential contamination by norovirus, samples are kept frozen by laboratories in France for analysis in case of outbreaks. In this case, this was useful because it demonstrated the presence of norovirus up to 19 days before the shellfish were marketed. This detection in samples collected two weeks before an outbreak suggests that illness could have been prevented. Control shellfish samples from different production areas were analyzed at the same time and were negative for norovirus, correlating well with the estimated NoV prevalence of less than 10% in France.

### Impact of 2003 state regulation on raw oyster-associated Vibrio vulnificus illnesses and deaths, California, USA [^111ywrGa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

US vibriosis rates have increased since 1996, with many Vibrio vulnificus infections proving fatal. In April 2003, California implemented a regulation restricting the sale of raw oysters harvested from the Gulf of Mexico between April 1 and October 31, unless they were processed to reduce V. vulnificus to nondetectable levels. We analyzed California cases of V. vulnificus infection before and after the regulation's implementation and compared case data with data from other states.

The annual number of reported V. vulnificus infections and deaths in California, attributed solely to raw oyster consumption, dropped from 0 to 6 cases and 0 to 5 deaths per year during 1991–2002, before implementation, to 0 during 2003–2010, after implementation (p = 0.0005 for both). In other states, median annual numbers of similar cases and deaths increased slightly after 2002. The data strongly suggest that the 2003 regulation led to a significant reduction in reported raw oyster-associated V. vulnificus illnesses and deaths.

### Group B streptococcus infections caused by improper sourcing and handling of fish for raw consumption, Singapore, 2015–2016 [^113epoAg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The number of RTE fish samples collected from food stalls was limited because eating establishments were advised to stop the sale of RTE raw fish dishes containing Asian bighead carp and snakehead during July 24–December 5, 2015, while the outbreak investigation was underway. Sampling was not random because it was part of an outbreak investigation, but it was biased toward fish species and food stalls implicated in the outbreak. Thus, contamination rates might not reflect contamination rates of all fish species sold for raw consumption in the market. Similarly, testing of samples from ports and retail outlets was performed by using different protocols, which limited comparisons that could be made.

In conclusion, we detected GBS ST283, which caused a severe foodborne outbreak in Singapore in 2015, in freshwater fish not only in food stalls and fish markets, but also in ports from which fish are imported. Comparison of human and fish isolates showed as few as 0–2 SNPs between human and fish isolates of GBS ST283 on a background of a diversity of GBS and other bacteria in freshwater fish. These data indicate the risk for contamination of raw freshwater fish and underscore the need for proper sourcing and handling of all fish for raw consumption. To control the outbreak, a ban on the sale of RTE raw freshwater fish dishes was implemented, and additional requirements were imposed for the sale of RTE raw fish dishes made with saltwater fish. Our study complements the epidemiologic findings for this outbreak and illustrates the need for public health authorities and industries to ensure proper handling practices.

### Vibrio parahaemolyticus foodborne illness associated with oysters, Australia, 2021–2022 [^113oVUvC]. Emerging infectious diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Of the 206 case-patients interviewed, 199 (97%) reported consuming oysters, while 189 (92%) reported consuming at least some of the oysters raw. Additionally, 25 (12%) reported consuming oysters for more than one meal in the week before the onset of illness. For case-patients who consumed oysters on only a single occasion (n = 131), the median incubation period was 1 day (range 4 hours to 7 days). The median number of oysters eaten per case-patient was 6 (range 1–31 oysters).

Case-patients purchased oysters from a variety of venues, including restaurants (n = 71), supermarkets or seafood stores (n = 23), farms (n = 17), oyster tours (n = 9), and takeaway venues (n = 8). Exposure to other seafood was common, with 41% (n = 84) reporting consumption of fish (of varied types) and 37% (n = 76) reporting consumption of prawns in the 7 days before onset. For those who consumed fish or prawns, most reported that the food had been cooked. Less than 20% of case-patients reported consuming seafood other than oysters, fish, or prawns.

From 166 case interviews, 25% (n = 42) of case-patients reported taking medication that reduced stomach acid (e.g. reflux or ulcer medications) in the month before onset.

### Impact of 2003 state regulation on raw oyster-associated Vibrio vulnificus illnesses and deaths, California, USA [^115oefyW]. Emerging infectious diseases (2013). Low credibility.

To decrease the risk of Vibrio vulnificus infection, individuals in high-risk groups and others aiming to reduce the likelihood of illness should avoid consuming raw, unprocessed oysters, particularly those harvested from the Gulf Coast during the summer months. Oysters harvested in the summer from the Mid-Atlantic region should also be a concern, as they have been shown to contain V. vulnificus levels nearly as high as those from the Gulf Coast. Individuals at high risk for disease should avoid seawater exposure if they have a fresh wound and should seek medical care immediately if signs of wound infection develop following such exposure. Clinicians' heightened awareness of the risk factors for V. vulnificus infection, coupled with prompt diagnosis and treatment, can substantially improve patient outcomes.

Our study had some limitations. First, the surveillance system relies on passive reporting, meaning some cases might not have been reported. If cases occurred after 2003 that were not captured by public health data, the decline might not have been as significant. However, underreporting would likely have occurred both before and after 2003, and given the severity of V. vulnificus disease, most cases are probably recognized and reported. Second, since vibriosis did not become officially nationally reportable until 2007, the increase in reported cases nationally after 2002 could partly be due to increased reporting. Nevertheless, all states have been voluntarily reporting vibriosis since before 2003, and FoodNet population-based surveillance data, albeit based on a smaller national sample, suggests…

### Epidemiology of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks caused by noroviruses in Okayama, Japan [^111MLikF]. Journal of Medical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Noroviruses (formerly called "Norwalk-like viruses") cause food-borne gastroenteritis outbreaks. These outbreaks were thought to be related to shellfish consumption, although non-shellfish related outbreaks also occurred frequently in Japan. To clarify the epidemiology of Norovirus outbreaks, 435 stool samples were collected from 60 acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks occurring over 8 years in Okayama, Japan. Using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), Noroviruses were detected in 257 cases (59.1% of all samples) from 46 outbreaks (77% of all outbreaks).

The majority of the 46 Norovirus outbreaks (89%) occurred from November to March; notably, one-third occurred in December. Restaurants, schools, and welfare institutions accounted for the major settings in 50%, 20%, and 15% of the Norovirus outbreaks, respectively. This was similar to other reports from Japan but differed from those from the United Kingdom. The transmission routes were assigned in 27 of the Norovirus outbreaks.

- **Transmission routes**:
	- In 18 outbreaks, the routes were related to human contact (7 from food handlers and 11 from person-to-person contact).
	- Those related directly to shellfish occurred only in 9 outbreaks.

These results suggest that transmission routes related to human contact are more important than previously recognized in the context of preventive medicine. Furthermore, all outbreaks in which some of the samples contained dual genogroups of Noroviruses were related to shellfish, suggesting that consumption of contaminated shellfish frequently results in mixed Norovirus infections.

### Increase in Vibrio parahaemolyticus infections associated with consumption of Atlantic Coast shellfish — 2013 [^1118VgQS]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

In 2013, this same indistinguishable strain was traced from shellfish consumed by ill persons to a larger area of the U.S. Atlantic Coast, causing illness in 104 persons from 13 states during May–September (Figure). The median age of patients was 51 years (range = 22–85 years); 62% were male. Six (6%) patients were hospitalized; none died. Multiple outbreaks appeared to be occurring, accounting for many of these illnesses. Illness was associated with consumption of raw shellfish, and seafood traceback was reported for 59 (57%) of the illnesses. Of these illnesses, 51 (86%) involved seafood that could be definitively traced to a single harvest area.

- **Traceback information**: The implicated harvest areas were located in Connecticut (20 illnesses), Massachusetts (15), New York (10), Virginia (four), Maine (one), and Washington (one). The remaining eight illnesses with traceback information involved seafood that could not be definitively traced to a single harvest area (locations reported included harvest areas of the Atlantic Coast of the United States and Canada). In response to the illnesses, four Atlantic Coast states closed implicated harvest areas; two issued shellfish recalls. The number of foodborne Vibrio parahaemolyticus cases in the United States traced to Atlantic Coast shellfish was threefold greater in 2012 and 2013 compared with the annual average number reported during 2007–2011.

This PNW strain is possibly becoming endemic in an expanding area of the Atlantic Ocean. The mechanisms for this introduction are not known. During the 2014 Vibrio season, beginning in the spring, clinicians, health departments, and fisher-

### Control and prevention of viral gastroenteritis [^115K8omD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Because a large proportion of norovirus illness results from foodborne exposures, considerable effort has gone into the development of methods for detecting and eliminating virus contamination from food items, particularly shellfish and fresh produce. Additionally, because outbreaks of norovirus illness often occur in institutional settings, efforts are underway to standardize effective methods for disinfection of contaminated surfaces.

Several other viruses, including astrovirus, sapovirus, and Aichi virus, as described by Drexler et al, are also responsible for diarrheal illness in children and adults. Although the incidence and severity of illness caused by these pathogens may not warrant the immediate development of vaccines, work continues to document their relative contributions to diarrhea-associated illness and death. Thus, although there is optimism for universal vaccination to prevent illness and death from severe rotavirus diarrhea and for the reduction of norovirus illness by rapid outbreak detection and source identification, many challenges remain for the control and prevention of viral gastroenteritis.

### Vibrio parahaemolyticus foodborne illness associated with oysters, Australia, 2021–2022 [^116BrvUk]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

There were limitations in the traceback of oysters within a complex supply chain. This included distributors and retailers receiving stock from multiple growers and different growing regions, leading to potential mixing of stock, some incomplete records and invoicing, and case-patients having multiple exposures to oysters within their incubation period. Mixing of oyster stock could have contributed to the identification of multiple strains of V. parahaemolyticus in cases included in this outbreak. Although traceback was not completed for all cases, oysters consumed by most case-patients were traced to at least the harvest area.

In conclusion, evidence for the source of this outbreak was strong, considering the oyster consumption among case-patients, traceback of the source of oysters consumed by case patients, and identification of the same strain of V. parahaemolyticus in both oysters and case patients. The reduction in cases of V. parahaemolyticus after the recall of oysters and the wide implementation of Vibrio control programs supports this evidence. This outbreak of V. parahaemolyticus associated with the consumption of Australia-grown oysters, largely consumed raw, has led to improvements in postproduction control and traceability in the oyster industry in South Australia. The outbreak also highlighted the virulent potential of V. parahaemolyticus and the value in distinguishing it as a nationally notifiable disease in Australia. Improved surveillance data, including strain identification from a wider range of regions, and a clearer understanding of underreporting are needed.

### Internationally distributed frozen oyster meat causing multiple outbreaks of norovirus infection in Australia [^116d43Kr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Between November 2003 and January 2004, outbreaks of norovirus in three Australian jurisdictions involving 83 cases of illness were associated with imported oyster meat.

- **Methods**: Cohort studies were conducted in two jurisdictions to identify relative risks of illness for the consumption of oysters. A case series was conducted in the third jurisdiction.

- **Results**: The cohort studies conducted in the first two jurisdictions identified relative risks of illness of 17 (95% confidence interval, 5–51) and 35 (95% confidence interval, 5–243), respectively, for the consumption of oysters. Multiple strains of norovirus were detected in fecal specimens from eight of 14 patients and in one of the three batches of implicated oyster meat using seminested reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methods. Traceback investigations revealed that all oyster meat was harvested from the same estuary system in Japan within the same month.

- **Conclusions**: These outbreaks demonstrate the potential of foodborne disease to spread internationally and the need for national and international collaboration to investigate such outbreaks. Foodborne illness related to norovirus is underestimated because of underreporting of human cases and challenges in laboratory detection of viruses in foods, both of which can delay public health action.

### Concurrent norovirus outbreaks associated with consumption of oysters harvested in Mexico - California, December 2023-January 2024 [^116sjGDQ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Low credibility.

Investigations and findings

- **Epidemiologic investigation**: On December 31, 2023, a food service facility notified the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and County of San Diego (CoSD) Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) of gastrointestinal (GI) illness reports among 37 persons who had consumed oysters there during December 27–29, 2023; these illnesses were confirmed by CoSD public health laboratory on January 2, 2024, as caused by norovirus infections. By January 9, CoSD HHSA identified 16 additional GI illness complaints from customers who consumed oysters at three locations of a local restaurant chain unrelated to the first facility.

On January 12, 2024, CDPH received reports from Southern California local health jurisdictions within and surrounding Los Angeles County of GI illness and norovirus infections among persons who consumed oysters at additional food service facilities. By January 16, 140 illness reports were associated with 51 facilities throughout greater Los Angeles and San Diego.

### Infectious outbreaks associated with bivalve shellfish consumption: A worldwide perspective [^1165S8Es]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Outbreaks of shellfish-associated infection have been reported for more than a century. Since the early 1970s, the global consumption of shellfish has increased considerably, and with it, the reports of outbreaks of infection. Most of these reports have originated from the United States, but Europe and, to a lesser extent, Asia and Australia have also been represented.

The majority of outbreaks have been linked to oysters, followed by clams and mussels. Hepatitis A virus caused the largest ever shellfish-associated outbreak, but caliciviruses have caused the highest number of outbreaks; Vibrio species lead the list of bacterial pathogens. The prognosis of shellfish-associated infections is generally good, except for outbreaks of Vibrio vulnificus infection, which have a mortality rate of up to 50% in vulnerable people.

Conventional and molecular techniques should be applied to better identify the causative agents, thereby enabling more targeted control measures in growing, harvesting, and shipping bivalves.

### Infections related to the ingestion of seafood part I: Viral and bacterial infections [^112woHuZ]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Foodborne diseases cause an estimated 76 million illnesses in the United States each year. Seafood is implicated in 10–19% of these illnesses. A causative agent can be traced in about 44% of seafood-related outbreaks, with viruses accounting for around half of these illnesses. Although viruses are the most common cause of seafood-related infections, most hospitalizations and deaths are due to bacterial agents.

A wide variety of viruses, bacteria, and parasites have been implicated in seafood-related outbreaks, which are reported worldwide. The factor most commonly associated with infection is the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood. People with underlying disorders, particularly liver disease, are more susceptible to infection.

The first part of this two-part review summarizes the general incidence of seafood-related infections and discusses the common viral and bacterial causes of these infections. For each agent, the microbiology, epidemiology, mode of transmission, and treatment are discussed. In the May issue of the journal, we will discuss parasites associated with seafood consumption, the safety of seafood, and the measures put in place in the United States to increase its safety.

### Concurrent norovirus outbreaks associated with consumption of oysters harvested in Mexico - California, December 2023-January 2024 [^115R3R8v]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Low credibility.

- **Environmental health investigation**: CDPH and environmental health staff members from local health jurisdictions completed traceback investigations and collected shellfish tags, which are federally required records attached to raw molluscan shellfish that must contain harvest, dealer, and certification information as well as consumption warnings, along with invoices at all facilities associated with illness reports. The traceback investigation identified that the two outbreaks were unrelated.

- **Sources of outbreak-associated oysters**: A common distributor, Distributor A, was identified for the oysters associated with outbreak 1. These oysters were harvested on December 18 and December 27, 2023, from the growing region of Bahia Salina Sonora, Mexico. The harvest area, which might have had fecal contamination from sewage runoff, was the suspected contamination source for outbreak 1 based on investigations by Mexican authorities. Distribution of these oysters was limited to facilities in San Diego County.

	- Oysters associated with outbreak 2 were distributed to facilities throughout Los Angeles and Southern California, including facilities in San Diego County. These oysters were harvested during November 21–December 29, 2023, from the Laguna de Guerrero Negro and Laguna Manuela growing areas of Baja California, Mexico. Although these harvest areas were in a similar region, they were located approximately 25 miles apart. However, all outbreak 2–associated oysters had been held in wet storage from November 22, 2023, to January 5, 2024, in Rincón de Ballenas, a natural body of water.

### Increase in Vibrio parahaemolyticus infections associated with consumption of Atlantic Coast shellfish — 2013 [^111xCDCv]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). High credibility.

Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp) is found naturally in coastal saltwater. In the United States, Vp causes an estimated 35,000 domestically acquired foodborne infections annually, most of which are attributable to the consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish. Illness typically consists of mild to moderate gastroenteritis, although severe infection can occur.

Demographic, clinical, and exposure information (including traceback information on implicated seafood) for all laboratory-confirmed illnesses are reported by state health departments to the CDC through the Cholera and Other Vibrio Surveillance system. Vp isolates are distinguished by serotyping (more than 90 serotypes have been described) and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

Vp serotypes O4:K12 and O4:K(unknown) comprise the Pacific Northwest (PNW) strain and, prior to 2012, had not been associated with shellfish outside the Pacific Northwest in the United States. During May–July 2012, Vp of the PNW strain associated with shellfish from Oyster Bay Harbor in New York caused an outbreak of 28 illnesses in nine states. Simultaneously, Vp of the PNW strain caused an outbreak of illnesses on a cruise ship docked on the Atlantic Coast of Spain; the illness was associated with cooked seafood cooled with ice made from untreated local seawater. All Vp isolates from ill persons in the U.S. and Spanish outbreaks that were further subtyped were indistinguishable by PFGE.

### Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) detection among three successive generations of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) [^116MGhZ6]. Virus Research (2005). Low credibility.

Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) was likely detected in Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, at different stages of development. Viral infections were associated with high mortality rates in the spat and larvae. Furthermore, the persistence of OsHV-1 in asymptomatic adults was demonstrated by detection of viral DNA and proteins. In the present study, three successive generations of C. gigas (G0 and G1 parental oysters, G1 and G2 larvae) were screened for OsHV-1 by PCR. Viral DNA was detected in 2-day-old larvae, indicating that infection may take place at very early stages.

Although results strengthen the hypothesis of a vertical transmission, it was not possible to predict the outcome of a particular type of cross. Indeed, the detection of viral DNA in parental oysters did not systematically correspond to a productive infection or result in a successful transmission to the progeny. However, the infective status of the parents appeared to have an influence on both the infection and survival rates of the progeny. Crosses involving an OsHV-1 infected male and a non-infected female resulted in hatching and larval survival rates statistically lower than those observed in other types of crosses. These results suggest that OsHV-1-infected females may transmit to their offspring some kind of protection or resistance against viral infection.

### Use of templates to identify source of norovirus outbreak [^114GjB4N]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The oysters had been individually quick frozen on the half shell and packed loosely in cartons after being harvested in South Korea by growers approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. For the reception, a single 6-kg box of oysters was thawed and served raw. The box was from a shipment of 2,200 boxes legally imported in October 2006. Boxes from the same shipment had been distributed to five states. Oysters from four other cartons were consumed (some cooked) at two other Oregon locations. Public health officials in other states were notified and asked to report any related illnesses; none were identified.

Noroviruses (genogroups I and II) were detected in oysters from an intact carton of the implicated lot. Sequencing was not attempted. The implicated lot was voluntarily recalled by the national distributor; most of the lot was embargoed or recalled before the oysters were consumed.

Oysters are a resource of outbreaks and sporadic cases of norovirus infection, vibriosis, and other infections because they are frequently eaten raw or undercooked. Microbial monitoring of oyster harvest areas reduces but does not eliminate the risk for disease associated with consumption of raw or undercooked oysters.

Oysters from many parts of the world have been implicated in previous norovirus outbreaks, including similar norovirus outbreaks in New Zealand in 2004 and 2006 caused by consumption of frozen oysters from South Korea. In addition, norovirus was detected in 10% of imported oysters in Hong Kong, and adenoviruses or enteroviruses were identified in 80% of one sample.

### Vibrio spp. infections [^115n2vui]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2018). Low credibility.

Vibrio is a genus of ubiquitous bacteria found in a wide variety of aquatic and marine habitats; of the over 100 described Vibrio spp., approximately 12 cause infections in humans. Vibrio cholerae can cause cholera, a severe diarrheal disease that can be quickly fatal if untreated and is typically transmitted via contaminated water and person-to-person contact. Non-cholera Vibrio spp. (for example, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus) cause vibriosis — infections normally acquired through exposure to seawater or through consumption of raw or undercooked contaminated seafood. Non-cholera bacteria can lead to several clinical manifestations, most commonly mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis, with the exception of V. vulnificus, an opportunistic pathogen with a high mortality that causes wound infections that can rapidly lead to septicemia.

Treatment for Vibrio spp. infection largely depends on the causative pathogen: for example, rehydration therapy for V. cholerae infection and debridement of infected tissues for V. vulnificus-associated wound infections, along with antibiotic therapy for severe cholera and systemic infections. Although cholera is preventable and effective oral cholera vaccines are available, outbreaks can be triggered by natural or man-made events that contaminate drinking water or compromise access to safe water and sanitation. The incidence of vibriosis is rising, perhaps owing in part to the spread of Vibrio spp. favored by climate change and rising seawater temperatures.

### Concurrent norovirus outbreaks associated with consumption of oysters harvested in Mexico - California, December 2023-January 2024 [^114ETcZ9]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Low credibility.

Although the exact source of contamination for outbreak 2 was not determined, shellfish growers should consider measures to prevent possible contamination of oysters from multiple harvest lots during wet storage. Producers should be aware of the potential risks associated with the wet storage of oysters and should take steps to reduce exposure risks to consumers. Consumers should be aware of the health risks for raw oyster consumption, which can be mitigated through cooking. The recommended method of oyster preparation is to thoroughly cook raw oysters to 145°F (62.8°C) before consumption.

### Vibrio parahaemolyticus foodborne illness associated with oysters, Australia, 2021–2022 [^11531oVs]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Most outbreak cases (79%) could be classified as confirmed or probable, including 143 cases typed as ST417 and 70 cases typed as ST50. Cases of both sequence types (STs) occurred throughout the duration of the outbreak. All isolates from the 14 positive oyster samples were identified as ST417 Vibrio parahaemolyticus.

Phylogeny confirmed that ST417 and ST50 V. parahaemolyticus were not closely related. Because of the distinct nature of these strains, we performed phylogenetic SNP clustering analyses on each ST individually. We grouped all clinical cases of ST417 and oyster samples from Australia submitted for national analysis in AusTrakka (n = 135) into a single cluster at a 5-SNP threshold. Clustering analysis of V. parahaemolyticus ST50 grouped 65 clinical cases at the 10-SNP threshold. Further analysis at the narrower 5-SNP threshold revealed two distinct but related clusters (n = 35 and n = 28; 2 were unclustered at 5 SNPs). We excluded 4 cases from the outbreak based on genomic analysis: 1 ST50 case unclustered at the 10-SNP threshold on phylogenetic analysis in AusTrakka, and 3 cases that were different STs (2 ST1140 and 1 ST36).

Both STs of V. parahaemolyticus isolated from cases in this outbreak investigation harbored virulence factors associated with human pathogenicity. This discovery provides key insights into the pathogenicity and epidemiology of foodborne illnesses linked to seafood consumption.

### Parasites [^112wUzpC]. Microbiology Spectrum (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cystoisosporiasis:

- **Definition**: Cystoisosporiasis, formerly known as isosporiasis, is an intestinal infection caused by the protozoan parasite Cystoisospora belli.

- **Pathophysiology**: Infection occurs through ingestion of food or water contaminated with sporulated oocysts. Sporozoites released in the small intestine invade epithelial cells, causing inflammation and malabsorption. The incubation period ranges from several days to over two weeks.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of cystoisosporiasis in patients with HIV is estimated at 2.5% globally.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include immunocompromising conditions, such as HIV/acquired immunodeficiency, and residence in or travel to regions with higher endemicity, such as sub-Saharan Africa.

- **Disease course**: The disease typically presents with watery, non-bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever, and weight loss. In immunocompromised patients, the infection can become chronic and severe, causing severe dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, and malabsorption. Acalculous cholecystitis and reactive arthritis have also been reported.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In immunocompromised patients, the disease may become chronic and recurrent, often requiring long-term suppressive therapy. Dissemination can involve lymph nodes, liver, and spleen.

### Concurrent norovirus outbreaks associated with consumption of oysters harvested in Mexico - California, December 2023-January 2024 [^116AV4V1]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Low credibility.

Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States. In January 2024, local health jurisdictions and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) identified two concurrent norovirus outbreaks across eight Southern California local health jurisdictions. CDPH was notified in late December 2023 and early January 2024 of gastrointestinal illnesses in persons who consumed raw oysters from food service facilities in San Diego County (outbreak 1). Additional illness reports came from multiple jurisdictions, including Los Angeles County and other areas in Southern California (outbreak 2). In total, approximately 400 persons across eight local health jurisdictions reported gastrointestinal illness after raw oyster consumption.

A multiagency investigation confirmed that outbreaks 1 and 2 were unrelated, and implicated oysters were traced to two separate, nonoverlapping harvest regions in Mexico. A total of 179 outbreak-associated cases, including 24 laboratory-confirmed norovirus cases, were identified. Patient samples from both outbreaks identified norovirus genogroups I and II; other enteric viruses (sapovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, and adenovirus) were also identified from one or both outbreaks. Noroviruses were genetically related by genotype within each outbreak but dissimilar between outbreaks. In outbreak 2, oysters might have been contaminated at a location separate from the original growing area, also known as wet storage. Outbreaks with similar modes of transmission can be unrelated, and the source for each should be investigated independently.

### Multistate outbreak of Salmonella Thompson infections linked to seafood exposure - United States, 2021 [^111fEvTg]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

In July 2021, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) laboratory identified a cluster of five Salmonella enterica serotype Thompson isolates related to one another within one allele difference, using whole genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST). These five isolates were submitted to the public health laboratory as part of the routine process for confirmatory testing of Salmonella and were highly related to those identified in a 2020 multistate investigation, during which traceback was conducted for sushi-grade tuna and salmon; a common supplier was not identified.

The 2021 investigation commenced on August 5, 2021, involving five patients living in Colorado, and one each in Missouri, Washington, and Wisconsin. During August-December 2021, the CDC, CDPHE, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted epidemiologic, environmental, and laboratory investigations of this multistate outbreak of Salmonella Thompson. Isolates were genetically related to one another and to 2020 isolates within zero to one allele difference.

Implicated seafood products were traced to a single seafood distributor, where the outbreak strain was identified through environmental sampling, and inspection revealed inadequate sanitization and opportunities for cross-contamination of raw fish. The distributor issued a voluntary recall of 16 seafood items with high potential for contamination and completed remediation actions.

This outbreak illustrated the importance of effective cleaning and sanitizing procedures and implementing robust food safety practices to prevent contamination.

### Cholera and other types of vibriosis: A story of human pandemics and oysters on the half shell [^112EoimX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Vibrios are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and are commonly present in or on shellfish and other seafood. A small subset of strains and species are able to cause human disease, including the cholera toxin-producing strains of Vibrio cholerae responsible for epidemic or pandemic cholera; thermostable direct hemolysin-producing strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus; and Vibrio vulnificus, which can cause fulminant sepsis. Cholera outbreaks can be initiated by transmission of "epidemic" V. cholerae strains from their environmental reservoir to humans through seafood or other environmentally related food or water sources. "Nonepidemic" strains of V. cholerae and strains of other Vibrio species, including V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus, are generally acquired by eating seafood, particularly raw oysters or oysters on the half shell. Although the primary clinical manifestation of infection with these strains is gastroenteritis, they can also cause wound infections and, particularly for V. vulnificus, septicemia in persons who have liver disease or are immunocompromised.

### Increase in Vibrio parahaemolyticus infections associated with consumption of Atlantic Coast shellfish — 2013 [^112aZHBu]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp) is found naturally in coastal saltwater. In the United States, Vp causes an estimated 35,000 domestically acquired foodborne infections annually, most of which are attributable to the consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish. Illness typically consists of mild to moderate gastroenteritis, although severe infection can occur. Demographic, clinical, and exposure information, including traceback information on implicated seafood, for all laboratory-confirmed illnesses are reported by state health departments to the CDC through the Cholera and Other Vibrio Surveillance system. Vp isolates are distinguished by serotyping, with more than 90 serotypes described, and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

### Ostreid herpesvirus 1 latent infection and reactivation in adult Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas [^11281BQf]. Virus Research (2024). Low credibility.

Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) is one of the most economically important pathogens of Pacific oysters. Understanding the pathogenesis of this virus is critical to developing tools to control outbreaks on shellfish farms. OsHV-1 is genetically related to vertebrate herpesviruses, which have a lytic and a latent stage, with the latent stage capable of being reactivated to the lytic stage. Here, OsHV-1 latency in Pacific oysters was investigated in experimentally and naturally infected oysters.

Lytic infection in one-year-old oysters injected with the Tomales Bay strain of OsHV-1 was detectable between 1 and 4 days post-injection (dpi) but was not detectable after 5 dpi. The injected oysters shed 1 × 10² to 1 × 10⁴ DNA copies/ml into the water during the 4-day acute phase. Lytic shedding was not detectable in two-year-old oysters injected similarly with the same strain of OsHV-1; however, the OsHV-1 genome was detectable by qPCR in the adductor muscle, gill, mantle, and hemocytes within the first 3 dpi, after which it became undetectable.

No OsHV-1 was detectable in the adductor muscle, gill, or mantle from experimentally infected oysters on days 15 and 21 post-injection or from oysters sampled 9 months after surviving an OsHV-1 mortality event; however, OsHV-1 DNA could be detected in hemocytes of both experimentally infected oysters at 21 dpi and naturally infected oysters using nested PCR. In addition, lytic viral gene transcription was detectable in hemocytes of experimentally infected oysters between 1 and 21 dpi and in hemocytes of naturally infected oysters.

### Impact of 2003 state regulation on raw oyster-associated Vibrio vulnificus illnesses and deaths, California, USA [^116XDTgh]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The 27 patients who consumed only raw oysters had a median age of 48 years (range 27–72); 24 (89%) were men, and 23 (85%) were Hispanic. All had an underlying condition predisposing them to severe infection, including 22 (81%) with liver disease, cirrhosis, or hepatitis. The oyster harvest site was known (for 19) or suspected (for 2) for 21 (78%) patients who consumed only raw oysters; all oysters were traced to the Gulf of Mexico.

During 1991–2010, states other than California reported 231 cases of foodborne V. vulnificus infection in patients who reported consuming only raw oysters; 106 (46%) of these patients died. The median annual number of non-California patients who reported consuming only raw oysters was 10.5 (range 2–21) during 1991–2002 and 15 (range 9–19) during 2003–2010 (p = 0.02). The median annual number of these non-California patients who died was 5 (range 1–12) during 1991–2002 and 6.5 (range 4–7) during 2003–2010 (p = 0.17). The oyster harvest site was known for 151 (65%) of these patients; 145 (96%) of the oysters were traced to the Gulf of Mexico.

A confirmed outbreak-associated case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed norovirus infection in a person with illness onset during December 1, 2023–January 31, 2024, who consumed oysters in Southern California 12–48 hours before illness onset. A probable case was the occurrence of vomiting or diarrhea (three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period) with illness onset during December 1, 2023–January 31, 2024, in a person who consumed oysters in Southern California 12–48 hours before illness onset. On January 17, 2024, Southern California local health jurisdictions deployed an electronic survey to persons with potential cases who reported their illness to public health agencies. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted to determine if the outbreak case definition had been met and to collect additional clinical and oyster exposure information. Excluding the initial ill persons from San Diego who reported their illnesses to the food service facility, all cases were passively reported by ill persons to public health agencies after the release of health advisories and recall notices.

- **Patient characteristics**: Based on information from local health departments, approximately 400 persons from eight local health jurisdictions reported illness after consuming oysters. Among those interviewed by telephone, 179 persons met the confirmed or probable case definition for illness. Patients had a median age of 40 years (IQR = 32.3–55), and 100 (56%) were female. Outbreak 1 cases included patients who ate at four facilities exclusively in San Diego County.

### Fatal Vibrio vulnificus infection associated with eating raw oysters, New Caledonia [^117Xwizt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The literature mentions few cases of V. vulnificus infection in the South Pacific. Cases described were isolated, rarely fatal, and involved infection through the skin. The V. vulnificus infections we report may be related to the emergence of a new clone or to changes in the climate or environmental conditions. New Caledonia experienced unusual weather conditions during the first half of 2008, including heavy rains and exceptionally high temperatures. These specific conditions may have favored higher sea surface temperatures, lower salinity, increased turbidity, and subsequent multiplication of V. vulnificus in seawater.

A range of projects were implemented to train practitioners to recognize potential V. vulnificus infections. Local health authorities issued criteria for defining suspected cases of V. vulnificus infection and recommendations for early medical care of patients with clinical symptoms. Methods of detecting the bacterium in human and animal health laboratories were improved, particularly by the systematic use of selective media in the event of suspected clinical V. vulnificus infection and standardized reporting of V. vulnificus isolation. Preventive measures, such as improving microbial surveillance and warning consumers about risks associated with eating raw seafood, are essential to help reduce the risk for V. vulnificus-induced illness.

### Chronic liver disease and consumption of raw oysters: A potentially lethal combination — a review of Vibrio vulnificus septicemia [^113bPUUQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Vibrio vulnificus septicemia is the most common cause of fatality related to seafood consumption in the United States. It occurs predominantly in patients with chronic liver disease following consumption of raw oysters. V. vulnificus is a highly virulent human pathogen, normally found in warm estuarine and marine environments, where it lodges in filter feeders like oysters. The onset of this illness is abrupt, rapidly progressing to septic shock with a high mortality rate. Clinicians managing patients with chronic liver disease need to educate their patients about the risks associated with the consumption of raw seafood, especially oysters.

A high index of suspicion is necessary for appropriate treatment because doxycycline, the antibiotic of choice, is not usually part of the empiric therapy for septicemia. The high mortality associated with this septicemia demands aggressive preventive measures: susceptible individuals must be forewarned by signs displayed in restaurants; physicians must educate patients with chronic liver disease about the risk of raw oyster consumption; and harvesting methods that reduce contamination by V. vulnificus must be utilized.

### Outbreak of Vibrio parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis associated with Alaskan oysters [^113qHkHA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005).

Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the leading cause of seafood-associated gastroenteritis in the United States, is typically linked to the consumption of raw oysters gathered from warm-water estuaries. We describe a recognized outbreak of V. parahaemolyticus infection associated with consuming seafood from Alaska.

- **Methods**: After receiving reports of gastroenteritis occurrence on a cruise ship, we conducted a retrospective cohort study among passengers. Additionally, we implemented active surveillance throughout Alaska to identify more cases and performed an environmental study to identify sources of V. parahaemolyticus and contributors to the outbreak.

- **Results**: Of 189 passengers, 132 (70 percent) were interviewed, and 22 interviewees (17 percent) met our case definition of gastroenteritis. In our multiple logistic regression analysis, consumption of raw oysters was the sole significant predictor of illness. The attack rate among those who consumed oysters was 29 percent. Active surveillance identified a total of 62 patients with gastroenteritis. V. parahaemolyticus serotype O6:K18 was isolated from the majority of patients tested and from environmental samples of oysters. Patterns on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were highly related across clinical and oyster isolates. All oysters associated with the outbreak were harvested when mean daily water temperatures exceeded 15.0 degrees Celsius, the theorized threshold for the risk of V. parahaemolyticus illness from consuming raw oysters. Since 1997, mean water temperatures in July and August at the implicated…

### Concurrent norovirus outbreaks associated with consumption of oysters harvested in Mexico - California, December 2023-January 2024 [^112SQaai]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Low credibility.

In late December 2023, the FDA released a health advisory for contaminated oysters from certain harvest areas in Bahia Salina, Sonora, Mexico, in response to outbreak one. On January 12, 2024, distributor A issued a recall. On January 17, 2024, in response to outbreak two, the FDA issued a second health advisory for contaminated oysters from some harvest areas in Baja California, Mexico, leading to the recall of the product. Growing areas were closed by Mexican authorities for 21 days after confirmation of positive norovirus samples from patients with outbreak-associated cases. The CDPH and California local health jurisdictions issued advisories and press releases to consumers, restaurants, and retailers not to eat, serve, or sell any oysters that were grown in certain regions of Mexico implicated in the investigation.

### Detection and genetic characterization of human enteric viruses in oyster-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks between 2001 and 2012 in Osaka City, Japan [^1145LL6B]. Journal of Medical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Enteric viruses are an important cause of viral food-borne disease. Shellfish, particularly oysters, are well recognized as a source of these diseases, and oyster-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks have occasionally become international occurrences. In this study, 286 fecal specimens from 88 oyster-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks were examined for the presence of 10 human enteric viruses using antigenic or genetic detection methods to determine the prevalence of these infections. All virus-positive patients were over 18 years old.

The most common enteric virus in outbreaks (96.6%) and fecal specimens (68.9%) was norovirus (NoV), indicating a high prevalence of NoV infection associated with the consumption of raw or under-cooked oysters. Five other enteric viruses — Aichiviruses, astroviruses, sapoviruses, enteroviruses (EVs), and rotavirus A — were detected in 30.7% of outbreaks. EV strains were characterized into three rare genotypes: coxsackievirus (CV) A1, A19, and EV76. No reports of CVA19 or EV76 have been made since 1981 in the Infectious Agents Surveillance Report by the National Infectious Diseases Surveillance Center, Japan.

The detection of these rare types of EVs suggests that they are circulating in human populations inconspicuously, and one of their transmission modes could be the consumption of contaminated oysters. Rapid identification of pathogens is important for developing methods for control and prevention. The results of the present study will be useful for establishing an efficient approach for the identification of viral pathogens in oyster-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks.

### Impact of 2003 state regulation on raw oyster-associated Vibrio vulnificus illnesses and deaths, California, USA [^112WjHzH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In 1991, California adopted a regulation to decrease oyster-associated V. vulnificus infections and deaths. Restaurants and other food establishments that sold or served raw Gulf Coast oysters were required to provide the following written warning to prospective customers about the potential harmful effects of consuming raw oysters: "Eating raw oysters may cause severe illness and even death in persons who have liver disease (for example, alcoholic cirrhosis), cancer, or other chronic illnesses that weaken the immune system".

In 1996, the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services reported that, despite this regulation, V. vulnificus cases and deaths due to eating raw oysters were ongoing, especially among the Spanish-speaking Hispanic population. A survey of 103 restaurants serving raw Gulf Coast oysters showed that more than 50% either had no warning sign or a poorly visible sign.

In 1997, California updated the raw oyster regulation to require the provision of the written warning both in English ("Warning") and in Spanish ("Aviso Importante"), with specific wording and formatting requirements for a prominently posted sign, a boxed statement prominently placed on each menu, or a tent card for each dining table.

Despite the implementation of these updated regulations, oyster-associated V. vulnificus infections and deaths continued. This situation led the state of California to enact an emergency regulation on April 14, 2003, restricting the sale, in California, of raw oysters harvested from the Gulf of Mexico from April 1 through October 31, unless the oysters were treated with a specific process.

### Norwalk virus-specific binding to oyster digestive tissues [^1118chPm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Twelve years ago, the question, "Should shellfish be purified before public consumption?" was asked in Lancet. Since then, new evidence of gastroenteritis outbreaks linked to shellfish consumption, even depurated shellfish, has been published; raw or cooked oysters are the predominant bivalve mollusks involved. Regulations for Escherichia coli counts in shellfish-growing waters (United States) or shellfish meat (European Community) have failed to protect consumers because most shellfish-associated gastroenteritis outbreaks have a viral origin. Enteric viruses are different from enteric bacteria in terms of resistance to sewage treatment, persistence under unfavorable conditions as occurs in seawater, and transmission into the environment. Shellfish mollusks cultivated in coastal areas close to human activities can be contaminated by human sewage, which can spread more than 100 types of viruses. Viruses persist in shellfish for an extended period and can adversely affect public health; despite improvements, depuration does not eliminate viral particles.

Noroviruses are the most frequent cause of diarrhea outbreaks in all age groups. These viruses, which are commonly associated with foodborne and waterborne outbreaks, are resistant to sewage treatment and are present in high concentrations during the epidemic season. They are the primary pathogens associated with shellfish-borne outbreaks worldwide. Oysters are rapidly contaminated, as shown by outbreaks linked to accidental input, and viruses then persist for up to several weeks.

### Comprehensive analysis of a norovirus-associated gastroenteritis outbreak, from the environment to the consumer [^1127g1fL]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

Noroviruses have been recognized as the predominant agents of nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks in humans, with transmission via contaminated shellfish consumption being well-documented. Norovirus laboratory experiments, volunteer challenge studies, and community gastroenteritis outbreak investigations have identified human genetic susceptibility factors related to histo-blood group antigen expression.

A gastroenteritis outbreak following a banquet in Brittany, France, in February 2008, was linked to oyster consumption. The study identified an association between norovirus illnesses and histo-blood group expression. Oyster contamination with norovirus was confirmed through qualitative and quantitative analyses, with the secretor phenotype particularly associated with illness, especially for the non-A subgroup.

The study concluded that, in addition to accidental climatic events that may lead to oyster contamination, illegal shellfish collection and trading are also significant risk factors associated with outbreaks.

### Fatal vibrio vulnificus infection associated with eating raw oysters, New Caledonia [^116FVy37]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Strains were sent to the Centre National de Reference des Vibrions et du Choléra (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France), where PCR confirmed the gene encoding virulence-associated hemolysin, a species-specific marker. Molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to assess possible clonality of the strains.

Several studies have demonstrated the genomic diversity among environmental and clinical V. vulnificus isolates. Genotyping methods have identified more than 100 V. vulnificus strains in a single oyster and notable heterogeneity among clinical isolates from multiple patients, even if a unique pathogenic strain causes the infection in each patient. Therefore, V. vulnificus infections within a large population at risk may result from rare events, controlled more by the host than by the bacterial strain.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotype analysis enabled us to divide the strains into two groups. One group included the isolate from patient 1, and the other group included isolates from patients 2 and 3. Despite having slightly different Not I and Sfi I patterns reflecting genetic rearrangement, these isolates clearly belonged to a single clone. The isolation of strains with such a high degree of homogeneity is uncommon, raising the question of the existence of V. vulnificus clones that are particularly virulent or adapted to humans. Currently, however, reliable markers for determining V. vulnificus virulence do not exist. Thus, no genotyping system is likely to be useful for rapidly identifying strains that affect public health.

### Norovirus contamination found in oysters worldwide [^114n7Np2]. Journal of Medical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Noroviruses (Norwalk-like viruses) are recognized as major causes of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis are often associated with the consumption of oysters. In this study, oysters imported into Hong Kong from 11 countries over a 3-year period were screened by RT-PCR. Overall, 53 out of 507 (10.5%) samples were positive for norovirus RNA, and a wide variety of strains were found. Two novel genetic clusters were detected, which could indicate novel human or animal norovirus strains. However, whether these two new clusters are of human or animal origin is not known.

Thirteen outbreaks in which oysters were implicated as the source of infection were investigated: Norovirus RNA sequences could be detected in oysters from six outbreaks, but only in one outbreak did the strains isolated from patients and oysters match (> 98% homology). Therefore, RT-PCR was useful in detecting norovirus contamination of oysters implicated in an outbreak, but was less effective in demonstrating an actual molecular epidemiological link with human cases. It was shown that contamination by noroviruses could be demonstrated in oysters worldwide, and therefore oysters may serve as an important vehicle for introducing novel norovirus strains.

### Detection of multiple noroviruses associated with an international gastroenteritis outbreak linked to oyster consumption [^1159hFsH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

An international outbreak linked to oyster consumption involved a group of over 200 people in Italy and 127 total subjects across 13 smaller clusters in France. This was analyzed using epidemiological and clinical data, alongside shellfish samples. Environmental information from the oyster-producing area, located in a lagoon in southern France, was collected to investigate possible events leading to the contamination. Virologic analyses were conducted by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using the same primer sets for both clinical and environmental samples. After sequencing, the data were analyzed through the database operated by the scientific network FoodBorne Viruses in Europe.

The existence of an international collaboration between laboratories was critical to rapidly connect the data and fully interpret the results, as it was not obvious that one food source could be the link due to the diversity of the norovirus strains involved across different cases. It was also demonstrated that heavy rain was responsible for the accidental contamination of seafood, leading to a concentration of up to hundreds of genomic copies per oyster, as detected by real-time RT-PCR.

### The role of seafood in bacterial foodborne diseases [^116GcpCm]. Microbes and Infection (2000). Low credibility.

Pathogenic bacteria, when present in marine seafood and fresh cultured products, are usually found at fairly low levels. When these products are adequately cooked, food safety hazards are insignificant. However, a few bacteria associated with fecal contamination of seafood continue to pose a large-scale health threat through seafood.

### Increasing quinolone resistance in Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis [^115PrGYC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The major sources of domestically acquired S. Enteritidis infections are raw or undercooked eggs produced in Denmark (unpub. data). The most common phage types in Danish layer hens are PT 6 and PT 8, which accounted for 65.1% of the domestically acquired infections in our study. Resistance in these two phage types remained low, as were the rates of resistance in PT 13A, PT 25, and PT 34. These types also originate from layer hens. In contrast, the proportion of resistant isolates was highest in phage types PT 1, PT 4, PT 6A, PT 14B, and PT 21, which are often associated with infections from imported poultry products, including imported broiler chickens.

- **Prevalence of quinolone resistance**: In human isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis, by phage type and history of foreign travel. Denmark, 1995–2000.

From 1994 to 1997 in England as well as Wales, quinolone resistance in S. Enteritidis increased from 0.4% to 1.3%. As in our study, resistance was highest in PT 1 (19%) and PT 6A (14%). These types were mainly associated with foreign travel. In a recent study from Spain, 31% of 385 S. Enteritidis isolates overall, but 80% of PT 1 isolates, were reported to be quinolone resistant.

### Fatal vibrio vulnificus infection associated with eating raw oysters, New Caledonia [^112wDzX8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

To the Editor: The bacterium Vibrio vulnificus is a marine flora saprophyte that can cause necrotic skin infection and septicemia in humans who eat shellfish. Symptoms of septicemia (mortality rate > 50%) have been described mostly in Florida and Japan among persons who ate raw filter-feeding shellfish when seawater temperatures are > 20°C.

V. vulnificus-related septicemia introduced through the digestive system appears within 7 days after ingestion. Clinical signs and symptoms include fever, collapse, and metastatic necrotic skin lesions. We report 3 patients from New Caledonia who died after V. vulnificus infection, which they probably acquired by eating contaminated oysters. These patients were hospitalized during February–May 2008 at Noumea Hospital (Noumea, New Caledonia).

- **Patient 1**: A 51-year-old man with fever, muscle pains, bleeding gums, and a history of alcohol abuse; within 48 hours after symptom onset, he died of septic shock, with diffuse ecchymoses and purpura.
- **Patient 2**: A 67-year-old woman with no known conditions who was admitted to the hospital with chills, diarrhea, and vomiting; septic shock developed, with painful erythematous plaques on the lower limbs becoming foamy, confluent, and necrotic.
- **Patient 3**: A 74-year-old woman with untreated lupus who was hospitalized with lower-limb edema, hypotension, hypothermia, and erythematous skin lesions.

All 3 patients received cephalosporins but died of multiple organ failure within 12 hours after hospital admission. Peripheral blood aerobic–anaerobic samples were taken from all patients.

### Vibrio parahaemolyticus foodborne illness associated with oysters, Australia, 2021–2022 [^117MfJSZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Until recently, foodborne outbreaks of V. parahaemolyticus were rare in Australia. Only four outbreaks were reported during 2002–2019, affecting a total of 24 persons. Two previously reported outbreaks were linked to the consumption of oysters: one from oysters produced in Tasmania and one from oysters grown in South Australia. From 2016 to 2020, only 29 locally acquired, sporadic foodborne cases of V. parahaemolyticus were reported in Australia, with 22 of the infected persons reporting oyster consumption (76%). V. parahaemolyticus infections might be underreported in Australia because pathology laboratories rarely include it in routine fecal testing procedures, and the infection is a notifiable condition in only four of the eight states and territories of Australia.

In September 2021, at the end of the winter season in the Southern Hemisphere, health officials identified an increase in locally acquired V. parahaemolyticus cases in South Australia, and a similar trend was later noted in other jurisdictions of Australia. In November 2021, through the OzFoodNet network, a multijurisdictional outbreak investigation commenced to coordinate the public health response. OzFoodNet is a network of epidemiologists across Australia responsible for undertaking surveillance and outbreak investigations of foodborne disease. Investigators worked closely with jurisdictional public health laboratories and Australian food regulatory authorities who implement control measures.

### Detection of oyster herpesvirus DNA and proteins in asymptomatic Crassostrea gigas adults [^117ALaCY]. Virus Research (2002). Low credibility.

Since 1972, several herpes-like virus infections have been reported among different bivalve species around the world. Most of these reports involved larvae or juveniles presenting high mortalities. Two case reports of herpes-like viruses concerned adult oysters, Crassostrea virginica in the United States and Ostrea angasi in Australia. Molecular techniques, including PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH), have been recently developed to detect the oyster herpesvirus genome.

In the present study, 30 Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, adults have been analyzed using three different techniques: PCR, ISH, and immunochemistry, in order to detect herpesviruses in asymptomatic individuals. PCR and ISH allowed detection of oyster herpesvirus DNA in 93.3% and 86.6%, respectively, of analyzed oysters, while polyclonal antibodies allowed detection of viral proteins in 76.6% of analyzed adult oysters.

These results suggest that oyster herpesvirus infects adult oysters with high prevalence and that the virus may persist in its host after primary infection. The detection of viral DNA and viral proteins in the gonad of several individuals supports the hypothesis of a possible vertical transmission of the infection. Lastly, concordance among the three techniques used in this study is discussed.

During May 20-July 31, 2006, New York City, New York state, Oregon, and Washington health departments reported a total of 177 cases of Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection, of which 122 have been associated with 17 clusters. A cluster has been defined as a group of two or more ill persons who were linked to the same shellfish source (e.g. shared a meal at the same restaurant or obtained shellfish from the same seafood market). Certain clusters were associated with restaurants, seafood markets, and recreational harvesting. Three patients were hospitalized; no fatalities have been reported. No demographic (e.g. age, sex, or race) or medical history (e.g. predisposing conditions) information is yet available regarding affected persons.

### Vibrio parahaemolyticus foodborne illness associated with oysters, Australia, 2021–2022 [^112dVpQF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a marine and estuarine bacterium ubiquitous in tropical and temperate waters worldwide. Infections, including wound infections, can occur in humans through exposure to water, and enteric infections are most commonly attributed to ingestion of raw or undercooked seafood. Invasive bloodstream infections and death rarely occur. Human infection is not associated with person-to-person spread or transmission through the fecal–oral route, and the environmental presence of V. parahaemolyticus has not been linked to fecal contamination. The virulence of V. parahaemolyticus is associated with the presence of a thermostable direct hemolysin (coded by the tdh gene) or thermostable-related hemolysin (trh gene).

Foodborne V. parahaemolyticus outbreaks have been reported across Asia, the United States, South America, Europe, and New Zealand, predominantly associated with the consumption of filter-feeding bivalve shellfish, such as oysters and mussels. V. parahaemolyticus infections show seasonal patterns, with increases in warmer months, because V. parahaemolyticus will grow in seawater at temperatures > 14°C–19°C. Climate change can increase the distribution and incidence of V. parahaemolyticus, and a rise in water temperature is the main environmental factor associated with the growth of V. parahaemolyticus in oysters. Postharvest risk reduction strategies focus on rapid cooling and maintaining cold refrigeration of oysters throughout the supply chain to prevent bacterial growth, which occurs at air temperatures > 10°C.
