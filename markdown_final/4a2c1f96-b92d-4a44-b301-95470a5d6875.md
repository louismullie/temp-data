## Question

Diagnosis and management of Hemoperitoneum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnosis and management of hemoperitoneum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical presentation and initial assessment, including distinguishing traumatic from nontraumatic etiologies. Then, I should verify the hemodynamic status because this dictates imaging and intervention. Next, I will review first-line imaging choices (FAST vs CT) and when to escalate to contrast-enhanced CT with vascular phase. After that, I will examine key CT signs that predict intervention and outline source control options, including surgery, angioembolization, and laparoscopy. Finally, I will address special populations such as pregnancy, consider postoperative complications like abdominal compartment syndrome, and synthesize a practical decision algorithm, making sure I double-check where guidelines differ and why.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: hemoperitoneum is the presence of free intraperitoneal blood, and the first branch point is traumatic versus spontaneous, because this alters pretest probabilities, imaging urgency, and intervention thresholds. I should also verify the most common nontraumatic sources, which include hepatic or splenic rupture with underlying pathology, vascular lesions such as visceral artery aneurysms, gynecologic etiologies like ectopic pregnancy or ruptured ovarian cysts, and coagulopathies, and I need to keep iatrogenic causes in mind as well, particularly post-procedural bleeding [^117WNMQy] [^114vYgH8] [^113uKSvg] [^114ST36d] [^112kdVoL] [^113wkFNs] [^116FCCLv].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic status before anything else, because unstable patients with suspected hemoperitoneum should not be delayed for definitive imaging. I should confirm airway, breathing, and circulation, initiate massive transfusion if indicated, and use permissive hypotension principles when appropriate, while rapidly triaging to source control. If the patient is unstable with a positive FAST, I need to avoid CT delays and proceed to operative or endovascular hemorrhage control, ideally with trauma team activation and damage control resuscitation protocols in place [^111YdMGe] [^115kqqAd] [^114pyhdf].

> Next, I should review first-line imaging in the unstable patient. FAST is the correct initial test because it is rapid, repeatable at the bedside, and does not interrupt resuscitation; however, I must remember its limitations. I initially recalled sensitivity around 90–93% for hemoperitoneum detection, but wait, I should double-check the contemporary evidence, which shows pooled sensitivity closer to 63–74% with very high specificity, and a meaningful false negative rate, particularly in hypotensive patients; serial FAST can improve sensitivity, and a negative FAST does not exclude injury, so I should not anchor on a single negative study in a high-risk patient [^112CamXg] [^115aGCkE] [^112GVHak] [^114PbZ2A]. Hold on, I should also verify mimics and pitfalls: fluid from resuscitation, ascites, or artifact can cause false positives, and I need to correlate clinically to avoid misclassification [^112jL3xY] [^115SRiEt].

> For stable patients, I need to ensure we do not jump to conclusions from a negative FAST. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the diagnostic modality of choice because it characterizes the source, quantifies hemoperitoneum, detects active extravasation, and guides intervention planning; whole-body CT can be considered in polytrauma. I should confirm we obtain arterial and portal venous phases when active hemorrhage is suspected to optimize detection of contrast extravasation and vascular injuries [^111YdMGe] [^116zwdLL] [^1114AMUc] [^11424WXT].

> Let me consider what on CT changes management. Active contrast extravasation indicates ongoing arterial bleeding and correlates with a high likelihood of intervention, while sentinel clot density near an organ helps localize the bleeding source. I should double-check the quantitative impact of hemoperitoneum volume; multiple trauma series demonstrate that moderate to large hemoperitoneum independently increases the odds of splenic artery embolization or failure of nonoperative management, and the presence of a vascular blush, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula further heightens risk and often mandates angiography and embolization in stable patients [^111hGCLV] [^1117EiM1] [^111Th9ut] [^116Z7s5X] [^116UAci5].

> Now, I will examine source control options. For unstable patients with a positive FAST, exploratory laparotomy is indicated. In selected unstable pelvic fracture patients without a laparotomy indication, REBOA or preperitoneal packing with angioembolization may be first-line adjuncts. But wait, I should verify angioembolization indications for solid organs: in hemodynamically stable patients with contrast extravasation, pseudoaneurysm, high-grade injury, or moderate to large hemoperitoneum, splenic or hepatic embolization is appropriate and improves nonoperative success, with reported splenic salvage rates often exceeding 80–90% in modern series. If embolization fails or instability persists, I need to ensure rapid conversion to operative management to prevent exsanguination [^115aGCkE] [^111BD8bk] [^116Z7s5X] [^1114AMUc] [^115HnGH8].

> I should also consider when diagnostic or therapeutic laparoscopy is useful. In selected stable patients with an unclear diagnosis, in those with suspected gynecologic sources such as ectopic or ovarian pathology, or in penetrating trauma with equivocal trajectories, laparoscopy can expedite diagnosis and allow targeted treatment while avoiding nontherapeutic laparotomy. Hold on, I need to ensure we do not delay definitive control in unstable patients; hemodynamic instability remains a contraindication to diagnostic laparoscopy in most settings [^113FpP86] [^111cUPFL] [^112kdVoL] [^1162N24V].

> Special populations require tailored pathways. In pregnancy, I should double-check for ectopic pregnancy, heterotopic pregnancy, and spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy (SHIP), especially with endometriosis, ART, or prior abdominal surgery. Transvaginal ultrasound with serum β-hCG guides triage, and laparoscopy or laparotomy is often required when hemoperitoneum is present. I need to ensure maternal stabilization and fetal monitoring are prioritized, and coordinate with obstetrics for peripartum management and potential delivery decisions if late gestation [^112kdVoL] [^111qpeW3] [^112snFp4] [^117H4ev6].

> But wait, what if the hemoperitoneum follows a procedure or anticoagulation? Iatrogenic sources such as colonoscopy-associated splenic injury, post-biopsy hemorrhage, or vascular access complications can present subtly; CT is essential to localize bleeding and plan embolization or surgery. I should confirm that any patient with new abdominal pain, hypotension, or dropping hemoglobin after an invasive procedure gets urgent imaging and early involvement of interventional radiology [^116FCCLv] [^112wXgo6] [^112UXpKo].

> I will now examine complications that change ICU care. Large-volume hemoperitoneum and aggressive resuscitation can precipitate intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome; I need to monitor bladder pressures, avoid excessive crystalloids, and employ stepwise decompression, including percutaneous drainage and, if refractory, decompressive laparotomy with temporary abdominal closure. Let me verify thresholds and timing: persistent IAP above roughly 20–25 mmHg with organ dysfunction warrants intervention, and earlier recognition improves outcomes [^112L5Sck] [^116Ddd7L] [^116FRcxL].

> Next, I should review nonoperative management protocols and follow-up. For stable blunt splenic or hepatic injuries without active extravasation, observation with serial hemoglobin checks, bed rest, and interval imaging when indicated is appropriate; many patients, even older adults, can be managed nonoperatively if carefully selected. I should double-check failure predictors: need for transfusion, large hemoperitoneum, contrast blush, and higher AAST grade increase the risk of failure, so I need a low threshold for angiography or surgery if clinical deterioration occurs [^113FK2hQ] [^117Thdix] [^111xiLqf] [^112tJPHW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about FAST dictating the operating room in all scenarios. I initially thought a positive FAST alone mandates immediate laparotomy, but I should correct that nuance: a positive FAST in an unstable trauma patient strongly supports the need for emergent hemorrhage control, yet the definitive decision is hemodynamics plus clinical context, and in pelvic fracture–predominant bleeding, angioembolization may be first-line while laparotomy is deferred if there is no indication for an intraperitoneal source. The key is that unstable patients with hemoperitoneum require source control without delay, tailored to the suspected etiology and local resources [^111YdMGe] [^111BD8bk] [^113P3sYv].

> To synthesize a practical decision pathway: if unstable, I should prioritize resuscitation, perform FAST rapidly, and proceed to OR or IR for hemorrhage control based on suspected source. If stable, I should obtain contrast-enhanced CT to localize bleeding and stratify risk, then pursue angioembolization for active extravasation or vascular injury, operative management for ongoing instability or complex injuries, and observation for low-grade solid organ injuries without active bleeding. I need to ensure I revisit hemodynamics frequently because deterioration should trigger escalation without waiting for repeat imaging in most cases [^111YdMGe] [^116zwdLL] [^112cfJPr].

> Finally, I should confirm quality metrics and system factors that improve outcomes: early trauma team activation, rapid access to CT in or adjacent to the resuscitation area, massive transfusion protocols, and clear pathways to interventional radiology reduce time-to-intervention and mortality. Let me double-check that proximity of CT to the trauma bay is associated with improved survival; yes, European guidance highlights this infrastructure element as impactful, reinforcing the need for streamlined logistics during the golden hour [^111YdMGe].

Hemoperitoneum is diagnosed by **FAST ultrasound for unstable patients** [^115aGCkE] and **contrast-enhanced CT for stable patients** [^111YdMGe] to localize bleeding and guide management [^117WNMQy]. Unstable patients require **immediate resuscitation and operative or angiographic control** [^111YdMGe]; stable patients may undergo angioembolization or observation [^116xWocN]. Management is dictated by hemodynamics, bleeding source, and comorbidities, with a multidisciplinary approach to optimize outcomes.

---

## Clinical presentation and initial assessment

Patients typically present with **acute abdominal pain, distension, and signs of hypovolemia** (tachycardia, hypotension, shock) [^113uKSvg]. Initial assessment should include:

- **Vital signs**: identify hemodynamic instability [^111YdMGe].
- **Focused history**: trauma, anticoagulation, pregnancy, malignancy, liver disease, or recent procedures [^1153bghv].
- **Physical examination**: abdominal tenderness, distension, guarding, or rebound tenderness [^114ihVHr].

---

## Diagnostic imaging modalities

### Ultrasound

Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (**FAST**) is rapid, noninvasive, and highly specific for detecting free intraperitoneal fluid [^115aGCkE]; sensitivity is variable (69–98%), particularly in unstable patients [^115aGCkE]. Prehospital ultrasound can expedite care but has limited sensitivity and should not delay transport or definitive imaging [^116SyQHx].

---

### Computed tomography (CT)

CT is the **gold standard** for stable patients, providing precise localization of bleeding, grading of organ injuries, and detection of active extravasation [^113ngUYK]. Key CT findings include:

- **Active extravasation**: linear or irregular high-attenuation contrast indicating ongoing bleeding [^116UAci5].
- **Sentinel clot**: hyperattenuating clot near the bleeding source [^116UAci5].
- **Organ injury**: lacerations, hematomas, or pseudoaneurysms [^1172Ljuq].

---

### Laboratory tests

Laboratory evaluation includes a **complete blood count** to assess anemia and serial hemoglobin trends [^116M7uCq], coagulation profile to evaluate coagulopathy, and type and crossmatch to prepare for transfusion.

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Hemoperitoneum can be **traumatic or non-traumatic**:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Traumatic | - Blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma <br/> - Splenic injury <br/> - Hepatic injury <br/> - Mesenteric injury [^11424WXT] |
| Non-traumatic | - Ruptured ectopic pregnancy <br/> - Ovarian cyst rupture <br/> - Splenic artery aneurysm <br/> - Hepatic tumors <br/> - Coagulopathies <br/> - Anticoagulation therapy [^1153bghv] |

---

Risk factors include **anticoagulation, liver disease, pregnancy, malignancy, and recent surgical or interventional procedures** [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **hemodynamic stability**, the **source and severity of bleeding**, and **patient comorbidities**:

---

### Unstable patients

Unstable patients require **immediate resuscitation** with blood products and rapid hemorrhage control [^114pyhdf]. Operative management entails **emergency laparotomy or laparoscopy** for direct hemorrhage control, while **angiographic embolization** is appropriate for select cases with accessible bleeding vessels [^112cfJPr].

---

### Stable patients

Stable patients may be managed **conservatively or with minimally invasive techniques**:

- **Observation**: For minor injuries or small hemoperitoneum without active bleeding [^116xWocN].
- **Angiographic embolization**: For active extravasation, pseudoaneurysm, or vascular injuries [^1114AMUc].
- **Laparoscopy**: Diagnostic and therapeutic for unclear sources or minimally invasive intervention [^113FpP86].

---

## Complications

Potential complications include **hypovolemic shock, abdominal compartment syndrome, infection, and organ failure** [^notfound]. Early recognition and intervention are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality [^111hGCLV].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with the **cause, severity, and timeliness of intervention**. Rapid diagnosis and appropriate management significantly improve outcomes, whereas delays increase morbidity and mortality [^111YdMGe].

---

Hemoperitoneum is a life-threatening condition requiring rapid diagnosis and targeted management. FAST ultrasound and CT are key imaging tools [^111YdMGe], and management is tailored to hemodynamic stability and bleeding source, with a multidisciplinary approach to optimize outcomes [^112DvChk].

### Angiography and embolisation for solid abdominal organ injury in adults-a current perspective [^1114AMUc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

CT grading systems incorporating MDCT findings of vascular lesions and active bleeding when assigning grade of injury have been suggested and may be better than the AAST system for predicting which patients need angiography or intervention after blunt splenic trauma. To date these are not in widespread use.

Indicators of the need for intervention in the form of transarterial embolisation or surgery include active contrast extravasation from the splenic parenchyma and vascular injuries such as pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula. At CT, these are demonstrated as an intraparenchymal contrast blush - a focal hyperdense collection of contrast. The presence of haemoperitoneum can also suggest vascular injury. If the patient is hypotensive, parenchymal enhancement is often delayed and heterogenous and so appropriate CT technique with plain, arterial and delayed (2–3 minutes) phases of examination is necessary to achieve optimum sensitivity.

ii) Conservative management

The majority of blunt splenic injuries can be managed safely with observation, even in centres with a low incidence of trauma. Embolisation is required in only 7% of patients and conservative treatment of low grade injuries is successful in over 90% of patients.

Patients with a high grade injury are at greatest risk of failure of observational management (up to 70%) and are at greatest risk of delayed operative intervention. The need for transfusion of greater than 1 unit of blood is another independent risk factor for failure of observation and haemodynamic instability will also determine further treatment as is discussed later.

Vascular injury (haemorrhage, haematoma, pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula) at CT is also associated with failure of observational treatment. A contrast blush at CT scanning is associated with failure of observational treatment in up to 80%.

Abdominal surgeons are often asked to manage challenging pathologic conditions with limited preoperative information. As such, unexpected intraoperative findings are commonly encountered. Often, there is little peer-reviewed evidence on which to base management decisions. This article reviews common unexpected surgical challenges and provides recommendations based on the latest available literature.

### A clinician's guide to management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome in critically ill patients [^116Ddd7L]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

A Practical Approach Based on the IAH Triangle

The first two elements of the triangle (pressure and impact) will determine whether or not active attempts to decrease IAP should be considered, in what timeframe these attempts should produce a clinically relevant result, and what level or invasiveness (and possibility of complications) is required. The third element (cause) will determine which treatment option will most likely produce the desired result. At the bedside, three critical questions should be asked once IAH/ACS has been diagnosed (Fig. 3).

Elements to be considered in decision-making for management of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). ACS abdominal compartment syndrome, IAP intra-abdominal pressure

Is an Intervention Required?

Why intervene: The decision to intervene will be guided by the presence of organ dysfunction caused by a relevant increase in IAP in a patient who has been diagnosed with a condition that may be associated with IAH and in which an intervention is expected to have a beneficial impact on IAP as well as on organ function. The IAP value, the evolution of IAP over time, and the degree of organ dysfunction are the most important considerations. However, the measured IAP value should be interpreted carefully. If IAP is elevated in semiconscious or fully awake patients and organ function is normal or improving, techniques to reduce IAP are probably less warranted and may cause unnecessary complications. If IAP is normal after analgesia/sedation, IAH is unlikely to be a contributing factor to organ dysfunction. If IAP remains increased, an underlying cause of IAH is likely and additional diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions are warranted.

How Urgent Is the Effect of the Intervention Required?

When to intervene: The urgency of an intervention in the setting of IAH/ACS depends on the measured IAP value, the rate of IAP increase, and the degree of organ dysfunction. In most situations, starting stepwise management should not be delayed and some situations require immediate invasive intervention. In general, in patients with primary ACS, intervention is more urgent than in patients with secondary ACS where the clinician has more time to intervene. If adequate oxygenation and/or ventilation cannot be maintained despite optimal ventilator settings, or circulation is severely compromised despite adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support, immediate decompression may be required — irrespective of the other interventions. If organ function is slowly deteriorating along with a gradually increasing IAP, using a technique expected to have a slower effect on IAP may be considered, if the potential for serious complications can be avoided by this strategy.

### A unique case of diagnosis of a heterotopic pregnancy at 26 weeks-case report and literature review [^1153bghv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

The study's strong side is that it presents a well-managed clinical diagnosis of hemoperitoneum with an excellent outcome. In the differential diagnosis of hemoperitoneum, the main question is: was it caused by trauma. After excluding an injury, iatrogenic causes such as anticoagulation therapy, invasive procedures, or surgery in anamnesis should be considered. Spontaneous nontraumatic hemoperitoneum may result from hemorrhage from an ovarian cyst or vascular lesions such as an arterial aneurysm or even neoplasm rupture. In women of childbearing age, complications of early pregnancy should be taken into consideration. Ectopic pregnancy or much less common heterotopic pregnancy can cause dramatic internal hemorrhage, especially in a woman with preexisting risk factors.

The main "take-away" lesson from this case report is that adnexa should be routinely examined during the first-trimester scan. Our patient had first trimester bleeding, but HP was not recognized. The differential diagnosis of internal hemorrhage in the late second trimester should include ruptured heterotopic pregnancy, even in a potentially low-risk patient.

### American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines on diagnosis and management of abdominal vascular injuries [^11278Yed]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal vascular trauma accounts for a small percentage of military and a moderate percentage of civilian trauma, affecting all age ranges and impacting young adult men most frequently. Penetrating causes are more frequent than blunt in adults, while blunt mechanisms are more common among pediatric populations. High rates of associated injuries, bleeding, and hemorrhagic shock ensure that, despite advances in both diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, immediate open surgical repair remains the mainstay of treatment for traumatic abdominal vascular injuries. Because of their devastating nature, abdominal vascular injuries remain a significant source of morbidity and mortality among trauma patients. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma in conjunction with the World Society of Emergency Surgery seek to summarize the literature to date and provide guidelines on the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of abdominal vascular injuries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Review study, level IV.

### Diagnostic laparoscopy guidelines: this guideline was prepared by the SAGES guidelines committee and reviewed and approved by the board of governors of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), November 2007 [^1137qu9a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) in the intensive care unit (ICU) — risks include delay in the diagnosis and treatment of patients if the procedure is false negative, missed pathology and its associated complications, and procedure- and anesthesia-related complications; benefits include expeditious diagnosis of suspected intra-abdominal pathology, minimization of treatment interruption by not moving the patient outside the ICU, avoidance of the morbidity of open exploration, avoidance of potential risks associated with transportation to the operating room or radiology for diagnostic tests, and the ability to provide therapeutic intervention.

### Atraumatic splenic rupture, an underrated cause of acute abdomen [^116UAci5]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

As correctly stated by Unal et al. due to widespread availability and extreme acquisition speed, multidetector CT represents the ideal imaging modality to consistently assess patients presenting to the emergency department with acute abdomen and signs of hemodynamic instability. Since physical signs are often unclear and laboratory findings do not accurately reflect the entity of bleeding, CT is warranted to investigate suspected intra-abdominal bleeding.

Depending on the patient's haematocrit, recent extravascular blood measures at 35 to 60 Hounsfield Units (HU) of attenuation, and becomes even denser (60.80 HU) from clotting within a few hours (Figs. 1 and 2). The highest attenuation "sentinel clot" located nearest to the site of bleeding allows confident identification of the spleen as the injured organ. Furthermore, CT reliably allows detecting coexistent haemoperitoneum and ongoing bleeding, two features that are strongly associated with the risk of failed nonsurgical management. Haemoperitoneum (Figs. 1 and 2) is heralded by higher-than-water attenuation (30–45 HU) peritoneal effusion, often with a mixed appearance or fluid-fluid level. Noncontained active haemorrhage (Fig. 1) appears as serpiginous or jet-like extravasation of injected contrast medium, which follows the attenuation of blood vessels in all acquisition phases and generally progresses from the arterial to the venous phase. Finally, CT allows the differentiation of ASR from other rare non-traumatic causes of abdominal haemorrhage including ruptured liver (mostly hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma rather than metastases) or kidney (particularly angiomyolipomas) tumours, visceral aneurysms and pseudo-aneurysms, and gynecologic conditions such as ectopic pregnancy, ruptured corpus luteum cysts, and HELLP syndrome.

Treatment guidelines for splenic injury from blunt abdominal trauma cannot be directly applied to ASR, since the latter commonly occurs in a diseased spleen and patients are generally older than those experiencing traumas. The correct therapeutic choice should consider the presence of haemodynamic instability, the amount of blood products used, the degree of haemoperitoneum, the underlying pathology, and the extent of splenic damage. As is well known to radiologists who are familiar with polytrauma imaging, multidetector CT is crucial in this setting as it detects active bleeding, and reliably measures and categorises splenic injuries according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) scale as either subcapsular and intraparenchymal hematomas, variably deep parenchymal and/or capsular lacerations, or devascularisation and fragmentation.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^112en3cs]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Rationale

Blunt abdominal trauma represents a major diagnostic challenge and an important source of internal bleeding. FAST has been established as a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic approach for detection of intra-abdominal free fluid in the emergency room. Large prospective observational studies determined a high specificity (range 0.97 to 1.0) and a high accuracy (range 0.92 to 0.99) but low sensitivity (range 0.56 to 0.71) of initial FAST examination for detecting intra-abdominal injuries in adults and children. Shackford and colleagues assessed the accuracy of FAST performed by non-radiologist clinicians (that is, surgeons and emergency physicians who were certified for FAST by defined standards) for detecting a haemoperitoneum in 241 prospectively investigated adult patients with blunt abdominal trauma (except for n = 2 with penetrating injuries) during a four year period. These findings were confirmed by Richards and co-workers in a four year prospective study of 3,264 adult patients with blunt abdominal trauma. Similar conclusions were drawn by the same group of investigators in a paediatric population, based on a prospective study on 744 consecutive children 16 years old or younger who underwent emergency FAST for blunt abdominal trauma. Liu and colleagues conducted a one year prospective comparison on the diagnostic accuracy of CT scan, diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), and sonography in 55 adult patients with blunt abdominal trauma. The authors found a high sensitivity (0.92), specificity (0.95), and accuracy (0.93) of initial FAST examination for the detection of haemoperitoneum. Although CT scan and DPL were shown to be more sensitive (1.0 for DPL, 0.97 for CT) than sonography for detection of haemoperitoneum, these diagnostic modalities are more time-consuming (CT and DPL) and invasive (DPL).

### Clinical analysis of women with ovarian pregnancy: a retrospective case-control study [^116KjkBS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early diagnosis of ovarian pregnancy is necessary in order to avoid serious complications. This study compared clinical manifestations of OP and TP and showed that OP patients were more likely to have worse clinical complications (hemorrhagic shock, rupture of gestational sac, hemoperitoneum and need for emergency laparotomy) at an early gestational age. Our findings also indicated that ART and current IUD use were risk factors of OP. For patients whose gestational sac is not detected in the uterus or the fallopian tubes, these risk factors and clinical features seem to have a high predictive value and may contribute to early suspicion of OP, thereby optimizing its clinical management.

Purpose and use of these guidelines

These guidelines are evidence-based, with the grades of recommendation based on the evidence and a consensus of experts. They do not exclude other approaches as being within a standard of practice. The treating clinician should determine the most appropriate action, after taking into account conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. The responsibility for the management and outcome rests with the engaging practitioners, and not the consensus group.

### Complications of abdominal and pelvic procedures: computed tomographic diagnosis [^112wXgo6]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The postprocedural period is a critical time in which serious complications can manifest. Localization of suspected complications following abdominal and pelvic procedures can be difficult on clinical evaluation alone. For example, abdominal pain after a colonoscopy may vary in etiology and can result from simple colonic spasm to colonic perforation, hemoperitoneum, or even splenic rupture. Vague abdominal pain following a renal biopsy may be due to minimal postprocedural bleeding into and around the kidney or may be due to potentially life-threatening hemorrhage. In such patients, computed tomography can play a crucial role in the rapid identification of complications as well guidance of subsequent patient management. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the benefit of computed tomography-assisted diagnosis of complications associated with routine procedures performed on or throughout the abdomen and pelvis, including cardiac catheterization, colonoscopy, endoscopy, percutaneous biopsy, and interventional radiology procedures.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^113wEnqE]. Critical Care (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for traumatic hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining pre-hospital ultrasound to detect hemothorax/pneumothorax, hemopericardium, and/or free abdominal fluid in patients with thoracoabdominal injuries, if feasible, without delaying transport.

---

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^1144Pa8E]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Blunt abdominal trauma represents a major diagnostic challenge and an important source of internal bleeding. Ultrasonography has been established as a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic approach for the detection of intra-abdominal free fluid in the emergency room. Large prospective observational studies determined a high specificity and accuracy but low sensitivity of initial ultrasonographic examination for detecting intra-abdominal injuries in adults and children. Liu and colleagues found a high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of initial ultrasound examination for the detection of haemoperitoneum. Ultrasonography has a high specificity but a low sensitivity for detecting free intraperitoneal fluid in penetrating torso trauma and in blunt abdominal trauma in children. A positive ultrasound suggests haemoperitoneum, but a negative initial abdominal ultrasound should direct further diagnostic investigations.

The role of CT scanning in acute trauma patients is well documented, and in recent years imaging for trauma patients has migrated towards multislice computed tomography (MSCT). The integration of modern MSCT scanners in the emergency room area allows the immediate assessment of trauma victims following admission. Using modern MSCT scanners, total whole-body scanning time may be reduced to less than 30 seconds. In a retrospective study comparing 370 patients in two groups, Weninger and colleagues showed that faster diagnosis using MSCT led to shorter emergency room and operating room time and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stays. Huber-Wagner et al. also showed the benefit of integration of the whole-body CT into early trauma care. CT diagnosis significantly increases the probability of survival in patients with polytrauma. Whole-body CT as a standard diagnostic tool during the earliest resuscitation phase for polytraumatised patients provides the added benefit of identifying head and chest injuries and other bleeding sources in multiply injured patients.

Further investigation

Recommendation 6

We recommend that patients presenting with haemorrhagic shock and an unidentified source of bleeding undergo immediate further investigation. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

A patient in haemorrhagic shock with an unidentified source of bleeding should undergo immediate further assessment of chest, abdominal cavity and pelvic ring, which represent the major sources of acute blood loss in trauma. Aside from a clinical examination, X-rays of chest and pelvis in conjunction with ultrasonography or occasionally diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) are recommended diagnostic modalities during the primary survey. In selected centres, readily available computed tomography (CT) scanners may replace conventional radiographic imaging techniques during the primary survey. In their systematic literature review, Jorgensen and colleagues found no evidence that pre-hospital ultrasound of the abdomen or chest improves the treatment of trauma patients.

Imaging

Recommendation 7

We recommend early imaging (ultrasonography or CT) for the detection of free fluid in patients with suspected torso trauma. (Grade 1B)

Intervention

Recommendation 8

We recommend that patients with significant free intra-abdominal fluid and haemodynamic instability undergo urgent intervention. (Grade 1A)

Further assessment

Recommendation 9

We recommend further assessment using CT for haemodynamically stable patients. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

Blunt abdominal trauma represents a major diagnostic challenge and an important source of internal bleeding. Ultrasonography has been established as a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic approach for detection of intra-abdominal free fluid in the emergency room. Large prospective observational studies determined a high specificity and accuracy but low sensitivity of initial ultrasonographic examination for detecting intra-abdominal injuries in adults and children. Liu and colleagues found a high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of initial ultrasound examination for the detection of haemoperitoneum. Ultrasonography has a high specificity but a low sensitivity for detecting free intra-peritoneal fluid in penetrating torso trauma and in blunt abdominal trauma in children. A positive ultrasound suggests haemoperitoneum, but a negative initial abdominal ultrasound should direct further diagnostic investigations. Although CT scan and DPL were shown to be more sensitive than sonography for detection of haemoperitoneum, these diagnostic modalities are more time-consuming (CT and DPL) and invasive (DPL).

### Successful laparoscopic management of spontaneous hemoperitoneum at 15 weeks of pregnancy: case report and review of literature [^1153vds2]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

We present a case report of laparoscopic management of a spontaneous hemoperitoneum in the second trimester of pregnancy. The patient was a 40-year-old woman at 15 weeks of gestation. At laparoscopic surgery, the hemoperitoneum was evacuated, and the right-sided uterine vessels were closed with diathermocoagulation. Every pregnant woman with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and imminent hypovolemic shock should be carefully evaluated. After ruling out the most prevalent causes of hemoperitoneum, idiopathic spontaneous hemoperitoneum should be considered. Rapid diagnosis and aggressive fluid replacement together with prompt surgical intervention may be the only chance for a favorable outcome for both mother and child in the presence of such a rare complication. Moreover, in early stages of pregnancy, the laparoscopic approach should be considered but only in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons.

### Controversies in emergency radiology. CT versus ultrasound in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma [^115Vk34h]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

There has been controversy regarding ultrasonography (US) versus CT in blunt abdominal trauma (BAT). Each modality has its strengths and weaknesses. US is fast and allows resuscitative efforts to proceed while the patient is being scanned. However, the sensitivity of US is inferior to that of CT, and there is user variability. CT is better at determining the extent, type, and grade of injury, resulting in a more tailored therapeutic plan and safe conservative management of many patients. However, CT involves ionizing radiation, cannot be performed portably, and requires only visual monitoring while scanning. Given each modality's strengths and weaknesses we conclude that CT is the preferred examination when the BAT patient is stable or moderately stable, enough to be taken to CT. If a BAT patient is unstable, US is beneficial in screening for certain injuries or large hemoperitoneum prior to an exploratory laparotomy.

### Splenic artery aneurysm: an important cause of hemoperitoneum and shock [^112mWfEq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Splenic artery aneurysm ruptures are rare and highly morbid events that are frequently associated with pregnancy. However, approximately 15% may occur in men, and it is important to have this possibility in the differential diagnosis in cases of hemoperitoneum and hemorrhagic shock. Rapid diagnosis and treatment is essential to survival.

Objectives

The aim of this report is to educate emergency physicians on the early recognition and treatment of this life-threatening event and to increase the awareness of this condition in male patients.

Case Report

We describe the evaluation and management of two cases of splenic artery rupture in male patients with unique presentations.

Conclusion

Splenic artery aneurysm ruptures should be considered in the differential diagnosis in any patient with undifferentiated shock. Early diagnosis and treatment can save lives.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^112CamXg]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The accuracy of PHUS was adequate with high sensitivity and specificity for pneumothorax, free intraabdominal fluid and haemoperitoneum in a systematic review of three retrospective and six prospective observational studies including 2889 trauma patients. Five studies reported at least one change in management. A more recent systematic review of 16 studies including 3317 trauma patients confirmed the feasibility/potential of PHUS, with seven studies evaluating treatment and transport impact, but with large inconsistencies in protocols, variables and outcomes, precluding a meta-analysis of the data.

In-hospital, POCUS, with its best-known application FAST, remains central to the primary ATLS survey for the detection of haemorrhage in pleural, pericardial and peritoneal cavities, with high specificity but overall variable to low sensitivity. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for detecting/excluding free fluids, organ/vascular or other injuries compared with reference imaging and/or operative/autopsy findings were 0.74 and 0.96 in a review and meta-analysis of 34 studies with 8635 patients and any type of blunt civilian injury. There was substantial heterogeneity across studies and the reported accuracy of POCUS varied greatly, depending on study populations and body areas affected. In general, a negative POCUS in the context of abdominal trauma cannot exclude injury and must be verified in any case against a standard reference, for example, CT. In a secondary analysis of prospective data from 317 hypotensive patients (< 90 mmHg systolic blood pressure) of the Prospective, Observational, Multicentre, Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) RCT, 22 FAST-negative patients required laparotomy within 6 h of admission; thus, in hypotensive patients with haemorrhage, significant intraabdominal haemorrhage must be suspected. From a series of small studies in mixed populations, it was concluded that POCUS may have a higher sensitivity in the context of chest and cardiac injuries. The classic FAST protocol can be augmented with an additional transverse scan of the pubic symphysis (FAST-PLUS protocol), with a high CT correlation with unstable pelvic injury. Rolling patients to the right may increase FAST sensitivity by converting false-negatives into true positive examinations.

### Evidence-based guidelines for bleeding in trauma patients: where do we go from here? [^112YQAw1]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The development of evidence-based guidelines has gained popularity as a strategy to reduce variation in practice and to orient clinical care around documentable best practices. Based on available data, the new European guidelines for the management of bleeding in the trauma patient do deliver a number of sound recommendations. However, some issues remain controversial and, like many guidelines, the actual translation of these evidence-based recommendations into routine clinical practice protocols continues to leave opportunity for variation. Nevertheless, this consensus guideline provides an excellent starting point. As evidence continues to accumulate, future iterations should provide greater specificity and move us closer to the definitive best practice.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^111BD8bk]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture patients — initial resuscitation and hemorrhage control follow a stepwise algorithm: When patients are hemodynamically unstable as a result of hemorrhage, a massive transfusion protocol should be activated, and while initiating resuscitative efforts a temporary pelvic binder or circumferential sheet should be positioned around the greater trochanters; a rapid assessment to exclude other bleeding sources is required using portable X rays of the chest and pelvis. To rule out intraabdominal hemorrhage, a Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) scan or diagnostic peritoneal aspiration (DPA) should be performed; if intraabdominal hemorrhage is diagnosed, hemodynamically unstable patients should be taken to the operating room for exploration and should be considered for pelvic fracture external fixation. If intraabdominal hemorrhage is not diagnosed by FAST or DPA, patients should undergo pelvic stabilization with either a temporary pelvic binder or sheet followed by surgical stabilization and preperitoneal packing, with stability provided by an external fixator giving greater support for pre-peritoneal packs and, if time allows, better hemorrhage control if fixation is achieved prior to packing. Patients who remain hemodynamically unstable following pelvic stabilization and those with preperitoneal packing in place should undergo angiography and potential embolization, and for patients truly in extremis solely from pelvic bleeding a potential alternative initial intervention is Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA), for which early experience in lieu of or in addition to preperitoneal packing has shown promising results.

### Splenic trauma: what is new? [^1127qrwj]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation for splenic injury is an important component of patient assessment after blunt abdominal trauma. Key imaging modalities include ultrasound, particularly for rapid identification of hemoperitoneum, and computed tomography (CT), which permits a more detailed and accurate determination of splenic integrity. Specific findings at contrast-enhanced multidetector CT (MDCT) should prompt the consideration of catheter angiography with arterial embolization as an adjunct to nonsurgical management. This article reviews the roles of imaging in the management of splenic trauma, illustrates the MDCT appearance of various splenic injuries, and discusses imaging-based indications for operative and angiographic intervention.

### The open abdomen in trauma and non-trauma patients: WSES guidelines [^116FRcxL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose and use of this guideline

The guidelines are evidence-based, with the grades of recommendation, based on the evidence. These guidelines present methods for optimal management of open abdomen in trauma and non-trauma patients. They do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and a consensus of experts. They, however, do not exclude other approaches as being within a standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which should be finally determined after taking into account conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. The responsibility for the results, however, rests with the engaging practitioners and not aged therein, and not the consensus group.

### Spontaneous hemoperitoneum: a bloody mess [^113uKSvg]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Spontaneous hemoperitoneum may be a life-threatening occurrence. It most frequently presents with acute abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) is the most commonly used modality in the initial work up of these patients, but sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play a role in the diagnosis. The etiology is varied, yet may be broadly classified into gynecologic, hepatic, splenic, vascular, and coagulopathic causes. This review will describe the common imaging findings of spontaneous hemoperitoneum, as it presents through the emergency room, and will detail the underlying causes and significance of spontaneous hemoperitoneum.

### Diagnostic laparoscopy [^115DPnne]. Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Since the early part of the 20th century, diagnostic laparoscopy has become an important tool in the armamentarium of surgeons and gastroenterologists alike. Its indications have expanded from initial attempts at tamponading internal hemorrhage to avoidance of unnecessary laparotomies with accurate staging of malignancies, treatment of a multitude of intra-abdominal pathologies, and even as a resource for evaluating blunt abdominal trauma and chronic abdominal pain. Its accuracy has been demonstrated in the evaluation of chronic liver diseases, in comparison with other diagnostic modalities. Many further technical advances have been introduced in recent years. Gastroenterology training programs should include formal diagnostic laparoscopy training as part of their curriculum.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^111YdMGe]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Haemodynamically stable patients, or patients who can be stabilised during initial resuscitation, with an unidentified bleeding source, but not in need of immediate bleeding control, should undergo further investigation of the chest, abdominal cavity and pelvic ring, which can be major sources of acute blood loss following traumatic injury. Besides clinical examination, imaging studies, including ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT), as well as laboratory tests, including blood gas analysis and coagulation profiles, together with functional assays, are recommended diagnostic modalities during the primary survey.

As CT scanners are increasingly being advocated and integrated into modern resuscitation units and emergency departments, this technique may replace conventional radiographic imaging and ultrasound as diagnostic measures during the primary survey. The diagnostic accuracy, safety and effectiveness of these immediate measures are dependent on sophisticated pre-hospital treatment by trained and experienced emergency personnel and short transportation times. Proximity of the CT scanner to the resuscitation room in the emergency department has been shown to have a significant positive effect on the probability of survival for the severely injured patient. Distances of more than 50 m had a significant negative effect on outcome and should be considered when new emergency departments are planned and constructed. If a CT scanner is not available in the emergency department, CT scanning implies transportation of the patient to the CT room; therefore, the clinician must evaluate the implications and potential risks and benefits of the procedure. Transfer times to and from all forms of diagnostic imaging need to be considered in the context of haemodynamic stability. During transport, all vital signs should be closely monitored and resuscitation measures continued. If performed quickly within a well-structured environment and by a well-organised trauma team, CT seems to be safe, feasible and justified, even in severely injured haemodynamically unstable patients. Among haemodynamically unstable haemoperitoneum patients, 17.2% had no documented intraperitoneal injury and over half of the patients were treated without emergent surgical intervention.

### Making paracentesis safer: a proposal for the use of bedside abdominal and vascular ultrasonography to prevent a fatal complication [^112UXpKo]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Paracentesis has been considered a relatively safe procedure; however, hemorrhagic complications do occur and can be fatal, especially in the context of coagulopathy. We describe the case of a 47-year-old man with coagulopathy secondary to end-stage liver disease, whose hospital course was complicated by paracentesis-related hemoperitoneum leading to abdominal compartment syndrome. Emergent laparotomy revealed left inferior epigastric artery laceration caused by paracentesis. Despite operative control of bleeding, postoperatively, the patient developed severe metabolic acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and ultimately died from complications of hemorrhagic shock. Understanding key anatomic structures is essential for patient safety in the setting of paracentesis. While recognizing the lack of clinical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of ultrasonography use in paracentesis, we discuss the benefit of bedside abdominal ultrasonography to locate ascites and avoid intraabdominal structures, as well as vascular ultrasonography, during needle insertion to avoid abdominal wall vessels.

### Challenges in diagnosis and management of hemobilia [^111dqED1]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Hemobilia, or hemorrhage within the biliary system, is an uncommon form of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding that presents unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Most cases are the result of iatrogenic trauma, although accidental trauma and a variety of inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic processes have also been implicated. Timely diagnosis can often be difficult, as the classic triad of upper GI hemorrhage, biliary colic, and jaundice is present in a minority of cases, and there may be considerable delay in the onset of bleeding after the initial injury. Therefore, the radiologist must maintain a high index of suspicion for this condition and be attuned to its imaging characteristics across a variety of modalities. CT is the first-line diagnostic modality in evaluation of hemobilia, while catheter angiography and endoscopy play vital and complementary roles in both diagnosis and treatment. The authors review the clinical manifestations and multimodality imaging features of hemobilia, describe the wide variety of underlying causes, and highlight key management considerations. © RSNA, 2021.

### Predictors and pathways of in-hospital mortality in active vascular contrast extravasation detected on abdominopelvic CT [^111hGCLV]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Active vascular contrast extravasation (AVCE) is a critical CT finding, often requiring emergent treatment. First reported in 1989, AVCE manifests as a focal collection of contrast material adjacent to injured organs with high-attenuated hemoperitoneum. Subsequent investigations consistently underscore the importance of AVCE and the reliability of CT in diagnosing and localizing AVCE. The benefits of CT include rapid acquisition, noninvasiveness, and precise localization of bleeding sites, aiding in treatment selection and procedural planning. Given the prominence of nonsurgical interventions like transarterial embolization (TAE) and endoscopy in managing abdominopelvic bleeding, understanding prognostic factors is imperative. Our retrospective study aimed to identify clinical and CT-based factors associated with in-hospital mortality in adults with AVCE on abdominopelvic CT. Recognizing these factors informs acute management decisions, potentially reducing morbidity and mortality. By elucidating the pathways to death in patients with AVCE, valuable insights into the complexity of bleeding-related deaths are gained. Healthcare providers can anticipate and manage potential complications, tailoring treatment strategies effectively. These pathways may inform clinical decision-making and resource allocation, thereby optimizing patient care.

### Quantity of hemoperitoneum is associated with need for intervention in patients with stable blunt splenic injury [^111Th9ut]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In patients with hemodynamically stable BSI, there is still uncertainty as to which patient and clinical factors may prompt the need for intervention with angiography and embolization or result in a failed trial of NOM. The results of this study demonstrate that quantity of HP is independently associated with intervention, which suggests that quantity of HP should be used to optimize NOM. We also identified additional variables that were associated with intervention, including AAST grade, splenic vascular injury, and older age; these variables have previously been shown to be associated with higher fNOM rates. Our study confirms the association of these variables as a marker of worse splenic injury and identifies that volume of HP is an additional factor that may guide placement of these patients in the ICU and earlier intervention to maximize splenic preservation.

These results suggest that hospital and national guidelines would benefit from incorporating quantity of HP into their algorithms. Currently, only the EAST guidelines use moderate or large HP in the guidelines; none of our institution's guidelines consider quantity of HP in their algorithms. In general, there is little consensus on the importance of presence and quantity of HP on splenic management. In a survey of 30 expert trauma surgeons and interventional radiologists from around the world, the survey results were as follows: with low grade I-II injuries, small HP are managed with observation. If the HP is large, then 50% say to perform SAE and 42% say to do operation. For grade III-IV injuries, small HP are managed with observation, unless there is contrast extravasation, then they are managed with SAE more than 50% of the time. If the HP is large, then there is no consensus on optimal splenic management.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^115y339N]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Some authors have shown the benefit of contrast medium enhanced CT scanning. Anderson and colleagues found high accuracy in the evaluation of splenic injuries resulting from trauma after administration of intravenous contrast material. Delayed phase CT may be used to detect active bleeding in solid organs. Fang and colleagues demonstrated that the pooling of contrast material within the peritoneal cavity in blunt liver injuries indicates active and massive bleeding. Patients with this finding showed rapid deterioration of haemodynamic status and most of them required emergent surgery. Intraparenchymal pooling of contrast material with an unruptured liver capsule often indicates a self-limited haemorrhage, and these patients respond well to non-operative treatment.

Compared with MSCT, all traditional techniques of diagnostic and imaging evaluation are associated with some limitations. The diagnostic accuracy, safety and effectiveness of immediate MSCT are dependent on sophisticated pre-hospital treatment by trained and experienced emergency personnel and short transportation times. If an MSCT is not available in the emergency room, the realisation of CT scanning implies transportation of the patient to the CT room, and therefore the clinician must evaluate the implications and potential risks and benefits of the procedure. During transport, all vital signs should be closely monitored and resuscitation measures continued. For those patients in whom haemodynamic stability is questionable, imaging techniques such as ultrasound and chest and pelvic radiography may be useful. Peritoneal lavage is rarely indicated if ultrasound or CT is available. Transfer times to and from all forms of diagnostic imaging need to be considered carefully in any patient who is haemodynamically unstable. In addition to the initial clinical assessment, near patient testing results, including full blood count, haematocrit (Hct), blood gases and lactate, should be readily available under ideal circumstances.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^112w2AGK]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound — bedside ultrasound, such as the eFAST, can be used in the initial evaluation of stable and unstable patients with projectile injuries to evaluate the pericardium for fluid and identify possible tamponade, but with penetrating injuries false negatives can occur due to blood decompressing into the hemithorax; ultrasound can identify intraabdominal fluid yet cannot discern specific injuries, and in penetrating trauma the sensitivity for intraabdominal fluid may be as low as 43 percent, so ultrasound cannot rule out abdominal injury of the abdomen and often does not change acute management.

For evaluation, "Consider using eFAST for the initial evaluation of stable and unstable patients with projectile injuries to evaluate the pericardium for fluid and tamponade"; "Radiographs can be useful to identify the course or location of a projectile, but have little use in management of stab wounds"; and "MDCT for penetrating trauma plays a key role in selective nonoperative management and evaluation of back or flank wounds".

Diagnostics

FAST

The primary goal in the initial management of abdominal trauma is to detect and treat life-threatening injuries, in the majority of cases bleeding-related, as quickly as possible. The method of choice for rapid evaluation of the abdomen for free fluid is the Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma (FAST). In European trauma centers, sonography has replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage as the primary screening test for intra-abdominal hemorrhage. FAST can be performed simultaneously with resuscitation efforts during the initial trauma management and only takes 2 minutes to perform. For this reason, it also is useful in hemodynamically unstable patients. FAST is especially useful for detecting the presence or absence of a hemoperitoneum, a herald of significant organ injury with a sensitivity of 90–93%. However, FAST has a low sensitivity for detecting and grading splenic injury. Injuries to bowel and mesentery without hemoperitoneum and retroperitoneal hematomas also may be missed by FAST. In addition to this, FAST is unable to detect the presence of active hemorrhage. For patients who are hemodynamically stable, a FAST detecting hemoperitoneum should lead to a CT scan for further evaluation of the nature and extent of injury.

When the FAST is negative for hemoperitoneum, debate exists regarding whether a CT scan is required. Estimates for the presence of intra-abdominal injuries in the absence of hemoperitoneum on FAST can be as high as 29%.

Most trauma centers that use FAST as a primary screening modality rely on the assumption that any missed injuries are low-grade lesions without serious clinical consequence. However, some studies demonstrated that the use of FAST examination as a screening tool for blunt abdominal injury in the hemodynamically stable trauma patient results in underdiagnoses of intra-abdominal injuries. Routine CT scan frequently reveals additional injuries, which results in a change of treatment in 6.4–16% of these patients. This may have an impact on treatment and outcome in trauma patients. Therefore, hemodynamically stable patients with a negative FAST and a high clinical suspicion for splenic injury, for example, a seat belt sign or upper abdominal pain, should undergo routine CT scanning.

### Spontaneous hemoperitoneum in a 29-week pregnancy with a history of endometriosis: a case report and review of the literature [^111qpeW3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease that affects at least 10% of women in reproductive age. Although it is known as one of the causes of infertility, it is also associated with negative pregnancy outcomes. Miscarriage, preterm birth, placenta‐associated complications (pre‐eclampsia, abruptio placenta, and placenta previa), hemorrhage, acute abdomen (spontaneous uro‐hemoperitoneum, uterine rupture, and bowel perforation), fetal dystocia, stillbirth, and cesarean delivery are among these negative outcomes. Endometriosis was shown to be present in 71% of spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy (SHIP) cases.SHIP is defined as sudden, nontraumatic intraperitoneal bleeding that occurs during pregnancy or up to 42 days postpartum. The incidence ranges between 4 and 4.9 per 100 000 births. Although seen rarely, it is associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality due to maternal hemodynamic instability. Pregnancies in women older than 35, previous history of abdominal surgery, use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) for conception, multiple pregnancy, and endometriosis are some of the known risk factors for SHIP.SHIP is most commonly encountered during the second half of pregnancy and necessitates emergency surgical intervention. This often results in high neonatal mortality rates secondary to preterm birth. Due to its nonspecific clinical presentation, including symptoms such as abdominal pain, signs of hypovolemic shock, and fetal distress, the final diagnosis is typically established intraoperatively. Despite its rare occurrence, early diagnosis and appropriate management are of utmost significance, given its potential to be a life‐threatening condition.

In this study, we present the case of a 30‐year‐old 29‐week pregnant patient with a history of endometriosis surgery who was admitted to our emergency department with SHIP.

### Conservative treatment of spontaneous intraperitoneal hemorrhage in severe dengue: a case report and review [^113wkFNs]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Dengue fever is a common arboviral illness that can result in severe hemorrhagic complications, although spontaneous intraperitoneal bleeding remains rare. We report the case of a 26-year-old previously healthy female who presented with a 4-day history of high-grade fever and myalgia that was later diagnosed as dengue fever. During hospitalization, she developed vaginal bleeding followed by generalized abdominal pain and shock. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed significant hemoperitoneum, despite a normal coagulation profile and no identifiable bleeding source. She was managed conservatively with supportive care and made a full recovery. A 1-year follow-up was unremarkable. This case underscores the importance of early recognition, prompt imaging, and consideration of differential diagnoses. In the absence of established guidelines for managing spontaneous intraperitoneal hemorrhage in dengue, individualized conservative treatment may be effective. Clinicians should remain vigilant for atypical presentations to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate management.

### Exsanguination in trauma: a review of diagnostics and treatment options [^114pyhdf]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Trauma patients with haemorrhagic shock who only transiently respond or do not respond to fluid therapy and/or the administration of blood products have exsanguinating injuries. Recognising shock due to (exsanguinating) haemorrhage in trauma is about constructing a synthesis of trauma mechanism, injuries, vital signs and the therapeutic response of the patient. The aim of prehospital care of bleeding trauma patients is to deliver the patient to a facility for definitive care within the shortest amount of time by rapid transport and minimise therapy to what is necessary to maintain adequate vital signs. Rapid decisions have to be made using regional trauma triage protocols that have incorporated patient condition, transport times and the level of care than can be performed by the prehospital care providers and the receiving hospitals. The treatment of bleeding patients is aimed at two major goals: stopping the bleeding and restoration of the blood volume. Fluid resuscitation should allow for preservation of vital functions without increasing the risk for further (re)bleeding. To prevent further deterioration and subsequent exsanguinations 'permissive hypotension' may be the goal to achieve. Within the hospital, a sound trauma team activation system, including the logistic procedure as well as activation criteria, is essential for a fast and adequate response. After determination of haemorrhagic shock, all efforts have to be directed to stop the bleeding in order to prevent exsanguinations. A simultaneous effort is made to restore blood volume and correct coagulation. Reversal of coagulopathy with pharmacotherapeutic interventions may be a promising concept to limit blood loss after trauma. Abdominal ultrasound has replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage for detection of haemoperitoneum. With the development of sliding-gantry based computer tomography diagnostic systems, rapid evaluation by CT-scanning of the trauma patient is possible during resuscitation. The concept of damage control surgery, the staged approach in treatment of severe trauma, has proven to be of vital importance in the treatment of exsanguinating trauma patients and is adopted worldwide. When performing 'blind' transfusion or 'damage control resuscitation', a predetermined fixed ratio of blood components may result in the administration of higher plasma and platelets doses and may improve outcome. The role of thromboelastography and thromboelastometry as point-of-care tests for coagulation in massive blood loss is emerging, providing information about actual clot formation and clot stability, shortly (10min) after the blood sample is taken. Thus, therapy guided by the test results will allow for administration of specific coagulation factors that will be depleted despite administration with fresh frozen plasma during massive transfusion of blood components.

### Diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage: what you need to know [^112rKvE9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a common cause for hospital admission that requires prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary management to optimize clinical outcomes. Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) includes both upper and lower GI tract sources with an extensive list of differential pathologies. This review provides a systematic approach to both upper and lower GIB management, emphasizing initial resuscitation, stabilization, diagnostic evaluation to identify the source, and treatment modalities. Endoscopy remains the cornerstone for diagnostic and interventional purposes, significantly reducing the need for surgical procedures. However, lower GIB and severe or refractory cases may necessitate additional imaging and interventions, including surgical management. Integrating clinical guidelines, evidence-based strategies, and individualized care, this review delineates what you need to know to diagnose and manage acute GI hemorrhage.

Preoperative phase

The preoperative phase of an ERAS protocol for emergency laparotomy aims to rapidly correct alterations in the patients' physiologic homeostasis. Management of physiological derangement should occur alongside investigation and diagnosis. Surgery is a key component to correction of the underlying pathology and when appropriate should occur without delay. The following evidence-based components should be incorporated into a preoperative pathway of care for each patient undergoing emergency laparotomy. Organization of care to ensure these key components are delivered reliably, by highly skilled personnel, to all patients regardless of location and type of presentation is one of the main challenges to improving care for these high-risk patients.

Diagnosis and treatment

The role of elevated IAP is fundamental in understanding the evolution from IAH to ACS. Basing on the different patients and the setting into which they are admitted the measurement of IAP can be less or more helpful but in any case it remains a cornerstone. Recently Starkopf et al. found that the risk of IAH in mechanically ventilated patients is very low especially if they have a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) < 10 cm H2O, PaO2/FiO2 > 300 and BMI < 30 kg/m2 and without pancreatitis, hepatic failure/cirrhosis with ascites, gastrointestinal bleeding or laparotomy and the use of vasopressor/inotropes at admission. In all those patients with the aforementioned characteristics the measurement of IAP might be considered.

According to the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome 2013 consensus guidelines, IAP should be measured when there are at least 2 known risk factor for IAH/ACS in critically ill or injured patients. Serial measurements should be performed during the patient's critical illness, preferably every 4–6 h. To measure the IAP the bladder pressure is considered the gold standard and should be taken at end-expiration with the patient supine and the transducer zeroed at the midaxillary line after an instillation of saline into the bladder. Another option available, if the bladder pressure is contraindicated (due to a constitutive augmented bladder pressure, e.g. in pelvic hematoma), is the measurement with the stomach technique. Moreover exist the possibility to measure the intra-abdominal pressure via rectal, vaginal, inferior vena cava and direct intra-peritoneal measurement.

In treating patients with IAH, key principles include: optimization of systemic perfusion and organ function, institution of specific medical procedures to reduce IAP, and prompt surgical decompressive laparotomy for refractory IAH. Great emphasis has been placed on prevention, with early, prompt haemostatic control, aggressive balancing of resuscitation to include abundant coagulation factors. Tailoring the response for individual patients is essential to ensure that optimal outcomes are achieved. Further measures to alleviate IAH include sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade can be used to decrease IAP. Is it has been shown that persistent IAH of > 18 mmHg is an independent cause of renal failure in general surgical patients admitted to ICU.

When employing early goal-directed fluid resuscitation is crucial to remember that correction of hypovolemia must be balanced carefully to avoid an iatrogenic secondary abdominal compartment syndrome. The keys in the end are prompt return to status quo, hemorrhage control, eradication of sepsis, removal of fluid either by percutaneous catheter drainage and finally decompression.

Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) — contraindications, risks, and benefits are outlined as follows: Contraindications (Absolute or Relative) include hemodynamic instability defined by most studies as systolic pressure < 90 mm Hg, a clear indication for immediate celiotomy such as frank peritonitis, hemorrhagic shock, or evisceration, known or obvious intra-abdominal injury, posterior penetrating trauma with high likelihood of bowel injury, and limited laparoscopic expertise. Risks include delay to definitive treatment, missed injuries with their associated morbidity, and procedure- and anesthesia-related complications. Benefits include reduction in the rate of negative and nontherapeutic laparotomies (with a subsequent decrease in hospitalization, morbidity, and cost after negative laparoscopy), accurate identification of diaphragmatic injury, and ability to provide therapeutic intervention.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms [^114ST36d]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Visceral artery aneurysms — natural history, rupture risk, and general management: Splenic artery aneurysms are thought to have a particular tendency toward rupture, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy, and visceral artery pseudoaneurysms certainly have a higher rupture potential than true aneurysms. There is no firm evidence that calcification in a visceral artery aneurysm protects against a risk of rupture, and when rupture occurs it can involve the peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneal space, gastrointestinal tract, or biliary tract, with free rupture into the peritoneal cavity resulting in hemoperitoneum often termed abdominal apoplexy and it may also be manifested with life-threatening gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Although not directed by randomized prospective trials, general principles of management of visceral artery aneurysms do exist; because of their potential for rupture, most visceral artery pseudoaneurysms, mycotic aneurysms, and many larger true aneurysms warrant intervention, and treatment can generally be accomplished by either open surgical or endovascular approaches. The treatment goal is to prevent aneurysm expansion and potential rupture by exclusion from the arterial circulation while maintaining necessary distal or collateral bed perfusion; in areas of the visceral circulation with an abundance of collateral flow, for example, in the splenic artery, proximal and distal ligation of the aneurysm segment is a viable surgical option, and endovascular isolation can be achieved either by placement of a stent graft or by coil embolization of the proximal and distal arterial segment. The preferred treatment of an individual patient and aneurysm must be carefully based on the particular anatomy and any associated clinical conditions as well as the underlying condition of the patient, and the purpose of these guidelines is to inform the diagnosis, treatment options, screening, and follow-up of visceral aneurysms based on the available published literature and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^114PbZ2A]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In haemodynamically stable patients, a negative FAST without a CT scan may result in missed intra-abdominal injuries and should direct further diagnostic investigations. A number of patients who present with free intra-abdominal fluid according to ultrasound can safely undergo further investigation using multislice CT (MSCT). Under normal circumstances, adult patients need to be haemodynamically stable when MSCT is performed outside of the emergency department. Haemodynamically stable patients with a high-risk mechanism of injury, such as high-energy trauma, or even low-energy injuries in elderly individuals, should be scanned after ultrasound for additional injuries using MSCT. As CT scanners are integrated into resuscitation units, WBCT diagnosis may replace ultrasound as a diagnostic method. In haemodynamically unstable blunt-trauma patients with clear physical findings on examination, the decision to perform exploratory laparotomy should not be discouraged by a negative FAST.

Follow-up sonography as part of secondary or tertiary surveys in patients without abdominal parenchymal organ lesions or free intra-abdominal fluid on initial WBCT is not routinely required, but should be performed if indicated on a clinical or laboratory basis due to its rapid and non-invasive character. New ultrasound techniques using second-generation contrast agents [contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)] have been developed, allowing all of the vascular phase to be performed in real time, increasing ultrasound capability to detect parenchymal injuries, enhancing some qualitative findings, such as lesion extension, margins and its relationship with capsule and vessels. These techniques are currently under investigation.

Computed tomography (CT)

The advantages of MSCT, including WBCT, among severely injured patients in time savings, diagnostic accuracy and potentially also survival have been documented. The integration of modern MSCT scanners in the emergency department area prompts immediate assessment of any trauma victim likely to survive the assessment following admission, thereby allowing timely diagnosis, differentiation between various types of major vascular injury, identification of associated findings, specific localisation of the source of bleeding and planning for bleeding control. A 1-year review of early management of pelvic fracture patients documented a significant delay in the recognition of (major) pelvic fractures, including those associated with hip dislocations and (potential) pelvic bleeding with selective pelvic X-ray versus CT scanning. More than one third of patients with thoracic stab wounds presented with negative chest X-ray, but pathologies using CT.

### Primary omental pregnancy after in vitro fertilization complicated by hemoperitoneum-how to manage it laparoscopically [^112kdVoL]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To report an uncommon case of primary OP treated laparoscopically. Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is the leading cause of maternal mortality during the first trimester and the incidence increases with assisted reproductive techniques, occurring in approximately 1.5%-2.1% of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. 1 Omental pregnancy (OP) is an extremely rare form of EP accounting for less than 1% of all EPs. OP can be classified as primary or secondary on the basis of Studdiford's criteria 2. The preoperative diagnosis of OP is complex and usually occur in acute circumstances during a throughout intraoperative evaluation of the abdomen. 3–5 A delayed diagnosis poses a serious threat to the survival of the patient; therefore, it is important to remark that EP can exist in unusual locations and prompt surgical intervention may be necessary.

Design

A step-by-step narrated video of a rare clinical case and description of the surgical procedure.

Setting

Tertiary Level Academic Hospital "IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero - Universitaria di Bologna" Bologna, Italy.

Patient

A 36-year-old woman was referred to our emergency room because of acute abdominal pain and nausea for 2 hours with no signs of hemodynamic instability. The patient also complained that poor vaginal bleeding appeared during the last 24 hours. The patient has undergone a cycle of in vitro fertilization with an elective single frozen embryo transfer of a blastocyst on day 5, 2 months before. She had no relevant clinical or surgical history. Diffuse abdominal tenderness and a painful uterus at mobilization were appreciated at clinical examination. A massive hemoperitoneum was diagnosed using transvaginal-transabdominal ultrasound, and no uterine or adnexal lesions were identified. The β-human chronic gonadotropin level was 43.861 mIU/mL, and the hemoglobin value was 10.5 g/dL.

Interventions

On suspicion of a ruptured EP, after detailed counseling and the acquisition of informed consent, a laparoscopic exploration was planned. First, the hemoperitoneum was evacuated to allow visualization of the abdominal cavity. At pelvic inspection, no EP was found. Throughout the exploration of the abdominal cavity, a 4-cm bluish cystic mass of friable consistency was detected infiltrating the omentum and the mesentery. According to Studdiford's criteria, the diagnosis of a primary OP was established. A careful and complete excision of the ectopic implant was performed with an ultrasonic system and required a considerable hemostatic effort using bipolar energy, endoscopic clips, and mechanical compression. The postoperative course was uneventful. The β-human chronic gonadotropin levels gradually decreased to negative values within 29 days after surgery.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Omental ectopic pregnancy can be successfully managed with a laparoscopic approach even in an emergency setting.

Conclusion

Omental pregnancy can easily be overlooked, even by skilled surgeons, during laparoscopic exploration. It is mandatory that all peritoneal surfaces and the omentum be carefully inspected during surgery in patients without other signs of pelvic EP. We confirm that the patient included in this video gave consent for publication of the video and posting of the video online, including on social media, the journal website, scientific literature websites, and other applicable sites.

TABLE 1
Summary of cases with spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy.

TABLE 2
Demographic and clinic characteristics of patients with spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy.

In a prospective population‐based cohort study conducted by Mazzacco et al.in Italy, it was reported that at the time of hospital admission abdominal pain was present in 89.6% of SHIP patients, hypotensive symptoms in 27.6%, hypovolemic shock in 24.1%, and fetal distress in 37.9%. The differential diagnosis includes conditions involving extra‐pelvic structures such as traumatic splenic artery and vein bleeding, splenic and hepatic injury, and ovarian artery rupture. Additionally, cases involving uterine rupture and placental abruption, which present with abdominal pain and fetal distress, can also lead to massive bleeding. Challenges in early diagnosis arise from symptoms that are non‐specific and can mimic other conditions. A comprehensive review of current literature suggests that early assessment of these patients, manifesting hemodynamic instability or fetal bradycardia, warrants emergency laparotomy without delay for imaging methods. In instances where hemodynamic stability and fetal well‐being are confirmed through imaging modalities such as ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging, the application of minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopy and artery embolization facilitates the continuation of pregnancy and might even prevent complications in newborns resulting from preterm births. Given the presence of symptoms such as back and abdominal pain, hypotensive symptoms, and later, the manifestation of fetal distress after initial follow‐up in our patient, a definitive diagnosis was established following explorative laparotomy. However, diagnostic imaging modalities could be used in cases lacking hemodynamic instability and reassuring fetal well‐being. Expectant management could then be considered as an alternative option, aiming to reduce urgent C‐section rates and mitigate negative neonatal outcomes.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^116M7uCq]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The hypotensive patient (systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg) presenting free intra-abdominal fluid according to ultrasonography or CT is a potential candidate for early surgical intervention if he or she cannot be stabilised by initiated fluid resuscitation. A retrospective study by Rozycki and colleagues of 1540 patients (1227 blunt, 313 penetrating trauma) assessed with ultrasound as an early diagnostic tool showed that the ultrasound examination had a sensitivity and specificity close to 100% when patients were hypotensive.

A number of patients who present with free intra-abdominal fluid according to ultrasound can safely undergo further investigation using MSCT. Under normal circumstances, adult patients need to be haemodynamically stable when MSCT is performed outside of the emergency room. Haemodynamically stable patients with a high-risk mechanism of injury, such as high-energy trauma or even low-energy injuries in elderly individuals, should be scanned after ultrasound for additional injuries using MSCT. As CT scanners are integrated in resuscitation units, whole-body CT diagnosis may replace ultrasound as a diagnostic method.

MSCT is the gold standard for the identification of retroperitoneal haemorrhage (RPH). After injection of i.v. contrast solution, CT identified RPH in all cases (100%) and may show the source of bleeding (40%) by extravasation of contrast media.

Haemodynamically unstable patients with significant intrathoracic, intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding may need urgent intervention. In these cases with thoracic trauma and chest bleeding the insertion of a chest tube is the first surgical step, usually just prior to acute damage control thoracotomy. Surgical bleeding control is necessary in unstable patients presenting with haemoperitoneum. Patients with pelvic trauma and significant retroperitoneal haematoma may need external compression, retroperitoneal packing or urgent radiologic embolisation for pelvic haemorrhage control.

Haemoglobin

Recommendation 10

We recommend that a low initial Hb be considered an indicator for severe bleeding associated with coagulopathy. (Grade 1B)

We recommend the use of repeated Hb measurements as a laboratory marker for bleeding, as an initial Hb value in the normal range may mask bleeding. (Grade 1B)

Spontaneous hemoperitoneum is an uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain. When it occurs, it may be catastrophic. There are a myriad of causes for spontaneous hemoperitoneum and an underlying cause should always be looked for if the patient survives the initial event. This article describes the imaging findings of spontaneous hemoperitoneum and discusses the relative merits of multiple imaging modalities used for the diagnosis of the hemoperitoneum and an underlying cause. In addition, we outline the etiology of spontaneous hemoperitoneum, which includes hepatic, splenic, gynecologic, and vascular causes, and bleeding disorders.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^11424WXT]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Some authors have shown the benefit of contrast medium-enhanced CT scanning. Anderson et al. found high accuracy in the evaluation of splenic injuries resulting from trauma after administration of intravenous (i.v.) contrast material. Delayed-phase CT may be used to detect active bleeding in solid organs. Fang et al. demonstrated that the pooling of contrast material within the peritoneal cavity in blunt liver injuries indicates active and massive bleeding. Patients with this finding showed rapid deterioration of haemodynamic status, and most required emergent surgery. Intraparenchymal pooling of contrast material with an unruptured liver capsule often indicates a self-limited haemorrhage, and these patients respond well to non-operative treatment. Tan and colleagues found that patients with hollow viscus and mesenteric injuries following blunt abdominal trauma exhibited an abnormal preoperative CT scan. Wu et al. showed the accuracy of CT in identifying severe, life-threatening mesenteric haemorrhage and blunt bowel injuries.

Compared to MSCT, all traditional techniques for diagnostic and imaging evaluation are associated with some limitations. The diagnostic accuracy, safety and effectiveness of immediate MSCT are dependent on sophisticated pre-hospital treatment by trained and experienced emergency personnel and short transportation times. If an MSCT is not available in the emergency room, the realisation of CT scanning implies transportation of the patient to the CT room, therefore the clinician must evaluate the implications and potential risks and benefits of the procedure. During transport, all vital signs should be closely monitored and resuscitation measures continued. For those patients in whom haemodynamic stability is questionable, imaging techniques such as ultrasound and chest and pelvic radiography may be useful. Peritoneal lavage is rarely indicated if ultrasound or CT are available. Transfer times to and from all forms of diagnostic imaging need to be considered carefully in any patient who is haemodynamically unstable. In addition to the initial clinical assessment, point-of-care testing results, including full blood count, haematocrit (Hct), blood gases, and lactate, should be readily available under ideal circumstances.

### Delayed laparoscopic peritoneal washout in non-operative management of blunt abdominal trauma: a scoping review [^113F3MES]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Existing literature reporting on DLPW after non-operative management of blunt abdominal trauma is limited primarily to retrospective observational data. These studies support the use of DLPW in patients managed non-operatively who go on to develop SIRS features or significant abdominal symptoms. Its use should thus be considered in patients suspected of developing post-trauma intra-abdominal complications. In particular, the use of DLPW in bile leaks and large volume hemoperitoneum appears to appropriately control the systemic inflammatory response, improve clinical symptoms, and possibly reduce length of stay with good mortality outcomes. Despite limited evidence, its use has been incorporated into popular management guidelines. There are substantial gaps in the literature regarding DLPW in this population due to quality and level of evidence. These are opportunities for future prospective and interventional research.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^115aGCkE]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Focused Assessment Sonography in Trauma (FAST) — in hemodynamically unstable trauma patients, FAST is performed to detect intraabdominal free fluid suggestive of hemoperitoneum, and a positive FAST allows quick triage to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy; because FAST has high specificity, an unstable trauma patient with a positive FAST goes to the OR. FAST has acceptable sensitivity (69–98 percent) for detection of free fluid and lower sensitivity (63 percent) for detection of solid organ injury, and obtaining serial FAST examinations increases overall sensitivity (72–93 percent). In stable patients, FAST has limited sensitivity for detecting the presence of an injury that might require intervention, and not all injuries detectable by FAST require intervention.

### Spontaneous hemoperitoneum: a practical radiologic review for emergency diagnosis [^117WNMQy]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous hemoperitoneum (SH) is defined as the presence of blood within the peritoneal cavity from a non-traumatic origin. The absence of clinical suspicion and its low frequency render it a challenging diagnosis in the emergency setting. As it is a potentially life-threatening condition, radiologists play a fundamental role in the identification and location of the source of bleed, both essential to be able to deliver the best care possible for the patient. This review article aims to facilitate a practical approach to SH: We will begin by reviewing key imaging modalities of significant value for the detection and characterization of SH. Relevant anatomy and important CT signs to know will be mentioned. We will summarize the potential causes of SH in order of frequency, with a brief mention of differential diagnoses to consider. Finally, we will illustrate this review with a collection of cases from our hospital to showcase relevant diagnoses to consider when facing a patient with SH, focusing on key imaging elements that should not be overlooked.

The failure rate of NOM has been described in multiple reports after 2000 to range between 4 and 12%, with lower incidence in Level I trauma centers. Several risk factors of NOM failure have been reported, including the need for red cell transfusions in the emergency department or during the first 24 h, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels at admission, HIV disease, cirrhosis, and drug addiction. The presence of a blush at CT scan has been considered a risk factor for NOM failure only in studies in which SAE was not adopted, whereas the extension of hemoperitoneum at imaging alone cannot be considered an absolute contraindication for NOM. Higher injury grades and ISS are strictly associated with the risk of NOM failure. Moreover, it has been suggested that age > 55 years could be a risk factor for NOM failure only in high injury grades. Most patients who fail NOM do so within the first 3 days following trauma. However, the time to failure varies considerably. According to Clancy et al. the median time to surgery for patients who failed NOM was 11.2 h.

### Consensus strategies for the nonoperative management of patients with blunt splenic injury: a Delphi study [^116xWocN]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nonoperative management is the standard of care in hemodynamically stable patients with blunt splenic injury. However, a number of issues regarding the management of these patients are still unresolved. The aim of this study was to reach consensus among experts concerning optimal treatment and follow-up strategies.

Methods

The Delphi method was used to reach consensus among 30 expert trauma surgeons and interventional radiologists from around the world. An online survey was used in the two study rounds. Consensus was defined as an agreement of 80% or greater.

Results

Response rates of the first and second rounds were 90% and 80%, respectively. Consensus was reached for 43% of the (sub)questions. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma organ injury scale for grading splenic injury is used by 93% of the experts. In hemodynamically stable patients, observation or splenic artery embolization (SAE) can be applied in the presence of a small or no hemoperitoneum combined with an intraparenchymal contrast extravasation or no contrast extravasation, regardless of the presence of an arteriovenous (AV) fistula/pseudoaneurysm. Hemodynamic instability is an indication for operative management, irrespective of computed tomographic characteristics and grade of splenic injury (≥ 82% of the experts). Operative management is also indicated in the presence of associated intra-abdominal injuries and/or the need for five or more packed red blood cell transfusions (22 of 27 experts, 82%). Recommended time span to start SAE in a stable patient with an intraparenchymal contrast extravasation is 60 minutes (19 of 24 experts). Patients should be admitted 1 to 3 days to a monitored setting (27 of 27 experts, 100%). Serial hemoglobin checks are performed by all experts, every 4 to 6 hours in the first 24 hours and once or twice a day after that (21 of 24 experts, 88%), in nonoperative management as well as after SAE. Routine postdischarge imaging is not indicated (21 of 24 experts, 88%).

Conclusion

Although treatment should always be adjusted to the specific patient, the results of this study may serve as general guidelines.

### Spontaneous hemoperitoneum in a 29-week pregnancy with a history of endometriosis: a case report and review of the literature [^112kLTP2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

3 DISCUSSION

Spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy, despite its rarity in medical practice, has been recognized for its poor maternal and fetal outcomes since the 18th century. It continues to pose challenges in terms of prompt diagnosis and management. For this case, we aimed to present the diagnosis and management of a 29‐week pregnant woman with a history of endometriosis surgery.

In the literature, there are 67 SHIP cases with endometriosis (Table 1). The mean age of the patients was 32.95 ± 4.39, and 68.18% of them were under 35 years of age. In addition, 77.61% of these patients were nulliparous and 14.93% were multiple pregnancies. Those who became pregnant with ART and those who had a history of previous abdominal surgery constituted 41.79% and 52.23% of the patients, respectively. The mean week when SHIP presented was 27.71 ± 7.86, while the week when pregnancy was terminated was calculated as 29.70 ± 7.90. In most cases, the bleeding site was the posterior surface of the uterus. The results together with the patients' initial symptoms, the median amount of bleeding and pregnancy outcomes are shown in Table 2.

The use of CT in the diagnosis and management of liver trauma is responsible for the shift from routine surgical versus non-surgical treatment in the management of traumatic liver injuries, even when they are of high grade. The main cause of complication and of death in liver trauma is related to vascular injury. The goal of this review focussed on the vascular complications of liver trauma is to describe the elementary lesions shown by CT in liver trauma including laceration, parenchymal hematoma and contusions, partial devascularisation, subcapsular hematomas, hemoperitoneum, active bleeding, pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery, bile leak, and periportal oedema, to illustrate the possible pitfalls in CT diagnosis of liver trauma and to underline the key-points which may absolutely be present in a CT report of liver trauma. Then we will remind the grading system based on the CT features and we will analyze the interest and limitations of such grading systems. Last we will discuss the diagnostic strategy at the early phase in patients with suspected liver trauma according to their clinical conditions and underline the conditions of arterial embolization, and then we will discuss the diagnosis strategy at the delayed phase according to the suspected complications.

### Quantity of hemoperitoneum is associated with need for intervention in patients with stable blunt splenic injury [^1117EiM1]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Greater quantity of hemoperitoneum was associated with increased odds of intervention with SAE or failing a trial of NOM, with no difference in risk for moderate versus large HP. These findings support inclusion of HP into the algorithm for management of BSI by EAST. Furthermore, WTA and WSES guidelines could be altered to include moderate and large hemoperitoneum into their indications for SAE. Knowledge that moderate and large HP increased the odds for SAE and fNOM will assist the trauma surgeon in their decision-making process at the bedside. Thus, moderate or large quantity HP should incorporated as a consideration for angiography and/or embolization to maximize splenic preservation and reduce the risk of splenic rupture.

### Blunt abdominal trauma: imaging and intervention [^113ngUYK]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Interventional radiology, particularly percutaneous angioembolization, plays an important role in the management of blunt abdominal trauma involving solid organs and pelvic fractures. The traumatic injuries of the central nervous system, heart, and great vessels often lead to death at the site of trauma. Although patients with visceral organ injuries can also die at the site of trauma, these patients often reach the hospital thus giving us an opportunity to treat them with surgical or radiological intervention depending on the clinical condition of the patient. The management of these patients with trauma is now well codified-patients who remain unstable despite resuscitation should be shifted either to an operating room for laparotomy if the ultrasound (US) revealed hemoperitoneum or to a interventional room for angioembolization in cases of pelvic fractures. In all other cases, computed tomography is essential. Currently, multidetector computed tomography with contrast is the gold standard imaging modality for the diagnosis of traumatic abdominal injuries; it helps in assessing the extent of injuries, and further management can be planned.

### Grade III blunt splenic injury without contrast extravasation-World Society of Emergency Surgery nijmegen consensus practice [^112tJPHW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The spleen is the most commonly injured solid organ in blunt abdominal trauma and contributes to worldwide trauma associated mortality and morbidity. Over the last 30 thirty years, there has been a prominent shift towards a more conservative approach in the management of splenic injury, with an emphasis on the preservation of splenic parenchyma and function. Indeed, current data suggests up to 90% of patients with splenic injury can be treated non-operatively, boasting a success rate of over 80% in avoiding surgical intervention. This shift was aided by haemostatic resuscitation, enhanced diagnostic, monitoring facilities and advances in the field of interventional radiology with selective or non-selective splenic artery angioembolisation. As a result, patients have benefited from lower mortality rates, shorter hospital stays and decreased burden of post-splenectomy complications.

High level evidence for management of splenic injury is limited, and guidelines necessarily rely on studies with less than optimal design. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grading (herein referred upon as grade) and the presence of contrast extravasation on computed tomography (CT) (henceforth referred upon as blush) play an important role in planning the management of splenic injuries. While the management of splenic injury with blush and/or grade IV-V splenic injuries is supported by studies on large databases, the management of grade III injury without blush is not supported by large cohort studies. As a result, previous attempts to gain consensus on the management of this specific injury pattern have consistently failed. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines indicate such injury not warranting angiography/angioembolisation. Nevertheless, a high rate of practice variation hinders management of grade III splenic lesions. This can be also confounded by factors like patient age, associated injury, presence of haemoperitoneum, co-morbidities and overall injury severity.

We hypothesized that experienced clinicians would meet consensus on areas of clinical variation regarding the management of grade III blunt splenic injuries without CT blush when presented with a clinically relevant hypothetical scenario. A modified Delphi questionnaire was utilised in the form of a phone application, with the aim to obtain expert opinion and enhance effective decision-making in the management of grade III blunt splenic injury without blush.

### The lipliner sign: potential cause of a false positive focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) examination [^112jL3xY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) examination plays an essential role in diagnosing hemoperitoneum in trauma patients to guide prompt operative management. The FAST examination is highly specific for hemoperitoneum in trauma patients, and has been adopted in nontrauma patients to identify intraperitoneal fluid as a cause of abdominal pain or distension. However, causes of false positive FAST examinations have been described and require prompt recognition to avoid diagnostic uncertainty and inappropriate procedures. Most causes of false positive FAST examinations are due to anatomic mimics such as perinephric fat or seminal vesicles, however, modern ultrasound machines use a variety of postprocessing image enhancement techniques that can also lead to novel false positive artifacts.

Case Report

We report cases where experienced clinicians incorrectly interpreted ultrasound findings caused by a novel mimic of hemoperitoneum: the "lipliner sign". It appears most prominently at the edges of solid organs (such as the liver and the spleen), which is the same location most likely to show free fluid in FAST examination in trauma patients. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Clinicians who take care of trauma patients must be familiar with causes of false positive FAST examinations that could lead to a misdiagnosis of hemoperitoneum.

### Massive recurrent hemoperitoneum with encapsulating peritonitis: another enigmatic clinical feature of endometriosis [^115xQRZe]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical characteristics and laparoscopic findings of a very uncommon presentation of a patient with endometriosis.

Design

Video presentation of case report (Canadian Task Force classification III). (The institutional review board of the Hospital Naval Pedro Mallo, Buenos Aires, Argentina, has ruled that approval was not required for the publication of this case report.) SETTING: Hospital.

Patient(S)

Thirty-two-year-old woman with endometriosis presenting with hemorrhagic ascites.

Intervention(S)

We demonstrate the laparoscopic appearance of the peritoneal organs in the presence of massive hemoperitoneum and encapsulating peritonitis and also describe the diagnosis and management options of an uncommon clinical presentation of endometriosis. The patient is a 32-year-old woman, gravida 0, who presented with abdominal pain and ascites. Initially, she underwent exploratory laparotomy with drainage of 5 liters of ascites and excision of endometrial peritoneal implants. She then presented 4 months later with sudden worsening abdominal pain and distention, weight gain, bloating, and shortness of breath. A diagnostic laparoscopy was performed with the findings of over 10 liters of dark hemoperitoneum and diffuse pelviperitonitis with loose necrotic, easy to remove, dense peritoneal tissue. Patient was started on triptorelin acetate with great response.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Resolution of the symptomatology secondary to hemorrhagic peritonitis.

Result(S)

Clinical improvement of symptomatology of a patient with endometriosis and hemorrhagic ascites.

Conclusion(S)

Endometriosis can have different clinical presentations. Endometriosis should be a differential diagnosis in women of reproductive age presenting with massive hemorrhagic ascites. Hemorrhagic ascites, considered an exceedingly rare clinical course of endometriosis, represents a challenge to the surgeon who is unfamiliar with this condition. Bilateral oophorectomy is the definitive treatment, but conservative therapy is indicated for women of childbearing age. Diagnostic laparoscopy with drainage of hemoperitoneum is a feasible option to obtain a pathology-confirmed diagnosis in patients presenting with hemoperitoneum secondary to pelvic endometriosis. Awareness of this condition will prevent unnecessary aggressive resection, as is commonly performed when the condition is confused with ovarian cancer.

### Emergency laparoscopy – current best practice [^116ni8gB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Non-specific abdominal pain

Whilst most patients presenting with abdominal pain will be diagnosed within a short period of assessment, there remains a cohort in whom the clinical picture remains equivocal. In these patients, depending on the severity of their symptoms, laparoscopy plays a role. If patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are relatively less concerning, then a period of observation may allow clarification of a diagnosis or simply cessation of the pain. However in those where observation is not safe, due to the severity of the clinical findings, we advocate diagnostic laparoscopy. The reasons for this are two fold. Firstly, converted-to-open cases have a similar outcome to primary laparotomy, thus minimising potential negative effects of laparoscopy. Secondly, as discussed above, many common pathologies, which may be the underlying cause of the non-specific abdominal pain, are now best managed laparoscopically.

### Literature review of the role of ultrasound, computed tomography, and transcatheter arterial embolization for the treatment of traumatic splenic injuries [^115HnGH8]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Omert et al. have questioned the significance of a contrast blush. They suggested that a contrast blush is not an absolute indication for an operative or angiographic intervention. Factors, such as patient age, grade of injury, and presence of hypotension, need to be considered in the clinical management of these patients.

Splenic embolization has been used successfully in patients with AAST grade 3–5 splenic injuries. Haan et al. published results demonstrating success rates from 87–100% after embolization. Another study demonstrated increases in NOM success rate from 74–89% with embolization in patients with high-grade lesions.

Presence of a large hemoperitoneum predicted failure of NOM in the EAST study and also in a study by Velmahos et al. However, in other studies a significant hemoperitoneum did not affect the success rate. The combination of a contrast blush within the peritoneal cavity and a significant hemoperitoneum indicate active and massive bleeding and predict a high failure rate and thus warrant a low threshold for AE or a splenectomy.

The overall success rate (defined by preservation of the spleen) of splenic embolization ranges from 73–97%, with most studies reporting success rates greater than 90%. Several authors also successfully re-embolized patients in whom initial embolization failed, which further increased the splenic salvage rate. Some studies, in contrast, showed no benefit of splenic artery embolization. A study by Harbrecht et al. concluded that patients who underwent splenic arteriography did not have improved nonoperative splenic salvage rates compared with a contemporaneous control group of similarly injured patients. In two other studies, the authors showed their concern that embolization may be overutilized for blunt splenic injury, resulting in still high failure rates (27%) after embolization. They recommend a low threshold to operate if bleeding persists in an embolized patient who had the combination of a high-grade injury and large hemoperitoneum or contrast blush on CT. Figure 3 depicts our strategy for the diagnostic and therapeutic management.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute blunt abdominal trauma [^114ihVHr]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute blunt abdominal trauma — prospective data on physical examination and hematuria for intra-abdominal injury report that 22/196 (11%) had positive computed tomography (CT) scans, 8/196 (4%) underwent exploratory laparotomy (all CT-positive), and 14/196 (7%) had intra-abdominal injury managed nonoperatively. For physical examination (abdominal tenderness), sensitivity was 82% (CI 60% to 95%), specificity 41% (CI 34% to 49%), positive predictive value (PPV) 15% (CI 9% to 23%), and negative predictive value (NPV) 95% (CI 87% to 99%). For hematuria (> 50 red blood cells/high power field [RBC/HPF]), sensitivity was 65% (CI 41% to 83%), specificity 94% (CI 89% to 97%), PPV 56% (CI 33% to 76%), and NPV 95% (CI 91% to 98%). The outcome standard defined intra-abdominal injury as "potentially serious or life-threatening injury detected by CT or laparotomy or injury that changed management or patient care".

### Updated guideline on diagnosis and treatment of intra-abdominal… [^112BHugS]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Initial Evaluation Routine history, physical examination, and laboratory studies will identify most patients who require further evaluation. Intra-abdominal infection should be considered in patients with unreliable physical examination findings who present with evidence of infection from an undetermined source. Further diagnostic imaging is not necessary in patients with obvious signs of diffuse peritonitis and in whom immediate surgical intervention is required. Computed tomography should be performed to determine whether an intra-abdominal infection is present in adults who are not undergoing immediate laparotomy. Interventions A source control procedure to drain infected foci, control ongoing peritoneal contamination, and restore anatomic and physiologic function is recommended in virtually all patients with intra-abdominal infection.

Emergency surgery should be performed in patients with diffuse peritonitis, even if measures to restore physiologic stability must be continued during the procedure. An urgent approach also should be taken in hemodynamically stable patients without evidence of acute organ failure. However, intervention may be delayed for up to 24 hours in closely monitored patients who have started antimicrobial therapy. Select patients with minimal physiologic derangement and a well-circumscribed focus of infection can be treated with antimicrobial therapy without a source control procedure if close clinical follow-up is possible. In patients with severe peritonitis, relaparotomy is not recommended in the absence of intestinal discontinuity, abdominal fascial loss that prevents abdominal wall closure, or intra-abdominal hypertension.

Necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns is managed with fluid resuscitation, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, and bowel decompression. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapies that may be useful in such cases include ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole; ampicillin, cefotaxime, and metronidazole; or meropenem. Vancomycin may be used instead of ampicillin when MRSA or ampicillin-resistant enterococcal infection is suspected. Antimicrobial therapy with agents effective against facultative and aerobic gram-negative organisms and anaerobic organisms should be initiated in all patients diagnosed with appendicitis. In patients with suspected appendicitis who have equivocal imaging findings, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated in combination with pain medication and antipyretics, if indicated.

Antimicrobial therapy should continue for at least three days in adults, until clinical symptoms and signs of infection resolve or a definitive diagnosis is made.

### Tension pneumoperitoneum: a comprehensive review of etiologies, diagnosis, and management strategies [^117D6ECc]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tension pneumoperitoneum (TPP) is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by free intraperitoneal air causing intra-abdominal hypertension and hemodynamic compromise. It shares physiologic features with abdominal compartment syndrome and requires timely recognition and intervention. This systematic clinical review evaluates the presentation, diagnostic strategies, management approaches, and outcomes associated with TPP.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2004 and 2024. Search terms included "tension pneumoperitoneum", "acute pneumoperitoneum", "surgery", and "needle decompression". Eligible studies included human case reports, case series, and narrative reviews that addressed the pathophysiology, diagnosis, or management of TPP. Duplicates were removed and a two-step screening process was used to identify studies for inclusion. A total of 78 studies were selected, including 57 patient cases for subanalysis.

Results

Of the 57 cases identified, 40 involved adults and 17 involved pediatric patients. The overall survival rate was 84.2% with higher survival observed in the pediatric population (94.1% vs. 80%). Iatrogenic causes were the most common etiology accounting for 56.1% of cases followed by medical (24.6%), traumatic (14%), and idiopathic (5.3%) inciting events. Management strategies included percutaneous decompression alone (26.3%), operative intervention alone (29.8%), combined decompression and surgery (28.1%), and endoscopic management (7%). Non-procedural management was infrequently reported (8.8%).

Discussion

This comprehensive clinical review emphasizes that successful treatment of TPP occurs through early recognition, understanding the variability of precipitating events, and individualized management. Heightened awareness and diagnostic vigilance may decrease delay in diagnosis and minimize associated morbidity and mortality.

### A case of splenic laceration presenting as a delayed complication of colonoscopy [^116FCCLv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Colonoscopy is a frequently performed medical procedure; complications associated with this procedure often present to the emergency department (ED). Splenic laceration is a rare but life-threatening complication of colonoscopy. We report the unique case of a patient with a splenic laceration who presented after a recent colonoscopy and had no history of trauma.

Case Report

A 52-year-old man presented to our ED with abdominal pain and lightheadedness the day after a routine colonoscopy. Ultrasound demonstrated hemoperitoneum, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a large hemoperitoneum with active contrast extravasation from the laceration of the superior pole of the spleen. After resuscitation, the patient was managed with an emergency splenectomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Colonoscopy complications are frequently identified and managed in the ED. Splenic laceration should be on the differential for patients that present with abdominal pain or hypotension after colonoscopy. Splenic injury carries a high mortality risk, and prompt, accurate diagnosis can be lifesaving.

### Managing complicated pancreatitis with more knowledge and a bigger toolbox! [^113Bj6SH]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of local complications

In deciding how to treat peripancreatic fluid collections, necrotic collections, and pseudocysts, two important questions must be addressed: what is the location of the collection(s) and what is the degree of encapsulation? Therefore, prior to any intervention, a present-day pre-procedure multiphase contrast-enhanced CΤ scan of the abdomen should be performed. Early imaging after contrast administration provides an arterial phase that is useful for defining the arterial anatomy and excluding the presence of a pseudaneurysm. The portal venous phase allows for the identification of portal venous anatomy and helps evaluate any associated mesenteric, splenic, or portal vein thrombosis. МRI is a reasonable alternative for patients with an iodine contrast allergy and has been reported to be more accurate than CT in detecting necrotic debris. Strand et al. add that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) should be considered in patients with AP when the etiology remains unexplained after initial evaluation and routine imaging. Over the past 30 years, the surgeon's toolbox for managing local complications of AP has greatly expanded, from a single option of open laparotomy to now include percutaneous catheter-based, endoscopic, and surgical approaches. Surgical options now include robotic and laparoscopic approaches in addition to traditional open operative procedures. In many cases, a combination of these procedures is required. The optimal management of complicated AP requires a surgeon-led multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists, and specialists in critical care medicine, infectious disease, and nutrition. If these resources are not available, consideration should be given to transferring patients with complicated pancreatitis to an appropriate tertiary-care center equipped and staffed to manage such cases. Local complications of AP are associated with a substantial increase in both morbidity and mortality. When infection occurs, as previously mentioned, mortality is doubled. When complicated by hemorrhage, the mortality rate more than triples. The ongoing enzymatic destruction of pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues in NP may involve adjacent blood vessels, such as the splenic artery, gastroduodenal artery, or pancreaticoduodenal arcade, predisposing patients to pseudoaneurysm formation and subsequent hemorrhage. Bleeding complications occur in up to 6% of patients with NP. All surgeons caring for patients with AP must maintain a heightened awareness of this potential complication. A sentinel bleed occurs in 75% of cases and requires immediate action. Prompt recognition, resuscitation with blood products, and emergent angiographic embolization or laparotomy are essential for survival. The decision to proceed to the operating room for hemorrhage control versus angioembolization in the interventional radiology suite depends on the patient's condition, response to resuscitation, and the availability and timely response of the necessary resources. Another indication for emergent invasive intervention in AP is the development of acute abdominal compartment syndrome, which affects 20%–30% of patients with NP, and is associated with mortality rates as high as 50%–75%. A high index of suspicion by the surgeon is critical to early identification and treatment. Avoiding excessive fluid resuscitation is key to reducing the incidence of this complication. Routine monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure in high-risk patients is recommended. Maximal medical management includes achieving a negative fluid balance, confirming adequate enteral decompression with a nasogastric tube, and considering pharmacological paralysis to improve abdominal wall compliance. If, despite these efforts, intravesicular pressure exceeds > 25 cm H 2 O and is accompanied by renal insufficiency or respiratory failure, intervention is required. An urgent bedside ultrasound should be performed to assess the volume of accumulating peritoneal fluid or ascites. If a significant volume is noted, ultrasound-guided percutaneous intraperitoneal catheter placement and drainage should follow. If this approach is ineffective in lowering intra-abdominal pressure, emergent decompressive laparotomy is indicated. The DECOMRESS (Decompressive Laparotomy With Temporary Abdominal Closure Versus Percutaneous Puncture With Placement of Abdominal Catheter in Patient With Abdominal Compartment Syndrome During Acute Pancreatitis) trial, proposed in 2010 to evaluate decompressive laparotomy versus intraperitoneal catheter drainage in AP, has yet to be published. De In 2016, Wang et al. reported that reducing intra-abdominal pressure through percutaneous catheter drainage of early pelvic ascites in patients with severe pancreatitis led to a reduction in intra-abdominal infections, a decreased need for surgical intervention, and shorter hospitalizations. Surgery was traditionally the mainstay of treatment for pancreatic pseudocysts until less invasive modalities emerged as viable alternatives. An important advancement has been the recognition that not all pancreatic pseudocysts require intervention, and most can be treated with supportive measures alone. Intervention is indicated if the patient is symptomatic or if infection or complications are present. For most patients with symptomatic pancreatic pseudocyst abutting the stomach or duodenum, the preferred approach is ΕUЅ-guided transmural drainage rather than surgical drainage, as numerous studies have shown transmural drainage to be equally effective with lower associated morbidity.Ѕurgiϲаl cystgastrostomy is now being performed using the robotic platform, and it may represent a superior alternative. Further studies comparing it with current endoscopic techniques are needed. The surgical management for sterile necrosis has been a point of contention among surgeons for decades. Historically, Senn, in 1886, was the first to propose the surgical removal of necrotic tissue as a treatment for NP. Throughout the first nine decades of the 20th century, surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis remained the standard, with several technical iterations evolving over time. In 1991, Bradley and Allen published their landmark paper, proclaiming that pancreatic necrosis alone, even when accompanied by organ failure, should not be considered an absolute indication for surgery. They proposed that a trial of medical treatment be considered for all patients with sterile pancreatic necrosis. This led to the adoption of medical treatment as the accepted approach for patients with NP with sterile necrosis. Surgical intervention is now reserved for infected necrosis or necrosis associated with other complications. Current guidelines recommend that necrosectomy for sterile necrosis be considered only in specific situations: ongoing organ failure 4 weeks after the onset of disease; gastric, biliary, or intestinal obstruction due to WON; and cases of a disconnected pancreatic duct with ongoing symptoms or a growing pseudocyst. The choice of intervention (endoscopic, robotic, laparoscopic, or open) should be individualised based on multiple factors, including the location and extent of the necrosis, the presence of communication with pancreatic duct, the maturity of the wall, presence of a pancreatic duct stricture or biliary obstruction, the patient's history of previous abdominal surgery, and their hemodynamic status and overall clinical condition. Drainage of infected necrosis/collection, with or without the presence of organ failure, remains the standard of care worldwide. In the 1980s, immediate surgical intervention was emphasized for managing infected necrosis. This frequently entailed multiple trips to the operating room for progressive debridement of the necrosum, daily open packing of the lesser sac, or placement of multiple drains, with both approaches often resulting in pancreatic fistulas. Several important technological advances have significantly contributed to changing our approach. In 1998, Freeny et al first described the use of percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) in NP, reporting a 47% necrosectomy-free survival rate. Today, the dictum has evolved to a delayed approach. The POINTER (Postponed or Immediate Drainage of Infected Necrotizing Pancreatitis) trial, published in 2021, was a multicenter randomized superiority trial in patients with infected NP comparing immediate drainage at the time of diagnosis of infection with delayed drainage, postponed until the stage of WON was reached. These investigators reported no significant difference in mortality or complications between the two cohorts but found that patients in the delayed-drainage group required fewer invasive interventions. This finding is explained by the fact that the delayed-drainage group received antibiotics during the waiting period, and in 39% of cases, antibiotics and catheter drainage alone resolved the need for necrosectomy. Delaying necrosectomy for at least 3–4 weeks allows for liquefaction of the necrotic tissue and maturation of the encapsulation, seemingly making drainage more effective. While PCD has been shown to improve survival, it does not eliminate the risk of pancreatocutaneous fistula. With the advancement of endoscopic techniques, endoscopic drainage is now reported by most authors to be the initial procedure of choice for drainage of walled-off infected collections and symptomatic pseudocysts that are adherent to the stomach or duodenum, as it helps avoid the risk of pancreatocutaneous fistula. Transmural drainage is performed by locating and accessing the collection via an endoscope using radiographic and/or EUS imaging. A tract is then created through the gastric or duodenal wall, followed by the placement of one or more stents (figure 2). If necrosectomy is necessary, the transmural tract allows for evacuation of the necrotic debris through direct endoscopic necrosectomy. Advances in stent technology have progressed from small plastic stents to expandable metal stents, and now to novel lumen-apposing metal stents, which have been shown to markedly reduce complications, including stent occlusion and migration.PCD use is now reserved for cases where endoscopic drainage is either not technically feasible — such as when the necrotic collection is not in close proximity to the gastrointestinal tract — or when patients are too critically ill to tolerate the procedure. It is also used when endoscopic drainage fails to resolve the infected collection, which is often the case when the collection extends into dependent regions like the paracolic gutters or pelvis. In these cases, placing an additional percutaneous drainage catheter into the dependent region should be strongly considered. Percutaneous and endoscopic drainage are the initial steps in the 'step-up approach'. The PANTER (Minimally Invasive Step Up Approach versus Maximal Necrosectomy in Patients with Acute Necrotising Pancreatitis) study confirmed that this minimally invasive approach leads to significantly better outcomes than open surgery, particularly in critically ill patients. If drainage fails to resolve the infection, which occurs in 30%–75% of cases, debridement of the necrosum becomes necessary. Failure to adequately control infected pancreatic necrosis results in an almost 100% mortality due to overwhelming organ failure. A surgical approach is indicated for patients who are not candidates for endoscopic intervention or if endoscopic intervention fails. The surgical methods for performing necrosectomy have expanded significantly over the past decade. Minimally invasive operative approaches to debride the necrosum are preferred to open surgical necrosectomy when feasible, as they are associated with lower mortality and morbidity. Multiple minimally invasive surgical techniques, including videoscopic-assisted retroperitoneal debridement, mini-access transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches, laparoscopic procedures, and robotic-assisted surgery, have proven to be both feasible and effective. Collections located at the root of the mesentery or to the right of the mesenteric vessels are challenging to access through percutaneous, endoscopic, or retroperitoneal approaches. In these cases, robotic or traditional open surgical approaches should be considered. For patients with a disconnected left pancreatic remnant following mid-body necrosis, a definitive surgical procedure, such as robotic transgastric drainage or distal pancreatectomy, should be performed. Insufficient evidence exists to support long-term stenting of the pancreatic duct for the management of a disconnected left pancreatic remnant. The optimal approach for managing complicated NP must be individualized based on the patient's specific condition. This approach is strongly influenced by available resources and the experience and expertise of the multidisciplinary team involved in the patient's care. Today, the 'step-up' surgical strategy — also known by some as the 'delay, drain, debride approach' — should be used for managing the majority of IPN cases. However, this approach may not be appropriate for patients lacking a safe puncture path (endoscopic or percutaneous). Additionally, indiscriminate implementation of the 'step-up' strategy may lead to an increased number of required operations. Robotic surgery, on the other hand, offers effective management with a single intervention. The robotic approach for drainage and debridement of IPN and symptomatic or infected pancreatic pseudocysts has been shown to be both safe and feasible. The robotic platform is an important tool in providing a 'one-step' surgical management approach. Robotic transenteric drainage and debridement techniques warrant further study, as they are likely to become the procedures of choice for appropriately selected patients in the future.

### Quantity of hemoperitoneum is associated with need for intervention in patients with stable blunt splenic injury [^114Ru5zZ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Study variables

The following demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes were obtained from the trauma registries: admission date; transfer status; age, years; gender; cause of injury (motor vehicle crash (MVC), fall, other cause); injury severity score (ISS); admission vital signs including Glasgow coma score (3–8 or 9–15), systolic blood pressure (< 90 mm Hg or ≥ 90 mm Hg), pulse (< 120 or 120 beats/minute), and respiratory rate (< 12 or > 20 vs. 12–20 breaths/minute); in-hospital mortality; ICU LOS (length of stay), days; Hospital LOS, days.

The following radiographic findings were abstracted from the electronic medical record: hemoperitoneum and quantity (small, moderate, large); AAST grade (the 1994 scale was in use during the study period); presence of contrast blush; presence of splenic vascular injury (defined as a pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula); presence of a nonsurgical abdominal injury.

The quantity of hemoperitoneum was defined semiquantitatively as small (perisplenic blood or blood in Morrison's pouch), moderate (presence of blood in one or both pericolic gutters), and large (additional finding of free blood in the pelvis). This definition uses the Federle score, which quantifies hemoperitoneum based on the count of compartments in the peritoneal cavity affected by the effusion.

The primary outcome was definitive intervention strategy. Intervention techniques were abstracted as both the initial intended intervention (NOM in all cases) and definitive intervention technique (observation, SAE, and failed NOM).

Hospital protocols

Consideration for angiography and/or embolization included a combination of high grade IV/V injuries, contrast blush, and pseudoaneurysm, but varied slightly by hospital guideline. None of the hospital protocols incorporate quantity of HP in guidelines for considering SAE. The standard CT protocol for trauma patients is a combination of Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis with IV contrast on a 64-slice or greater CT in venous phase.

### Diagnostic accuracy for hemoperitoneum, influence on prehospital times and time-to-definitive treatment of prehospital FAST: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^116SyQHx]. Injury (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Focused assessment sonography for trauma (FAST) performed in the prehospital setting may improve trauma care by influencing treatment decisions and reducing time to definitive care, but its accuracy and benefits remain uncertain. This systematic review evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of prehospital FAST in detecting hemoperitoneum and its effects on prehospital time and time to definitive diagnosis or treatment.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library up to November 11th, 2022. Studies investigating prehospital FAST and reporting at least one outcome of interest for this review were considered eligible. The primary outcome was prehospital FAST diagnostic accuracy for hemoperitoneum. A random-effect meta-analysis, including individual patient data, was performed to calculate the pooled outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Quality of studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool for diagnostic accuracy.

Results

We included 21 studies enrolling 5790 patients. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of prehospital FAST for hemoperitoneum were 0.630 (0.454–0.777) and 0.970 (0.957–0.979), respectively. Prehospital FAST was performed in a median of 2.72 (2.12–3.31) minutes without increasing prehospital times (pooled median difference of 2.44 min [95% CI: -3.93–8.81]) compared to standard management. Prehospital FAST findings changed on-scene trauma care in 12–48% of cases, the choice of admitting hospital in 13–71%, the communication with the receiving hospital in 45–52%, and the transfer management in 52–86%. Patients with a positive prehospital FAST achieved definitive diagnosis or treatment more rapidly (severity-adjusted pooled time ratio = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.41–0.95]) compared with patients with a negative or not performed prehospital FAST.

Conclusions

Prehospital FAST had a low sensitivity but a very high specificity to identify hemoperitoneum and reduced time-to-diagnostics or interventions, without increasing prehospital times, in patients with a high probability of abdominal bleeding. Its effect on mortality is still under-investigated.

### Pneumoperitoneum [^111Kw6Pt]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Pneumoperitoneum has a wide differential diagnosis and presents with varying degrees of severity; however, not all etiologies require operative intervention. It is imperative that all patients with this diagnosis are evaluated by a surgeon. A thorough history, physical examination, and workup, aimed at localization of the source of pneumoperitoneum will ultimately determine the necessary treatments, including the need for operative intervention. We aim to provide the reader with a working knowledge regarding the evaluation and treatment of patients with pneumoperitoneum.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^112cfJPr]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Interventional radiology for traumatic injuries — angioembolization (AE) indications state that angioembolization (AE) is an important component of salvaging injured organs, such as the spleen, kidney, and liver, utilizing minimally invasive measures, and to consider using AE of the spleen in adult patients who are hemodynamically stable with AAST Grade 3 or higher injury, contrast extravasation or pseudoaneurysm, hemoperitoneum, or evidence of ongoing hemorrhage. AE may have a role in selected pediatric patients to increase splenic salvage; however, specific indications are not reported regarding AE based on injury grade or contrast extravasation. Consider AE as initial treatment for patients with a pelvic fracture who are hemodynamically unstable and have no indication for laparotomy or other source of hemorrhage.

### Traumatic injuries: imaging of abdominal and pelvic injuries [^113cdR2g]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

The availability of new imaging modalities has altered the diagnostic approach to patients with abdominal and pelvic trauma. Computed tomography and ultrasound have largely replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage. Ultrasound is used in most trauma centers as the initial imaging technique for the detection of hemoperitoneum and helps to determine the need for emergency laparotomy. Computed tomography allows for an accurate diagnosis of a wide range of traumatic abdominal and pelvic conditions. The speed of single-detector helical and multi-detector row CT (MDCT) permits a rapid CT examination of the seriously ill patient in the emergency room. In particular, the technology of MDCT permits multiple, sequential CT scans to be quickly obtained in the same patient, which is a great advance in the rapid assessment of the multiple-injured patient. The evolving concepts in trauma care promoting non-operative management of liver and splenic injuries creates the need for follow-up cross-sectional imaging studies in these patients. Computed tomography and, less frequently, MR or ultrasound, are used for this purpose.

### Positive FAST without hemoperitoneum due to fluid resuscitation in blunt trauma [^115SRiEt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) examination is an important screening tool in the evaluation of blunt trauma patients.

Objectives

To describe a case of a hemodynamically unstable polytrauma patient with positive FAST due to fluid resuscitation after blunt trauma.

Case Report

We describe a case of a hemodynamically unstable polytrauma patient who underwent massive volume resuscitation prior to transfer from a community hospital to a trauma center. On arrival at the receiving institution, the FAST examination was positive for free intraperitoneal fluid, but no hemoperitoneum or significant intra-abdominal injuries were found during laparotomy. In this case, it is postulated that transudative intraperitoneal fluid secondary to massive volume resuscitation resulted in a positive FAST examination.

Conclusion

This case highlights potential issues specific to resuscitated trauma patients with prolonged transport times. Further study is likely needed to assess what changes, if any, should be made in algorithms to address the effect of prior resuscitative efforts on the test characteristics of the FAST examination.

### Quantity of hemoperitoneum is associated with need for intervention in patients with stable blunt splenic injury [^116BbyXv]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nonoperative management (NOM) is the standard treatment strategy for patients with hemodynamically stable blunt splenic injury (BSI). NOM consists of observation for lower injured spleens and splenic artery embolization (SAE) for higher injured spleens. Studies to date have reported disparate findings on whether quantity of hemoperitoneum (HP) reflects a more injured spleen with subsequent higher risk of rupture. Some studies report quantity of HP to be associated with failed embolization, need for massive transfusion, and failed NOM, whereas other studies reported quantity of HP had no independent association with the studied outcome.

Thus, there is no consensus on whether quantity of HP should be incorporated into NOM algorithms for patients with hemodynamically stable BSI. Only the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) guidelines state that, in patients with moderate hemoperitoneum, angiography should be considered. Guidelines by the Western Trauma Association (WTA, 2016 update)and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) do not suggest angiography and/or embolization should be considered based on presence or quantity of HP. In contrast, all of the above guidelines specify consideration for SAE based on American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grade and presence of contrast blush.

This study sought to analyze whether the quantity of HP was associated with need for intervention in a large cohort of patients with hemodynamically stable BSI from six level I and II trauma centers in the USA.

### New technology in the management of liver trauma [^112hDVjT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging

Computed tomography (CT) is the modality of choice for the diagnosis and evaluation of severe hepatic injury in hemodynamically stable patients as it facilitates the accurate diagnosis of parenchymal injury, the detection of potential damage to the hemoperitoneum and other solid organs including the retroperitoneal structures as well as a ruptured gastrointestinal tract.

Multi detector-row CT (MDCT) has enhanced imaging resolution and reduced scanning times while further permits the fast and reliable examination of patients with hemodynamic instability.

Non-operative management of liver trauma is currently the preferred management approach for those patients with hemodynamic stability, while high-quality CT has contributed significantly to the reduction in routine surgery.

It is essential that radiologists be familiar with the hepatic injury scoring system established by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST).

CT scanning has proved equally beneficial in the detection of delayed liver injury complications such as hemorrhage, hepatic or perihepatic abscess, post-traumatic pseudoaneurysm or hemobilia, as well as biloma or bile peritonitis. CT monitoring is vital in those patients with a high grade hepatic injury to identify potential complications that require immediate intervention, as well as in those who are managed conservatively so that any imaging improvement can be recorded. Furthermore, the wide application of interventional radiology in hepatic trauma management has enabled an increase in the non-operative approach. Such techniques include angiographic embolization for the control of active bleeding, image-guided percutaneous drainage of bile and infected collections.

During the 80s and the early part of the 90s, several publications confirmed that up to 86% of liver injuries had stopped bleeding before surgery and up to 67% of exploratory laparotomy procedures for abdominal trauma proved non-therapeutic.

Major hepatic injuries identified by CT involve lacerations, subcapsular and parenchymal hematomas, active bleeding and hepatic venous injury. Minor injuries that can be revealed include disturbed periportal circulation and a flat inferior vena cava.
