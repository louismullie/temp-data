## Question

Ckp elevation explaination of rhabdomyolysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about why creatine kinase (CK) becomes elevated in rhabdomyolysis and how to interpret that elevation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal physiology of CK and its isoenzymes. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis and why CK leaks into the circulation. Next, I will review the kinetics of CK rise and fall and how that informs serial testing. After that, I need to check the diagnostic thresholds used in guidelines and studies and reconcile any discrepancies. Finally, I will consider confounders, the role of myoglobin, and how CK relates to complications like acute kidney injury, so I can synthesize a clinically actionable explanation.

> Let me first confirm the physiology. CK is an intracellular enzyme abundant in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain, where it catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of creatine to phosphocreatine, buffering energy in tissues with high and variable energy demands; in healthy individuals, serum CK is low because it is normally confined within myocytes, so any measurable increase reflects leakage from damaged cells.

> Now, I need to verify the pathophysiology in rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis results from skeletal muscle injury that disrupts the sarcolemma, allowing intracellular contents to spill into the circulation; this includes CK, myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, electrolytes, and other proteins, with CK-MM from skeletal muscle being the predominant isoenzyme detected in serum, which explains why CK rises when muscle is damaged [^90e370ed] [^7254f914].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing. I should confirm the kinetics. CK typically begins to rise within about 12 hours of muscle injury, peaks at roughly 24–72 hours, and then declines with a half-life around 1–3 days, returning to baseline in about 5–7 days if the injury resolves; this delayed peak and slower clearance compared with myoglobin is precisely why serial CK measurements are useful for tracking the course of rhabdomyolysis [^7254f914] [^d01af11d].

> Next, I should review diagnostic thresholds and reconcile them. Most contemporary guidelines and systematic reviews define rhabdomyolysis as CK greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal or greater than 1000 IU/L, acknowledging that some studies use higher cutoffs for "severe" disease; importantly, exertional rhabdomyolysis reviews often use a much higher threshold, such as greater than 50,000 IU/L, to distinguish physiologic post-exercise CK elevations from clinically significant rhabdomyolysis, so I need to interpret CK in clinical context and not rely on a single number [^96481ff5] [^28a6f1c4] [^9b8f0ed8] [^f34aa9de].

> Wait, let me verify the role of myoglobin so I don't overstate CK's specificity. Myoglobin rises earlier and clears faster than CK, so it may be elevated and even appear in urine before CK peaks; however, myoglobin assays are less standardized, and urine dipsticks for blood detect myoglobin indirectly and cannot distinguish hemoglobin from myoglobin, which limits diagnostic specificity, whereas CK remains the most reliable and widely available marker for diagnosing and monitoring muscle injury in rhabdomyolysis [^d01af11d] [^7254f914].

> I should double-check confounders that can elevate CK without rhabdomyolysis. Strenuous exercise, intramuscular injections, seizures, and certain medications can raise CK, and baseline CK varies with sex, race, and training status; in statin-associated muscle injury, CK thresholds of 3–5 times ULN prompt concern, and greater than 10 times ULN with symptoms warrants stopping the statin and evaluating for rhabdomyolysis, so I need to ensure the clinical picture matches the biochemical signal before labeling rhabdomyolysis [^a6793cd0] [^31f82df9] [^d01af11d].

> Let me consider the relationship between CK and complications, especially AKI. Historically, higher CK levels, particularly above about 5000–15,000 IU/L, have been associated with increased risk of AKI, but wait, I should verify whether CK itself predicts AKI independently of other factors; indeed, some studies show that initial creatinine, acid–base status, and other clinical variables may be stronger predictors than CK alone, so CK should be integrated with renal function and risk scores rather than used in isolation to forecast AKI or the need for renal replacement therapy [^5a0f09fc] [^175cc809] [^d5298efd].

> I will now examine how to use CK in practice. Serial CK measurements are recommended to identify the peak and confirm a downtrend before stopping monitoring, typically every 24–48 hours until the trajectory is clearly downward; in exertional cases, many clinicians continue monitoring until CK falls below 1000 IU/L, and persistent elevations beyond about 8 weeks should prompt evaluation for underlying myopathy or genetic disorders, which I should keep in mind for recurrent or unexplained cases [^175ff95d] [^612101ea] [^7ea3bdbb].

> But wait, what if the patient has minimal symptoms and only modest CK elevation after exercise? I should confirm whether this reflects physiologic adaptation versus disease. In trained individuals, post-exercise CK elevations up to about 5–10 times ULN can occur without myoglobinuria or renal injury, whereas values exceeding roughly 50 times ULN, especially with symptoms or pigmenturia, push toward clinically significant rhabdomyolysis; this is why I need to integrate symptoms, urine findings, and renal function with CK rather than using CK alone to make the diagnosis [^ae28e55a] [^f34aa9de].

> In summary, CK elevation in rhabdomyolysis reflects sarcolemmal disruption with release of the intracellular enzyme CK-MM into the circulation; its delayed peak and slower clearance make serial CK measurements valuable for tracking disease course, while diagnostic thresholds vary with context, and CK must be interpreted alongside clinical features and renal function to guide risk stratification and management decisions [^90e370ed] [^7254f914] [^28a6f1c4].

---

CK elevation in rhabdomyolysis reflects **skeletal muscle breakdown** [^90e370ed] that releases intracellular enzymes, including CK, into the bloodstream [^2c40910a]. CK rises within 12 hours [^7254f914], peaks at 24–72 hours, and declines over 3–5 days [^7254f914]; levels > 5× ULN or > 1,000 IU/L support the diagnosis [^96481ff5], while > 50,000 IU/L indicates severe muscle necrosis and higher risk of complications [^f34aa9de]. CK is the most sensitive and specific marker for muscle injury [^d01af11d], but its correlation with acute kidney injury is imperfect [^5d4c1001], so serial CK and renal function monitoring are essential [^175ff95d] [^83cc8ece].

---

## Pathophysiology of CK elevation in rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by **rapid skeletal muscle breakdown** [^2c40910a] with release of intracellular contents — including CK, myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aldolase, and electrolytes — into the circulation [^2c40910a]. CK is a dimeric enzyme abundant in skeletal muscle; the CK-MM isoenzyme predominates in muscle and is the main source of CK elevation in rhabdomyolysis [^7254f914].

---

## Kinetics of CK elevation

CK elevation follows a predictable pattern after muscle injury:

| **Timeframe** | **CK level** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| 12 hours | Begins to rise | Initial detection of muscle injury [^7254f914] |
| 24–72 hours | Peaks | Peak levels indicate severity of muscle damage [^7254f914] |
| 3–5 days | Declines | Resolution phase; half-life ~1.5–2 days [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic thresholds and clinical significance

CK elevation is a cornerstone of rhabdomyolysis diagnosis, but thresholds vary by context:

- **Standard diagnostic threshold**: CK > 5× ULN or > 1,000 IU/L [^96481ff5] [^28a6f1c4].
- **Severe rhabdomyolysis**: CK > 50,000 IU/L, indicating extensive muscle necrosis and higher risk of complications [^f34aa9de].
- **Physiological exercise-induced CK elevation**: Typically < 5× ULN and resolves within days without complications [^ae28e55a].

---

## Correlation with clinical severity and complications

CK levels correlate with muscle injury severity but are an **imperfect predictor** of complications:

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: CK > 5,000 IU/L increases AKI risk, but correlation is inconsistent; other factors (hypovolemia, acidosis, nephrotoxins) also contribute [^5a0f09fc] [^1d3141d9].
- **Compartment syndrome**: Higher CK levels are associated with increased risk, but clinical assessment is essential [^notfound].
- **Mortality**: Very high CK levels (> 50,000 IU/L) are linked to higher mortality, especially with renal failure [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing CK levels in rhabdomyolysis

Several factors influence CK magnitude and kinetics:

- **Extent of muscle injury**: Greater muscle damage yields higher CK levels [^notfound].
- **Cause of rhabdomyolysis**: Trauma, crush injury, and exertion often cause higher CK than drugs or metabolic causes [^notfound].
- **Individual variability**: Baseline CK varies with sex, race, and fitness, affecting interpretation [^d01af11d].
- **Timing of sampling**: Early or late sampling can underestimate or miss the peak [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

CK elevation guides diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring:

- **Diagnosis**: Elevated CK in the right clinical context confirms rhabdomyolysis [^96481ff5].
- **Risk stratification**: Higher CK levels inform AKI risk and need for aggressive hydration and monitoring [^47346f7e].
- **Monitoring**: Serial CK helps track disease course and response to therapy [^175ff95d].

---

## Limitations of CK as a biomarker

Despite its utility, CK has limitations:

- **Lack of specificity**: CK elevation alone does not distinguish rhabdomyolysis from other myopathies or muscle injuries [^e14d220a].
- **Imperfect correlation**: CK does not reliably predict AKI or other complications [^5d4c1001].
- **Delayed peak**: CK peaks at 24–72 hours, potentially delaying recognition of severe cases [^7254f914].

---

CK elevation in rhabdomyolysis reflects **muscle breakdown** and is a sensitive marker of injury, but its correlation with complications is imperfect; therefore, CK should be interpreted in clinical context with serial measurements and renal function monitoring [^89c7df74].

What laboratory findings aid in the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

The most commonly implicated variables include elevated serum concentrations of CK (> 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L), myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), potassium, creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Elevated urine myoglobin provides additional evidence. A low threshold of suspicion in the proper clinical context is warranted to initiate appropriate therapy. A strategy for disease monitoring with serial CK measurement should be additionally undertaken. Interval CK values should be followed until a peak concentration is identified (typically at 24–72 hours), discontinued once the CK is reliably downtrending.

Discussion

Traumatic or non-traumatic injury to the skeletal muscle cellular membrane leads to an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, disrupting cellular homeostasis and leading to cell death. Injury may be exacerbated by the generation of reactive oxygen species after restoration of blood flood to the affected tissue (reperfusion injury). The resulting effect is the accumulation of CK, myoglobin, LDH, and potassium in the circulation. In a recent systematic review, the laboratory definition of rhabdomyolysis varied to include an elevated CK level > 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L, with the CK-MM subtype being the most reflective of skeletal muscle injury.CK values may become elevated within 12 hours of injury, peak at 24 to 72 hours, and return to normal in roughly 5 days, depending on the degree of injury and appropriate therapy.

Myoglobin becomes elevated in the circulation once intrinsic binding proteins are overwhelmed. Given a shorter half-life (1–3 hours) versus CK, myoglobin may elevate and resolve prior to CK depreciating its clinical utility. Myoglobin may also be evident in the urine and, although the sensitivity has been reported up to 100%, the specificity varies widely from 15% to 88%. Although a causal relationship may exist between rhabdomyolysis and elevations in hepatic aminotransferases (AST, ALT: alanine transaminase), this is of unclear value as both enzymes exist within skeletal muscle and may become elevated as a result of primary muscle injury.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^9b8f0ed8]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is the combination of symptoms (myalgia, weakness and muscle swelling) and a substantial rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) > 50000 IU/L; there are many causes, but here we specifically address exertional rhabdomyolysis. The consequences of this condition can be severe, including acute kidney injury and requirement for higher level care with organ support. Most patients have 'physiological' exertional rhabdomyolysis with no underlying disease; they do not need investigation and should be advised to return to normal activities in a graded fashion. Rarely, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the initial presentation of underlying muscle disease, and we review how to identify this much smaller group of patients, who do require investigation.

CK elevation

The presence of elevated serum myoglobin was once used routinely to diagnose rhabdomyolysis; however, this parameter is not widely available for diagnostic testing and unreliable because myoglobin is rapidly cleared from the blood. Laboratory testing in urine (a positive dipstick for blood with absence of red blood cells on microscopic urinalysis serves as an indirect marker of urinary myoglobin) offers a fast screening tool if serum myoglobin testing is not readily available. Serum CK is the most reliable diagnostic marker of rhabdomyolysis. It usually peaks 24–36 hours after exertion and then decreases back to baseline at a rate of about 40% per day (figure 2).

Figure 2
Rise and fall of myoglobin and creatine kinase (CK) during the course of rhabdomyolysis. Myoglobin is the first enzyme that increases, but returns to normal levels within the first 24 hours after onset of symptoms. CK increases a few hours later, reaches its peak value within the first 24 hours, and remains at these levels for 3 days. Even though the presence of myoglobin in serum is the key feature of rhabdomyolysis, CK is considered to be a more useful marker for the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of muscular injury due to its delayed clearance from the plasma and the wide availability for diagnostic testing.

There is no consensus in the literature concerning the exact level of CK increases required to fulfil the definition of ERM, with suggested CK levels ranging from > 5, > 10, > 20 or even > 50 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). There is, however, some agreement that the limit of a CK value of > 5 times the ULN is very conservative, as it does not take into account documented baseline differences as a function of gender, ethnicity and training levels. These ULN levels vary considerably: 217 and 414 IU/L in Caucasian women and men, and 336 and 801 IU/L in African women and men, respectively.

### Bench-to-bedside review: rhabdomyolysis – an overview for clinicians [^18c12ddc]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis ranges from an asymptomatic illness with elevation in the creatine kinase level to a life-threatening condition associated with extreme elevations in creatine kinase, electrolyte imbalances, acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Muscular trauma is the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis. Less common causes include muscle enzyme deficiencies, electrolyte abnormalities, infectious causes, drugs, toxins and endocrinopathies. Weakness, myalgia and tea-colored urine are the main clinical manifestations. The most sensitive laboratory finding of muscle injury is an elevated plasma creatine kinase level. The management of patients with rhabdomyolysis includes early vigorous hydration.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a serious medical condition characterized by the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue. This process leads to the release of various cellular components into the bloodstream and surrounding tissues, including proteins such as myoglobin and enzymes like creatine kinase (CK), as well as electrolytes. The severity of rhabdomyolysis can vary significantly, ranging from mild cases with minimal symptoms and slightly elevated CK levels to severe, life-threatening cases. Although traumatic injury is a common cause, a wide range of other factors can also trigger this condition. Previous studies and our research have confirmed that factors such as infection, certain medications, pancreatitis, alcohol consumption, electrolyte imbalance, excessive physical exertion, and heatstroke can also lead to elevated CK. The diverse range of potential causes underscores the complexity of this condition and the importance of considering rhabdomyolysis in various clinical scenarios.

Given the diverse etiology of rhabdomyolysis, patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) with critical illnesses are particularly susceptible to developing rhabdomyolysis. This condition can lead to severe complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome(MODS). Previous studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and the incidence of AKI. Despite its clinical significance, the specific characteristics and risk factors contributing to mortality or adverse outcomes in ICU patients with rhabdomyolysis are not fully understood. Moreover, the relationship between elevated serum CK levels and increased patient mortality remains controversial. In light of these uncertainties, the objective of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of ICU patients diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and to determine whether rhabdomyolysis constitutes a risk factor for outcomes within this patient population.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^06440241]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis is characterised by muscle breakdown associated with strenuous exercise or normal exercise under extreme circumstances. Key features are severe muscle pain and sudden transient elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels with or without associated myoglobinuria. Mild cases may remain unnoticed or undiagnosed. Exertional rhabdomyolysis is well described among athletes and military personnel, but may occur in anybody exposed to unaccustomed exercise. In contrast, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the first manifestation of a genetic muscle disease that lowers the exercise threshold for developing muscle breakdown. Repeated episodes of exertional rhabdomyolysis should raise the suspicion of such an underlying disorder, in particular in individuals in whom the severity of the rhabdomyolysis episodes exceeds the expected response to the exercise performed. The present review aims to provide a practical guideline for the acute management and postepisode counselling of patients with exertional rhabdomyolysis, with a particular emphasis on when to suspect an underlying genetic disorder. The pathophysiology and its clinical features are reviewed, emphasising four main stepwise approaches: (1) the clinical significance of an acute episode, (2) risks of renal impairment, (3) clinical indicators of an underlying genetic disorders and (4) when and how to recommence sport activity following an acute episode of rhabdomyolysis. Genetic backgrounds that appear to be associated with both enhanced athletic performance and increased rhabdomyolysis risk are briefly reviewed.

Creatine kinase (CK) remains an essential tool for assessment of muscular weakness and pain in children despite the advent of advanced diagnostic tests in this field. It is also useful in diagnosing and monitoring various other conditions. This article will explore the physiology of CK and clinical situations where the estimation of CK can help the clinicians' decision-making process with the diagnosis and management of these conditions. Some clinical scenarios are used to highlight how the tests can be used in different clinical situations.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^90e370ed]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical condition characterized by destruction of skeletal muscle with release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream. Intracellular contents released include electrolytes, enzymes, and myoglobin, resulting in systemic complications. Muscle necrosis is the common factor for traumatic and non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis. The systemic impact of rhabdomyolysis ranges from asymptomatic elevations in bloodstream muscle enzymes to life-threatening acute kidney injury and electrolyte abnormalities. The purpose of this clinical consensus statement is to review the present-day diagnosis, management, and prognosis of patients who develop rhabdomyolysis.

### A systematic review on the definition of rhabdomyolysis [^28a6f1c4]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis (RML) is an interdisciplinary condition due to muscle cell injury followed by the release of cell components into circulation. Etiology of RML has a broad range; a serious complication is acute kidney injury (AKI). Despite its high relevance, there is no established formal definition for RML.

Objectives

A systematic review, focusing on RML definition, providing a recommendation for clinicians.

Method

Systematic literature research in PubMed and Embase (1968–07/2018).

Results

The database research presented 8136 articles in PubMed and 2151 in Embase. After screening, 614 papers were retained for statistical analysis. A retrospective study was the most used design (44%). A definition of RML was stated in 231 studies (37.6%), including a precise creatine kinase level (CK) cut-off most frequently (67.1%). In 53/231 (22.9%) studies the CK cut-off was > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN), and in 64/231 (27.7%) studies > 1000 IU/L. Further components of definitions were elevated CK without specific thresholds, and clinical symptoms. Exclusion criteria referring to the definition of RML were established in 113 studies, including myocardial, renal, cerebral and neuromuscular characteristics.

Conclusion

At present, we recommend a clinical syndrome of acute muscle weakness, myalgia, and muscle swelling combined with a CK cut-off value of > 1000 IU/L/ or CK > 5× ULN for the standard definition of a mild RML. Additionally measured myoglobinuria and AKI indicate a severe type of RML. Exclusion criteria as well as the chronological sequence need to be considered for a conclusive RML definition.

### Diagnostic evaluation of rhabdomyolysis [^e1a5eea6]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by severe acute muscle injury resulting in muscle pain, weakness, and/or swelling with release of myofiber contents into the bloodstream. Symptoms develop over hours to days after an inciting factor and may be associated with dark pigmentation of the urine. Serum creatine kinase and urine myoglobin levels are markedly elevated. Clinical examination, history, laboratory studies, muscle biopsy, and genetic testing are useful tools for diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, and they can help differentiate acquired from inherited causes of rhabdomyolysis. Acquired causes include substance abuse, medication or toxic exposures, electrolyte abnormalities, endocrine disturbances, and autoimmune myopathies. Inherited predisposition to rhabdomyolysis can occur with disorders of glycogen metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Less common inherited causes of rhabdomyolysis include structural myopathies, channelopathies, and sickle-cell disease. This review focuses on the differentiation of acquired and inherited causes of rhabdomyolysis and proposes a practical diagnostic algorithm. Muscle Nerve 51: 793–810, 2015.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^d4c2c1ce]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a condition characterized by primary (mechanical) or secondary (metabolic) skeletal muscle injury, resulting in cell death and release of potentially toxic substances into circulation. Management often centers on prevention or treatment of the primary complication of the condition, acute kidney injury (AKI). Here we briefly review the causes, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of rhabdomyolysis.

In what patient populations should rhabdomyolysis be suspected?

Trauma patients

Recommendation

Rhabdomyolysis should be suspected in patients with a large burden of traumatic injury involving muscular tissue, especially patients with crush injuries involving the extremities or mangled extremities. Patients with vascular injuries or muscle ischemia with subsequent reperfusion are also at higher risk for rhabdomyolysis.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis is the result of skeletal muscle breakdown with release of potentially toxic substances such as electrolytes, myoglobin, and sarcoplasmic proteins into the bloodstream. The pathophysiology underlying all cases of rhabdomyolysis is disruption of the myocyte cell membrane and leakage of cell contents into circulation. This may result from direct myocyte injury related to trauma or from metabolic disturbances affecting supply of ATP within the myocyte.

Traumatic injuries are a common cause of rhabdomyolysis. One study has shown some degree of biochemical evidence of rhabdomyolysis (abnormal creatine kinase (CK)) among 85% of critically injured patients admitted to a trauma intensive care unit setting, although only 10% developed renal failure and only 5% required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Patients with multisystem trauma, crush injuries involving the extremities or torso, and those with compartment syndrome of one or more extremities are at highest risk. Other independent risk factors for rhabdomyolysis among trauma patients include age older than 55 years, Injury Severity Score greater than 16, penetrating trauma with vascular injury, severe extremity injury, male sex, and body mass index greater than 30 kg/m². Patients who fall with subsequent prolonged immobilization are also at higher risk for rhabdomyolysis, particularly if their limbs are compressed by their head or torso for a significant period of time, leading to muscle hypoxia. Conditions leading to skeletal muscle ischemia, such as direct compression or compartment syndrome, may lead to irreversible damage to the muscle; much of the injury may actually occur with reperfusion, in addition to injury sustained during the period of ischemia. Trauma is a common cause of rhabdomyolysis, but less than 20% of all cases of rhabdomyolysis are thought to be related to direct injury; metabolic or medical causes of rhabdomyolysis are more common.

### Signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis… [^9d05789a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The main rhabdomyolysis symptoms are muscle pain, dark urine, and feeling weak or tired.
- Seek medical attention immediately if you experience any symptoms.
- Rhabdo symptoms can mimic other conditions like heat cramps and dehydration.
- A healthcare provider can perform a specific blood test to determine if you have rhabdo. Signs and symptoms It's important to learn the signs and symptoms of rhabdo that may be present. Learning the symptoms can help you figure out if you or someone else needs to seek medical attention. If you develop rhabdo, you might have one or more of these symptoms: Muscle cramps, aches, or painsthat are more severe than expected Dark urine Feeling weak or tired, unable to complete tasks or finish a workout you were able to do previously. When will symptoms appear. Symptoms of rhabdo may not begin until hours or days after the initial muscle injury.

For some people, symptoms might not start to appear until several days after the initial injury. Seek medical care immediately If you have any of these symptoms at any time, do not ignore them. Seek medical treatment right away. Earlier diagnosis means an earlier start to treatment and a greater chance of recovery without permanent health effects. Blood tests for rhabdo Repeated blood tests for the muscle protein creatine kinase are the only accurate test for rhabdo. If you suspect that you may have rhabdo, ask a healthcare provider to check your CK levels with a blood test.
- CK enters the bloodstream when muscle tissue is damaged.
- When rhabdo is present, CK levels will rise. You will need repeat blood tests to determine if CK levels are going up or down:

- Like symptoms, the rise in CK may not appear right away.
- Test CK levels until 2 consecutive tests show levels lowering.

Urine tests are not accurate Urine dipstick tests are not a good way to diagnose rhabdo.
- These tests check for myoglobin indirectly.
- Myoglobin quickly clears from the body so it may not show up in urine.
- High CK levels in the blood may persist for days.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis is a systemic metabolic illness, with roughly 26,000 events recorded per year in the United States alone. This syndrome is typically marked by skeletal muscle necrosis which leads to leaking of muscle cell components, such as myoglobin, into the bloodstream. The disorder may appear as an asymptomatic illness with high creatine kinase (CK) values or become a serious health issue with significant elevation in CK, electrolyte deficiencies, acute kidney injury (AKI), and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Clinically, rhabdomyolysis is characterized by a triad of symptoms, comprising myalgia, weakness, and myoglobinuria, which appears as the generally recognized tea-colored urine. However, this stringent description of symptoms may be deceiving since the trio of symptoms is only found in < 10% of patients, and > 50% of patients have no complaints of muscular pain or weakness, despite presenting with stained urine. Therefore, elevated CK level is an exceptionally sensitive laboratory test for detecting muscular injury that has the potential to produce rhabdomyolysis, providing there is no concomitant heart or brain damage.

In adults, the available literature has shown that the most common causes of rhabdomyolysis are drug or alcohol abuse, medicinal drug use, trauma, immobility, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. However, the data in pediatric patients is skewed towards different causes, with viral myositis, trauma, connective tissue disorders, exercise, and drug overdose being reported as the leading causes of rhabdomyolysis in this population. Moreover, the treatment strategies for pediatric rhabdomyolysis remain an area of ongoing clinical debate. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to identify and categorize etiologies of pediatric rhabdomyolysis, evaluate the different treatment strategies for rhabdomyolysis, and assess the outcomes of children with rhabdomyolysis.

Treatment involves aggressive fluid resuscitation and may necessitate intensive care.
Patients with recurrent events, elevated baseline serum creatine kinase, or features consistent with metabolic myopathies should be considered for investigation for underlying genetic disorders.
Rhabdomyolysis in the setting of a heat syndrome usually does not require further muscle investigations.
Patients should return to normal activities in a graded fashion.

### Influenza-induced rhabdomyolysis [^b53db520]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The mortality rate of rhabdomyolysis increases with increasing severity of the illness. One study reported 7.1% overall mortality in rhabdomyolysis which increased to 22.5% in patients with renal failure and 40% in those that require renal replacement therapy. Our patient did not require renal replacement therapy.

Our case highlights the need to consider checking CK levels in hospitalised patients with influenza infection. Additionally, influenza must remain in the differential for unexplained rhabdomyolysis.

Learning points

Influenza can cause severe rhabdomyolysis and clinicians should consider checking a creatine kinase (CK) level in adults hospitalised with acute influenza infection.
A correlation between fever and elevated CK levels may exist further supporting the hypothesis that direct myocyte invasion by the virus may be a key component of influenza pathogenesis.
Oseltamivir treatment has been associated with a reduction in mortality for acutely ill hospitalised patients with influenza up to day 5 after symptom onset.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^0b67ec84]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ERM) is the general term for muscle breakdown associated with strenuous exercise and is well described among athletes and military personnel. Although there is no universally accepted definition, ERM is often defined as a clinical syndrome associated with severe muscle pain, sudden elevation (and subsequent fall) of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels with or without myoglobinuria. Individuals experiencing ERM present to a variety of physicians, in particular to general practitioners and physicians working in sports medicine, emergency and internal medicine, neurology and the neuromuscular field, and for the military. As a result of the diversity of medical personnel having to deal with ERM, most physicians will have experience with some but not necessarily all aspects of this important condition.

ERM results in the entry of skeletal muscle contents, in particular CK and myoglobin, into the systemic circulation. In most cases, the condition has a mild course characterised by postexertional myalgia with mild-to-moderate CK increases, mild pigmenturia, and will often not even come to medical attention. However, in a minority of patients the clinical course can be severe, resulting in marked hyperCKaemia, compartment syndrome, acute renal injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cardiac arrhythmias secondary to electrolyte imbalances, and even cardiac arrest if left untreated. The annual rhabdomyolysis prevalence has been reported as 26 000 cases in the USA, with 47% meeting the diagnostic criteria of ERM. In other studies, a lower percentage of ERM has been suggested, a discrepancy which reflects differences in the cohorts studied.

Defining rhabdomyolysis

There is no universally agreed clinical definition of rhabdomyolysis, but a working definition would encompass the twin features of symptomatic muscle involvement and a substantial rise in serum CK, usually > 50 000 IU/L. Muscle symptoms include myalgia, weakness and/or swelling. The presence of myoglobinuria is not required and many laboratories do not routinely measure serum and urinary myoglobin. Nevertheless, patients should be asked about changes in urine coloration, which may be the classical 'Coca-Cola' of myoglobinuria. Urine should be dipstick tested: haemoglobin without erythrocytes indicates myoglobinuria.

Data synthesis

Definition

The clinical studies were very heterogeneous with regard to the definition of rhabdomyolysis; although most authors diagnosed rhabdomyolysis based on CK levels five times the upper limit of normal levels (> 1000 U/L), others used alternative criteria for diagnosis (Table 1). In the clinical setting, symptoms were not usually taken into consideration when defining rhabdomyolsysis; however, the most commonly included ones were muscle pain and muscle weakness while the presence of dark urine was not used to define this entity in most studies. When rhabdomyolysis is associated with the use of lipid-lowering drugs (statins, fibrates, or a combination of both), the CK level cutoff is considered ten times the upper limit of normal. The definition of severity of rhabdomyolysis varied among studies, some defining "severe rhabdomyolysis" based on different CK cutoff values (> 5000 U/L up to > 15,000 U/L).

Returning to normal activities

The risk of recurrence is low if there is no suggestion of an underlying genetic cause: 1%–2% suffered recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis in the US Army study, the risk may be lower in the general population.

Most experts recommend a graded return to exercise. Exercise should be avoided in the first month and until symptoms have disappeared and the serum CK normalised. Light exercise can then be started and gradually increased in extent and duration if symptoms of weakness and/or myalgia do not recur. Eccentric training is best avoided, at least to start with, as is strenuous unaccustomed exercise. Patients with suspected underlying myopathies/genetic disorders need a stricter approach, as described elsewhere.

### Identifying inherited metabolic disorders in children: the role of elevated creatine kinase [^e8793a33]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels are key indicators of muscle injury and are commonly used in the differential diagnosis of pediatric disorders, particularly inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs). However, variability in CK elevation and the absence of standardized diagnostic thresholds complicate its clinical interpretation. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of CK levels in distinguishing IMDs from other etiologies and to identify clinical and biochemical patterns that could facilitate earlier recognition of IMDs.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 1,660 pediatric patients seen at a metabolic clinic, identifying 320 (19.3%) who had CK measurements. Among them, 99 patients (30.9%) had elevated CK levels (> 171 U/L). These patients were divided into three diagnostic groups: idiopathic, IMD-diagnosed, and other diseases. "Idiopathic" referred to cases without a confirmed diagnosis. Biochemical parameters (CK, AST, LDH) were compared, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed.

Results

Thirteen patients (15.1%) were diagnosed with IMDs. The IMD group showed significantly higher CK and AST levels compared to the idiopathic group (p < 0.05). ROC analysis indicated that a CK cut-off of 617.5 U/L had a sensitivity of 61.5% and specificity of 88.0% for identifying IMDs. However, CK alone could not effectively distinguish other diseases from idiopathic cases. Advanced metabolic investigations and comprehensive clinical evaluations were essential for accurate diagnosis.

Conclusion

While CK levels offer useful preliminary diagnostic information, they must be interpreted alongside advanced metabolic testing and clinical findings for reliable diagnosis. This study emphasizes the value of a multidisciplinary approach in assessing elevated CK levels in pediatric patients and calls for further research to optimize diagnostic pathways.

Exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis

Exertional rhabdomyolysis is the combination of muscle symptoms (myalgia, weakness and swelling) and a substantial rise in serum CK (> 50 000 IU/L) in the setting of exercise. Serum CK rises after exercise are common and are asymptomatic in up to half of cases. Mean serum CK values 24 hours after marathons are 3322 IU/L for men (22× baseline) and 946 IU/L for women (9× baseline). The clinical significance of the serum CK concentration is unclear: 6000 IU/L has been cited as the minimum necessary for renal failurebut case reports indicate acute kidney injury may occur with a serum CK of 5000 IU/Land other studies suggest no safe serum concentration of CK. Pragmatically, a rise in CK to > 5000 U/L and/or evidence of end-organ damage (eg, myoglobinuria or decline in renal/liver function) is sufficient for a diagnosis of exertional rhabdomyolysis. Patients with exertional rhabdomyolysis may also experience fever, nausea and decreased/absent urine production. Supportive biochemical findings include hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypercalcaemia or hypocalcaemia and metabolic acidosis.

Most cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis are caused by heat-related injuries, specifically heat stroke and heat injury. The WHO's International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision includes four overlapping categories relating to exertional heat conditions (table 1). These symptoms are worth enquiring about since rhabdomyolysis in the context of a clear-cut heat-related condition usually does not require further investigation.

Key points
- The main rhabdomyolysis symptoms are muscle pain, dark urine, and feeling weak or tired.
- Seek medical attention immediately if you experience any symptoms.
- Rhabdo symptoms can mimic other conditions like heat cramps and dehydration.
- A healthcare provider can perform a specific blood test to determine if you have rhabdo. Signs and symptoms It's important to learn the signs and symptoms of rhabdo that may be present. Learning the symptoms can help you figure out if you or someone else needs to seek medical attention. If you develop rhabdo, you might have one or more of these symptoms: Muscle cramps, aches, or painsthat are more severe than expected Dark urine Feeling weak or tired, unable to complete tasks or finish a workout you were able to do previously. When will symptoms appear. Symptoms of rhabdo may not begin until hours or days after the initial muscle injury.

For some people, symptoms might not start to appear until several days after the initial injury. Seek medical care immediately If you have any of these symptoms at any time, do not ignore them. Seek medical treatment right away. Earlier diagnosis means an earlier start to treatment and a greater chance of recovery without permanent health effects. Blood tests for rhabdo Repeated blood tests for the muscle protein creatine kinase are the only accurate test for rhabdo.

### Rhabdomyolysis [^ac7199fe]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a well-known clinical syndrome of muscle injury associated with myoglobinuria, electrolyte abnormalities, and often acute kidney injury (AKI). The pathophysiology involves injury to the myocyte membrane and/or altered energy production that results in increased intracellular calcium concentrations and initiation of destructive processes. Myoglobin has been identified as the primary muscle constituent contributing to renal damage in rhabdomyolysis. Although rhabdomyolysis was first described with crush injuries and trauma, more common causes in hospitalized patients at present include prescription and over-the-counter medications, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The diagnosis is confirmed by elevated creatine kinase levels, but additional testing is needed to evaluate for potential causes, electrolyte abnormalities, and AKI. Treatment is aimed at discontinuation of further skeletal muscle damage, prevention of acute renal failure, and rapid identification of potentially life-threatening complications. Review of existing published data reveals a lack of high-quality evidence to support many interventions that are often recommended for treating rhabdomyolysis. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore renal perfusion and increase urine flow is agreed on as the main intervention for preventing and treating AKI. There is little evidence other than from animal studies, retrospective observational studies, and case series to support the routine use of bicarbonate-containing fluids, mannitol, and loop diuretics. Hyperkalemia and compartment syndrome are additional complications of rhabdomyolysis that must be treated effectively. A definite need exists for well-designed prospective studies to determine the optimal management of rhabdomyolysis.

What are the new findings

Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ERM) may be the first manifestation of a genetic muscle disease that lowers the exercise threshold for developing muscle breakdown.
Consider a genetic cause of the ERM in case of recurrent episodes; high creatine kinase (CK) levels (> 50×upper limit of normal) or persisting hyperCKaemia; absence of unaccustomed exercise; absence of (recreational or medical) drugs; or a positive family history of rhabdomyolysis or other exertional symptoms.
Type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1) mutations have been recently recognised to account for a substantial proportion of patients presenting with ERM.
Participants with a genetic predisposition to ERM need specific guidance when they recommence exercise and sporting activities.

Patients with muscle symptoms and elevated serum creatine kinase levels (> 4× upper limit of normal)

For patients at low CVD risk who have symptoms with CK > 4× ULN, the statin should be stopped and the need for statin reassessed. If considered important, a lower dose of an alternative statin should be tried and CK monitored. For patients at high CVD risk with muscle symptoms and a CK of > 4× ULN (but < 10× ULN), statin therapy can be continued with concomitant monitoring of CK, but stopped (at least temporarily) if the levels exceed 10× ULN. In this case, that particular statin regimen should not be restarted. If CK levels decrease after stopping the statin, restarting at a lower statin dose with CK monitoring should be tried. If, however, CK elevation persists, there may be an underlying myopathy (e.g. hypothyroidism or a metabolic muscle disorder), and referral to a neuromuscular specialist should be considered.

In patients with a CK > 10× ULN for which no secondary cause (e.g. exercise) can be found, statin therapy should be stopped because of the potential risk of rhabdomyolysis. If the CK level subsequently returns to normal, re-challenge with a lower dose of an alternative statin and careful monitoring of symptoms and CK may be considered. If rhabdomyolysis is suspected, statin should not be reintroduced. Rhabdomyolysis should be considered if there is severe muscular pain, general weakness and signs of myoglobinaemia or myoglobinuria. These patients, and those with very high CK levels (e.g. > 40× ULN), should be referred for evaluation of renal damage (urinalysis, serum creatinine levels). Intravenous hydration and urine alkalinisation are recommended for the treatment of rhabdomyolyis depending on severity and the presence of kidney injury. If indicated, non-statin LDL-C lowering agents should be used (see below).

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis – when should we start worrying? Case reports and literature review [^5b0eb4a5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) is a serious medical issue usually seen in individuals or patients after engaging in heavy exertion and physical activity. The incidence, natural course, and recurrence of ER are, by and large, unknown. Given the lack of rigorous scientific data that are specific for ER, most of the patients with ER receive treatment in an inpatient setting even with only a mild elevation of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level. Often, patients receive inpatient treatment solely on the basis of elevated CPK (< 3000 IU) even in the absence of other serious signs and symptoms of ER. We intent to describe 2 case reports that involve patients who developed ER after an intense physical exertion and were managed in an outpatient setting with close follow-up. In the discussion part, we point suggest that in patients with a relatively mild CPK elevation (< 15,000 IU) and normal creatinine value and in the absence of factors such as profound dehydration, sickle cell trait, concomitant infectious cause, underlying metabolic syndrome, and current and ongoing use of analgesics, the complications after ER are low. Patients who develop ER, who can be reliably followed up, and who fulfills these criteria can be managed as outpatients.

### An evidence-based narrative review of the emergency department evaluation and management of rhabdomyolysis [^89c7df74]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis is a medical condition caused by muscle breakdown leading to potential renal damage. This can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not rapidly identified and treated.

Objective

This article provides an evidence-based narrative review of the diagnosis and management of rhabdomyolysis, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis is caused by the breakdown of muscle cells leading to the release of numerous intracellular molecules, including potassium, calcium, phosphate, uric acid, and creatinine kinase. There are a number of potential etiologies, including exertion, extreme temperature changes, ischemia, infections, immobility, drugs, toxins, endocrine causes, autoimmune reactions, trauma, or genetic conditions. Findings can include myalgias, muscle weakness, or dark-colored urine, but more often include non-specific symptoms. The diagnosis is often determined with an elevated creatinine kinase greater than five times the upper-limit of normal. Severe disease may result in renal failure, electrolyte derangements, liver disease, compartment syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Treatment includes addressing the underlying etiology, as well as aggressive intravenous hydration with a goal urine output of 300 mL/h. Bicarbonate, mannitol, and loop diuretics do not possess strong evidence for improved outcomes. Renal replacement therapy should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Most patients are admitted, though some may be appropriate for discharge.

Conclusion

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially dangerous medical condition requiring rapid diagnosis and management that may result in significant complications if not appropriately identified and treated. Emergency clinician knowledge of this condition is essential for appropriate management.

Physiological exertional CK elevation

Several studies have investigated the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis among healthy individuals exposed to unaccustomed physical exertion, such as military recruits during basic military training and athletes. Kenney et al studied a cohort of 499 healthy individuals who participated in a 2-week basic military training, including eccentric strength training. The cohort included individuals of various ethnicities. The term 'clinically symptomatic ERM' was defined more stringently than the above: elevated serum CK, muscle weakness and myoglobinaemia and/or myoglobinuria. Hence, patients with myalgia in the absence of weakness were not included. Based on this definition, no cases of ERM were encountered. The mean and median CK values were within normal limits (for sex and race) at baseline, peaked with maximal elevation at day 7 and returned to normal at day 14. Serum CK levels were nearly universally elevated during training, but they were also increased in nearly one-fourth of the participants at baseline. At day 7, 27% of participants had CK levels > 5 times the ULN, and 11% had levels > 10 times the ULN, with values ranging from 56 to 35 056 IU/L on day 7. There was no correlation whatsoever between CK levels and the amount of exertion, environmental conditions, or myalgia, or weakness. In fact, quite surprisingly, and contrary to received opinion, CK elevations were less pronounced during the hot, humid months. One possible explanation was the less rigorous training during the hot months. Hence, the authors proposed that patients with serum CK levels < 50 times the ULN, no definite muscle swelling or weakness, no myoglobinuria, and without laboratory evidence of ARF or electrolyte imbalance have most likely expressed a physiological response to exercise and should not be classified as having 'clinically significant ERM'. Furthermore, the authors suggested that CK is only one of the factors predicting morbidity and mortality in ERM, which is in line with a recent risk stratification model.

### Weakness and elevated creatinine kinase as the initial presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^c540a7f4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 is a global public health emergency with more than one million positive cases across the globe. COVID-19 has a multifaceted presentation. We are herein to report two cases of SARS-CoV-2 induced rhabdomyolysis with an initial presentation of weakness and elevated creatinine kinase (CK). Both patients had no respiratory symptoms, they only complained of generalized weakness and were found to have elevated CK. Routine chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates in both cases and subsequently reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. To the best of our knowledge, there was only one literature to date documented SARS-CoV-2 induced rhabdomyolysis as a late complication of COVID-19 patient. Our cases showed that elevated CK and rhabdomyolysis can be the sole initial presentation of patients with COVID-19 and total CK should be ordered in every patient on admission.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^7ea3bdbb]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Investigating exertional rhabdomyolysis

In general, patients with a clear history of a preceding heat-related illness do not require further investigations; this group is statistically the largest. Further investigations should be considered in patients with no history of heat exposure, or who have recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis. Patients may not have sought medical attention for previous milder episodes; ask about previous episodes of postexertional muscle pain, weakness or dark urine. Almost all patients with metabolic myopathies will have had symptoms since teenage years. Other features requiring further investigation include persistently raised serum CK after 8 weeks, family history of rhabdomyolysis (including after exercise, fasting or illness), exertional muscle cramps or exercise intolerance. The acronym (retronym?) RHABDO has been suggested as an aide-mémoire (box 2).

Box 2
Features suggesting need for further investigation

R — Recurrent episodes of exertional rhabdomyolysis

H — HyperCKaemia more than 8 weeks after event

A — Accustomed to exercise

B — Blood creatine kinase (CK) concentration above 50× upper limit of normal

D — Drug ingestion insufficient to explain exertional rhabdomyolysis

O — Other family members affected or Other exertional symptoms

Clinicians should take a general myopathy history, including exercise intolerance, exertional rhabdomyolysis tempo (eg, duration between exercise and onset) and family history. Family history is sometimes forgotten: case 2 had little contact with his sister but recalled she had been diagnosed with something which stopped her exercising; renewed contact revealed her McArdle's disease. Examination for myopathic weakness and electromyography should be delayed until the patient has fully recovered. Further investigations for underlying causes, including exercise testing, muscle biopsy and muscle MRI, depend on the clinical phenotype but are often non-diagnostic until the exertional rhabdomyolysis has resolved. Figure 1 summarises the approach to a new presentation of exertional rhabdomyolysis.

### Identifying inherited metabolic disorders in children: the role of elevated creatine kinase [^43d1bc80]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Creatine kinase (CK) is an essential enzyme predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain tissue, where it facilitates energy homeostasis by catalyzing the conversion of creatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). CK elevation is a key biochemical marker for muscle integrity and is widely used in diagnosing neuromuscular disorders, particularly in pediatric patients. However, the underlying causes of CK elevation vary, encompassing both inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) and primary myopathies. The differential diagnosis of these conditions requires a systematic approach integrating clinical, biochemical, and genetic assessments.

Among IMDs, disorders such as glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), fatty acid oxidation defects (FAODs), and mitochondrial disorders frequently present with CK elevation, often accompanied by additional biochemical abnormalities such as elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In addition, neuromuscular diseases, including muscular dystrophies and inflammatory myopathies, also manifest with increased CK levels, necessitating careful differentiation. Moreover, non-metabolic factors such as trauma, viral myositis, exercise-induced muscle damage, and drug-induced myopathies (e.g. statins, corticosteroids) further complicate the diagnostic process.

Despite the widespread use of CK as a screening tool, there is no universal consensus on CK cut-off values that reliably distinguish metabolic from neuromuscular conditions. CK thresholds used in clinical practice may differ based on laboratory-specific reference values, and there is variability in reference ranges across different populations and age groups. In our institution, a CK level exceeding 171 U/L is considered elevated based on laboratory-defined upper limits. Previous studies, such as Schumann and Klauke, have also defined the upper normal CK limit as 171 U/L based on the 97.5th percentile of reference samples, which aligns with our institutional threshold. While some sources suggest that CK levels exceeding 1000 U/L warrant investigation for muscle disorders, there is still a lack of standardized reference values specific to pediatric metabolic diseases, underscoring the need for further research in this area.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by deposition of muscle protein that can be life-threatening, and identification of severity biomarkers is key. CK is usually taken as a reference to estimate prognosis; however, this is not the most effective parameter. McMahon et al performed a retrospective cohort study to develop a risk prediction tool to identify patients at greatest risk of RRT or in-hospital mortality. In total, these outcomes occurred in 19.0% of patients with rhabdomyolysis. The independent predictors identified were age, female sex, cause of rhabdomyolysis, and values of initial creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, phosphate, calcium, and bicarbonate. In the validation cohort, among patients with the lowest risk score (< 5), 2.3% died or needed RRT. Among patients with the highest risk score (> 10), 61.2% died or needed RRT. Rodríguez et al conducted a retrospective observational cohort study to assess the risk factors for AKI and to develop a risk score for early prediction. The variables of peak CK, hypoalbuminemia, metabolic acidosis, and decreased prothrombin time were independently associated with AKI. A risk score for AKI was calculated for each patient, with an OR of 1.72 (95% CI 1.45 to 2.04).

Several other retrospective studies brought forth other prediction variables for AKI, ARF, and need for RRT. Baeza-Trinidad et al found initial creatinine levels associated with progression to AKI and mortality at 30 days. The cut-off point of creatinine of 1.15 mg/dL had the best ratio of sensitivity (74.6%) and specificity (67.4%) to predict mortality. Chen et al looked at predictive factors for ARF including dark urine, initial and peak serum myoglobin level, rhabdomyolysis caused by body temperature change, and elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for RRT initiation were peak BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)/creatinine levels and CK level on the third day as rhabdomyolysis developed. The initial serum myoglobin threshold associated with development of ARF is 600 ng/mL. In ambiguous cases, clinical suspicion of rhabdomyolysis is confirmed by a positive urine or serum test for myoglobin. There is a loose correlation between CK levels and the development of ARF, with levels higher than 16 000 IU/L more likely to be associated with renal failure.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^612101ea]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute treatment of exertional rhabdomyolysis

The management of exertional rhabdomyolysis depends on the clinical presentation, with extensive coverage of treatment options beyond the scope of this article. Clinicians should have a low threshold for referral to the intensive care unit, particularly where the serum CK concentration is > 10 000 U/L, the patient needs active cooling, or there is end-organ dysfunction such as obtundation. Giving high-volume intravenous fluids early, aiming for urine outputs of above 200 mL/hour, seems beneficial; serum electrolytes should be checked frequently. Urinary alkalinisation improves myoglobin removal, though there is no evidence that sodium bicarbonate or mannitol helps. Plasma exchange — but not haemodialysis — removes myoglobin. Compartment syndrome requires immediate referral to orthopaedics or plastic surgery. All potentially causative drugs should be stopped, including statins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, supplements (weight loss treatments or creatinine), recreational drugs and others.

After discharge, the serum CK and renal function should be monitored every 72 hours; the CK or creatinine may not peak until after day 4. Monitoring can stop when the serum CK returns to below 1000 IU/L, though its failure to return to normal concentration should prompt consideration of underlying myopathy, as in case 2.

### Managing statin myopathy [^2968ccf2]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% of patients treated with statins experience some form of muscle-related side effects in clinical practice. These can range from asymptomatic creatine kinase (CK) elevation, to muscle pain, weakness, and its most severe form, rhabdomyolysis. Higher risk patients for statin myopathy are those older than 80, with a small body frame, on higher statin doses, on other medications, or with other systemic diseases including hepatic or renal diseases, diabetes mellitus, or hypothyroidism. The cause of statin myopathy is presumed to be the same for its variable presentation but has not been defined. In patients with myopathic symptoms, their symptoms and CK levels determine whether statin therapy can be continued or must be stopped.

Table 1
Definitions of statin-associated muscle symptoms proposed by the EAS Consensus Panel

In the vast majority of cases, SAMS are not accompanied by marked CK elevation. For SAMS with CK elevations > 10× ULN, usually referred to as myopathy, the incidence is approximately 1 per 10 000 per year with a standard statin dose (e.g. simvastatin 40 mg daily). The risk varies, however, among different statins, and increases not only with the dose of statin, but also with factors associated with increased statin blood concentrations (e.g. genetic factors, ethnicity, interacting drugs, and patient characteristics) (see Box 1). Rhabdomyolysis is a severe form of muscle damage associated with very high CK levels with myoglobinaemia and/or myoglobinuria with a concomitantly increased risk of renal failure. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis in association with statin therapy is ∼1 in 100 000 per year. In view of the rarity of CK elevations during statin therapy, it is not recommended to routinely monitor CK. Even if an asymptomatic elevation of CK is detected, the clinical significance is unclear.

Box 1
Risk factors for statin-associated muscle symptoms. Adapted from Mancini et al.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms are more likely to be caused by statins when elevated CK levels decrease after cessation of either the statin or the interacting drug, or when symptoms regress markedly within a few weeks of cessation of the statin and/or reappear within a month of drug re-challenge. Time to reappearance of symptoms is also influenced by the dose of statin and the duration of the re-challenge. Individual patient drug–placebo clinical trials have been suggested as an approach to confirming diagnosis of SAMS, but are not feasible in the routine outpatient setting.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis was described by Bywaters and Beall in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in 1941 who demonstrated the presence of pigmented casts in the renal tubules of victims of bombing during World War 2. Of note, this syndrome had previously been described by German pathologists and a published summary of the literature provided a description that tallied exactly with that in the BMJ. Often described as "crush syndrome", rhabdomyolysis refers to the breakdown of skeletal muscles following severe injury which may complicate trauma, major surgery, high voltage electrocution, intoxications, drug abuse and infection. It is best viewed as a multifactorial syndrome, the clinical presentation of which is variable and can range from mild muscle pain, weakness, and confusion through to critical illness requiring multi-organ support. Myoglobin release plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiological mechanisms behind rhabdomyolysis related organ dysfunction particularly acute kidney injury (AKI). Following injury, serum myoglobin concentrations rise, but due to rapid renal clearance, circulating levels may decrease within the first 24 h after the onset of symptoms. However, when the myoglobin concentration exceeds the reabsorbing capacity of the kidney, myoglobulin appears in the urine (myoglobinuria) and when detected in the first 24 h after an injury, is pathognomonic for the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. Although there is no current consensus definition for rhabdomyolysis, a recent systematic review recommends defining rhabdomyolysis as a clinical syndrome of acute muscle weakness, myalgia, and muscle swelling combined with a creatinine kinase (CK) cut-off value of > 1000 IU/L or a 5-fold increase above the upper limit of the local laboratory reported normal range (for mild rhabdomyolysis). Additionally, measured myoglobinuria and AKI might serve as indicators for the severity of rhabdomyolysis. An estimated 10 − 40% of patients with rhabdomyolysis develop AKI, with a risk that increases not only with the degree of CK rise, but also in the presence of volume depletion, sepsis and acidosis and the development of AKI increases the observed in-hospital mortality significantly. Given the fundamental role of myoglobin in the development of the rhabdomyolysis syndrome it follows that early and effective reductions in elevated levels may prevent the development of AKI and its further consequences, or at least shorten its duration.

### Beyond muscle destruction: a systematic review of rhabdomyolysis for clinical practice [^5d4c1001]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Laboratory work-up

Serum CK levels gradually increase during the first 12 h of rhabdomyolysis, peak within 3–5 days, and return to baseline during the following 6–10 days. Clinicians often use serum CK levels exceeding five times the upper limit of normal for diagnosing rhabdomyolysis.

Urinalysis can detect the presence of myoglobin when it exceeds 0.3 mg/L in serum. The heme molecule reacts in a urine dipstick but this method cannot distinguish between a positive result due to the presence of hemoglobin or myoglobin. Myoglobinuria can be considered when a patient has a reactive heme test positive for blood but the microscopic exam reveals only few red blood cells in the urine. The urine pH tends to be acidic and it often contains detectable levels of protein.

Serum CK levels have traditionally been considered the best predictor of AKI. However, Baeza-Trinidad and coworkers recently conducted a retrospective study of 522 patients with rhabdomyolysis in which both initial CK and creatinine levels were recorded. In this study, the initial CK level was not a predictor of AKI. Serum myoglobin has also been used as a predictor of AKI; Premru and coworkers found that > 15 mg/L of myoglobin in the blood was highly associated with development of AKI in a cohort of 484 patients. However, data regarding the use of myoglobin as an early marker of rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI remains inconclusive since many values of myoglobin overlap.

The Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) criteria are used in most studies nowadays to define AKI. However, different criteria have been used to establish the diagnosis of AKI after rhabdomyolysis in clinical studies. Talaie and coworkers diagnosed rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI in patients with a serum creatinine level elevation of more than 30% in the first days of admission. In another study, Iraj and coworkers established a diagnosis based on two repeated values of creatinine ≥ 1.6 mg/dL.

Conclusion

Rhabdomyolysis is a relatively uncommon but important condition seen in critically ill and injured patients. Surgical critical care providers should be familiar with the less frequently encountered metabolic etiologies of rhabdomyolysis, in addition to the well-known traumatic causes. The diagnosis is made with a combination of clinical and laboratory findings and should lead to prompt intervention to halt any processes causing muscle damage and to prevent or treat known complications of the disease. A consensus summary for the diagnosis and management of rhabdomyolysis is provided in (table 2). Although traditional therapies such as urine alkalinization and diuresis are often employed in an effort to prevent rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI, evidence-based treatments with outcome benefits are lacking. There is a critical need for quality research.

### Serum creatine kinase: requesting and interpreting results [^e14d220a]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Creatine kinase is an intracellular enzyme found abundantly in skeletal muscle, myocardium and brain. It is well known as a biomarker that increases following skeletal muscle damage and doctors instinctively associate it with myopathies. Serum creatine kinase is undoubtedly often raised in many myopathies and the extent of increase may provide a clue to the myopathic culprit. However, in other myopathies, it may be normal or only marginally raised, and rarely it is normal when the underlying pathology suggests that it should be very raised. Creatine kinase can also be raised in neurogenic disorders, and it can help in the investigation of some neurological disorders that are unrelated to neuromuscular disease. Finally, it may be discovered to be mysteriously elevated without a clear clinical correlate. Here, we examine each of these conundrums, beginning with the clinical problem at hand.

### Phenotype standardization for statin-induced myotoxicity [^14ae3cba]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Plasma CK elevation

Asymptomatic serum CK elevations (SRM 0) and muscle pain without an increase in CK (SRM 1) have been the two most commonly (occurring in up to 33% of patients) described features of statin-induced toxicity. With the increasing use of electronic medical records, it may be possible to use CK elevations to identify patients with statin myotoxicity. However, because the use of CK as a screening test for muscle injury is not recommended, the identification of an isolated CK elevation in an electronic (or paper-based) record may indicate suspicion of the clinician of muscle toxicity, even if symptoms are variably recorded. CK levels are often used as a crude estimate of severity, but the correlation between muscle symptoms and CK levels is imperfect, and the clinical interpretation of CK levels is complex. There is considerable variability in the inclusion criteria and CK levels in the literature, particularly in genetic susceptibility studies. Some authors investigate patients with self-reported myalgia and CK levels from 1 to 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) (SRM 2), whereas others apply more stringent criteria with CK elevations > 4× (ref.) (SRM 3) or > 10× the ULN (SRM 4) for myopathy and ≥ 50× the ULN for rhabdomyolysis (SRM 5), which are the criteria used in some recent industry-funded studies. To prevent inclusion of patients with CK elevations from causes other than statin myotoxicity, we have adopted the > 4× the ULN for myopathy (SRM 3) and > 10× the ULN for severe myopathy (SRM 4). Although these cutoff points have been commonly used in clinical trials and in several guidelines, they are somewhat arbitrary. However, future analyses based on these cutoff points (< 4× the ULN, 4–10× the ULN, and > 10× the ULN) will help in defining the sensitivity and specificity of different genetic markers, and provide a first step in future refinement of cutoff levels. Some investigators have also used alanine aminotransferase elevation to identify muscle injury; this may be of use when measured in combination with CK. Isolated elevation of alanine aminotransferase, in the absence of an increase in CK levels, should raise the suspicion of liver injury, which can also rarely occur with statins.

### Identifying inherited metabolic disorders in children: the role of elevated creatine kinase [^121dad80]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Elevated CK levels are an important marker in the differential diagnosis of pediatric neuromuscular and metabolic disorders. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting the role of CK in identifying inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) and establishing a potential cut-off for distinguishing IMDs from other conditions. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on neuromuscular diseases, our findings emphasize the metabolic aspect of CK elevation and its relevance in early diagnosis and intervention.

In our study, IMDs were diagnosed in 15.1% of patients with elevated CK, highlighting the necessity of considering metabolic etiologies when evaluating CK elevation. IMDs such as GSD type IIIA and Pompe disease (GSD type II) presented with the highest CK levels, reflecting their underlying pathophysiology. In GSD IIIA, CK elevation results from glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle, leading to progressive myopathy due to impaired glycogenolysis. Similarly, Pompe disease involves lysosomal glycogen storage caused by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency, contributing to both myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Other IMDs, including mitochondrial disease, TANGO2 deficiency, and adipose triglyceride lipase deficiency, also showed significant CK elevations due to their impact on energy metabolism and muscle integrity. These findings reinforce the importance of CK as a marker for metabolic myopathies but also highlight the variability in CK elevation across different IMDs.

Notably, CK elevation was not persistent in all IMDs, which is a critical consideration for clinical interpretation. Since this study was based on a single CK measurement, we could not assess temporal variations. Conditions such as fatty acid oxidation defects often exhibit episodic CK elevation triggered by metabolic stress, whereas metabolic myopathies tend to have more consistently elevated CK levels. Future studies should incorporate longitudinal CK assessments to better characterize these patterns and improve diagnostic accuracy.

Elevated AST or LDH levels, particularly in the absence of liver or hematologic disease, may serve as indirect indicators of muscle involvement and should prompt clinicians to evaluate CK levels when myopathy is suspected. In this study, a significant correlation between CK, AST, and LDH levels reinforces their potential role as supportive markers rather than primary diagnostic tools. However, these biomarkers alone are insufficient for distinguishing IMDs from other neuromuscular conditions, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive biochemical and genetic workup.

Step 2: what is the risk of developing ARF?

The second step takes place during evaluation in the emergency room, and concerns the assessment of the risk of ARF and mortality, according to a recently developed algorithm, which shows that the risk of ARF increases with a CK > 40 000 IU/L. Other risk factors are age > 50 years, female sex, initial creatinine > 1.4 mg/dL and additional metabolic changes (hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, decreased bicarbonate) (table 4). The ability to identify these patient early in the course of a rhabdomyolysis episode is useful for early institution of aggressive prophylactic measures, admission to the ward or intensive care unit, and communication with patients and families about prognosis. Scharmann has summarised the available evidence concerning therapies to prevent kidney injury in rhabdomyolysis.

DISCUSSION

Rhabdomyolysis is a life-threatening entity characterized by rapid destruction of skeletal muscle fibers, causing the release of toxic intracellular components into the bloodstream. The diagnosis of this condition requires a high index of suspicion. The most accepted diagnostic criterion is an elevation of CK greater than 1,000 U/L, considering severe rhabdomyolysis with a cutoff value of 5,000–15,000 U/L.

The classic clinical triad myalgia, muscle weakness and, pigmenturia is present in less than 10% of cases. In addition to increased amounts of serum CK, other biochemical abnormalities include elevated transaminases, LDH and myoglobin, myoglobinuria, and electrolyte or acid–base disturbances, such as hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and metabolic acidosis.

The development of rhabdomyolysis is associated with a wide variety of conditions such as trauma, drugs, toxins, autoimmune myopathies and viral infections. Although viral infection is the most frequent cause in children, it is seldom reported in adults. Influenza virus is the most common viral etiology of rhabdomyolysis; however, many others have been described, including enterovirus, HIV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, Epstein-Barr, herpes simplex, echovirus, varicella-zoster, and dengue virus.

SARS-CoV-2 has shown a wide variability of systemic manifestations. Rhabdomyolysis has been described anecdotally with just a few cases reported so far. – In addition, there were two patients with rhabdomyolysis in China's first multicenter cohort that included a total of 1,099 patients. Rhabdomyolysis can develop either as a first manifestation or as a complication of the disease, independently of the presence of respiratory symptoms. This highlights the need of a high index of suspicion, especially during the actual pandemic.

### The etiology of rhabdomyolysis: an interaction between genetic susceptibility and external triggers [^2c40910a]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis is a complex condition relevant to many medical disciplines, involving the rapid dissolution of damaged or injured skeletal muscle. This disruption of skeletal muscle integrity leads to the direct release of intracellular muscle components, including myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase and electrolytes, into the circulation and extracellular space. Clinical manifestations range from a largely asymptomatic illness with isolated serum CK level elevation (hyperCKaemia) to a life‐threatening condition with profound myoglobinuria, often leading to acute renal failure. Definitions vary, but rhabdomyolysis is most commonly defined as a clinical syndrome of severe myalgia, muscle weakness and swelling, with sudden elevation of CK levels, with or without the presence of myoglobinuria, and subsequent fall of CK levels.

Three retrospective cohort studies in a hospital setting, performed in 2005, 2009 and 2012, described the demographics and different causes of rhabdomyolysis. All three studies, performed when diagnostic genetic testing was not yet widely available, focused on external triggers as a cause for the rhabdomyolysis event and identified exogenous toxins as the most frequently reported trigger, followed by traumatic muscle injury [1, 2, 3]. However, recent reports suggest that rhabdomyolysis events can be attributed to a combination of certain environmental factors (e.g. strenuous exercise and/or febrile infection) and a predisposing genotype [4]. A combination of external triggers and genetic predisposition may thus be required for an individual to exceed the threshold for developing rhabdomyolysis (Fig. 1), and the majority of rhabdomyolysis events may therefore have to be considered multifactorial. To identify episodes of rhabdomyolysis suggestive of an underlying genetic susceptibility, we have introduced the acronym RHABDO (Box 1) [5, 6]. This acronym was developed based on an extensive literature review and has been adopted in a recent review on exertional rhabdomyolysis [7]. It aims to distinguish the patients in whom the external triggers are sufficient to explain the episode of rhabdomyolysis from those in whom the external triggers insufficiently explain the (severity of the) rhabdomyolysis event.

### Serum creatine kinase as predictor of clinical course in rhabdomyolysis: a 5-year intensive care survey [^d5298efd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the risk factors for the development of acute renal failure (ARF) in severe rhabdomyolysis.

Design

Observational historical cohort study.

Setting

General intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

Twenty-six patients with severe rhabdomyolysis, who were admitted between July 1996 and July 2001.

Measurements and Results

Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed and groups were stratified according to presence or absence of acute renal failure. The underlying cause of rhabdomyolysis was ischemia by vascular obstruction (50%), crush injury by trauma (23%), sepsis (11.5%), heatstroke/hyperthermia (11.5%) and hyponatremia in a single patient. Mean creatine kinase (CK) level was 38,351 ± 35,354 U/l on admission and rose further in all patients (mean: 59,747 ± 67,514 U/l). Renal failure developed in 17 patients (65%). Serum CK levels correlated with onset of ARF, as these patients had significantly higher admission and peak serum CK concentrations. Patients with ARF had a higher mortality (59% vs 22%).

Conclusion

In our cohort of patients with severe rhabdomyolysis the level of serum CK predicted the development of ARF. Although our results suggest that series of CK determination might be beneficial for the evaluation of the effect of therapy, the value of CK determination as a prognostic tool is limited, given the wide range of CK levels.

### Acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients with exertional rhabdomyolysis [^5a0f09fc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by muscle tissue breakdown, can result in severe complications, such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and can be fatal, with mortality rates up to 59%. Studies have shown that exertional rhabdomyolysis (ERM), caused by strenuous physical exertion, had a 10-fold increase in incidence in the US from 2000 to 2019for unknown reasons, with incidence rates varying from 1 to 31.8 per 100 000 population across different populations.

Concurrently, research on the outcomes of ERM, both AKI and CKD, and associated risk factors remains scarce. Elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels within the range of 5000 to 40 000 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167) are reportedly associated with an increased risk of AKI. However, certain studies have reported no significant association between CK and creatinine levels in ERM. A previous study found that the risk of AKI in rhabdomyolysis can exceed 50% and varies by etiology. However, earlier investigations by Clarkson et alhave suggested a significantly lower risk of AKI in ERM. The risk factors that lead to AKI in association with ERM are largely unknown. In this study, we aim to bridge these gaps by examining both the short-term and long-term outcomes of ERM and identifying predisposing factors to AKI within a broad, diverse cohort in Northern California, with a focus on hospitalized patients who are at higher risk of severe complications.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^31f82df9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Statin safety — myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are key considerations, with myopathy (incidence < 0.1%) defined as unexplained muscle symptoms with creatine kinase (CK) elevation > 10 times the upper limits of normal (ULN); when CK is above 10 000 IU/L or greater than 40 times ULN, rhabdomyolysis should be considered. Myopathy is rare, with incidence < 0.1% for most statins and 1% for simvastatin 80 mg, a dose no longer used, and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis is even lower at < 0.01%. In patients with myopathy, discontinuation of the statin usually results in resolution of muscle symptoms within days and CK returns to normal within 2 to 3 weeks, and if rhabdomyolysis is suspected, intensive hydration is usually effective in preventing renal failure. Possible risk factors include older age, female sex, diabetes, Chinese ancestry, renal insufficiency, pre-existing muscle disease, hypothyroidism, and drug interactions; in a patient with unexplained muscle symptoms, CK levels will distinguish nonserious muscle symptoms from myopathy. About 10% to 20% of statin-treated subjects in clinical trials report muscle symptoms that are usually not accompanied by CK increases, yet statin-associated muscle symptoms are caused by the statin in < 1% of patients. In a 2016 meta-analysis of 12 cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome studies in 97 000 subjects, myalgia or muscle ache occurred in 5162 (11.7%) on statins versus 5051 (11.4%) on placebo (P = 0.10), and in 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials specifically querying muscle symptoms, none found a statistically significant difference between statin and placebo groups. Re-challenge data show 90% of statin-intolerant patients tolerated the same or a different statin, and in 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) labeled statin intolerant, the vast majority could tolerate a statin under double-blind conditions.

### Phenotype standardization for statin-induced myotoxicity [^60493e05]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are effective in lowering blood cholesterol as well as in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Approximately 25 million people worldwide are taking statins. Statins are safe and effective in the majority of patients, but they are associated with muscle toxicity, which, although rare, can be serious and potentially life threatening. The clinical spectrum of statin-induced myotoxicity varies greatly from asymptomatic elevations of creatine kinase (CK) without muscle pain, to muscle pain or weakness with raised CK levels, myositis with biopsy-proven muscle inflammation, and, finally, rhabdomyolysis with muscle symptoms, high CK, and potential for acute kidney injury (Table 1). Whether statins cause muscle pain in the absence of CK changes remains controversial. Although milder forms of myotoxicity tend to be self-limiting and disappear after cessation of therapy, they can lead to poor quality of life, poor drug compliance, and, consequently, the failure to prevent cardiovascular events.

Because statin-induced myotoxicity is uncommon, it is necessary to pool and analyze data from various sources, including multicenter clinical trials and observational studies, to study genetic etiology. In addition, electronic medical records linked to biological repositories or to individual patients have been useful in identifying and recruiting patients with drug-induced toxicities. The Phenotype Standardization Project was started a few years ago to facilitate such multicenter research collaborations on various types of serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Phenotype consensus papers on drug-induced liver injury, skin injury, and torsade de pointes have been published by multidisciplinary groups of international experts. The aim of this article is to provide consensus definitions for statin-induced myotoxicity phenotypes, to facilitate cross-study comparisons from the existing cohorts, to aid in the recruitment of retrospective and newly diagnosed patients with statin-induced muscle damage, and to define the phenotype for genomic data analyses.

We convened an international expert workshop on statin-induced myotoxicity in December 2013 in Liverpool, UK, to agree on definitions and a minimum set of criteria to help in identification and recruitment. We report on the deliberations of this workshop: first, we summarize evidence of the clinical and biochemical phenotypes that have been reported, and second, we report on our suggested standardization of the terminology and phenotypes of statin-induced muscle toxicity.

In this paper a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is reported who developed rhabdomyolysis (maximum CK level, 37,700 U/L; normal, < 170 U/L), anemia (6.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (16,000/microL). This combination of rhabdomyolysis with anemia and thrombocytopenia has not yet been reported in DKA. The pathogenic mechanism leading to rhabdomyolysis in DKA remains unsettled. From the literature it seems that those patients who develop rhabdomyolysis have very high glucose levels and a high osmolality on admission. Low phosphate levels can play a role as well. The etiology of anemia and thrombocytopenia in our patient remains obscure. Intravascular hemolysis could not be demonstrated but intramedullar hemolysis, due to osmolar shift or hypophosphatemia, cannot be excluded. A review of the literature data revealed that rhabdomyolysis is not so uncommon in DKA. However, to obtain incidence data in children, prospective studies are necessary.

### MLIP causes recessive myopathy with rhabdomyolysis, myalgia and baseline elevated serum creatine kinase [^3ab8646f]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Striated muscle needs to maintain cellular homeostasis in adaptation to increases in physiological and metabolic demands. Failure to do so can result in rhabdomyolysis. The identification of novel genetic conditions associated with rhabdomyolysis helps to shed light on hitherto unrecognized homeostatic mechanisms. Here we report seven individuals in six families from different ethnic backgrounds with biallelic variants in MLIP, which encodes the muscular lamin A/C-interacting protein, MLIP. Patients presented with a consistent phenotype characterized by mild muscle weakness, exercise-induced muscle pain, variable susceptibility to episodes of rhabdomyolysis, and persistent basal elevated serum creatine kinase levels. The biallelic truncating variants were predicted to result in disruption of the nuclear localizing signal of MLIP. Additionally, reduced overall RNA expression levels of the predominant MLIP isoform were observed in patients' skeletal muscle. Collectively, our data increase the understanding of the genetic landscape of rhabdomyolysis to now include MLIP as a novel disease gene in humans and solidifies MLIP's role in normal and diseased skeletal muscle homeostasis.

Figure 1
Pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis. The pathophysiological events in rhabdomyolysis follow a common pathway, irrespective of its cause. CK, creatine kinase; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Electrolyte disturbances occurring during exercise (hypokalaemia by perspiration; hyponatraemia due to polydipsia or medications) reinforce this process. Fluid sequestration by damaged muscle leads to profound intravascular volume depletion. This shift may over time exceed 15 L and exacerbates the potential for ARF. Potassium release from muscle cells during exercise normally mediates vasodilation and an appropriately increased blood flow to muscles. Decreased potassium release due to profound hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 2.5 mEq/L) may promote the development of rhabdomyolysis by decreasing blood flow to muscles in response to exertion, thus limiting availability of energy sources. As rhabdomyolysis develops, potassium leaks from myocytes into the bloodstream causing hyperkalaemia, which can result in fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Hyponatraemia contributes to Na⁺/Ca²⁺-ATPase dysfunction, which leads to the activation of proteases and lipases that are responsible for further cell lysis. Furthermore, hyponatraemia causes failure of cell volume regulation, leading to exertional cell lysis that may stimulate vasopressin secretion. Thus, rhabdomyolysis may occur during the development of hyponatraemia, or during its correction. Combined with other cellular responses to exercise such as increased oxidative stressand release of proinflammatory cytokines, this will ultimately result in cell death and intracellular components spilling into the surrounding tissue.

### Rhabdomyolysis: a review [^fbdb03e2]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis, a syndrome of skeletal muscle breakdown with leakage of muscle contents, is frequently accompanied by myoglobinuria, and if sufficiently severe, acute renal failure with potentially life-threatening metabolic derangements may ensue. A diverse spectrum of inherited and acquired disorders affecting muscle membranes, membrane ion channels, and muscle energy supply causes rhabdomyolysis. Common final pathophysiological mechanisms among these causes of rhabdomyolysis include an uncontrolled rise in free intracellular calcium and activation of calcium-dependent proteases, which lead to destruction of myofibrils and lysosomal digestion of muscle fiber contents. Recent advances in molecular genetics and muscle enzyme histochemistry may enable a specific metabolic diagnosis in many patients with idiopathic recurrent rhabdomyolysis.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^dcd3cbb6]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have presented an overview of clinical and diagnostic aspects of ERM, in a stepwise approach. At each step, it is important to distinguish normal physiological reactions from ERM as the first manifestation of a genetic disorder. It is essential for physicians working at the 'physiological' end (sports medicine/military medicine) and those working at the clinical end of the medical spectrum (emergency medicine, internal medicine, neurology) to consider that ERM can happen to anyone who is exposed to unaccustomed exercise. The threshold, however, is much lower in patients with an underlying genetic disorder. In addition, several other exogenous and endogenous factors also lower this threshold. The most important question is whether the level and type of exercise in combination with other exogenous and endogenous factors is sufficient to explain the rhabdomyolysis episode. If not, screening for an underlying genetic (neuromuscular) disorder needs to be performed.

Future research should focus on defining specific, evidence-based training and exercise advice for patients with various myopathies, in order to prevent recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis while enabling patients to optimise their physical condition or even improve their strength. New treatments to reduce the risk of ERM should be prospectively tested in various cohorts of patients with genetic risk factors for rhabdomyolysis.

Approach to statin-associated muscle symptoms in adults — the algorithm defines statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) as "one or more muscular complaints (myalgia, weakness, tenderness) improved or resolved after dose reduction/discontinuation" with a "Minimum of 2 statin-treatment attempts (including ≥ 1 at the lowest approved dose)". It advises to "Evaluate risk factors: Age (older adults), race/ethnicity (Asian), vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism, CKD, genetics", "Correct underlying contributors (e.g., vitamin D deficiency/ hypothyroidism, drug-drug interactions etc.)", and then assess severity. For mild symptoms with "Normal/mild elevation (CK < 3 ULN)", the pathway includes "Consider rechallenge with other statin, or lower dose (including alternate-day dosing)". For moderate/severe symptoms with "CK 3-5X ULN", management includes "Add/start non-statin therapy (ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, PCSK9-based therapy and/or bile acid resins)" using shared decision-making. With "CK > 5 ULN ± rhabdomyolysis", the directive is "Discontinue statin". If "statin rechallenge fails or LDL-C not at goal", proceed based on "Clinical judgment".

The utility of muscle biopsy in patients with modest elevations of serum creatine kinase (CK) level but normal neurological examinations and nondiagnostic electrodiagnostic studies is uncertain. We performed systematic, extensive studies on muscle biopsies of 20 such patients. A definitive diagnosis was arrived at in only 1 by histochemical studies, although 4 others demonstrated minor myopathic changes. Biochemical evaluation led to a diagnosis in an additional 5. Muscle biopsy is useful for evaluating such patients, but extensive studies of the muscle are necessary.

### Intolerance to statins: mechanisms and management [^fc10538e]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statins are considered very effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients. However, although adherence to statins improves morbidity and mortality, it remains suboptimal. One of the most important causes of nonadherence is the so-called statin intolerance, mainly because of muscle-related symptoms. These symptoms most often consist of myalgia unaccompanied by significant creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Less often, myositis (elevated CK > 10 times the upper limit of normal) or rhabdomyolysis (CK level > 10,000 IU/L or accompanied by significant elevation in creatinine level) develops.

In randomized controlled trials, the incidence of statin myopathy is ~1.5–5.0%. However, this low incidence may be misleading for several reasons. First, in most studies patients with a history of statin intolerance were excluded. Other studies had a single-blinded statin run-in phase, and patients experiencing muscle-related symptoms or CK elevations during this phase were excluded. Patients who tend to be at risk for developing muscle-related symptoms, such as women, elderly patients, and patients with significant comorbidity, who comprise a large proportion of statin-treated patients in real-life settings, are underrepresented in randomized controlled trials. Some studies have defined muscle-related effects by elevated CK levels only, disregarding myalgia. Last but not least, patients enrolled in studies might be motivated and so minimize reporting of mild myalgias, thus leading to underestimation of the magnitude of the problem.

### Rosuvstatin [^31304d73]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Rosuvastatin may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including rosuvastatin.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher rosuvastatin dosage. Asian patients on rosuvastatin may be at higher risk for myopathy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]. The myopathy risk is greater in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg daily compared with lower rosuvastatin dosages.

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

The concomitant use of rosuvastatin with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended. Rosuvastatin dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral medications, darolutamide, and regorafenib [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue rosuvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if rosuvastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue rosuvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the rosuvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

Introduction

Approximately 44% of patients on isotretinoin develop elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), a proxy for potential muscle tissue damage. Mild elevations are typically transient and well-tolerated, whereas marked elevations can indicate rhabdomyolysis (CK level of ≥ 5 times the reference range [approximately 200 IU/L]) and can be life-threatening. Here, we present 2 physically active patients with clinically divergent presentations of elevated serum CK levels during isotretinoin therapy.

Abstract

Background

Skeletal muscle injury in Ebola virus disease (EVD) has been reported, but its association with morbidity and mortality remains poorly defined.

Methods

This retrospective study included patients admitted to 2 EVD treatment units over an 8-month period in 2019 during an EVD epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Results

An overall 333 patients (median age, 30 years; 58% female) had at least 1 creatine kinase (CK) measurement (n = 2229; median, 5/patient [IQR, 1–11]). Among patients, 271 (81%) had an elevated CK level (> 380 U/L); 202 (61%) had rhabdomyolysis (CK > 1000 IU/L); and 45 (14%) had severe rhabdomyolysis (≥ 5000 U/L). Among survivors, the maximum CK level was a median 1600 (IQR, 550–3400), peaking 3.4 days after admission (IQR, 2.3–5.5) and decreasing thereafter. Among fatal cases, the CK rose monotonically until death, with a median maximum CK level of 2900 U/L (IQR, 1500–4900). Rhabdomyolysis at admission was an independent predictor of acute kidney injury (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.2–3.8]; P = 0.0065) and mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.03–2.9]; P = 0.037).

Conclusions

Rhabdomyolysis is associated with acute kidney injury and mortality in patients with EVD. These findings may inform clinical practice by identifying laboratory monitoring priorities and highlighting the importance of fluid management.

### Acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis and renal replacement therapy: a critical review [^8dc88590]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis, a clinical syndrome caused by damage to skeletal muscle and release of its breakdown products into the circulation, can be followed by acute kidney injury (AKI) as a severe complication. The belief that the AKI is triggered by myoglobin as the toxin responsible appears to be oversimplified. Better knowledge of the pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis and following AKI could widen treatment options, leading to preservation of the kidney: the decision to initiate renal replacement therapy in clinical practice should not be made on the basis of the myoglobin or creatine phosphokinase serum concentrations.

Other external or acquired provoking factors

In addition to unaccustomed physical exercise, other factors contributing to the risk of ERM include inadequate hydration, high ambient temperatures, supplement use (ephedra, creatinine and herbal weight loss supplements) or certain medications (statins, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), illicit drug or alcohol use, or recent viral illnesses. This is illustrated by the report of a 31-year-old athlete and physiology professor who experienced an episode of rhabdomyolysis after resistance training, where high intrinsic motivation, mental stress, use of supplements and dehydration were identified as probably additive provoking factors. Along similar lines, the rare reported cases of rhabdomyolysis with ARF in marathon runners most likely result from the combination of several factors, such as heat stress, dehydration, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or other analgesic use, viral or bacterial infection, and possibly latent myopathies.

Most recently, obstacle races combining aerobic and anaerobic activities performed at different environmental settings (eg, running and/or crawling on mud, diving in freezing water and being exposed to electrical discharges, which are commonly followed by alcohol intake) such as Tough Mudder are becoming popular. This is associated with various risk factors for rhabdomyolysis such as extenuating exercise, dehydration and exposure to heat, infectious disease, electrical pulses, physical trauma and alcohol consumption.

Furthermore, intense and enthusiastic coaching or challenge by peers is the force that drives the already highly motivated professional or recreational athletes beyond their limit of exertion in many cases. This includes sports teams, as well as inmates in prison and soldiers.

Symptoms of CK increase

In many patients, early, uncomplicated rhabdomyolysis is subtle, with delayed-onset myalgia and localised oedema being the only noted symptoms. Myalgia typically occurs 12–36 hours after the exercise. In a minority of patients, generalised weakness and myoglobinuria are the presenting symptoms. However, not all patients present with this classic triad. Other symptoms include fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever. In severe cases, patients may have delirium and oliguria. Muscle pain and weakness can continue during and after recovery from rhabdomyolysis. In theory, an inflammatory myopathy may occur with subsequent fibrosis of muscle tissue. If the patient is asymptomatic with a persistent and stable raised CK, consider an underlying neuromuscular condition such as muscular dystrophy (table 1).

### Myotoxicity associated with lipid-lowering drugs [^50413c14]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lipid-lowering drugs are associated with myotoxicity, which ranges in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis resulting in renal failure and death. Although rhabdomyolysis is rare, muscle symptoms and serum creatine kinase elevations are sufficiently frequent during the course of lipid-lowering drug therapy to pose diagnostic challenges for the clinician. Progress in our understanding of this form of myotoxicity is reviewed.

Recent Findings

Muscle pain and weakness are the cardinal symptoms and often interfere with vigorous exercise. These symptoms may occur with or without serum creatine kinase elevations. The risk of myotoxicity is increased by combination statin-fibrate therapy as well as by factors that elevate tissue levels of the lipid-lowering drug, including the dose, drug-drug interactions, and host factors. Underlying neuromuscular diseases may become clinically apparent during statin therapy and may predispose to myotoxicity. The pathophysiology of myotoxicity most probably involves metabolic effects of the statins on the isoprenoid pool and on mitochondrial function.

Summary

Management of myotoxicity requires an evaluation of risk factors prior to prescribing lipid-lowering drugs, attention to muscle symptoms, and withdrawal of drug in the event of significant abnormalities.

### Rhabdomyolysis in intensive care unit-distinctive clinical indicators and prognosis [^78c26154]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, although rhabdomyolysis has been reported in tumor patients following targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, our study found a lower incidence of malignant tumors in the RML group. This suggests that while rhabdomyolysis is a potential complication, it is relatively uncommon among ICU patients with malignancies. Muscle weakness, a notable symptom of rhabdomyolysis, was significantly more common in the RML group, highlighting its diagnostic importance. Additionally, the RML group had a markedly lower surgical intervention rate, suggesting that other factors contribute prominently to rhabdomyolysis occurrence.

For diagnosing rhabdomyolysis, while medical history and physical examinations offer valuable insights, laboratory studies confirm the diagnosis. CK levels are the most sensitive indicators of myocyte injury in rhabdomyolysis. Our analysis revealed significantly elevated CK levels in the RML group, alongside increased serum myoglobin and troponin I levels. Elevated myoglobin can lead to AKI through myoglobin precipitation with Tamm-Horsfall protein in acidic urine, causing tubular occlusion, and through hydroxyl radical oxidation. Troponin levels, although typically associated with cardiac conditions, can also be elevated due to non-cardiac causes such as rhabdomyolysis. Our findings confirmed abnormally elevated levels of troponin in the RML group.

### Common and rare variants associating with serum levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase [^cc6fad3c]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The release of intracellular enzymes into the serum is an indicator of tissue damage and physiological cell turnover. Thus, measurements of intracellular enzymes in serum are widely used to diagnose tissue damage, monitor its course and severity and gauge the effect of therapy.

Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme, catalyzing the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of creatine that is important for energy buffering in tissues with variable energy demands, most notably skeletal and cardiac muscle. Elevated serum CK levels can indicate tissue damage, and are observed in a number of pathological conditions, including statin-induced myopathy. Monitoring changes in serum CK levels is therefore important in statin-treated patients who display muscle pain or weakness, and in patients deemed at risk of rhabdomyolysis for various reasons.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme with a ubiquitous expression. It is responsible for catalyzing the anaerobic, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which is important during times of high muscular activity. Serum CK and LDH levels were previously used as biomarkers to diagnose myocardial infarction. Because of low specificity, however, they have been replaced by troponin T and troponin I, measured through high-sensitivity assays.

The heritability of LDH levels has been estimated between 40 and 50% (refs,) and upwards of 38% for CK. Our own data indicates a 19.33 and 19.36% heritability for CK and LDH, respectively. A recently published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 3,232,779 imputed variants in 3,412 statin users found two missense variants affecting serum CK levels, one in CKM (rs11559024) and one in LILRB5 (rs12975366). An association of a variant in CD163 (rs7136716) with serum CK levels has also been reported. To date, no systematic GWAS has been carried out to search for sequence variants influencing serum LDH levels.

To search for common and rare variants that associate with CK or LDH levels, we tested variants detected in a large sequencing study in Iceland for association with these traits. This unbiased approach has the potential to uncover previously unexpected molecular mechanisms regulating levels of this enzyme in serum. A thorough understanding of sequence variants influencing these biomarkers is important to improve the usefulness of their measurements, and in the assessment of tissue damage.

### Influenza-induced rhabdomyolysis [^28b2c25c]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rhabdomyolysis is characterised by breakdown of muscle tissue causing release of CK, aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, ALT and AST into the blood. Prompt recognition is critical to prevent permanent renal injury. Common causes of rhabdomyolysis include trauma, excessive exercise, medications, metabolic myopathies, electrolyte disturbances, connective tissue diseases, toxins and infections. The most common cause of virus-associated rhabdomyolysis is influenza. In a case series of 18 cases of H1N1 influenza, 62% of patients had elevated CK levels above 200 U/L. In an adult study of 505 patients, it was found that higher CK levels at the time of admission were associated with renal failure, dialysis requirement, mechanical ventilation and increased length of hospital stay.

Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, muscle weakness and fatigue. Other clinical manifestations include dark urine, nausea, confusion, decreased urine output and metabolic derangements such as hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia and transaminitis. The onset is usually within the first week of onset of respiratory symptoms.

The mechanism of rhabdomyolysis in influenza infection appears to be due to direct viral invasion of myocytes. In a porcine model, it was found that muscle cells express sialic acid receptors similar to respiratory epithelial cells, which serve as binding sites for the virus.

Furthermore, Desdouits et al studied the in vitro infectivity of influenza A, H1N1 subtype, to muscle cells from three healthy donors and found that the differentiated muscle cells were highly susceptible to infection and that progeny of those viruses were able to infect other muscle cells, suggesting that most or all of the viral cell cycle can be completed inside muscle cells in vitro. Interestingly, we observed a temporal correlation between fever spikes and a rise in serum CK level (figure 1). This predictable rise in serum CK occurred about 6 hours after a temperature spike. It is unclear what the precise mechanism is between the rise in the temperature and subsequent CK elevation but could be due to either direct viral invasion of myocytes or due to release of viral progeny following replication.

### Serum creatine kinase levels and renal function measures in exertional muscle damage [^4e0c87ec]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are commonly used to judge the severity of muscle damage and to determine when to hospitalize patients who present with symptoms of exertional rhabdomyolysis in order to prevent renal failure. However, no CK standard exists because of the limited information available regarding exercise-induced CK elevation and renal function. This study determined the magnitude of CK elevation and the effect on renal function produced by exercise in a large subject group.

Methods

Blood samples were obtained from 203 volunteers who performed 50 maximal eccentric contractions of the elbow flexor muscles. The samples, taken before and 4, 7, and 10 d after exercise, were analyzed for markers of muscle damage (CK, myoglobin (Mb), lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase and for measures of renal function (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, osmolality, and uric acid).

Results

All indicators of muscle damage increased significantly after exercise (P < 0.01). CK levels were 6420, 2100, and 311% above baseline on days 4, 7, and 10 after the exercise, respectively (P < 0.01), and Mb was 1137, 170, and 28% above baseline on days 4, 7, and 10 after exercise, respectively (P < 0.01). Of the 203 participants, 111 had CK values at 4 d postexercise > 2,000 U·L⁻¹ and 51 had values > 10,000 U x L(-1), levels used to diagnose myopathy (e.g., statin myositis) and rhabdomyolysis, respectively. There were no significant increases in any measure of renal function. Despite marked CK and Mb elevations in some subjects, none experienced visible myoglobinuria or required treatment for impaired renal function.

Conclusions

Exertional muscle damage produced by eccentric exercise in healthy individuals can cause profound CK and Mb elevations without renal impairment.

### Beyond muscle destruction: a systematic review of rhabdomyolysis for clinical practice [^548f5c7d]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and etiology

Many cases of rhabdomyolysis are not detected and the incidence of this clinical entity has been reported only in subgroups of populations at risk. Rhabdomyolysis is more frequent among males, African-Americans, patients < 10 and > 60 years old, and in people with a body mass index exceeding 40 kg/m².

The causes of rhabdomyolysis have been classified differently by several authors. Zimmerman and Shen used a classification based on their mechanism of injury (hypoxic, physical, chemical, and biologic). Other authors described alternative classifications such as physical/non-physical, exertional/non-exertional, and acquired/inherited. Table 3 distinguishes rhabdomyolysis according to acquired and inherited causes and includes some examples of the most common etiologies reported in the medical literature. Causes of rhabdomyolysis are also different depending on the age; trauma, drugs, and infections are the most commonly reported in adults while trauma, viral infections, drugs, and exercise etiologies prevail in children.

Table 3
Rhabdomyolysis etiology classification

Muscle toxicity due to several drugs may arise either by a direct mechanism or through drug interactions. A retrospective study of 8610 cases of drug-associated rhabdomyolysis reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2004 to 2009 found that simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin were most frequently suspected and accounted for 3945 cases (45%). Statin drugs all have the potential to cause muscle damage in a dose-dependent manner, although they vary in several characteristics. Simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin are metabolized by CYP3A4 (the most common cytochrome P 450 isozyme), which necessarily leads to competition with other drugs for metabolism, increasing statin blood levels and predisposing to toxicity. Rosuvastatin and fluvastatin are metabolized by the CYP2A9 isozyme and therefore carry less risk of drug interaction. Some degree of muscle toxicity is experienced by 0.08–10% of patients being treated with statins alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering drugs. However, less than 1% have significant elevation of serum CK levels.

The number of rhabdomyolysis cases associated with surgery seems to have been increasing over recent years. Several related risk factors include extended length of surgery and comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes. As the length of surgery increases, so does the time spent in immobility, raising the likelihood of secondary tissue compression and ischemia. Drugs used for anesthesia (propofol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and opiates) have also been associated with rhabdomyolysis.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^2b7b872f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

National Lipid Association statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) evaluation — baseline creatine kinase (CK) can be helpful and pretreatment CK may be considered in higher-risk patients, including those with significant drug-drug interactions, certain chronic diseases, or prior severe statin myopathy (i.e., rhabdomyolysis, CK > 5x ULN). Prior NLA guidance suggests withholding statin therapy for CK levels > 3 times ULN, and ACC/AHA guidelines recommends withholding statin therapy for CK levels > 5 x ULN; post-treatment CK is particularly important when evaluating suspected myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Measurement of anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) antibodies, electromyography, muscle strength testing, and muscle biopsy are described as neither pragmatic for clinical practice nor routinely recommended, while hypothyroidism should be ruled out and vitamin D levels measured and supplemented if deficient.

### The utility of electrodiagnostic testing in unprovoked rhabdomyolysis in the era of next-generation sequencing [^94346bdf]. Muscle & Nerve (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Rhabdomyolysis is an etiologically heterogeneous, acute necrosis of myofibers characterized by transient marked creatine kinase (CK) elevation associated with myalgia, muscle edema, and/or weakness. The study aimed to determine the role of electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing relative to genetic testing and muscle biopsy in patients with unprovoked rhabdomyolysis in identifying an underlying myopathy.

Methods

EDX database was reviewed to identify unprovoked rhabdomyolysis patients who underwent EDX testing between January 2012 and January 2022. Each patient's clinical profile, EDX findings, muscle pathology, laboratory, and genetic testing results were analyzed.

Results

Of 66 patients identified, 32 had myopathic electromyography (EMG). Muscle biopsy and genetic testing were performed in 41 and 37 patients, respectively. A definitive diagnosis was achieved in 15 patients (11 myopathic EMG and 4 nonmyopathic EMG; p = .04) based on abnormal muscle biopsy (4/11 patients) or genetic testing (12/12 patients, encompassing 5 patients with normal muscle biopsy and 3 patients with nonmyopathic EMG). These included seven metabolic and eight nonmetabolic myopathies (five muscular dystrophies and three ryanodine receptor 1 [RYR1]-myopathies). Patients were more likely to have baseline weakness (p < .01), elevated baseline CK (p < .01), and nonmetabolic myopathies (p = .03) when myopathic EMG was identified.

Discussion

Myopathic EMG occurred in approximately half of patients with unprovoked rhabdomyolysis, more likely in patients with weakness and elevated CK at baseline. Although patients with myopathic EMG were more likely to have nonmetabolic myopathies, nonmyopathic EMG did not exclude myopathy, and genetic testing was primarily helpful to identify an underlying myopathy. Genetic testing should likely be first-tier diagnostic testing following unprovoked rhabdomyolysis.

### Relationship of creatine kinase elevation and acute kidney injury in pediatric trauma patients [^c70a0c67]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Rhabdomyolysis following trauma has been associated with renal impairment. Nevertheless, the literature is scant in risk assessment of acute kidney injury (AKI) and survival in children experiencing posttraumatic rhabdomyolysis.

Methods

After institutional review board approval was obtained, the registry of an urban trauma center was reviewed for pediatric (age < 18 years) trauma admissions with available creatine kinase (CK) values. Variables extracted included demographics and trauma severity indices along with serum creatine, CK, and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) values. AKI was defined per pediatric RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End stage) definition. Regression models were deployed to determine the independent risk factors for AKI and CK levels.

Results

Overall, 521 patients constituted the study sample. AKI occurred in 70 patients (13.4%), with correlation to CK values in excess of 3,000 IU/L (41.4% vs. 4.9%, adjusted p < 0.001). Independent risk factors for AKI proved to be CK level of 3,000 or greater (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 11.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.56–26.64; p < 0.001), Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 15 or less (AOR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10–0.61), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less (AOR, 15.00; 95% CI, 4.98–44.94), abdominal Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 3 or less (AOR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.04–5.36), imaging studies with contrast of 3 or less (AOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.37–10.57), blunt mechanism of injury (AOR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.17–6.49), administration of nephrotoxic agents (AOR, 4.81; 95% CI, 1.23–18.79), and requirement for fluids administration in the emergency department (AOR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.04–5.36). Mortality in the study sample with CK values of 3,000 or greater versus less than 3,000 IU/L did not reach statistical significance (25.0% vs. 9.3%, adjusted p = 0.787).

Conclusion

AKI in pediatric posttraumatic rhabdomyolysis occurs in 13% of trauma patients. CK values of 3,000 IU/L or greater pose a significant adjusted risk for AKI. Aggressive monitoring of CK values in pediatric trauma patients is warranted.

### Identifying inherited metabolic disorders in children: the role of elevated creatine kinase [^62de3d87]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

This retrospective study was conducted using data from the Pediatric Metabolism Outpatient Clinic between June 2023 and February 2024. Only patients with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, defined as values exceeding the upper limit of the reference range (5–171 U/L), were included in the final analysis. Patients with liver or kidney failure, as well as those with documented recent trauma (within one week) or active infection at the time of CK measurement, were excluded from the study. Patients were categorized into three diagnostic groups based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic findings:

Idiopathic: Patients without a definitive diagnosis.
IMD-Diagnosed: Patients with confirmed inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs), as classified according to Saudubray's textbook on inherited metabolic disorders. Diagnosis was established in all IMD-diagnosed cases based on biochemical and genetic findings, with pathogenicity assessments following ACMG criteria. The classification of genetic variants as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) was based on ACMG/AMP guidelines.
Other Diseases: Patients with conditions unrelated to inherited metabolic diseases.

Biochemical measurements

Serum biochemical parameters analyzed in this study included CK, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, potassium, and creatinine. The following normal reference ranges were used to interpret the results: CK (5–171 U/L), AST (10–36 U/L), ALT (10–40 U/L), LDH (143–370 U/L), uric acid (3.5–7.2 mg/dL), potassium (3.5–5.1 mmol/L), and creatinine (0.2–0.9 mg/dL). Values exceeding these reference ranges were considered elevated. ALP and GGT were included in the descriptive biochemical analysis presented in Table 1 but were not further interpreted, as they are not directly indicative of muscle pathology. All biochemical analyses were performed using standard automated biochemical analyzers available in the institutional clinical laboratory, and enzyme activity assays were conducted using commercially available kits following manufacturer protocols.
