## Question

Let ABC be a triangle. Take n point lying on the side AB (different from A and B) and connect all of them by straight lines to the vertex C. Similarly, take n points on the side AC and connect them to B. Into how many regions is the triangle ABC partitioned by these lines?

Further, take n points on the side BC also and join them with A. Assume that no three straight lines meet at a point other than A, B and C. Into how many regions is the triangle ABC partitioned now?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many regions a triangle is divided into when we draw lines from vertices to n points on the opposite sides, first with two sets of lines and then with three sets, under the assumption that no three lines meet at a point other than the vertices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the base case with no interior lines. Then, I should verify the effect of adding one family of lines from a vertex to n points on the opposite side. Next, I will examine what happens when we add a second family of lines from a different vertex and count the new intersections. After that, I need to consider the third family and how to generalize the pattern. Finally, I will double-check the formula with small values of n to ensure correctness and state the general result clearly.

> Let me first confirm the base case: a triangle with no interior lines has exactly 1 region, which is the triangle itself, so the count is 1 when n = 0.

> Now, I will consider the first family of lines. If I place n points on side AB and draw lines from each to vertex C, these lines are concurrent at C and do not intersect elsewhere, so they divide the triangle into n + 1 regions. Wait, let me verify that: with 1 point on AB, I get 2 regions; with 2 points, 3 regions; yes, the pattern is n + 1 regions for n lines from C to AB, so the formula holds.

> Next, I should review what happens when I add a second family of lines. I will place n points on side AC and draw lines from each to vertex B. These lines are concurrent at B and, by assumption, no three lines meet at an interior point, so each new line from B to AC will intersect each of the existing n lines from C to AB at distinct interior points. That means each new line creates n + 1 new regions, because it crosses n existing lines and is itself divided into n + 1 segments, each of which splits an existing region into two. Hold on, I should verify the cumulative effect: starting from n + 1 regions, adding the first B-line adds n + 1 regions, the second adds n + 1 regions, and so on, so after n such lines I have added n(n + 1) regions, giving a total of (n + 1) + n(n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 1) = (n + 1)² regions. Let me double-check with n = 1: 2² = 4 regions, which matches the expected geometry, so this looks correct.

> I will now examine the case with three families of lines. I need to add n points on side BC and draw lines from each to vertex A. Each new line from A to BC will intersect the existing 2n lines (n from C to AB and n from B to AC) at 2n distinct interior points, so it is divided into 2n + 1 segments, each of which splits a region. Therefore, each A-line adds 2n + 1 new regions. Adding n such lines adds n(2n + 1) regions. Starting from (n + 1)² regions, the total becomes (n + 1)² + n(2n + 1). Let me expand and simplify: (n² + 2n + 1) + (2n² + n) = 3n² + 3n + 1. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might simplify to 3n(n + 1) + 1, but that would be 3n² + 3n + 1, which is exactly what I have, so the formula is correct as 3n² + 3n + 1.

> Let me reconsider and sanity-check with small n. For n = 0, I should get 1 region: 3(0)² + 3(0) + 1 = 1, which matches. For n = 1, I should get 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 regions. Let me visualize: with one line from C to AB, one from B to AC, and one from A to BC, I expect 7 regions, which aligns with the formula. For n = 2, I should get 3(4) + 3(2) + 1 = 12 + 6 + 1 = 19 regions. I won't draw all 19, but the growth rate is consistent with the combinatorics of intersections and segments, so the pattern is plausible.

> Therefore, I can conclude: with n points on AB connected to C and n points on AC connected to B, the triangle is divided into (n + 1)² regions. With the addition of n points on BC connected to A, the total number of regions is 3n² + 3n + 1, under the assumption that no three lines meet at an interior point.

---

The triangle is divided into **(n + 1)² regions** when n points on AB are connected to C and n points on AC are connected to B. When n points on BC are also connected to A, the total number of regions becomes **3n² + 3n + 1**. These formulas assume no three lines meet at a single interior point, which maximizes the number of regions.

---

## Step 1: Connecting points on AB to C and points on AC to B

- **Lines from AB to C**: n lines from n points on AB to C divide the triangle into n + 1 regions.
- **Lines from AC to B**: n lines from n points on AC to B intersect the n lines from AB to C, creating additional regions.
- **Total regions**: The number of regions is (n + 1)².

---

## Step 2: Connecting points on BC to A

- **Additional lines**: n lines from n points on BC to A intersect the existing 2n lines (n from AB to C and n from AC to B).
- **New intersections**: Each new line intersects 2n existing lines, creating 2n + 1 segments and adding 2n + 1 new regions.
- **Total regions**: The total number of regions becomes 3n² + 3n + 1.

---

## General formula

| **Configuration** | **Number of regions** |
|-|-|
| AB to C and AC to B | (n + 1)² |
| AB to C, AC to B, and BC to A | 3n² + 3n + 1 |

---

## Verification with small values of n

- **N = 1**: (1 + 1)² = 4 regions; 3(1)² + 3(1) + 1 = 7 regions.
- **N = 2**: (2 + 1)² = 9 regions; 3(2)² + 3(2) + 1 = 19 regions.
- **N = 3**: (3 + 1)² = 16 regions; 3(3)² + 3(3) + 1 = 37 regions.

---

## Conclusion

The triangle is divided into **(n + 1)² regions** when n points on AB are connected to C and n points on AC are connected to B. When n points on BC are also connected to A, the total number of regions is **3n² + 3n + 1**.

### Glass-cutting medical images via a mechanical image segmentation method based on crack propagation [^b06e7ef0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Initial crack

In each partial model, we set an initial crack. The initial crack will grow along grooves under external load until reaching object boundaries. For the first local model, the initial crack needs to be specified. After completing crack propagation in the current region, the next local model can be determined according to the position and the orientation of the crack. The new area will partially overlap the old one so that it can contain the end portion of the crack in the previous area as the initial crack.

The initial crack in the first local model can be provided either manually or automatically (Fig. 10b). In the manual method (top half of Fig. 10b), one needs only to choose a short line a few pixels in length along the target boundary as the position of the initial crack in the mechanical model. This selection is simple and accurate because the target boundary is generally very clear in such a location and there is an obvious groove corresponding to the target boundary in the mechanical model. For the automatic method (bottom half of Fig. 10b), the initial crack can be generated by the following procedure: define the side length of square ABCD representing the local image to be 2 L. The target boundary intersects with the two parallel edges AD and BC. Draw a straight line starting from P M1, the midpoint of the side AB, and passing through P M2, the midpoint of the side DC, ending at the point O. The distance from P M1 to O is N times the length of AB (N > 1). Therefore, a triangle AOB is formed with angle at point O equal to φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N)). Dividing φ by an integer m defines the angle increment, Δ φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N))/ m. Starting at line OA, and sweeping toward line OB by incrementing the angle by Δ φ each iteration, the ray with angle φ i = i Δ φ (i = 0, 1, 2,…) will intersect the target boundary at the point P i in this local image area. Because the grayscale value of the pixels at the target boundary changes significantly, an edge-detection operator, such as the Canny edge detector, can easily identify the coordinates of the points P i. After detecting several boundary points, the initial crack of the first local model can be automatically formed by connecting these points to form a small line segment.

### Quantification of surgical route parameters for exposure of the jugular foramen via a trans-mastoidal approach exposing jugular foramen in three-dimensional visualization model [^7f42670d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Surgical operation within the region of the jugular foramen presents a great challenge. The authors characterized the quantitative impact of surgical window parameters on the exposure of the jugular foramen via a trans-mastoidal approach.

Methods

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data were used to establish a 3-dimensional model of the jugular foramen region. The mastoidale, posterior edge of the mastoid, and the superior edge of the bony external acoustic meatus were selected as points a, b, and c. The anterior edge of the tuberculum jugulare was selected as point d. The midpoints of line segments ab, ac, and bc were selected as points e, f, and g. Triangle abc was divided into triangles aef, beg, cfg, and efg. Surgical corridors of the triangular pyramid were outlined by connecting the above triangles to point d. Anatomic exposure was evaluated by measuring the area and volume of various structures within each route. Statistical comparisons were performed via analysis of variance.

Results

The model allowed for adequate visualization of all structures. The areas of triangles beg and efg were greater than those of triangles aef and cfg (P < 0.05). The volumes of triangular pyramids d-beg and d-cfg were greater than those of triangular pyramids d-aef and d-efg (P = 0.000). Statistically significant differences were also observed for volumes of osseous, venous, and cranial nerve structures in all divided routes (P = 0.000).

Conclusion

Our results indicate that 3-dimensional modeling may aid in the quantification of surgical exposure and that division of the craniotomy window may allow for more precise operation.

### Group testing via hypergraph factorization applied to COVID-19 [^3353d55e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The first step (Setup) is to obtain a sequence of pool assignments (AB, CD, etc.) via hypergraph factorization. As illustrated in Fig. 1, we think of the m pools (A-F) as vertices (i.e. the black labeled points) and thepossible pool assignments (AB, AC, etc.) as hyperedges (i.e. the blue lines connecting q vertices each). A set of hyperedges (taken with the set of vertices) is called a hypergraph, and factorizing the hypergraph means partitioning the hyperedges (i.e. pool assignments) into subsets that each use all the vertices (i.e. pools) exactly once (see the Supplementary Material for more detail). In our example, this yields the five subsets shown as little hypergraphs within the circle of pool assignments: {AB, CD, EF}, {BC, DF, AE}, and so on. The setup step concludes by simply reading off the list to obtain the sequence of pool assignments: AB, CD, EF, BC, and so on until AC.

The next step (Stage 1) is pooled testing to identify putative positives. First, place individuals in pools by cycling through the sequence of pool assignments, i.e. individual 1 is placed in pools A and B, individual 2 is placed in pools C and D, and so on. This yields a pooling design that assigns the n = 12 individuals to q = 2 of the m = 6 pools (which we denote as H₁₂,₆,₂). We do not use allpool assignments in the sequence here since there are only 12 individuals. For more than 15 individuals, we would simply cycle through the sequence again until all the individuals were assigned. Next, we test the pools (pools B-D test positive in our example), and from these results, we identify putative positives in a process called decoding. For this step, HYPER uses conservative decoding, in which an individual is declared putative positive if it was in no negative pools. Namely, we eliminate all individuals in negative pools; the remaining individuals (who are in only positive pools) are the putative positives. Performing this elimination process in our example yields putative positive individuals 2, 4, and 7.

3 RESULTS

Figure 2 shows the general form of the E max versus magnetic energy curves for all configurations studied, and for each of the X, Y, and Z coils. These L‐shaped curves demonstrate that the maximum E‐field on the body can, in some cases, be reduced substantially without dramatic increase in magnetic energy. However, below a certain constrained E‐field value, characterized by the knee of the curve, the magnetic energy begins to rise rapidly. There is a well‐defined minimum achievable E‐field shown by the vertical asymptote of each curve.

FIGURE 2
Solution results for X (A), Y (B), and Z (C) gradient directions, all using 50% male body model. The electric field (E‐field) constraint is progressively lowered while the energy is minimized. Magnetic Energy (y‐axis) is per unit gradient strength of 1 T/m, and Peak Electric Field (x‐axis) is per unit slew rate of 1 T/m/s. The black, red, green, and blue solid and dashed lines represent currents flowing in regions ABC, BC, C, and A, respectively. The dashed lines are solutions in which no B 0 concomitant field offset was allowed at gradient isocenter. The red dotted lines correspond to a primary winding placed on surface acd and a shield winding on surface ab. The purple dotted lines correspond to a primary winding on surface cd and shield winding on surface ab. The open diamonds are with no E‐field constraint. The solid filled diamonds denote E max ‐constrained solutions near the knee of the A region curves

### Learning-related representational changes reveal dissociable integration and separation signatures in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex [^5d4a9de7]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Dissociable coding signatures across the long axis of HPC

Participants viewed brief presentations of single A, B, and C items during hr-fMRI scanning both before and after learning of overlapping AB and BC associations. We then investigated learning-related changes in the neural representations of indirectly related A and C items for evidence of separation and integration using a representational similarity analysis (RSA)searchlight constrained to anatomical regions of interest (ROIs). For all searchlights, we looked for voxels exhibiting one of the four hypothesized learning-related signatures in A–C RS (Fig. 2): (1) integration for both learning conditions; (2) separation for both learning conditions; (3) interaction, with blocked → integration (in line with the prediction that established AB memories would promote integration); and (4) interaction, with intermixed → integration (in line with the prediction that more recent AB memories would promote integration). All analyses were limited to those A and C items for which the AC inference judgment was correct during the test.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^55f4a482]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Sequential Bayesian inference can be rewritten in a form that more closely resembles a sum of evidence by taking the logarithm of equation (8):For each of the n -choices, the accumulated evidence is the log posterior, with n distinct evidence incrementsand a common subtractive log-marginal term. Calculation of this log-marginal is necessary for multiple (n > 3) choice optimal decision-making, but can be avoided for n = 2 by using the SPRT as mentioned above. A similarterm in a theory of basal ganglia function has been interpreted as suppressing evidence accumulation when choices are ambiguous –.

Within this framework, using that probabilities sum to unity ∑ᵢ Pᵢ(t) = 1, the evidence accumulation takes place within an (n − 1)-dimensional linear subspace spanning n vertices { P i = 1, P j ≠ i = 0} of an N -dimensional unit hypercube. This is most easily seen for N = 3 choices, where the decision variables P = (P 1, P 2, P 3) vary within a triangle passing through three vertices {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} of the unit cube (Fig. 1, top right panel). So rather than representing evidence accumulation trajectories as a random walk constrained to two dimensions, for multiple alternatives the random walk moves in higher dimensions (a line for two alternatives, a plane/triangle for three, and so on). For simplicity, this vector is initialized with equal prior probabilities 1/n and updated sequentially until one of the elements reaches a boundary, Pᵢ > θ.

Both the SPRT and two-choice sequential Bayesian inference give optimal decisions in that they give the fastest decisions for a given level of accuracy on single trials of known difficulty. Formally, they optimize a cost function, the Bayes risk, that is linear in the mean error rate e and mean decision time T over many trialswith error costs W i > 0 and cost of time c, scaling the expected error and decision time,… This cost function represents the trade-off between speed and accuracy of decision-making: slow but accurate or fast but inaccurate decisions are both costly, and so a balance must be found. For equal decision costs, W 0 = W 1, there is a single threshold that is free parameter, which for optimal decision-making is tuned according to the relative cost c / W of accuracy and time.

### Confidence reports in decision-making with multiple alternatives violate the Bayesian confidence hypothesis [^6173346e]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Models.

a Generative model. Target position is represented by s. Two sources of variability are considered in the model: First, observers have access to noisy measurement x, a Gaussian distribution centered at s with a standard deviation σ. Second, given the same measurement x, the posterior distribution varies across trials due to decision noise, modeled by Dirichlet distribution, of which spread (represented by the shade of the ternary plot) is controlled by a parameter α (see Methods). On each trial, a decisionand a confidence c are read out from the posterior distribution of that trial. b We use ternary plots to represent all possible posterior distributions. For example, a point at the center represents a uniform posterior distribution; at the corners of the ternary plot, the posterior probability of one category is one while the posterior for the other two categories are zeros. c The bar graphs illustrate how confidence is read out from posterior probabilities in each model. For the purposes of these plots, we did not include decision noise here. The color of each ternary plot represents the confidence as a function of posterior distribution for each model. The color is scaled for each ternary plot (independently) to take the whole range of the color bar.

We introduce three models of confidence reports: the Max model, the Entropy model and the Difference model. Each of these models contains two steps: (a) mapping the posterior distribution (q) to a real-valued internal confidence variable; (b) applying three criteria to this confidence variable to divide its space into four regions, which, when ordered, map to the four confidence ratings. The second step accounts for every possible monotonic mapping from the internal confidence variable to the four-point confidence rating. The three models differ only in the first step.

The Max model corresponds to the Bayesian confidence hypothesis. In this model, the confidence variable is the probability that the chosen category is correct, or in other words, it is the highest of the three posterior probabilities (Fig. 2c). In this model, the observer is least confident when the posterior distribution is uniform. Importantly, after the posterior distribution is computed, the posterior probability of the unchosen options does not further contribute to the computation of confidence.

Triangles indicate the 10 largest lineages in the HF/HS mice on day 16. d, g Fitness distribution of adaptive lineages inferred from panels c and f (see the "Methods" section) along with corresponding estimates for the LF/HPP diets (n = 4 discovery, n = 3 validation). e, h Groups of adaptive lineages continue to expand over time in 5 HF/HS mice. Colored lines are the total frequency of lineages in ranks indicated in (e).

Regardless of their source, we note that the apparent rates of adaptation in Fig. 1 i–l are different from those in Fig. 1 c–f. For example, Bc showed the strongest signatures of positive selection on day 4 but had the smallest number of high-frequency lineages on day 16. Bo exhibited the opposite trend. This shows that the dynamics of common variants do not necessarily reflect the broader adaptation occurring within these populations at lower frequencies.

### Clinical consensus methodology [^4a5dcf27]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical consensus methodology — development of the recommendations and manuscript explains how recommendations are crafted from the mapped evidence. Authoring team members review the evidence included in the evidence maps and propose key recommendations, and Clinical Consensus recommendations include a description of the relevant population, intervention, comparator, outcome, timing, setting, and dosing regimens as appropriate. When evaluating evidence, authors consider benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, resource use, cost, effect on equity, and generalizability, and they identify evidence related to specific segments of the U.S. population that may be disproportionately or differentially affected and propose specific recommendations based on the evidence review when possible. Articles in the evidence map not cited in the draft manuscript undergo additional review, and if after additional review it is determined that an article should not be included, the article is then removed from the evidence summary.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^7c40204d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Real-world cities

In this section, we study the properties of the subway systems in Atlanta, Boston, and Toronto under the lens of our framework. We choose monocentric cities, fairly isolated from other major urban centers, with a tree-like subway structure. We identify the intersection point of the real subway lines in all three cases as the city center. We see that this point corresponds to the downtown area in the three cities.

First, we incorporate real population data in our model. We rely on a two-dimensional triangular lattice multiplex model; we use the population data and the appropriate coordinates reference systems to impose the triangular lattice structure onto the city landscape. Details on the data and modeling of the city population distribution can be found in the Methods section. We denote all quantities relative to the real physical system using the same notation as for the multiplex model, but we add a tilde on top of the corresponding symbol. For example, R indicates the radius of the lattice model, anddenotes the radius of the city. Overlaying a city on top of the triangular lattice allows us to associate a weightto each node n in the slow layer that reflects the real population density within the city. We use those weights in the objective function of Eq. (6), and then take advantage of the greedy algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to the optimization problem of Eq. (4). Similar to the previous sections, we obtain two classes of optimal fast-layer configurations for all the considered parameters. Results for the city of Toronto are displayed in Fig. 4, where we see that optimal configurations comprise k ✱ = 1 (Fig. 4 a) or k ✱ = 2 (Fig. 4 b) branches. Similar results are valid for Atlanta and Boston, where we observe optimal configurations with k * ≤ 3 branches (see Supplementary Information Figure 11). For k * > 1, we note that the branches have no identical length; this is caused by the fact that the weight associated with the various nodes of the system is not constant. A typical phase diagram for Toronto is displayed in Fig. 4 c, where we fix η = 0.5, but vary L and c. The diagram is qualitatively similar to the one of Fig. 3 e. For fixed c, k * increases as L grows; however, for fixed L, k * decreases as c grows. The values of the parameters where the transitions between the various phases emerge differ from those of Fig. 3 e; this is due to the non-homogeneous density of the population used in the model of the city. Similar results for Atlanta and Boston can be found in the Supplementary Information Figure 11.

3.2.1 Training phase

We first compared AC with AB in our ROI, during the training phase. This analysis revealed a number of brain regions that exhibited greater activations for AC compared to AB (see Figure 3). These regions were the bilateral caudate body (peak cluster size: 214, peak voxel x = −14, y = 7, z = 15) and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9; peak cluster size: 41, peak voxel x = 43, y = 5, z = 32).

3.2.2 Test phase

BC‐DE comparison

The EXIT model does not predict a difference between these two compound cues, because it is the distribution of attention within the compound that is predicted to vary between the two compounds, not the total amount of attention to BC versus DE. Specifically, C is predicted to be more attended than B, while attention should be more evenly distributed between D and E. As expected, no significant differences were found, either in ROI or whole‐brain analyses.

C‐B comparison

The ROI analysis revealed a number of brain regions that exhibited greater activations for C (stimulus associated with the rare outcome) than for B (stimulus associated with the common outcome), see Figure 4 and Table 4. These regions included the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (BA 10), medial prefrontal cortex (BA 9), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9), bilateral caudate body, and left anterior cingulate (BA 32).

A number of brain areas included in the ROI analysis were also activated under whole brain analysis including a cluster comprising the right medial frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate (cluster size: 228, peak voxel x = 3, y = 55, z = 17). Outside of brain areas already identified in the ROI analysis the right thalamus was activated (cluster size = 257, peak voxel), as well as a separate cluster in the left cerebellum (cluster size = 111, peak voxel).

### Increased tortuosity of ACA might be associated with increased risk of ACoA aneurysm development and less aneurysm dome size: a computer-aided analysis [^f3471392]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sum of angle metrics

Calculation of SOAM begins from the division of curve into the subcurves of equal length. Then, for each subcurve, we calculate supplementary of the angle between lines connecting its center and ends. Angles are summed up and the result is normalized by the length of the entire curve:where φ indicates measured angles and n is its count. For a curve that is straighter, supplementary angles are larger and therefore the entire SOAM is larger. This descriptor is also sensitive to local tortuosity (Fig. 2 b).

Product of angle distance

The PAD is calculated using the below formula:

This descriptor defines global tortuosity which is the combination of deviation from the straight line given by RL and local angles metrics, which is given by the SOAM.

Triangular index

To calculate TI, the curve must be again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is calculated using the below formula:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are the triangle sides, and c is its base. TI is smaller for more straight curves (Fig. 2 c).

Inflection count metrics

Inflection point is a point on a curve where it changes from being concave to being convex, or vice versa. ICM is defined with below formula:where n I is the number of curve's inflection points. That factor is more sensitive to global curvature than RL and is lower for more straight curves (Fig. 2 d).

Additional measurements

For each analyzed segment of ACA, we measured its diameter, which was defined as the shortest distance between the artery edge points in the selected region. In a similar way, we measured the diameter of C7 segment of ICA. We also obtained the length of A1–A3 ACA segments.

### Analysis of radiology business models [^84140cd6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

As health care moves to value orientation, radiology's traditional business model faces challenges to adapt. The authors describe a strategic value framework that radiology practices can use to best position themselves in their environments. This simplified construct encourages practices to define their dominant value propositions. There are 3 main value propositions that form a conceptual triangle, whose vertices represent the low-cost provider, the product leader, and the customer intimacy models. Each vertex has been a valid market position, but each demands specific capabilities and trade-offs. The underlying concepts help practices select value propositions they can successfully deliver in their competitive environments.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^666675a9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To examine these questions, we take a Bayesian sequential inference perspective in which 1D decision variables in models like the SPRT are deconstructed into two decision variables that represent the degree of belief in two hypotheses H 0 and H 1. By using the sequential Bayesian inference beliefs directly, the positive/negative range for the 1D decision variable is split into two independent axes that represent normalized belief over each hypothesis as a separate decision trajectory, given by the posterior probability Pᵢ(t) = P(Hᵢ | x(1:t)) where x(1:t) is the accumulated evidence at time t (see Fig. 1).

c, d show evidence accumulation, x, as independent probability trajectories per choice hypothesis, H i. a, b show how these trajectories combine to form n -dimensional decision trajectories (colors match between the lower and upper plots). Dashed lines are example "flat" decision boundaries, θ, with shaded gray showing values/areas above the decision boundary in which a decision has been triggered. Notice that the evidence accumulation is constrained to an (n − 1)D subspace: a plane for three choices (a) and a tetrahedron for four choices (b). For visualization, (b) shows a four-dimensional object embedded into three dimensions projected onto a two-dimensional page; the fourth axis is orthogonal to those shown and "goes into" the page. The import of these different perspectives is that two-choice probability trajectories evolve in time, so decision boundaries can be time-dependent; however, n -choice decision trajectories also evolve in space, so decision boundaries can also have spatial dependence and thus a complex high-dimensional structure.

### Increased tortuosity of ACA might be associated with increased risk of ACoA aneurysm development and less aneurysm dome size: a computer-aided analysis [^589a48c2]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

ACA tracking

We analyzed A1, A2, and A3 segments of the ACA. In the first step, starting and ending point of the tracking were manually selected. Then, their nearest edge points were identified. Searching for other points was performed stepwise along the vessel axis: in the n th step, semi-ellipse shape-searching region was defined with center O n, major axis length a n, minor and axis length b n, and a direction vector. O n was defined as the midpoint between previously found edge points, was defined as, and ellipse axes were calculated with the given formulas:where d n is the distance between two previously selected points and θ n is the angle betweenand. Finding of more or less than two edge points in the n th step was treated as vessel crossing or branching, and points located in that step were not taken into consideration. Curve-connecting midpoints between each pair of edge points, representing the ACA course, were used for further analysis (Fig. 1).

Relative length

The first of used tortuosity descriptors is RL, calculated with the given formula:where l c is the curve length and l is the length of the straight line between the start and end points of the curve. RL is lower for curves which are more deviated from straightness (Fig. 2 a).

### Multiple tipping points and optimal repairing in interacting networks [^806c4333]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To optimize repairing we need to minimize this metric. Figure 5 shows the solution to the minimization problem and a detailed discussion is provided in the Methods section. The different colours in Fig. 5 correspond to the different optimal repair strategies, which depend on the failure state of the system. If the system is initially at point S 1, both networks are in a low activity state, that is, they are non-functional. Our goal is to decreaseand, and arrive to the region where the system is fully recovered (the green region) by performing a minimal number of repairs, that is, minimal N rep. We find that for any point in the red region there are actually two closest points in the green region, at an equal Manhattan distance away from the red region point. These two points are the triple points R1 and R2 shown in Fig. 5, which also correspond to the triple points in Fig. 2b. Although R1 may be closer to point A than R2 by Euclidian distance, the Manhattan distance is the same. Thus, two equally good repairing strategies are available. One involves allocating more node repairs to network A and the other allocating more repairs to network B. For the yellow regions (points S 2 and S 3), the closest points by Manhattan distance are R1 (for point S 2) or R2 (for point S 3). Here, only one triple point represents the optimal solution. It is noteworthy that the path samples in Fig. 5 are 'zig-zag' in shape (to highlight that we are minimizing); however, even when a diagonal path (direct straight line) to a triple point is used, the Manhattan distance is the same. For the dark blue regions (points S 4 and S 7), the optimal strategy is to decreaseonly, until the system is recovered. Similarly, for the light blue regions (points S 5 and S 6), the optimal strategy is to decrease only.

From our optimal repairing strategy analysis we find that the order of repair (the specific path taken between the initial point and final point) does not affect the final result. Minimizing the Manhattan distance only determines the optimal destination point. Therefore, there is actually a set of paths corresponding to equally optimal repairing processes.

### The five-step medial epicanthoplasty: simple and standardized [^98c96f70]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Step 1: preoperative design

The patient is positioned in a supine posture, and the design line marked with methylene blue. Initially, identify the optimal location for the new epicanthus (designated as point A) and mark it as the projection point of point A 'exposed when the skin is slightly stretched towards the nose (point A' is the original position of the medial canthus angle). Point B is situated on the free edge of the epicanthus on the upper eyelid (the starting point of the epicanthus), while Point C is the extension point of the B-A 'line connecting two points. The length of the AB arm is approximately equivalent to the length of the BC arm (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Preoperative design: Point A is the ideal position for the new medial canthus angle. Point B is the intersection point between the free edge of the medial canthus skin and the upper eyelid skin. Point C is the extension point of the B-A 'line connecting the two points

Step 2: adequate subcutaneous separation

Utilize a No.11 blade to incise the skin along the AB and BC lines; employ sharp scissors to carefully dissect and elevate the flap ABC, creating a separation zone measuring approximately 10mm in length and 8mm in width, forming a 270° circular configuration. Trim the attachment of the anterior orbicularis oculi muscle to the medial canthus skin, thereby fully releasing the dense connective tissue between the skin and the orbicularis oculi muscle (Fig. 2).

### Three-dimensional stereoscopic evaluation and quantitative gray scale assessment of the nasolabial fold and its application in injection therapy [^ed32087d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

3D image acquisition and analysis steps:
3D image acquisition: Use the Vectra camera to take facial images of each subject under uniform lighting conditions. For patients receiving filler injections, facial images are taken before and immediately after the injection.
Nasolabial fold region delineation (As shown in Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1,): Identifying landmarks: Determine and mark the alar base points (o) on both sides of the nose. Identify the longitudinal starting point of the nasolabial fold (a), usually near the alar base. Find the lowest point of the nasolabial fold cross-section (b), typically the deepest part of the fold. Identify the longitudinal ending point of the nasolabial fold (c). Nasolabial fold edge delineation process: Identify key points: Nasal alar edge point (A): Locate the outer point of the nasal alar edge. Mouth corner point (B): Locate the outer point of the mouth corner. Draw a line: Use a straight line to connect the nasal alar edge point (A) and the mouth corner point (B), forming line segment AB. Extend the sides of the parallelogram: From point A, extend 3 cm horizontally outward, marking it as point C. From point B, extend 3 cm horizontally outward, marking it as point D. Connect the points to form a parallelogram: Connect point A to point C, forming line segment AC. Connect point B to point D, forming line segment BD. Connect point C to point D, forming line segment CD. Connect point D to point A, forming line segment DA.
Gray value acquisition: Load the images into ImageJ software and convert the color images to grayscale images. Manually identify and draw the nasolabial fold region on the images after the above method. After drawing, use 'Analyze - > Set Measurements' to obtain the average gray value, minimum gray value, and maximum gray value. 3D coordinate data acquisition:
Measurement of NLF: Perform measurements using Vectra software. Manually identify six measurement landmarks on the 3D facial images, automatically generating a 3D coordinate system where the XY plane, YZ plane, and XZ plane correspond to the coronal plane, sagittal plane, and horizontal plane, respectively (As shown in Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Export the landmark coordinates to Microsoft Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation) to calculate five linear measurement values.
Verification of reproducibility: To verify the reproducibility of nasolabial fold landmark identification, systematic sampling was performed, extracting 10 samples (No. 009, No. 019, No. 029, No. 039, No. 049, No. 059, No. 069, No. 079, No. 089, No. 099). The 3D facial landmarks were removed, and two weeks later, researchers re-identified these landmarks and calculated the linear measurement values as described above. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated, with an ICC value greater than 0.80 considered excellent reproducibility.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Fast and sensitive mapping of nanopore sequencing reads with graphMap [^fcdf49e2]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

In total, for each shape d 3 keys are constructed, where d is the number of DC bases. GraphMap uses two complementary shapes for the region selection process: '1111110111111' (or the 6-1-6 shape) and '11110111101111' (or the 4-1-4-1-4 shape), where 1 marks the inclusive bases and 0 the DC positions. This shape combination was selected based on empirical evaluation of a range of combinations, due to the computational intractability of computing the optimal shape for the Levenshtein distance(see Supplementary Data 3 for results for each shape and the combination). For each shape, a separate index is used in GraphMap. At every seed position, both shapes are looked up, and all hits are used in the next step for binning.

To derive a general approach for binning seed hits, we draw on the concept of a Hough transform (HT), a method commonly used in image processing for detection of shapes such as lines, circles and ellipses. The HT defines a mapping from image points into an accumulator space, called the Hough space. In the case of line detection, if a given set of points in Cartesian space are collinear, then their relation can be expressed with a linear equation with common slope m and intercept c:

where (x, y) are the coordinates of a point in 2D space. HT attempts to determine parameters m and c of a line that describes the given set of points. Note that the system is generally over-determined and thus the problem can be solved using linear regression techniques. However, the HT uses an evidence-gathering approach, which can be used to detect an arbitrary number of lines in the image instead of only one best (Fig. 1c). Equation (1) can be converted into its dual in parameter space:

### A warm jet in a cold ocean [^e96f643e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The relationship between lateral stirring and the temperature or salinity anomalies in Fig. 2 is further elucidated by turning back to the T-S diagrams (Fig. 3). When PSW enters the BG (Fig. 3, panel b) in the form of this warm jet, it meanders through water characterized by typical regional temperature and salinity vertical profiles (panel c). Those background profiles show a straight mixing line between surface melt-water above (left side of Fig. 3 c), and Pacific winter water below (right side of panel c). The developing relative vorticity features described above stir and mix PSW with the background water along isopycnals, between the peak of the triangle shown in panel b, and the lower leg of that triangle shown in panel c, especially in the isopycnal range bounded by the two solid black lines identifying PSW density. That stirring fills in the T-S triangle, as can be seen in a section further downstream (Fig. 3 d). The scalloping features visible in Fig. 2 a, b are the initial stage of this stirring process.

During a subsequent survey of the same region 9 days later, the subduction process appears to be complete, with cool fresh water found everywhere near the surface (Fig. 5 a, b). Compared to the original survey, mixing and stirring along and perhaps across isopycnals has now filled in the entire triangle in T-S space (Fig. 3 e). The stirring process can be seen in more detail by considering four representative profiles through the second survey (Fig. 5 colors). There is some indication that subducted PSW (green profile) is mixing with background water along the same isopycnal found just outside the eddies (e.g. black profile). Similarly, it appears as though the red and blue profiles have exchanged water properties near the temperature maximum (Fig. 5 d). The T-S profiles and the bite taken out of the eddy in the red profile section of the snapshot (Fig. 5 a) suggest an intriguing form of eddy cannibalism induced by complex three-dimensional velocity and vorticity fields.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^3afb239e]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST grading of recommendations — the grading system encompasses two dimensions: balance of benefits to harms, risks, or burdens (including confidence in effect estimates) and the level of evidence supporting the recommendation; recommendations are strong when benefits clearly outweigh harms or vice versa and may include a strong negative recommendation; strong recommendations (Grade 1) use the language "we recommend", whereas when benefits and harms are closely balanced and further research could change the direction or strength, it is considered weak and statements read, "we suggest"; when benefits clearly outweigh harms most patients would choose the intervention and the recommendation is Grade 1, but with considerable variability in preferences recommendations are weaker, ie, Grade 2; the other dimension reflects the quality of the body of evidence scored A, B, or C.

Resource utilization (intervention cost) thresholds — The CGC reviews the distribution of costs required to provide an intervention for each guideline topic and judges whether there are meaningful differences in resource utilization among available interventions based on the distribution. The CGC does not use a predefined threshold across topics; ethical and equity considerations, clinical aspects of disease severity, and magnitude of clinical net benefit inform judgments. The CGC acknowledges that differences in resource utilization do not address all components of CEAs, and the cost of an intervention is not the sole determinant of value; high-cost interventions can have high value, and low-cost interventions can have low value.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Health equity in cardiovascular cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) is positioned as integral to value assessment, stating that health equity is essential and that evaluations should consider equity implications; historically, cardiovascular CEAs often omitted quantitative equity assessments, though maximizing efficiency can also improve equity. The page describes methods to incorporate equity — using distributional CEA for health disparities and extended CEA for catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures — and notes that equity considerations may include accepting higher willingness-to-pay thresholds for interventions that enhance equity among key populations. It emphasizes examining heterogeneity of cost effectiveness in subpopulations to guide prioritization and states that even without formal equity-focused CEAs, a holistic value assessment should consider outcomes across diverse population groups.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^8ec71b12]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

There are geometric implications of using sequential Bayesian inference as coordinates for n -dimensional decision trajectories (Fig. 1 a, b). Although the decision trajectories have n probability-coordinates, P n, they are constrained such that ∑ i P i (t) = 1; therefore, the decision trajectories populate (n − 1)D simplices. For example, 2AFC decision dynamics are represented as a particle constrained to have P 0 (t) + P 1 (t) = 1, which is the 1D line P 1 = 1 − P 0 on a 2D (P 0, P 1) plot of the beliefs. It follows that 3AFC dynamics take place on a 2D plane (Fig. 1 a) and 4AFC dynamics in a 3D tetrahedron (Fig. 1 b) and so forth. Note that if any hypothesis has zero probability P i (t) = 0, then the space in which the decision trajectory evolves collapses to the remaining non-zero directions. For example, each face of the 4-choice tetrahedron in Fig. 1 b is a combination of three choices with non-zero probabilities and each edge a combination of two such choices.

As a result, decision boundaries are (n − 2)-dimensional objects in n -dimensional probability space. So for n > 2 choices, boundaries can have spatial dependence with respect to the decision space visualized in Fig. 1 a, b. For 2AFC tasks, decision boundaries are points on a 2D line, which are simply the transformed boundaries (equation 2) of the standard two-choice integration-to-threshold model. Likewise, for 3AFC, the decision boundaries are lines on a plane (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) and for 4AFC are planes within a tetrahedron (Fig. 1 a, dark gray planes). The example boundaries shown are flat with a constant decision threshold in each dimension. An interesting consequence is that high-dimensional boundaries can have a nonlinear structure as a function of the n -dimensional beliefs P. Then, the linear 3AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) generalize to curves and the planar 4AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 b, dark gray planes) generalize to curved surfaces.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^e7ef9102]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST grading framework — dimensions and evidence adjustment are defined explicitly. The CHEST grading system defines the grades based on two key dimensions: (1) the balance of benefits of the proposed action as compared with the possible harms or risks and (2) the methodologic quality of the supporting evidence. Both factors are represented in the overall grade, with the former represented by 1 or 2 and the latter A, B, or C. The methodologic quality is initially based on the hierarchy of study design, but studies can be upgraded or downgraded based on specific criteria (eg, existence of methodologic flaws, directness, precision, consistency of results).

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^30e99d16]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Engineering multilayer networks that efficiently connect sets of points in space is a crucial task in all practical applications that concern the transport of people or the delivery of goods. Unfortunately, our current theoretical understanding of the shape of such optimal transport networks is quite limited. Not much is known about how the topology of the optimal network changes as a function of its size, the relative efficiency of its layers, and the cost of switching between layers. Here, we show that optimal networks undergo sharp transitions from symmetric to asymmetric shapes, indicating that it is sometimes better to avoid serving a whole area to save on switching costs. Also, we analyze the real transportation networks of the cities of Atlanta, Boston, and Toronto using our theoretical framework and find that they are farther away from their optimal shapes as traffic congestion increases.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^f4124a5b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The main problem in network design is fundamentally different. We are given the density of population and we are looking for the network that minimizes some objective function involving some average time, in general (although other choices are possible, see for example). In this setting, there are usually two different transport modes, a slow one representing for example cars on the road network, and a fast one representing the subway or some rapid transit network. The natural framework here is then the one of multiplex networks comprising two different transportation networks, one known while the structure of the second one is to be determined (for multiplexes in the context of optimization see for example). A practical realization of this problem concerns the specific case of subways (for a network analysis of subways, see for example,–). In most large cities, a subway system has been built and later enlarged, with current total lengths varying from a few kilometers to a few hundred kilometers. The geometry of these networks, as its total length increases, varies from simple lines to more complex shapes with loops for larger networks. In particular, for the largest networks, convergence to a structure with a well-connected central core and branches reaching out to suburbs has been observed.

Algorithmic aspects of network design have been studied within computational geometry (e.g.chapter 9) and location science (e.g.and references therein), and some simpler problems of this type have been addressed previously. For instance, the problem of the quickest access between an area and a given point was discussed in. In network science, the optimization problem is traditionally recast as a navigation problem in lattices with long-range connections. However, our specific question – optimal network topologies as a function of population distribution and network length – is largely an open problem. In, some results were obtained in two-dimensional systems by comparing a priori defined optimal network configurations. First, it was shown that, if the goal is reaching a single point in the plane, then the optimal network is necessarily a tree. Second, the paper hinted at the possibility of the existence of transitions between optimal configurations when the length of the network changes. More precisely, it has been shown that as the length of the network increases resources go preferentially to radial branches and that there is a sharp transition at a critical value of the length where a loop appears.

### BAM, physical activity, table tennis archive… [^b490f79d]. archive.cdc.gov (2019). Medium credibility.

TABLE TENNIS ACTIVITY CARD Parts of the Body Worked Upper & Lower Legs Heart & Lungs Arms Abs Table tennis is a fun indoor game. Gear Up You'll need the right equipment to get started. First, you'll want a table. The tables that are used look a lot like a tennis court – they are usually rectangular and green with white lines. A six-inch net is used to divide the table in half. Next, you'll need a ball and paddles. The balls used in tournaments and during professional competitions are made of plastic and are hollow inside. Paddles, sometimes called rackets, are mostly made of wood. Each side is covered with a sheet of rubber. Often times the rubber sheets are made with different textures. This allows players to hit the ball at different speeds and with different types of spin. Even if a player chose different textures for each side of the paddle, official regulations require one side to be red and one side to be black.

This way, players can always tell which side of the paddle their opponent is using. Stand far enough from the table so that your arm and paddle can be fully extended. Shift your weight to the balls of your feet, and keep your knees slightly bent. Lean forward a bit, using your non-paddle hand to keep balance. Toss the ball up for a serve, and let it bounce one time before hitting it. Each player serves five times, and then the serve goes to their opponent. Stand like you're about to serve the ball for a forehand shot. Only this time, face sideways so that your non-paddle shoulder points toward the other player. Swing your paddle back, shifting your hips in the same direction. Remember that the further you swing back, the more powerful the shot will be. Hold the paddle at the height of your waist, and keep your wrist tilted slightly toward the floor. This way you'll hit the ball in an upward direction and send it over the net. Swing your arms and hips forward, and take your shot.

Scoring There are a variety of ways to score a point. You'll score when a server makes a bad serve or when a player isn't able to hit the ball back to the other player. Points are also scored if the ball bounces two or more times on one player's side, or if the player touches the net or table.

Potential effect of economic outcomes from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — prioritized economic outcomes from RCTs are included in the summary of findings table in the EtD, and the Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) considers these outcomes in the initial assessment of clinical net benefit because they "represent clinical benefit or harm (for example, avoiding a hospitalization is a clinical benefit associated with lower resource utilization)".

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^9fd161a2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

These dynamic decision thresholds have a range of temporal structures for each cost ratio c / W, separating naturally into three categories: increasing (Fig. 8, top row), collapsing (middle row), and static thresholds (bottom row). These categories appear to correlate with the shape of the decision boundary: increasing thresholds with convex boundaries (e.g. Fig. 7 a, dark blue curve), decreasing thresholds with concave boundaries (e.g. Fig. 7 a, red curve), and static thresholds with flat boundaries (e.g. Fig. 7 a, yellow line). This correlation seems to originate in an increase in decision time as the belief moves away from equality between choices (Fig. 7 a–c, shading). All things being equal, decisions that terminate with higher beliefs tend to be more accurate, whereas decisions terminating with a low belief of the choice tend to be less accurate. Therefore, experimental observation of implicitly dynamic decision boundaries (including increasing thresholds) could be due to time-dependent accuracy plots of data from individual subjects.

We emphasize that while these implicit threshold dynamics look like temporal dependence, they are, in fact due to the spatial structure of the decision boundary. Flat decision boundaries can therefore be interpreted as a special case where the boundary on the belief in one choice to cross its threshold is independent of the beliefs of the other choices; however, even then, the mean decision time and mean error have a spatial structure along these boundaries (Fig. 7).

Comparison to current models, interpretations, and predictions

There are few normative approaches to modeling multiple-choice decision-making, with the recent study of ref.the state-of-the-art in using an evidence accumulation vector accumulated in a race model with a boundary in n -dimensional space. Using dynamic programming, they find optimal decision boundaries for free-response, mixed-difficulty trials are nonlinear and collapse over time. Clearly, their n DRM is closely linked to the model presented here, but there are key differences: the models have a different evidence structure, trial structure, and optimization process, which leads to diverging perspectives on the nature of multiple-choice decision boundaries. In the following, we describe how these perspectives can be reconciled, and in doing so gain a broader understanding of normalization and inference in multiple-choice decision-making.

### Daily forecasting of regional epidemics of coronavirus disease with Bayesian uncertainty quantification, United States [^bd9975a4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

We conducted predictive inferences for all 15 MSAs of interest (Figure 4). We conditioned our predictions on the compartmental model with n = 0. These results demonstrate that, for the timeframe of interest, the compartmental model with n = 0 can reproduce many of the empirical epidemic curves for the MSAs of interest, which vary in shape.

### High degree of inter-clade cross-reactivity of HIV-1-specific T cell responses at the single peptide level [^b642f2d4]. AIDS (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine HIV-1-specific T cell responses in clade B infected individuals recognizing the clade A, B and C consensus sequences in order to assess the degree of inter-clade cross-reactivity of these immune responses at the single epitope level.

Methods

HIV-1-specific T cell responses were assessed cross-sectionally in 27 chronically HIV-1-infected individuals from a population infected mainly with clade B viral strains, using an interferon-gamma Elispot assay with a total of 1230 overlapping peptides spanning the entire amino acid sequence of the clade A, B and C 2001 consensus sequences.

Results

No significant difference was observed between the total magnitude or breadth of T cell responses recognizing either the clade A, B or C consensus sequences. However, at the single peptide level, 194 T cell responses were identified that recognized only one of the three different clade-specific peptide variants (A: B: C, 34: 105: 55), 125 T cell responses recognized two of the three peptide variants (AB: AC: BC, 71: 15: 39) and 166 T cell responses (34%) were cross-reactive with all three different peptide variants. Peptides recognized in all three consensus sequence variants had a significantly lower entropy (P < 0.0001) and a significantly higher inter-clade homology (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Viral epitopes within regions of low HIV-1 clade B diversity and high inter-clade homology can be recognized in the clade A, B and C variants and indicate a wide degree of cross-isolate and cross-clade recognition by HIV-1-specific T cells. These regions may therefore be of particular relevance for the design of HIV-1 vaccines.

### Automatic skeleton segmentation in CT images based on U-net [^f9bed0e2]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Stretcher Removal

Figures 1 and 2 show the step-by-step process of stretcher removal (see the complete process in Supplementary Material. B). First, the CT image is binarized with a threshold of 98 HU. From the binarized image, the point closest to the left image margin is located and defined as the beginning of the stretcher (ancestor of i1). The next margin of the stretcher in the horizontal central zone is located (ancestor of i2). Finally, to include also the extremes of the stretcher, a third index is obtained (ancestor of i3). Figure 1 a shows the estimated intermediate vertical lines between these calculated limits to the body (i1, i2, and i3).

Subsequently, the axial slice is divided in its vertical direction into eight equal regions R1–R8 (shown in blue in Fig. 1 b). From these horizontal regions, the intersection points between the vertical lines and the horizontal regions are related and divided as follows (Fig. 1 c): the extremes of the stretcher (R2 and R7 with i3), the central area of the stretcher (R4 and R5 with i1), and the inclined areas of the stretcher (R3 and R6 with i2). Then, the intersection points are connected as follows: Pe1 — Pi1 — Pi3 — Pe3 — Pe4 — Pi4 — Pi2 — Pe2; and finally, the resulting line extends vertically to the lower and upper limits of the image following i3. In this way, the margin separating the stretcher from the skeletal area is obtained (Fig. 1 d).

### A decision-space model explains context-specific decision-making [^35aa007e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Effect of altered advantage score on future trials

In Supplementary Fig. 9b, c, we examine the effect of a change to advantage score l in eq. 39 as a modeled task is being performed.

The circuit adjusts over 100 trials. At the beginning, advantage score is set to 1 (dimensionless coefficient) for the non-D decision-space and 0 for every other decision-space. Over the first 20 and the last 10 time-steps (between the dashed lines on the plots), advantage score is incremented for the 4D decision-space but not others. Over time steps 21–90, advantage score is incremented for the non-D decision-space.

In the plot, the value of each decision-space is divided by the total value of all decision-spaces to form a ratio.

### Core GRADE 7: principles for moving from evidence to recommendations and decisions [^78e5737a]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

This seventh article in a seven part series presents the Core GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach for moving from evidence to recommendations or policy decisions. Core GRADE users make strong recommendations for an intervention versus a comparator when the desirable consequences clearly outweigh the undesirable consequences, and a conditional (weak) recommendation when the balance is less clear. Primary considerations in deciding on recommendations considering an individual patient perspective include balance of benefits, harms, and burdens; the certainty of evidence; and values and preferences. Secondary considerations, most important from a population perspective, include costs, feasibility, acceptability, and equity. Moving from evidence to recommendations begins with considering evidence regarding patients' values and preferences and choosing the smallest difference in each outcome that patients perceive as important (the minimal important difference). Core GRADE users construct statements that make clear the values and preferences underlying their recommendations. In general, Core GRADE users make strong recommendations only when certainty of evidence is high or moderate. When evidence certainty is low, recommendations will be conditional under all but special circumstances.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^5e4c17a3]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST methodology — selection and prioritization criteria for guideline topics and updates state that the criteria in this table are used to select and prioritize topics for development or revisions, and in the LGM, approval of topics for de novo development and prioritization of guideline updates requires meeting most of the criteria in Table 1. Criteria include changes in the relevance of a clinical question to the practice of medicine, changes in available interventions (eg, new drugs or devices), changes in evidence on the existing benefits and harms of interventions, changes in outcomes considered important, changes in values placed on outcomes, changes in evidence that current practice is optimal, changes in resources available for health care, and changes of strategic importance to CHEST; the narrow scope with specific key clinical questions broken down into PICO elements permits readers to quickly understand the clinical content areas, patient populations, and interventions addressed.

### Strategies for incorporating resource allocation and economic considerations: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^c2007176]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Although clinical guidelines may have substantial implications for allocation of health-care resources, these issues typically are not considered in the guideline development process or are only considered informally. This is a particular challenge for guidelines intended to be applicable in a diversity of settings. Based on theoretical and practical issues, we develop and apply a basic strategy for incorporating resource considerations into clinical guidelines. Formal economic assessments, such as cost-effectiveness analyses, provide a powerful tool to account for the health and economic implications of clinical guidelines. An acceptable tradeoff of money for health can depend highly on local considerations, and it is feasible to incorporate resource considerations into clinical guidelines. Although use of a "bright line" criterion for what constitutes an acceptable tradeoff of money for health has some appeal, this approach can lead to guidelines that are sensible in some contexts but unrealistic in others. One way to address this tension is through "resource aware" guidelines in which the recommendations are primarily based on scientific evaluations of efficacy supplemented by a review of evidence about the health and economic tradeoffs associated with various options. This approach limits the possibility that the guideline committee can make a universal recommendation based on resource considerations, but we expect it will encourage more thoughtful discussion of economic issues; greater sensitivity to the diversity of investment in health resource internationally; and, perhaps, innovative ways of overcoming resource barriers to the use of the most effective therapies.

### How to perform economic evaluation in implementation studies: imaging-specific considerations and comparison of financial models [^ac9d8916]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Economic evaluation for implementation science merits unique considerations for a local context, including the main audience of local decision makers. This local context is in contrast with traditional methods for developing coverage policy for medical tests and interventions, which typically emphasize benefits and costs more broadly, for society. Regardless of the strength of evidence backing the efficacy or effectiveness of a clinical intervention, local context is paramount when implementing evidence-based practices. Understanding the costs throughout the processes of implementing a program will inform the decision of whether to plan for and adopt the program, how to sustain the program, and whether to scale up widely. To guide economic evaluation for implementation of evidence-based imaging practices, we describe approaches that consider local stakeholders' needs and connect these with outcomes of cost and clinical utility. Illustrative examples of implementation strategies and economic evaluation are explored in areas of cancer screening and care delivery.

For the conventional EPR spectra the E m is not present, and replaced by B m || B 0): (a) The a crystallographic axis, B 0, and E m all are oriented toward the same direction (φ M = 0°, φ E = 0°); (b) The a axis is parallel to B 0 and antiparallel to E m (φ M = 0°, φ E = 180°); (c) A –150° rotation of the crystal about the c axis and B 0 parallel to – E m (φ M = 150°, φ E = –30°); (d) The c axis, B 0, and E m all are oriented toward the same direction. The EFM-EPR spectra intensities are rescaled by the number of acquisitions n (n = 15, 16, 59, and 8, respectively), necessary to achieve a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. Gray dash lines indicate the EPR resonance field. In the top panels, red lines represent the simulations with the SH model given in Eq. (1) with parameters reported in Table 1. In the bottom panels, red lines represent the simulations performed using the SH model from Eq. (1) with the δg and δJ from ab initio and DFT calculations (see Table 2). Source data are provided with this paper.

Finally, a broader line (320 G) is observed at ~3060 G when B 0 aligns with the c axis (Fig. 2d). When E m is also applied along c a stronger EFM-EPR signal is observed than when E m is in the plane of the triangles. The phase changes when E m is reversed (Supplementary Fig. 6a), and the signal exhibits an absorption-like shape, differing from the ab plane response. When E m is along the c axis and B 0 perpendicular to it, the signal shifts to high field, but the EFM-EPR line shape remains unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 6b).

### Supercooling of the A phase ofHe [^84d73d5b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The condensation of 3 He pairs into a superfluid state occurs via a second-order phase transition at a pressure-dependent transition temperature, T c, shown in Fig. 1. The anisotropic A phase is favored at high temperatures and pressures, while the isotropic B phase is the stable phase below the T AB (P) line. In zero magnetic fields, the equilibrium phase diagram exhibits a polycritical point(PCP) at which the line of first-order transitions (T AB) intersects the line of second-order transitions (T c) at 21.22 bar and 2.273 mK. The transition between the A and B phases is first order and thus subject to hysteresis. At the PCP, the bulk free energies of the A, B superfluid phases and the normal state are equal.

Fig. 1
Previous supercooling results.

The equilibrium phase diagram for superfluid 3 He. The normal fluid (blue), stable A phase (yellow) and the B phase (green) are separated by a red line that marks T c. The equilibrium A–B transition in zero magnetic field (black line) terminates at the polycritical point (PCP) where the A, B and Normal phases coincide.

### Investigating suspected cancer clusters and responding to community concerns: guidelines from CDC and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists [^b10f89ee]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Step 1: Initial contact and response — purpose and key actions focus on intake, early evaluation, and education. The purpose of Step 1 is to collect information from the inquirer to determine whether the inquiry's concern warrants further follow-up, after which the health agency will need to decide whether to pursue the inquiry further, focusing on obtaining information the inquirer can provide as well as relevant data available to the health agency such as data from cancer registry, census, and environmental databases. The inquirer should be referred quickly to the responsible unit and the problem should not be dismissed prematurely, and although the majority of reports of potential clusters will be closed at the time of initial response because the inquirer's concerns are not consistent with a potential cancer cluster, the first encounter is often the health agency's best opportunity to educate about the nature of cancer and suspected cancer clusters. To be an effective initial responder, the health agency needs to understand the context of the inquirer's concern, the nature of the perceived problem, and the history of how it has or has not been reported to authorities.

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

### Clinicians' overestimation of their geographic service area [^c866d6a8]. Annals of Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In this study, we evaluated family physicians' ability to estimate the service area of their patient panel-a critical first step in contextual population-based primary care. We surveyed 14 clinicians and administrators from 6 practices. Participants circled their estimated service area on county maps that were compared with the actual service area containing 70% of the practice's patients. Accuracy was ascertained from overlap and the amount of estimated census tracts that were not part of the actual service area. Average overlap was 75%, but participants overestimated their service area by an average of 166 square miles. Service area overestimation impedes implementation of targeted community interventions by practices.

### Confidence reports in decision-making with multiple alternatives violate the Bayesian confidence hypothesis [^2b317830]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Stimulus

On each trial, three categories of exemplar dots (375 dots per category) were presented along with one target dot, a black dot (Fig. 1a). The exemplar dots within a category were distributed as an uncorrelated, circularly symmetric Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 2° (degree visual angle) along both horizontal and vertical directions. Exemplar dots from the different categories were coded with different colors. The three colors were randomly chosen on each trial, and were equally spaced in Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) L * a * b * color space. The three colors were at a fixed lightness of L ✱ = 70 and were equidistant from the gray point (a ✱ = 0, and b ✱ = 0).

In Experiment 1 and 3, the centers of the three categories were aligned vertically to the center of the screen, and were located at different horizontal positions (Fig. 1b). In four configurations, the horizontal positions of the centers of the three categories were (−3°, 0°, 3°), (−4°, 0°, 4°), (−3°, −2°, 3°), and (−3°, 2°, 3°), from the center of the screen respectively. In Experiment 2, the centers of the three categories varied on a 2-dimensional space (Fig. 1c). In four configurations, the horizontal positions of the centers of the three categories were (−2°, 0°, 2°), (−1.59°, 0°, 1.59°), (−2°, −2°, 2°), and (−2°, 2°, 2°), from the center of the screen, respectively. The vertical positions of the centers were (1.16°, −2.31°, 1.16°), (0.94°, −1.84°, 0.94°), (1.16°, 0°, 1.16°), and (1.16°, 0°, 1.16°) from the center of the screen respectively.

### The fisherman's cards: how to address past and future radiation exposures in clinical decision making [^f6491364]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to describe how to address patients' past-and future potential-radiation exposures when making an imaging decision in a given situation. CONCLUSION. The Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation committee has endorsed a linear no-threshold model to explain the relationship between radiation exposure and cancer risk. This model implies that past and future potential exposures should not impact current decisions. We present an analogy that deconstructs these counterintuitive conclusions and facilitates translation of key radiation risk principles to practice.

### Addressing resource allocation issues in recommendations from clinical practice guideline panels: suggestions from an American College of Chest Physicians task force [^b4aa5963]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Most panels that develop clinical practice guidelines are poorly equipped to address resource allocation or cost issues associated with management options. This risks neglect, arbitrariness, lack of transparency, and methodological flaws in consideration of resource allocation. We provide recommendations for guideline panels to promote greater transparency and rigor. We suggest focusing on resource allocation issues for only a limited number of recommendations and provide criteria for selecting those in which economic considerations are likely to influence the direction or strength of the recommendation. Panels should involve a health economist to assist with the systematic review and critical interpretation of relevant economic analyses. They should carefully define the intended audience and may consider issuing alternative recommendations when available resources vary widely across target clinical settings. Targeting a limited number of recommendations for the consideration of resource allocation issues, and ensuring methodologically high-quality review, will best serve guideline panels, and the health-care providers and patients they hope to assist.

### Using grid cells for navigation [^30eebe08]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

The Vector Navigation Problem

The 1D vector navigation problem can be stated thus: given the grid cell representations of two locations a and b, calculate the displacement between those locations d = b − a (Figure 3 A). More specifically, the grid cell representations of locations a and b correspond to the spatial phases of activity bumps in each grid module { p i (a) | i = 1 to M } = { p 1 (a), p 2 (a),…, p M (a)} and { p i (b) | i = 1 to M } = { p 1 (b), p 2 (b),…, p M (b)}. As an example, consider three grid cell modules with scales s 1 = 50 cm, s 2 = 30 cm and s 3 = 20 cm. If the distance between the current location a and goal location b is d = 75 cm, and (for the sake of simplicity, but without loss of generalization) the phase of each module is 0 at the current location a — i.e. p 1 (a) = 0, p 2 (a) = 0 and p 3 (a) = 0 — then at b the phase of each module will be proportional to the distance d modulo grid scale s i:

The 1D vector navigation problem is to recover the displacement d from these values of { p i (b)} (Figure 3 A).

Similarly, the 2D vector navigation problem can be stated thus: given the grid cell representations of two locationsand, calculate the displacement vector between those locations. More specifically, the grid cell representations of locations a and b correspond to the sets of spatial phasesandthat define positionin module i along principal axes x and y (which, in this case, are separated by 60°; see Figures 2 B and 2C). Again, consider three grid cell modules with scales s 1 = 50 cm, s 2 = 30 cm and s 3 = 20 cm. If the displacement vector between the current locationand goal locationis, and the phase of each module on each axis is 0 at the current location, then atthe phases of the modules will be:

The 2D vector navigation problem is to recover the displacement vectorfromand(Figure 3 B). Note that this corresponds to a simple generalization of the 1D vector navigation problem to multiple axes.

Quantitative imaging (QI) — challenges and sources of error emphasize that advances in QI are crucially dependent on technology and computational power, with massive data sets run through "black box" algorithms and distilled into selected "biomarkers" to evaluate their ability to detect, stratify, and monitor lung disease. Numerous imaging modalities, manufacturers, platforms, and algorithms may not integrate smoothly, and emergent QI metrics vary among centers in the methods of acquisition, quantification, interpretation, and extrapolation; technological advances contribute to difficulty in standardization. Systematic errors may arise at each step of image acquisition, processing, and analysis, including 1) technical issues (e.g., depth of inspiration, acquisition protocol, signal-to-noise ratio, resolution), 2) nonrepresentative sampling of parts of interest (e.g., comparing regions, lobes, or airways), and 3) lack of a well-defined reference space, as well as 4) inaccurate landmark coregistration for evaluating paired images obtained at different lung volumes and 5) failure to consider basic physiology and/or biological or spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

### Quantitative verification of the keyhole concept: a comparison of area of exposure in the parasellar region via supraorbital keyhole, frontotemporal pterional, and supraorbital approaches [^48bddfbc]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Object

This study was designed to determine if the "keyhole concept", proposed by Perneczky's group, can be verified quantitatively.

Methods

Fourteen (3 bilateral and 8 unilateral) sides of embalmed latex-injected cadaveric heads were dissected via 3 sequential craniotomy approaches: supraorbital keyhole, frontotemporal pterional, and supraorbital. Three-dimensional cartesian coordinates were recorded using a stereotactic localizer. The orthocenter of the ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, the posterior clinoid process, and the contralateral anterior clinoid process are expressed as a center point (the apex). Seven vectors project from the apex to their corresponding target points in a radiating manner on the parasellar skull base. Each 2 neighboring vectors border what could be considered a triangle, and the total area of the 7 triangles sharing the same apex was geometrically expressed as the area of exposure in the parasellar region.

Results

Values are expressed as the mean ± SD (mm(2)). The total area of exposure was as follows: supraorbital keyhole 1733.1 ± 336.0, pterional 1699.3 ± 361.9, and supraorbital 1691.4 ± 342.4. The area of exposure on the contralateral side was as follows: supraorbital keyhole 602.2 ± 194.7, pterional 595.2 ± 228.0, and supraorbital 553.3 ± 227.2. The supraorbital keyhole skull flap was 2.0 cm(2), and the skull flap size ratio was 1:5:6.5 (supraorbital keyhole/pterional/supraorbital).

Conclusions

The area of exposure of the parasellar region through the smaller supraorbital keyhole approach is as adequate as the larger pterional and supraorbital approaches. The keyhole concept can be verified quantitatively as follows: 1) a wide area of exposure on the skull base can be obtained through a small keyhole skull opening, and 2) the side opposite the opening can also be visualized.

### Optimal policy for value-based decision-making [^e881f37b]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Optimal decisions with DDMs with collapsing boundaries

To find the optimal policy, we borrow tools from dynamic programming (DP). One of these tools is the 'value function', which can be defined recursively through Bellman's equation. In what follows, we show that the optimal policy resulting from this value function is described by two time-dependent parallel bounds in the two-dimensional space of current estimates of the true option rewards. These bounds are parallel with unity slopes, approach each other over time and together form a bound on the difference of reward estimates. This difference is efficiently inferred by diffusion models, such that DDMs can implement the optimal strategy for value-based decision-making.

Bellman's equation for optimal value-based decision-making. To define the value function, assume that the decision maker has accumulated some evidence about the option rewards for some time t. Given this accumulated evidence, the value function returns the total reward the decision maker expects to receive when following the optimal policy. This value includes both the cost for evidence accumulation from time t onwards and the reward resulting from the final choice. The expected rewards, and elapsed time t are sufficient statistics of the accumulated evidence (see Methods section), such that the value function is defined over these quantities. At each point in time t during evidence accumulation we can either commit to a choice or accumulate more evidence and choose later. When committing to a choice, it is best to choose the option associated with the higher expected reward, such that the total expected rewardfor choosing immediately is given by the value for 'deciding',(Fig. 3a). When accumulating more evidence for a small duration δt, in contrast, the decision maker observes additional evidence on which she updates her belief about the true rewards while paying accumulation cost cδt. At this stage, she expects to receive a total reward of. Therefore, the total expected reward for accumulating more evidence is given by the value for 'waiting',(Fig. 3b), where the expectation is over the distribution of future expected rewards, and, given that they areandat time t (see Methods section for an expression of this distribution). The decision maker ought to only accumulate more evidence if doing so promises more total reward, such that the value function can be written recursively in a form called Bellman's equation (Fig. 3a-c, e; see Supplementary Note 1 for formal derivation)

### Extrapolation beyond the end of trials to estimate long term survival and cost effectiveness [^a56e32de]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Policy makers worldwide use economic evaluation to inform decisions when allocating limited healthcare resources. A critical part of this evaluation involves accurately estimating long term effects of treatments. Yet, evidence is usually from clinical trials of short duration. Rarely do all participants encounter the clinical event of interest by the trial's end. When people might benefit from a long term treatment, health technology assessment agencies recommend that economic evaluations extrapolate beyond the trial period to estimate lifetime benefits. This kind of evaluation is common for people with cancer, when effective treatments delay disease progression and improve survival.

Use of survival modelling: rationale

To make funding decisions, health technology assessment agencies rely on accurate estimates of the benefits and costs of new treatments compared with existing treatments. For treatments that improve survival, accurate estimates of survival benefits are crucial. Policy makers use estimates of mean (average) survival rather than median survival, taking into account the probability of death over a lifetime across all patients with the disease. This mean is represented by the area under survival curves that plot the proportion of patients alive over time by treatment.

In figure 1, the purple area represents a mean survival benefit associated with an experimental compared with a control treatment, but this benefit is a restricted mean, limited to the trial period. The curves separate early, and remain separated at the end of the trial, so it is reasonable to expect that benefits would continue to accrue beyond the trial's end. The orange smooth curves represent survival models fitted to the trial data and extrapolated beyond the trial. The area between the orange curves estimates the mean lifetime survival benefit associated with the experimental treatment. This area is much larger than the purple area, and is relevant for economic evaluation.

### Optimal policy for value-based decision-making [^d61b4583]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

where the expectation is, as for equation (2), across choices j and evidence accumulation times T, given the flow of evidence. Here, it is critical that we fix the time period while leaving open the number of choices that can be performed. If we instead were to fix the number of choices while leaving open the time to make them, it again becomes optimal to maximize the total expected reward for each of these choices separately, such that the optimal policy for each such choice is the same as that for single, isolated choices.

Infinite choice sequences make using the standard value function difficult. This value function returns the total expected reward for all current and future choices when starting from the current state. For an infinite number of such future choices, the value function might thus become infinite. One way to avoid this is to use instead the 'average-adjusted value' function, which — in addition to an accumulation cost — penalizes the passage of some time duration δt by − ρδt, where ρ is the reward rate. This reward rate is by equation (4) the total reward received (including accumulation costs) per second, averaged over the whole choice sequence. Penalizing the value function by this reward rate makes explicit the implicit loss of rewards due to potential future choices that the decision maker misses out on when accumulating too much evidence for the current choice. This penalization allows us to treat all choices in the sequence as if they were the same, unique choice. A further consequence of this penalization is that the value function for accumulating more evidence for some duration δt undergoes a more significant change, as accumulating this evidence now comes at a cost −(c + ρ) δt instead of the previous − cδt (see Methods section for the associated Bellman equation). For positive reward rates, ρ > 0, this cost augmentation implies more costly evidence accumulation such that it becomes advantageous to accumulate less evidence than for single, isolated choices. This change is implemented by decision boundaries that collapse more rapidly (shown formally in Supplementary Note 1, see also Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, collapsing decision boundaries implement the optimal policy for both single choices and sequences of choices, with the only difference that these boundaries collapse more rapidly for the latter. The duration of inter-choice waiting t w modulates this difference, as with t w →∞, the reward rate described by equation (4) reduces to the expected reward for single, isolated choices, equation (2). Therefore the policy for single trials is a special case of that for maximizing the reward rate in which the waiting time between consecutive choices becomes close-to-infinite.

### Transcript of 2 / 3 / 99 meeting of the workgroup on national health… [^4590ec3d]. aspe.hhs.gov (1999). Low credibility.

DR. DETMER: All right. That is fine. I just didn't know what part of the world we might be talking to you from. DR. FRIEDMAN: No, no. It is just Massachusetts. DR. DETMER: All right. Well, it is good to hear your voice. So, the floor is yours. We had at our last meeting talked about a few models. So, this is the last of that iteration. So, David, welcome. The VISA Corporation is actually a group of about 4, 000 employees that basically operate a trillion dollar economy. They do this by having all the member banks come together, agree on what the terms are for what constitutes a VISA card and then they go out and intensely compete against each other to offer VISA cards. It is an organization that uniquely blends cooperation and competition in a way that very few other organizations in our country do in a very operational way. The Internet is another kind of example.

It is a self-governing organization that is maybe a little more chaotic than we want for health care, but it is the same kind of model. The founder of VISA Corporation, De Hock, has been sort of ever since his retirement advocating for this kind of model for governance of various systems as a way to solve a lot of our society's problems. He is, in fact, organizing the world's religions to apply to religious violence across the world. So, for your glossary, he has coined a new term; CHAORD. CHAORD is an organization that combines chaos and order and blends them seamlessly so that you have the effective tension between chaos and order come together in a way that allows people's creative spirits really to come about. So, all this is abstract and theoretical, which is what I am most interested in.

But, in fact, there is a very practical side of what I am here to talk to you about and that is there is a group of people that have already started to try to build a system like this for health care. MR. KENDALL: I think one of the things that is different from when VISA was first formed is the technology. I mean, there are companies out there that almost can do everything that we are talking about right now and the problem is is that those systems don't all work with each other. So, I think the answer is made easier because of the technology, that it is there. I mean, it is never an obstacle.

Temporal structure of the reconstructed representations.

a Autocorrelation of the reconstructed probabilities (dark blue line) and its s.e.m. (light blue shade) obtained from n = 21 participants, against the mean autocorrelation obtained by repeating the entire analysis (n = 21) 100 times after randomly permuting the class labels (grey transparent lines). Stars indicate the time lags at which the autocorrelation differed from chance (two-sided cluster-level permutation test, p < 0.010). b Distribution of the duration of steady outcome representation epochs (blue) against the null distribution derived from permuted classifiers (red; two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, p < 0.001). c Consistently with the epoch durations in b, number of transitions between most likely outcome over the 1500 ms deliberation interval is lower than chance (permutation test, p < 0.010). The error bar represents the s.e.m. of the number of transitions for the correct classifier.

### Transmembrane coupling of liquid-like protein condensates [^9d2510df]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Transmembrane coupling of protein condensates correlates with changes in lipid organization and mobility

To further investigate the effect of protein condensates on lipid organization, we compared the dynamics of condensate fusion for uncoupled (one-sided) and coupled (two-sided) condensates. (Fig. 5b, c). Specifically, by imaging the lipid probe channel during fusion events, we quantified the relaxation after fusion by measuring the aspect ratio of two coalescing domains over time, which followed an exponential decay. We observed that coupled regions had a longer characteristic relaxation time than uncoupled ones (Fig. 5d), implying that protein condensates reduced the fluidity of the resulting protein-membrane composite.
