## Question

What factors influence the clearance rate of HPV in immunocompetent individuals?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what factors influence the clearance rate of HPV in immunocompetent individuals. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline natural history of HPV clearance in immunocompetent hosts. Then, I should verify which host, viral, behavioral, and treatment-related factors modify clearance. Next, I will appraise the strength of evidence and quantify effect sizes where possible. Finally, I will synthesize practical, clinically actionable takeaways and highlight uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the baseline clearance dynamics in immunocompetent individuals. Most HPV infections are transient, with approximately 80–90% clearing within 1–2 years, and about half clearing by 6 months; persistent infection beyond 24 months is less common and carries higher oncogenic risk, which frames how we interpret "slow" versus "fast" clearance in this population [^113TJ7WA] [^114FskLh] [^114q3xSP].

> I will now examine host-related factors, starting with age. Wait, let me verify the directionality because I initially thought younger age uniformly accelerates clearance; however, the data are nuanced. In cervical HPV, adolescents and young women have very high prevalence and most infections clear, but adolescents also have high rates of low-grade cytology where overtreatment is discouraged, reflecting high acquisition rather than impaired clearance per se [^116VGprd]. In contrast, older age is consistently associated with slower clearance and higher persistence in multiple anatomic sites, including the cervix and oropharynx, with studies showing reduced clearance in women ≥ 55 years after conization and in older men with oral HPV, suggesting age-related immune senescence as a key driver [^114Dukv7] [^113CA9Ab]. Hold on, I should also note that some oral HPV cohorts found older age associated with clearance in prevalent infections, which complicates a simple "older equals slower" rule and underscores the need to distinguish incident from prevalent infections and account for behavioral confounding [^111QqyJs].

> Next, I should review immune competence and systemic factors. Even in immunocompetent hosts, subtle immune differences matter; robust HPV-specific T-cell responses, particularly CD4+ T-helper activity, correlate with clearance, whereas deficits in cellular immunity are linked to persistence, reinforcing that adaptive immunity is central to viral control [^114grKQx]. I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize from immunocompromised populations, but comparative data show that HIV-associated immunosuppression markedly impairs clearance, highlighting the mechanistic plausibility that even modest immune dysfunction in otherwise immunocompetent hosts could slow clearance, though effect sizes are smaller in the latter group [^117Db5Au] [^116s5LmU].

> Let me consider pregnancy-related immunomodulation. Pregnancy appears to transiently reduce clearance in the first two trimesters, with a postpartum "catch-up" in clearance during the third trimester and postpartum, likely reflecting gestational immune shifts; this is clinically relevant for counseling and follow-up timing in pregnant patients with HPV detected on screening [^111E1Wse].

> Now, I should review viral factors that modify clearance. High-risk types, especially HPV-16, clear more slowly than low-risk types; in anal HPV cohorts, HPV-16 consistently shows the lowest clearance rates and the highest incidence-to-clearance ratio, indicating greater persistence and oncogenic potential, and similar patterns are observed for oral HPV-16 in men [^116aQ7Ce] [^113QEEvc]. Higher viral load at detection is also associated with delayed clearance across anatomic sites, including cervical and oral HPV, supporting a dose-dependent effect of viral burden on persistence [^1164UMEw] [^113WrBTk]. But wait, what if coinfections alter clearance? Coinfection with multiple HPV types is common and may reflect or contribute to altered local immunity, though disentangling causality is challenging; nonetheless, type-specific persistence patterns persist after accounting for multiplicity, reinforcing the primacy of type and load effects [^114q3xSP].

> I will now examine behavioral and environmental modifiers. Smoking is consistently associated with increased persistence and progression risk, likely via local immunosuppression and epithelial injury; guidelines emphasize smoking cessation counseling for patients with HPV-related disease risk [^117F5yDC] [^113QEEvc]. Sexual behavior metrics such as number of partners and condom use are linked to acquisition and may influence clearance indirectly through reinfection dynamics; consistent condom use has been associated with higher clearance of cervical HPV and penile lesions in randomized and observational studies, suggesting a modest but real benefit on clearance through reduced reinoculation and possibly local immune effects [^114j5gSZ]. I should double-check that this does not imply condoms eliminate risk, as HPV can infect uncovered areas, but the reduction in incident infection and facilitation of clearance are meaningful [^111Jpg4J].

> Let me consider treatment-related factors that accelerate clearance. Surgical excision of HPV-associated lesions, such as conization for CIN, leads to rapid clearance of HPV in the treated field in most patients, with clearance typically within 3 months and low persistence at 12 months; this is why HPV testing is used as a post-treatment biomarker of cure and risk stratification [^1142vmzQ]. Adjuvant HPV vaccination at the time of treatment for CIN 2+ reduces recurrence by roughly 65% in meta-analyses, likely by preventing new infections and possibly by enhancing local immune responses, though vaccination does not hasten clearance of a preexisting active infection; this distinction is important for counseling and timing [^112QgCSM] [^115pRJQm].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and quantify where possible. The baseline 80–90% clearance within 1–2 years is supported by high-quality epidemiologic summaries and guidelines, whereas age effects are supported by multiple cohorts and post-surgical series showing slower clearance with advancing age, with odds of persistence 4–6 fold higher in women ≥ 55 years after conization compared with younger women [^113TJ7WA] [^114Dukv7]. HPV-16 persistence is consistently 1.5–2 fold slower than other high-risk types in anal and oral cohorts, and high viral load increases persistence risk by about 30–40% per log increase in some studies, though heterogeneity exists and estimates should be interpreted cautiously [^116aQ7Ce] [^1164UMEw]. Smoking and condom use effects are supported by observational and interventional data, with condom use associated with approximately 50–70% higher clearance in some analyses, acknowledging confounding and indirect mechanisms [^114j5gSZ].

> Next, I should review uncertainties and modifiers that could change conclusions. Distinction between incident and prevalent infections matters; some oral HPV analyses suggest older age associates with clearance in prevalent infections, possibly due to survivor bias or immune selection, so I need to be cautious about age generalizations across populations and study designs [^111QqyJs]. Host genetics, microbiome, and local mucosal immunity are plausible but undercharacterized; emerging data on microbial metabolites like butyrate suggest local environments may modulate persistence, but translation to clinical guidance is premature [^111cpj7G]. Finally, most data are observational; randomized trials are limited, so causal inference for some behavioral modifiers remains tentative.

> I should now translate this into practical clinical takeaways. For immunocompetent patients, emphasize that most HPV infections clear spontaneously within 1–2 years, reassure appropriately, and avoid overtreatment of low-grade lesions, especially in adolescents and young adults [^113TJ7WA] [^116VGprd]. Address modifiable risks: strongly counsel smoking cessation, support consistent condom use to reduce reinfection and facilitate clearance, and consider HPV vaccination to prevent future infections, including adjuvant vaccination at the time of CIN 2+ treatment to reduce recurrence risk [^117F5yDC] [^114j5gSZ] [^112QgCSM]. In older adults or those with persistent high-risk HPV, maintain vigilance with guideline-concordant screening intervals and consider closer follow-up given slower clearance and higher progression risk, while avoiding overtesting in very low-risk scenarios [^117TRkCw] [^115K85u4].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis remains precise: in immunocompetent individuals, clearance is primarily shaped by viral type and load, with HPV-16 and higher viral burden slowing clearance; host age and immune competence modulate risk, with older age impairing clearance; behavioral factors such as smoking and sexual exposures influence persistence via local immunity and reinfection; and treatment of HPV-related lesions accelerates clearance in the treated field, with adjuvant vaccination reducing recurrence risk, though it does not clear existing infection [^113TJ7WA] [^116aQ7Ce] [^114Dukv7] [^1142vmzQ] [^112QgCSM].

HPV clearance in immunocompetent individuals is primarily driven by **robust cell-mediated immunity** (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) [^114grKQx] and **type-specific neutralizing antibodies** that limit reinfection [^114FskLh]. Younger age, absence of smoking, and fewer sexual partners are associated with faster clearance, whereas **persistent infection is linked to older age, smoking, and high-risk HPV types** (especially HPV-16/18) [^117F5yDC] [^115K85u4]. Most infections clear within 1–2 years, but persistent high-risk HPV increases cancer risk; **no pharmacologic therapy reliably accelerates clearance** in immunocompetent hosts [^113TJ7WA].

---

## Host immune factors

- **Cell-mediated immunity**: CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses are critical for HPV clearance; impaired T-cell function delays clearance [^114grKQx].
- **Humoral immunity**: Type-specific neutralizing antibodies reduce reinfection risk but do not directly clear established infections [^116ZvR42].
- **Age**: Younger individuals clear HPV faster; clearance slows with age due to immune senescence [^114Dukv7].

---

## Viral factors

- **HPV type**: High-risk types (e.g. HPV-16, -18) persist longer and clear more slowly than low-risk types [^116aQ7Ce].
- **Viral load**: Higher initial viral load correlates with slower clearance and higher persistence risk [^1164UMEw].
- **Genetic diversity**: Intratype variants may influence persistence and clearance kinetics.

---

## Behavioral and lifestyle factors

- **Smoking**: Strongly associated with delayed clearance and increased persistence risk [^117F5yDC].
- **Sexual behavior**: Multiple partners and frequent exposure increase reinfection risk, complicating clearance [^111Jpg4J].
- **Condom use**: Consistent condom use may modestly reduce transmission and facilitate clearance by limiting reinoculation [^114j5gSZ].

---

## Hormonal and reproductive factors

Hormonal and reproductive factors influence clearance: **pregnancy** is associated with transiently reduced clearance in the first two trimesters, with a postpartum catch-up, whereas **hormonal contraception** may modestly increase persistence, though evidence is mixed [^111E1Wse] [^117F5yDC].

---

## Environmental and socioeconomic factors

Environmental and socioeconomic factors also shape clearance: **socioeconomic status** influences access to care, screening, and behavioral risks, while **co-infections** such as other STIs may impair local immunity and delay clearance [^111Jpg4J].

## Clinical implications

- **Natural history**: Most HPV infections clear spontaneously within 1–2 years; persistent high-risk HPV increases cancer risk [^113TJ7WA] [^116f37a6].
- **Prevention**: HPV vaccination reduces incident infections and may indirectly aid clearance by preventing reinfection [^111mkn9j] [^116ZvR42].
- **Management**: No pharmacologic therapy reliably accelerates clearance in immunocompetent individuals; management focuses on risk reduction and surveillance [^113TJ7WA].

### Incidence and clearance of anal human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 and HPV-18 infection, and their determinants, among human immunodeficiency virus-infected men who have sex with men in France [^1153VrTD]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prospective data on the natural history of anal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are scarce in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men who have sex with men (MSM).

Methods

We analyzed incidence and clearance of HPV-16 and HPV-18 in a French cohort of HIV-infected MSM, aged ≥ 35 years, followed-up annually (n = 438, 2014–2018).

Results

Human papillomavirus-16 and HPV-18 incidence were similar (~10% incident infections at 24 months). Human papillomavirus-16 incidence was higher among high-grade versus no lesion at baseline (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–8.18). Human papillomavirus-16 cleared significantly slower than HPV-18 (32% versus 54% by 24 months).

Conclusions

In conclusion, anal HPV-16 is more persistent than HPV-18, and its incidence correlates with a prior detection of high-grade lesions.

METHODS

Model Structure

We constructed a heterosexual compartmental transmission model with 2 competing HPV types, 1 VT and 1 NVT. In the model, individuals of both sexes are divided into 2 risk groups, distinguished by the rates at which new sexual partners of the opposite sex are contacted (Supplementary Figure 1). Within each risk group, individuals have the same age-dependent contact rates and prefer partners from the same risk group and of a similar age. We assumed a constant influx of individuals entering the model population at age 10 years and leaving at age 70 years.

We assumed susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible dynamics for both types (Supplementary Figure 2), in accordance with most heterosexual transmission models for studying the population impact of HPV vaccination. Individuals enter the population being susceptible for both types and subsequently undergo events of acquisition, clearance, and waning of natural immunity.

Unvaccinated individuals acquire infection with type i (= vt, nvt) at a rate proportional to the rate of new contacts with individuals infected with type i. On established contact, the transmission probability is β i. If vaccinated, the infection acquisition rate is reduced by the type-specific vaccine efficacy θ i. The vaccine is assumed to be fully protective against the VT (θ vt = 100%) and may induce partial protection against the NVT (θ nvt < 100%). Acquired infections of type i are cleared at rate μ i. Clearance induces natural type-specific immunity, inhibiting reinfection with the same type. Immunity wanes at rates γ f and γ m in women and men, respectively, after which the individual again becomes susceptible to that type.

Between-type competition is modeled by natural cross-immunity. During the period of type-specific immunity, cross-immunity is assumed to accelerate the clearance of the other type by a factor h ≥ 1, without blocking infection. Cross-immunity is lost simultaneously with the waning type-specific immunity. For simplicity, we consider only the symmetric case in which h does not depend on the type. Modeled as such, the 2 types disadvantage one another through cross-immunity, whereby parameter h regulates the strength of between-type competition. See Supplementary Appendix A for a more detailed description of the model.

Discussion

The ability of HPV virus-like particle vaccines to prevent new infections and their associated lesions has been clearly demonstrated. – This high prophylactic efficacy is likely explained by the induction of neutralizing antibodies that protect against infection by binding to virions and preventing them from infecting human cells. Whether HPV vaccination benefits individuals already infected with HPV is less well understood. Initial reports suggested that vaccination of women already infected with HPV did not affect the fate of detectable infections, – but more recent reports have raised the possibility of benefit in another group of women with a history of infection — women who receive treatment for HPV-associated disease. – To what extent vaccination helps prevent infection and disease after treatment and whether any benefit of vaccination in this group of women is explained by prevention of new infections after treatment vs protection against recurrence of already existing infections has not been determined.

Statistical analysis

Because the information on HPV status that is collected at the visits may not be sufficient to describe the dynamics of infection and clearance, particularly when test interval is 12 months such as in our study, we estimated incidence and clearance rates using a two-stage Markov model that allowed for interval censored event data. In the Markov model individuals can switch between states 'negative' and 'positive' at rates λ inf (negative to positive) for incident infection and λ clear (positive to negative) for clearance. The Markov assumption entails that the rate only depends on the current state; history of past HPV infection is not taken into account. Markov models can be defined by means of transition probabilities; an equivalent infinitesimal definition is based on the transition hazards, which is what we used. Both incidence and clearance rates were estimated jointly by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data, taking into account its interval censored nature. This likelihood takes the data as they are, that is, it only uses the information on HR-HPV infection status at the times of sample collection, but individuals can switch between both states at any time point, not just at the time of testing. As a consequence, we allow several infections and clearances to occur between two samples. Fitting Markov models with interval censored data has been described in detail.

We estimated incidence and clearance rate for each HPV type separately, assuming a constant rate over time. Incidence and clearance rates are expressed as events per 1000 person-months (p-m). Ratios of infection and clearance were estimated as well. Sampling uncertainty is expressed via 95% confidence intervals (CI).

For clearance rates, one constant value would not be appropriate if there were a group with high clearance and another group with low clearance rates. Therefore, we included a covariable that makes a distinction between clearance after an HPV positive visit at entry (prevalent positive cases) and clearance after an observed new infection (incident positive cases). This covariable was modelled as time-dependent: once a 'prevalent positive' person had cleared HPV and got re-infected, he contributed to the estimate of the 'incident positive' group after reinfection. These data, however, do not allow distinguishing reinfection from reactivation.

### Human papillomavirus: epidemiology and public health [^114FskLh]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Approximately 15 types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus 16 is the major type, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. The major steps of cervical carcinogenesis include HPV infection, viral persistence and progression to precancer (as opposed to viral clearance), and invasion. Human papillomavirus is the most common sexually transmitted infection. However, most HPV infections become undetectable by even sensitive HPV DNA testing within 1 to 2 years. The prevalence of infection peaks at young ages and declines thereafter, perhaps as the result of HPV type-specific acquired immunity. Most HPV infections are neither microscopically evident nor visible, making HPV DNA detection the diagnostic reference standard. Poorly defined immunologic factors are the major determinants of viral outcome. Smoking, multiparity, and long-term oral contraceptive use increase the risk of persistence and progression. Other sexually transmitted infections (eg, Chlamydia trachomatis), chronic inflammation, and nutritional factors might also play a role. Overt, long-term viral persistence in the absence of precancer is uncommon. New prevention strategies can be derived from the evolving knowledge of HPV carcinogenesis. Human papillomavirus vaccination is the ultimate prevention strategy, and large-scale trials are already underway. In the meantime, HPV DNA diagnostics are more sensitive although less specific than cytology, permitting a consideration of lengthened screening intervals. In terms of public health education, clinicians and patients will need to shift discussions of the mildly abnormal Papanicolaou test to consideration of HPV infection as a common sexually transmitted infection that rarely causes cervical cancer.

### Effective vaccination strategies for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer based on the mathematical model with a stochastic process [^113c3Bew]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection poses a significant risk to women's health by causing cervical cancer. In addition to HPV, cervical cancer incidence rates can be influenced by various factors, including human immunodeficiency virus and herpes, as well as screening policy. In this study, a mathematical model with stochastic processes was developed to analyze HPV transmission between genders and its subsequent impact on cervical cancer incidence. The model simulations suggest that both-gender vaccination is far more effective than female-only vaccination in preventing an increase in cervical cancer incidence. With increasing stochasticity, the difference between the number of patients in the vaccinated group and the number in the nonvaccinated group diminishes. To distinguish the patient population distribution of the vaccinated from the nonvaccinated, we calculated effect size (Cohen's distance) in addition to Student's t-test. The model analysis suggests a threshold vaccination rate for both genders for a clear reduction of cancer incidence when significant stochastic factors are present.

### Incidence and clearance of anal high-risk human papillomavirus in HIV-positive men who have sex with men: estimates and risk factors [^111h2xF4]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

In risk factor analyses, we allowed age, CD4 + T-cell counts, HIV-RNA viral load and cART to affect both transition rates. The incidence rate was additionally allowed to depend on number of male sexual partners, consistent condom use with anal sex in the last 12 months and country of origin. Clearance was allowed to depend on variables that were different to those for incidence, as conceptualized from the literature: current smoking status, educational level and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stage. First, we did the analysis per HR-HPV type, in which we assumed effects on the logarithm of the rate to be linear for age, square-root of CD4 + cell count, the base-10 logarithm of HIV-RNA viral load and the base-2 logarithm of number of sexual partners. We quantified their effects using the same Markov model that we used for the overall incidence calculations. For the reasons given below, we used and compared results with a Poisson regression model, again assuming a constant rate over time. In this model, we followed individuals until the first event and assumed that there were no unobserved events before. Since detection times cannot be equated to incidence or clearance dates, we took the midpoint of the time between two measurements to define incidence or clearance.

We informally compared results from both regression models in order to see whether we could use the Poisson model when fitting a model for all types jointly. In this model, the effect of the risk factors was assumed equal for all types, but we allowed overall rates (the intercepts) to differ by HPV type. For this model, we did not have software that both allows for interval censored transitions in a Markov model and correlation induced by considering all HR-HPV types in one model. In this combined Poisson model, we used generalized estimating equations to correct for multiple HPV types, assuming an exchangeable correlation structure. By assuming effects to be equal, we gained enough power to increase flexibility and allow the effects of continuous variables to be nonlinear; we used restricted cubic splines (four knots for age and three knots for the other variables).

### Persistence and clearance of oral human papillomavirus among a multi-national cohort of men [^111QqyJs]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

This study evaluates the clearance and investigate the factors associated with clearance of an oral oncogenic HPV infection in a prospective study of healthy men from the US, Brazil, and Mexico. With follow-up of up to 8 years and oral HPV testing at six month intervals, it represents one of the largest and most comprehensive evaluations of oral HPV natural history to date. We observed differences in clearance and risk factors for incident versus prevalent infections which is an important consideration as more studies investigate and draw conclusions on oral HPV natural history. We found no factors to be significantly associated with the ability to clear a newly acquired infection. Whereas among prevalent infections, older age and more oral sex was independently significantly associated with clearance. Further study is clearly needed to disentangle host demographic and behavioral factors, as well as immune response and viral factors at play with oral HPV persistence to address the increasing incidence of HPV-related OPC in men.

Incidence, clearance and incidence/clearance ratios for individual HR-HPV types

Incidence and clearance rates for each HR-HPV type are plotted in Fig. 1. Incidence as estimated by the Markov model ranged from 9.0/1000 p-m (95% CI 6.8–11.8) for HPV59 to 15.9/1000 p-m (95% CI 11.7–21.8) for HPV51. HPV16 and HPV18 had an average and slightly above average incidence respectively [11.9/1000 p-m (95% CI 9.20–15.3) and 12.8/1000 p-m (95% CI 8.6–18.9)] (Fig. 1). Clearance rates showed more variability; HPV16 showed the lowest clearance for both 'prevalent positive' (15.7/1000 p-m 95% CI 12.0–20.5) and 'incident positive' infections (22.1/1000 p-m 95% CI 11.8–41.1) (Fig. 1). For most HR-HPV types, 'incident positive' infections had higher clearance than 'prevalent positive' infections. The relatively high incidence and the low clearance rate together made HPV16 stand out as the genotype with the highest incidence/clearance ratio, both when using clearance from 'prevalent positive' infections [0.76; (95% CI 0.53–1.08)] and 'incident positive' infections [0.54; 95% CI 0.31–0.93)] (Fig. 1).

### Factors affecting clinical outcomes among patients infected with HIV and anal cancer treated with modern definitive chemotherapy and radiation therapy [^115DyfMg]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anal cancer is a relatively rare cancer and accounted for approximately 0.5% of all new cancer cases diagnosed in 2021. However, rates for new cases of anal cancer have risen an average of 2.1% each year from 2009 to 2018. Death rates have increased an average of 3.2% each year during the same time frame. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and immunosuppression, such as infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are well-known risk factors for the development of anal cancer.

HPV infection appears to persist for longer in persons living with HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (PLWHA) compared with patients uninfected with HIV; PLWHA are 7 times more likely to have persistent HPV infection, and immunosuppression from HIV could prevent HPV clearance, thus increasing the potential risk of developing anal cancer. The prevalence of anal HPV infection in men with HIV is very high, with estimates of > 86% in men who have sex with men (MSM); the only published prospective study estimates that the incidence of anal HPV-16 in MSM with HIV is 92%, with a clearance at 12.2% per year and a mean retention time of 36 months.MSM with HIV have a particularly high incidence of anal cancer compared with the general population, women with HIV, or other men with HIV. Individuals with HIV have a 40- to 80-fold increased risk of developing anal cancer compared with the general population and could be contributing to the overall rise of anal cancer incidence.

Several prospective trials have established the standard of care treatment for localized anal cancer as definitive chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT); multiple attempts to decrease the acute toxicities of CRT from mitomycin (MMC) have been tested, but CRT with 5-flurouracil (5FU) and MMC continues to be the standard treatment for patients who are immunocompetent. Toxicities have ranged as high as > 20% for acute grade 3 skin and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities for patients who are immunocompetent, often resulting in treatment breaks or delays for patients to recover from toxicities. In a pooled analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trials 87–04 and 98–11, total treatment time of more than 53 days was correlated with lower colostomy-free survival and was significantly associated with local failure. Improvements in radiation therapy (RT) technique with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) have helped decrease rates of high-grade toxicities and treatment interruptions compared with conventional 3-dimensional conformal RT.

### HPV infection and the genital cytokine milieu in women at high risk of HIV acquisition [^114q3xSP]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Cervical cancer disproportionately affects women in southern Africa, with double and triple, respectively, the incidence and mortality rates that are observed worldwide. Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by human papillomaviruses (HPV). These DNA viruses preferentially infect basal epithelial cells, and their effective evasion of host immunity can ultimately result in the formation of intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer. Over 40 HPV types are known to infect the human genital tract, with 12–20 classified as being oncogenic or "high risk" for causing cervical cancer –.

Two vaccine-preventable HPV types, HPV-16 and -18, contribute to over 70% of cervical cancer cases. These types have been included in each of the three HPV vaccines showing high efficacy in preventing HPV infection –. Because the risk of HPV infection is known to be very high following sexual debut, efforts are underway to implement these vaccines in young women worldwide, as the degree of protection is much higher in HPV uninfected individuals.

Young women in sub-Saharan Africa bear a disproportionate burden of not only HPV, but also human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection –. In addition to its role as a major factor in the development of cervical and several anogenital cancers, HPV has also been associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition. Multiple HPV strains can coinfect the same individual, thus life history of HPV infection can include simultaneous persistence, clearance (non-persistence), and/or acquisition of different HPV strains. Increased HIV infection risk in sub-Saharan Africa has been associated with prevalent HPV infection, infection with either oncogenic or non-oncogenic HPV types, infection with non-oncogenic HPV types, and concurrent infection with multiple HPV types –. Clearance of HPV infection occurs relatively quickly, with about half of infections clearing by 6 months; and more slowly over the next few years, with an average persistence of ~10 months. In two studies that assessed HPV persistence and HIV risk empirically in sub-Saharan Africa, non-persistence was associated with increased HIV risk, suggesting that active immune responses to HPV might underlie the observed HPV–HIV associations.

### Incidence and clearance of anal high-risk human papillomavirus in HIV-positive men who have sex with men: estimates and risk factors [^115xFEd6]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

None of these studies, though, took into account the interval censored nature of the data, that is, that the events of interest (incidence or clearance) are not directly observed. Estimates may be biased downwards if more than one infection and/or clearance episodes had happened between negative and positive test results. Furthermore, these studies (except Hernandez et al. assumed infection and clearance to have happened at the date of sampling.

Our aim was to estimate the incidence and clearance rates for type-specific HR-HPV infections as well as type-specific incidence/clearance ratios in MSM recently infected by HIV in a nation-wide study in Spain. Also, we wanted to study risk factors for incidence and clearance for all 12 HR-HPV types.

Discussion

In MSM recently infected by HIV in a contemporary multicenter cohort in Spain, the highest HR-HPV incidence was observed for HPV51 and 52 followed by HPV31, HPV18, HPV45 and HPV16. HPV16 had the lowest clearance rate and the largest incidence/clearance ratio, especially in the individuals that were already HPV-infected at entry, and thus potentially the highest oncogenic capacity. In the analyses of effects of covariables on incidence and clearance of the 12 HR-HPV types together, none of the risk factors for HR-HPV incidence yielded statistically significant results. For HR-HPV clearance, age and plasma HIV-RNA viral load revealed significant effects; a strongly nonlinear effect of age was observed as HIV-positive MSM younger than 25 years had up to twice the clearance of older ones. Men with higher plasma HIV-RNA viral load had lower HR-HPV clearance.

Our estimates for HR-HPV incidence are larger than those reported by most other authors. Clearance rates are also higher except for the study by Phanuphak et al. Direct comparisons are hampered by differences in sample characteristics (age distribution, maturity of HIV infection), width of follow-up intervals, and number of follow-up samples to define outcomes. Incidence and clearance rates were defined based on single HPV determinations in a follow-up visit. Some authors have used two successive six monthly HPV negative tests to define clearance in HIV-negative populations. Given our study was designed to have yearly HPV determinations, requesting a second confirmatory test would have required to wait for as long as two years before establishing outcomes and could therefore have introduced other sources of misclassification. Some of the differences between our results and other authors' may also be related to the incorporation of the interval censored information. Our two-state Markov model makes allowance for unobserved re-infections between visits. When we used standard person-years calculations for overall incidence and clearance rate and equated time of diagnosis to time of event occurrence, incidence estimates decreased by 22% for HPV16 to 53% for HPV56, and clearance decreased between 22% for HPV16 and 42% for HPV51.

### Might oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in healthy individuals explain differences in HPV-attributable fractions in oropharyngeal cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117FSBek]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Persistent oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is thought to be causally linked to the increasing rates of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) in some regions of the world. These rising trends have been observed in regions where tobacco consumption decreased while the lifetime number of sex partners and the proportion of people with a history of performing oral sex increased over time. HPV-attributable fractions (AFs) in cases of OPC are very heterogeneous, with the highest HPV-AFs observed in the United States and Northern Europe, young patients, and recent calendar periods. Sex differences are also observed, with higher HPV-AFs in males or females, depending on the region.

Contrary to the high number of prevalence surveys on cervical HPV infection conducted in the past 20 years, equivalent surveys on oral HPV infection prevalence in healthy individuals are scarce. The first global estimate on the prevalence of oral infection derives from a systematic review published in 2010 that conducted a simple pooling of 18 studies involving 4581 cancer-free subjects with an estimated overall oral HPV prevalence of 4.5%. The most frequently detected HPV type was HPV16 (1.3%). Two more recent systematic reviews with meta-analyses aimed to evaluate risk factors for oral HPV infection and to synthesize data on the prevalence, incidence, clearance, and persistence of oral HPV infection in healthy population. The estimated prevalences of oral HPV infection overall and due to HPV16 were 5.5% and 1.0%, respectively, and 7.7% and 1.4%, respectively. All of those reviews included high-risk populations, such as female sex workers and sexually transmitted diseases clinic attendees or men who have sex with men and women who had gynecological lesions, and had several limitations, such as the inability to provide age-specific prevalence and the underrepresentation of regions such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Moreover, none of the studies evaluated in detail the epidemiological differences in oral HPV infection across populations and the extent to which such differences can explain differences in HPV-AFs in OPC.

Therefore, we aimed to conduct a new systematic review applying sound meta-analysis techniques to provide age-, sex-, and type-specific global and regional estimates of the prevalence of oral mucosal alpha-type HPV infection in healthy individuals and to evaluate the potential influence and predictive value of oral HPV infection in healthy individuals on the estimated HPV-AFs and of OPC age-standardized rates (ASRs) at regional and national levels once differences in potential cofactors were considered.

### Impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 vaccination on prevalent infections and rates of cervical lesions after excisional treatment [^116ZvR42]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 virus-like particle vaccines first licensed in 2006 have been shown to be highly effective for prophylaxis of HPV infection, which in turn reduces rates of HPV-associated precancer lesions. – The high efficacy of these vaccines is thought to be explained by the induction of neutralizing antibodies that protect against infection by binding to virions and preventing them from infecting human cells.

Among HPV-infected individuals, neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination could hypothetically bind to virions produced by infected cells, reducing spread of an existing infection by limiting the ability of the virus to infect new cells in the infected individual. It is also possible that vaccine-induced, cell-mediated immune responses to L1 promote clearance of infected cells. Initial efforts to evaluate such a "secondary" effect of the vaccine, however, suggested that vaccination did not lead to faster clearance or reduced persistence of prevalent infections. –

More recently, findings from both randomized and nonrandomized studies have suggested a possible benefit of vaccination to prevent the recurrence of genital lesions after excisional treatment of prevalent disease, once again raising the possibility of a beneficial effect of vaccination of individuals already infected with HPV. – One study of women treated for cervical or vaginal HPV-associated disease observed that rates of disease after treatment were reduced among those who were vaccinated before treatment (46.2% vaccine efficacy against recurrent HPV-related disease), an effect that was stronger for cervical than noncervical disease. A similar effect was observed in a nonrandomized study that vaccinated women after treatment for cervical disease was completed (65.3% reduction in the rate of recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type 2–3, or CIN2-3). A third study of men who have sex with men treated for high-grade anal intra-epithelial neoplasia reported that rates of disease after treatment also were reduced among those who were vaccinated before treatment (55.7% reduction in the rate of recurrent high-grade anal intra-epithelial lesions). The later study was not randomized, and unvaccinated men had more time than vaccinated men from treatment to enrollment into the study, raising the possibility that efficacy estimates were biased in favor of the vaccine.

### Factors associated with persistence and clearance of high-risk oral human papillomavirus (HPV) among participants in the HPV infection in men (HIM) study [^111DpgrH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)–attributable oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs) among men is on the rise in high-resource countries globally. There is a lack of knowledge about the transition of oral HPV infection to OPC. However, based on HPV natural history at other anatomic sites, it is very likely that oral HPV persistence is an obligate precursor of HPV-attributable OPC. To date, few studies have reported on the natural history of oral HPV infections. In the past decade, factors associated with persistence of prevalent high-risk HPV infections among the population with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and at high risk of HIV was reported, as well as a study examining persistence of oral HPV infection among families. However, there is a lack of long-term prospective studies examining factors associated with oral HPV natural history, especially HPV16, the genotype most commonly found in HPV-attributable OPC, among a general, at-risk population of men. The goal of this study was to describe the percentage of prevalent oral high-risk and HPV16 infections that persist and to examine factors associated with persistence of these infections among healthy men participating in the HPV Infection in Men (HIM) Study.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^113TJ7WA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections — epidemiology and disease burden: Approximately 150 types of HPV have been identified, at least 40 of which infect the genital area. The majority of HPV infections are self-limited and are asymptomatic or unrecognized, and sexually active persons are usually exposed to HPV during their lifetime. Oncogenic, high-risk HPV infection (e.g. HPV types 16 and 18) causes the majority of cervical, penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers and precancers, whereas other HPV infection (e.g. HPV types 6 and 11) causes genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Persistent oncogenic HPV infection is the strongest risk factor for development of HPV-attributable precancers and cancers. An estimated 34,800 new HPV-attributable cancers occurred every year during 2012–2016, and before HPV vaccines were introduced, approximately 355,000 new cases of anogenital warts occurred every year.

### Abnormal cervical cytology in bone marrow transplant recipients [^115XLRUM]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Particular human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes are implicated in the genesis of abnormal cervical cytology and cervical cancer. While most immunocompetent hosts clear HPV infection with no sequelae, some develop premalignant cytological changes of whom a minority subsequently progress to overt carcinoma. Immunocompromised patients, such as renal allograft recipients and HIV-infected individuals, have a higher rate of cytological abnormalities. This is thought to be due to prolonged persistence of virus due to impaired clearance by the immune system. We undertook a retrospective review of the cervical cytology of all women who underwent BMT at two transplant centres and who had cervical smears performed between 1990 and 1998. The rate of cytological abnormalities was significantly higher than in the general population before BMT (age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.2, P = 0.02) and after BMT (OR 7.0, P < 0.0001). After BMT, allogeneic recipients had a higher rate of abnormalities than did autologous patients (OR 2.6, P = 0.02) although only allogeneic recipients had a higher rate of abnormalities post-BMT compared to pre-BMT (allogeneic OR 6.8, P = 0.004). These observations suggest that pre-transplant disease and treatment factors increase the risk of cytologic abnormalities and that transplant-related factors such as conditioning therapy and immunosuppression further increase this risk. These data suggest that more frequent screening may be required in these at-risk groups, especially allogeneic recipients. Prospective studies are required to further evaluate cytological abnormalities and HPV shedding in these populations.

Immunocompromised individuals — catch-up HPV vaccination remains uncertain because the role of "catch-up" vaccination is less clear due to concerns about effectiveness to reduce subsequent CIN 2+ in patients with human immunodeficiency virus, a history of solid organ transplantation, or those taking recently prescribed immunosuppressive medications, and more data are needed for these populations.

### Impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 vaccination on prevalent infections and rates of cervical lesions after excisional treatment [^115pRJQm]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Human papillomavirus vaccines prevent human papillomavirus infection and cervical precancers. The impact of vaccinating women with a current infection or after treatment for an human papillomavirus-associated lesion is not fully understood.

Objectives

To determine whether human papillomavirus-16/18 vaccination influences the outcome of infections present at vaccination and the rate of infection and disease after treatment of lesions.

Study Design

We included 1711 women (18–25 years) with carcinogenic human papillomavirus infection and 311 women of similar age who underwent treatment for cervical precancer and who participated in a community-based trial of the AS04-adjuvanted human papillomavirus-16/18 virus-like particle vaccine. Participants were randomized (human papillomavirus or hepatitis A vaccine) and offered 3 vaccinations over 6 months. Follow-up included annual visits (more frequently if clinically indicated), referral to colposcopy of high-grade and persistent low-grade lesions, treatment by loop electrosurgical excisional procedure when clinically indicated, and cytologic and virologic follow-up after treatment. Among women with human papillomavirus infection at the time of vaccination, we considered type-specific viral clearance, and development of cytologic (squamous intraepithelial lesions) and histologic (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) lesions. Among treated women, we considered single-time and persistent human papillomavirus infection, squamous intraepithelial lesions, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or greater. Outcomes associated with infections absent before treatment also were evaluated. Infection-level analyses were performed and vaccine efficacy estimated.

Results

Median follow-up was 56.7 months (women with human papillomavirus infection) and 27.3 months (treated women). There was no evidence of vaccine efficacy to increase clearance of human papillomavirus infections or decrease incidence of cytologic/histologic abnormalities associated with human papillomavirus types present at enrollment. Vaccine efficacy for human papillomavirus 16/18 clearance and against human papillomavirus 16/18 progression from infection to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or greater were -5.4% (95% confidence interval -19,10) and 0.3% (95% confidence interval -69,41), respectively. Among treated women, 34.1% had oncogenic infection and 1.6% had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or greater detected after treatment, respectively, and of these 69.8% and 20.0% were the result of new infections. We observed no significant effect of vaccination on rates of infection/lesions after treatment. Vaccine efficacy estimates for human papillomavirus 16/18 associated persistent infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or greater after treatment were 34.7% (95% confidence interval -131, 82) and -211% (95% confidence interval -2901, 68), respectively. We observed evidence for a partial and nonsignificant protective effect of vaccination against new infections absent before treatment. For incident human papillomavirus 16/18, human papillomavirus 31/33/45, and oncogenic human papillomavirus infections post-treatment, vaccine efficacy estimates were 57.9% (95% confidence interval -43, 88), 72.9% (95% confidence interval 29, 90), and 36.7% (95% confidence interval 1.5, 59), respectively.

Conclusion

We find no evidence for a vaccine effect on the fate of detectable human papillomavirus infections. We show that vaccination does not protect against infections/lesions after treatment. Evaluation of vaccine protection against new infections after treatment and resultant lesions warrants further consideration in future studies.

In bivariate- and multivariable-adjusted analyses, persistence of HPV16 at the second study visit was significantly higher among those with detectable HPV16 L1 antibody at enrollment compared with those who were antibody negative (OR, 4.45; 95% CI: 1.12–20.04; aOR, 9.11; 95% CI: 1.67–77.91) (Table 4). No factors were observed to be associated with oral HPV16 persistence at the 12-month time point. As the risk estimate for the association between HPV16 antibody status and oral HPV16 persistence was approximately 2 fold higher after adjustment for age, we examined whether there was effect modification by age. In stratified analyses, the association between HPV16 antibody and persistent oral HPV16 risk was restricted to men ages 31–40 years (OR, 12.0; 95% CI: 1.20–293.63), however, the interaction term was not statistically significant (data not shown).

In Kaplan-Meier curves fitted using actual duration of follow-up, median time to clearance of oral HPV16 was marginally significantly different by HPV16 L1 antibody status (P = 0.1), whereby median time to clearance was 6.64 months among men who were antibody negative and approximately 2-fold higher at 13.35 months among men who were antibody positive (Figure 3).

### Factors associated with persistence and clearance of high-risk oral human papillomavirus (HPV) among participants in the HPV infection in men (HIM) study [^113QEEvc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Human papillomavirus (HPV)–attributable oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC) incidence is increasing in many high-income countries among men. Factors associated with oral HPV persistence, the precursor of HPV-OPC, are unknown. Data from the HPV Infection in Men (HIM) Study, which followed participants > 7 years, were utilized to examine rates of persistence and associated factors.

Methods

Oral gargle samples from 3095 HIM study participants were HPV genotyped using the SPF 10 PCR-DEIA-LiPA 25 assay (DDL Diagnostic Laboratory). Oral HPV persistence for individual and grouped high-risk HPV types among 184 men positive for any high-risk HPV at their oral baseline visit was assessed at 6-month intervals. Factors associated with grouped high-risk HPV/HPV16 persistence were examined using logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to examine median time to HPV clearance overall, and by selected risk factors.

Results

Among the 7 HPV vaccine types, HPV33 had the longest median duration (7.6 months) followed by HPV16 and HPV45 (6.4 months). 10–30% of oral high-risk HPV infections persisted ≥ 24 months. Six months' persistence of oral high-risk HPV infections was positively associated with age and gingivitis and negatively with lifetime number of sexual partners, while 12 months' persistence was only inversely associated with lifetime number of sexual partners. Oral HPV16 persistence was positively associated with baseline HPV16 L1 antibody status.

Conclusions

Eighteen percent of HPV16 infections persisted beyond 24 months, potentially conferring higher risk of HPV-OPC among these men. Older age appears to be an important factor associated with oral high-risk HPV persistence. More studies among healthy men are required to understand the progression of oral HPV infection to HPV-OPC.

### Risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical neoplasia after pregnancy [^113NBcJT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The central causal role of the so-called high oncogenic–risk (HR)-human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes, such as HPV-16 in cervical carcinogenesis, has been established. HPV is a necessary but not sufficient cause of virtually all cases of cervical cancer worldwide. HR-HPV infection also causes a substantial proportion of other anogenital neoplasms and oral squamous cell carcinomas. HPV infections are one of the most common sexually transmitted conditions in the world although the vast majority are transient, with only a small proportion becoming persistent and leading the development of cervical cancer. The fact that HPV infection does not always progress to neoplastic disease suggests that interpersonal variations in the immune system may play a role in the clearance of HPV infections and/or in their acquisition. Other viral or environmental factors may also play a role. For example, parity is a well-established risk factor for cervical cancer. It is not clear, however, exactly how pregnancy influences the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical neoplasia. To our knowledge, there is no prospective study of the risk conferred by pregnancy on both HPV infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The aim of this prospective study was to analyse the risk of HPV infection and cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion following pregnancy.

Preventing oropharyngeal cancer — Although human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection might be useful in identifying individuals at high risk of oropharyngeal cancer, no adequate methods currently exist to determine the site of HPV-associated oropharyngeal precancer or cancer to target biopsy or treatment. It also should be noted that rates of non-HPV-associated oral cancer also are increased in people with HIV, and potentially malignant oral disorders can be diagnosed and followed by biopsy in some cases; the effectiveness of this approach has not been tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Penile cancer risk factors and HPV/HIV associations indicate that in the United States the median age at diagnosis is 68 years with increased risk in individuals > 50 years, and phimosis is associated with markedly higher risk (25% to 60%). An anatomic review of penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) localized 34.5% of primary lesions to the glans, 13.2% to the prepuce, and 5.3% to the shaft, with 4.5% overlapping and 42.5% unspecified. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated in approximately 45% to 80% of cases with strong correlation to types 16, 6, and 18, while HPV- or p16-positivity have been reported as favorable prognostic factors for disease-specific survival (DSS). Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have increased risk of HPV infection and associated disease; in females with HIV one study reported higher HPV acquisition (relative risk, 2.64; 95% CI, 2.04–3.42) and lower HPV clearance (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62–0.84) versus HIV-negative females, and oral HPV is common in males with HIV (17.6%; 95% CI, 13.5–22.8%). Neonatal circumcision is associated with a lower rate of penile cancer, although the protective effect is not seen in adults who have the foreskin removed.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111uY9Cv]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) has a minimum age of 9 years and, because it is not a live virus vaccine, it can be administered to individuals who are immunosuppressed, including those with HIV, although the immune response and vaccine efficacy in immunosuppressed individuals may be less than in immunocompetent individuals. HPV vaccines must be administered in a three-dose series to children and adolescents with HIV and are most effective for both males and females when given before exposure to HPV through sexual contact. Administer the first dose at age 11 years or 12 years, with approval to start as early as age 9 years. HPV vaccine should be administered early, beginning at 9 years of age, for persons with a history of sexual abuse and assault, and HPV vaccine can be administered to anyone beginning at 9 years of age. Administer the second dose 1 month to 2 months after the first dose and the third dose 6 months after the first dose (≥ 24 weeks after the first dose), and administer the three-dose series at ages 13 years through 26 years if not previously vaccinated.

Penile cancer — Risk factors and HPV/HIV associations: In the United States the median age at diagnosis is 68 years with increased risk in individuals > 50 years, and patients with phimosis carry an increased risk for penile cancer of 25% to 60%. Tumor location in a U.S. review showed 34.5% on the glans, 13.2% on the prepuce, 5.3% on the shaft, with 4.5% overlapping and 42.5% unspecified. Overall, approximately 45% to 80% of penile cancers are related to human papillomavirus (HPV) with a strong correlation with types 16, 6, and 18, and HPV- or p16- positivity has been reported as a favorable prognostic factor for better disease-specific survival. There is an increased risk of HPV infection in patients with HIV; one study reported higher HPV acquisition (relative risk, 2.64; 95% CI, 2.04–3.42) and lower HIV clearance (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62–0.84) in HIV-positive females, and oral HPV was reported as common in HIV-positive males (17.6%; 95% CI, 13.5–22.8%). Neonatal circumcision is associated with a lower rate of penile cancer, although the protective effect is not seen in adults who have the foreskin removed.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117Db5Au]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) disease — epidemiology and cancer associations in people with HIV are characterized by at least 12 oncogenic types, including HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59, with HPV68 considered "probably oncogenic" and several other types "possibly oncogenic". HPV16 alone accounts for approximately 53% to 73% of cervical cancers in the general population and HPV18 for another 12% to 21%, whereas the other oncogenic HPV types each account for under 5%. Anal cancer and a subset of tumors of the vulva, vagina, penis, and oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) are also associated with HPV, and HPV16 and 18 are the most commonly detected in noncervical HPV-positive tumors; while anal cancer and OPC occur in both women and men with HIV, these two tumors disproportionately affect males with HIV, as well as African Americans. HPV infection is the major risk factor for development of cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, and nearly all cervical cancers contain oncogenic HPV DNA sequences. Women with HIV have high incidence and persistence of HPV relative to women without HIV, as well as high rates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical precancer (CIN 3), and invasive cancer; rates of cervical cancer in women with HIV were elevated significantly compared with the general population — 3 to 4 times overall (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.13–3.70), most of these relative risks increase with decreasing CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts, and the percentage with adenocarcinoma histology compared with squamous cell carcinoma is lower in women with HIV than in the general population.

### High oral human papillomavirus type 16 load predicts long-term persistence in individuals with or at risk for HIV infection [^113WrBTk]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The association between oral human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) DNA load and infection clearance was evaluated among 88 individuals with oral HPV16 infection who were identified within a prospective cohort of 1470 HIV-infected and uninfected individuals. Oral rinse specimens were collected semiannually for up to 5 years. The oral HPV16 load at the time of the first positive test result was significantly associated with the time to clearance of infection (continuous P trends < .01). Notably, clearance rates by 24 months were 41% and 94% in the highest and lowest HPV16 load tertiles (P = 0.03), respectively. High oral HPV16 load warrants consideration as a biomarker for infection persistence, the presumed precursor of HPV16-associated oropharyngeal cancer.

### Persistence and clearance of oral human papillomavirus among a multi-national cohort of men [^113CA9Ab]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In response to the growing burden of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, this study investigated clearance of oral HPV, the obligate precursor, in a longitudinal cohort of men from the US, Brazil, and Mexico. Oral gargles collected every 6 months from the HPV Infection in Men Study were HPV genotyped using SPF 10 PCR-DEIA-LiPA 25. Oral HPV infection clearance and associated factors were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models, respectively. Median follow-up was 44.8 months with 403 and 186 men with an incident and prevalent oral HPV infection, respectively; and lower probability of clearance observed in prevalent infections. Infections were less likely to clear in the presence of increased sexual behaviors; and among prevalent infections, older men were less likely to clear their infection. Here, we report differences in prevalently and incidently detected infections with sexual behavior as a key factor and older age as a potential factor associated with clearance.

### Beyond human papillomavirus: the cervix, exogenous secondary factors, and the development of cervical precancer and cancer [^1169Vvpo]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the necessary but probably not sufficient cause of cervical precancer and cancer. Secondary exogenous and endogenous factors, HPV cofactors, may contribute to the probability of a cancer-associated (oncogenic) HPV infection progressing to cervical precancer and cancer. For these cofactors to influence the natural history of HPV infection, they must act on cervical tissue to promote viral persistence, progression to precancer or cancer given viral persistence, or both. The aim of this review was to examine briefly the impact these factors may have on carcinogenesis of the cervix. Specifically, the roles of the cervical transformation zone, cervical immunity, inflammation and coinfection, and exposure to the main HPV cofactors (smoking, oral contraceptive use, and multiparity) are discussed.

American Cancer Society human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations — The ACS recommends routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates. Health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine series at age 9 or 10 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated, and providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for adults aged older than 26 years. The ACS does not endorse the 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for shared clinical decision making for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on the selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^115GUtE3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination timing and doses — children and adolescents (9–14 years) — specifies that for immunocompetent girls and boys who receive the first dose before 15 years of age, only two doses are needed, given at 0 (baseline) and 6–12 months; the 6‑month interval is critical, and if the interval between the two doses is less than 5 months, a third dose is recommended. Two doses 6 months apart in individuals aged 9–14 years yield antibody titers equal to those in individuals aged 15–26 years who receive three doses; hence, only two doses, 6–12 months apart, are needed if vaccination is initiated before 15 years of age. Earlier vaccination is preferred because HPV vaccines are most effective before exposure and infection, with statistics indicating that 20% of 9th graders and more than 55% of 12th graders have engaged in sexual intercourse; in Sweden, vaccine effectiveness in preventing genital warts was 93% when vaccinated between 10 and 13 years compared with 48% at 20–22 years and 21% at 23–26 years. HPV vaccination is not associated with an earlier onset of sexual activity or increased incidence of sexually transmitted infections.

### Oral human papillomavirus infection in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected MSM: the OHMAR prospective cohort study [^1155DvkE]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to assess incidence and clearance of oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the respective risk factors in HIV-infected and uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM).

Methods

Oral rinse and gargles were collected semiannually from 244 MSM (103, 42.2% HIV-infected). HPV-DNA testing was performed with the Linear Array HPV Genotyping test. A Markov model was used for estimation of incidence, clearance and risk factor analysis.

Results

Incidence rates for any HPV were 21.2 and 15.0×1000 person-months in HIV-infected and uninfected MSM, respectively. The respective figures for high-risk HPVs were 10.7 and 6.5×1000 person-months. The clearance rate was 4–12 times higher than the respective incidence rate. HIV-infected MSM with > 95 lifetime oral sex partners showed increased incidence of any HPV (adjusted HR, aHR: 8.46, 95%CI 1.89 to 37.92). Condomless oral sex appeared the strongest predictor for incident infection by high-risk HPVs in this group (aHR: 13.40, 95%CI 2.55 to 70.53). Those aged > 46 years (aHR: 0.30, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.74) and those with nadir CD4+ T count of < 200cells/mm 3 (aHR: 0.14, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.75) displayed a significantly reduced clearance of any and high-risk HPVs, respectively. HIV-uninfected MSM aged > 46 years had increased risk of acquiring any HPV (aHR: 3.70, 95%CI 1.30 to 10.52) and high-risk HPV (aHR: 5.33, 95%CI 1.06 to 26.68). Any HPV clearance declined in those with more than six recent oral sex partners (aHR: 0.18, 95%CI 0.05 to 0.65).

Conclusions

Acquisition of oral HPV infection in MSM seems to occur rarely, whereas clearance seems to be a frequent event. Oral HPV natural history in these at-risk subjects is differently influenced by age and sex behaviour, depending on HIV status.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: cervical cancer, version 1.2024 [^117F5yDC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Cervical cancer — HPV and risk factors — Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is identified as the most important factor in the development of cervical cancer. The incidence of cervical cancer appears related to population HPV prevalence, with high-incidence countries having a prevalence of chronic HPV approximately 10% to 20% and low-incidence countries having 5% to 10%. Although a majority of studies report that most cervical cancers are caused by HPV, around 5% of the tumors are reported as HPV-independent tumors. Listed epidemiologic risk factors include a history of smoking, parity, oral contraceptive use, early age of onset of coitus, larger number of sexual partners, history of sexually transmitted disease, certain autoimmune diseases, and chronic immunosuppression; smoking cessation should be advised in current smokers, and former smokers should continue to avoid smoking.

### The interaction between human papillomavirus and other viruses [^111Fqe7C]. Virus Research (2017). Low credibility.

The etiological role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in anogenital tract and head and neck cancers is well established. However, only a low percentage of HPV-positive women develop cancer, indicating that HPV is necessary but not sufficient in carcinogenesis. Several biological and environmental cofactors have been implicated in the development of HPV-associated carcinoma that include immune status, hormonal changes, parity, dietary habits, tobacco usage, and co-infection with other sexually transmissible agents. Such cofactors likely contribute to HPV persistent infection through diverse mechanisms related to immune control, efficiency of HPV infection, and influences on tumor initiation and progression. Conversely, HPV co-infection with other factors may also harbor anti-tumor effects. Here, we review epidemiological and experimental studies investigating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), BK virus (BKV), JC virus (JCV), and adeno-associated virus (AAV) as viral cofactors in or therapeutic factors against the development of genital and oral HPV-associated carcinomas.

### T-cell responses to human papillomavirus type 16 among women with different grades of cervical neoplasia [^114grKQx]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus-specific CD4+ T cells may play a critical role in disease clearance

An effective CTL response might be important for HPV clearance. Human papillomavirus 16-specific CTLs are more frequent in women with cleared infection than those with newly diagnosed Human papillomavirus 16-positive CIN. However, both CD4 and CD8 effectors have been shown to be involved. Our observation that the frequency of CD4 responders varies among the disease grades suggests that the CD4+ T-cell response might be critically involved in HPV clearance. The patients with low- and high-grade disease showed CD4 reactivity less frequently. These women are more likely to have progressive disease than those patients with no CIN, and it is possible that their lack of CD4 T-cell reactivity is contributing to progression. Notably, another study has used similar protocols to examine T-helper responses to HPV16 E2, E6 and E7 peptides in healthy individuals and in women with cervical carcinoma. CD4 reactivity was found to be far more common among the group of normal donors than the cancer patients, again suggesting that HPV16-specific CD4+ T-cell immunity is important for disease protection. Evidence from allograft recipients and HIV-infected individuals also indicates that it is the absolute deficit in CD4+ T cells which is the important risk factor for HPV-induced disease and associated neoplastic progression in the immunocompromised individual, and CD4+ T cells have been shown to be prominent in resolving cutaneous and genital warts. Other recent studies looking for HPV-specific T cells in peripheral blood also suggest that helper T cells play a central role in the control of HPV infection, disease regression and clearance.

### How immunodeficiency can lead to malignancy [^116s5LmU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Immunodeficiency, whether acquired in the case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or congenital due to inborn errors of immunity (IEIs), presents clinically with not only infection and immune dysregulation but also increased risk of malignancy. The range of malignancies seen is relatively limited and attributable to the particular cellular and molecular defects in each disease. CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia in people living with HIV infection (PLWH) and certain IEIs drive the predisposition to aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including certain rare subtypes rarely seen in immunocompetent individuals. PLWH and IEI that lead to profound T-cell lymphopenia or dysfunction also are at risk of cancers related to oncogenic viruses such as Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomavirus (HPV), and Merkel cell polyomavirus. IEIs that affect natural killer cell development and/or function heavily predispose to HPV-associated epithelial cancers. Defects in DNA repair pathways compromise T- and B-lymphocyte development during immune receptor rearrangement in addition to affecting hematopoietic and epithelial DNA damage responses, resulting in both hematologic and nonhematologic cancers. Treatment of cancers in immunodeficient individuals should be curative in intent and pursued in close consultation with disease experts in immunology and infectious disease.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine hesitancy in the United States [^112LmxUX]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Although the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends vaccinating adolescents against the human papillomavirus (HPV) to prevent HPV-associated cancers, vaccine initiation and completion rates are suboptimal. Parental and provider hesitancy contributes significantly to low HPV vaccine uptake. This review describes sources of HPV vaccine hesitancy using a World Health Organization framework that categorizes determinants of vaccine hesitancy as follows: contextual factors (historical, sociocultural, environmental, or political factors), individual and group factors (personal perception or influences of the social/peer environment), and vaccine/vaccination-specific issues (directly related to vaccine or vaccination).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine (9vHPV) — Minimum Age: 9 years — can be administered to individuals who are immunosuppressed, including those with HIV infection, although the immune response and vaccine efficacy in immunosuppressed individuals may be less than in immunocompetent individuals; HPV vaccines are most effective for both males and females when given before exposure to HPV through sexual contact; administer the first dose at age 11 or 12 years, administer the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose and the third dose 6 months after the first dose (≥ 24 weeks after the first dose); administer the series at ages 13 through 26 years if not previously vaccinated; and HPV can be administered in a 3-dose series to individuals beginning at age 9 years.

### Anal pap smears and anal cancer: what dermatologists should know [^116LireL]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Squamous epithelial cells are susceptible to infection by the human papillomavirus. Infection of squamous epithelium with oncogenic human papillomavirus types is associated with development of dysplasia and potential malignant transformation. Historically, cervical cancer has been the most prevalent human papillomavirus-induced squamous neoplasia. However, because of widespread screening via Pap smear testing, rates of cervical cancer in the United States have decreased dramatically during the past 50 years. Rates of anal cancer, in contrast, have doubled during the past 30 years. The groups at highest risk for development of anal cancer are men who have sex with men, HIV-positive patients, and patients immunosuppressed as a result of solid-organ transplantation. By detecting dysplasia before it develops into invasive cancer, anal Pap smears may be a potentially useful screening tool for anal cancer, particularly in individuals known to be at increased risk. However, at this time, sufficient data supporting the benefit of anal Pap smear screening are lacking. With insufficient evidence, no national health care organizations currently recommend the use of anal Pap smears as a routine screening test, even among high-risk groups.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111DRoH9]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) in children and adolescents with or exposed to HIV — epidemiology, persistence, and neoplasia trends are summarized as follows: Perinatal transmission can occur and persistence is unusual when infection is acquired, with persistent genital HPV in 1.5% of infants. In sexually active adolescent girls, prevalence is 12% to 64%, compared with 2% to 7% in women aged > 35 years, and cervical HPV acquisition is early with 50% cumulative exposure within 3 years. Longitudinal studies show that 80% to 90% of infections in HIV-uninfected youth are transient, whereas among adolescents with HIV only 50% cleared their HPV infections. In men, overall prevalence remains above 50% across age groups. Anal HPV detection is higher in HIV-infected youth, and in women, anal HPV infection is equal to if not more prevalent than cervical infection. Among perinatally infected adolescents, 30% of HIV-infected girls had an abnormal Pap smear; the mean age at first Pap smear was 16.7 years (range 13–23 years), and 23 cases of condyloma were reported in those younger than age 13. Despite combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), studies report that HPV prevalence and rates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) have not been reduced with cART, while current data suggest that cervical cancer rates have decreased in most racial/ethnic groups and anal cancer rates have increased in HIV-infected individuals.

### Cervical cancer [^116f37a6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cervical cancer:

- **Definition**: Cervical cancer is a malignant neoplasm arising from the epithelial lining of the cervix, most commonly in the transformation zone where the squamous and glandular epithelia meet. It develops through a well-defined sequence of precursor lesions caused by persistent infection with high-risk HPV types, particularly HPV-16 and HPV-18. The disease is classified histologically as SCC in about 70% of cases and adenocarcinoma in about 25%, with other variants being rare.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cervical cancer arises from persistent infection with high-risk HPV, mainly HPV-16 and HPV-18, which integrate into the host genome and produce E6 and E7 oncoproteins that inactivate TP53 and RB1, driving malignant transformation. Chronic immunosuppression, particularly from HIV infection, increases susceptibility to HPV, persistence of infection, and earlier onset of cancer. Prevention is achieved primarily through HPV vaccination, which prevents over 90% of HPV-16 and HPV-18 infections, and secondarily through HPV-based screening, which detects precancerous lesions more effectively than cytology and substantially reduces incidence and mortality where implemented.
- **Epidemiology**: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with about 570,000 new cases and 310,000 deaths globally each year, nearly 90% of which occur in low- and middle-income countries where mortality is 18 times higher than in high-income regions. Incidence and mortality have declined by more than half in high-income countries following widespread screening and HPV vaccination, but rates remain stable or rising in many low-resource settings. The median age at diagnosis is about 47 years, with nearly half of cases occurring before age 35, and older women more likely to present with advanced disease. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV types, particularly HPV-16 and HPV-18, accounts for almost all cases worldwide.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for cervical cancer include persistent infection with high-risk oncogenic HPV types, particularly HPV-16 and HPV-18, early onset of sexual activity, multiple or high-risk sexual partners, and immunosuppression from conditions such as HIV infection or post-transplant therapy. Additional factors that increase risk include a history of STIs, prior HPV-related vulvar or vaginal dysplasia, cigarette smoking, long-term oral contraceptive use, high parity, and inadequate cervical screening or lack of HPV vaccination.
- **Disease course**: Cervical cancer is often asymptomatic in its early stages and is frequently detected incidentally through screening or pelvic examination. Common symptoms include postcoital, intermenstrual, or abnormal vaginal bleeding, and occasionally malodorous discharge. Advanced disease may cause pelvic pain, lower limb edema, or sciatica from sidewall invasion, while vesicovaginal or rectovaginal fistulas indicate bladder or rectal involvement. Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathologic evaluation of a cervical biopsy, supported by pelvic examination, cytology, and colposcopy. The disease spreads primarily through lymphatic channels to pelvic, para-aortic, mediastinal, or supraclavicular nodes, and clinical staging may be aided by cone biopsy when invasive disease is suspected but not confirmed on initial histology.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Survival in cervical cancer is determined mainly by disease stage, lymph node status, tumor volume, depth of invasion, histologic type, and overall performance status. In early-stage disease, outcomes are excellent, with a 5-year survival of about 87% for patients with stage I node-negative tumors and 73% for those with stage I node-positive disease. Prognosis worsens with increasing tumor burden and the number or location of metastatic lymph nodes. In locally advanced disease (stages IIB-IVA), concurrent chemoradiation achieves a 5-year survival of roughly 70%, though outcomes decline further with para-aortic nodal involvement, adenocarcinoma histology, or poor performance status.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^1172JYm2]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) adapted human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations — age indications and adult decision-making — state that HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, with an ACS qualifying statement that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9–12 y is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, resulting in increased numbers of cancers prevented, and health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine at age 9 or 10 y. Vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and the ACS qualifying statement specifies that providers should inform individuals aged 22–26 y who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. For adults, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all aged > 26 y and instead shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated; however, the ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27–45 y because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selection of individuals who might benefit.

### High-risk human papillomavirus clearance in pregnant women: trends for lower clearance during pregnancy with a catch-up postpartum [^111E1Wse]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

We followed 353 women referred with abnormal cervical cytology in a non-intervention cohort study. In 91 pregnant women we compared high-risk human papilloma virus rates in the subsequent trimesters and postpartum in comparison to 262 non-pregnant women. High-risk human papilloma virus clearance was compared with 179 high-risk human papilloma virus positive non-pregnant women. Our main questions were: (1) do high-risk human papilloma virus rates change during pregnancy? and (2) is there any difference between high-risk human papilloma virus clearance in pregnant and non-pregnant women? Women were monitored 3–4 monthly by cytology, colposcopy, and high-risk human papilloma virus testing. The median follow-up time was 33 months (range 3–74). Non-pregnant women showed prevalence rates of high-risk human papilloma virus of 64, 57, 53, and 50%, respectively, in four subsequent 3-months periods since the start of the study. These high-risk human papilloma virus rates were higher than in the three trimesters of pregnancy, and during the first 3 months postpartum, i.e. 50, 44, 45, and 31%, respectively. Postpartum only, this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.004). Paired comparisons of high-risk human papilloma virus prevalence rates of the different trimesters with the postpartum rate showed (McNemar test) decreased rates: first trimester: 18% (P = 0.02), second trimester: 13% (P = 0.02) and third trimester: 23% (P < 0.005). Such a phenomenon was not found in non-pregnant women. Pregnant women showed a trend for increased high-risk human papilloma virus clearance during the third trimester and postpartum compared to non-pregnant women (hazard ratios 3.3 (0.8–13.7) and 4.6 (1.6–12.8), respectively). These results suggest a lowered immune-response against human papilloma virus during the first two trimesters of pregnancy with a catch-up postpartum.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111Jpg4J]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus infection — testing limits and risk reduction: No HPV test can determine which HPV infection will become undetectable and which will persist or progress to disease; although certain circumstances allow HPV tests to determine whether a woman is at increased risk for cervical cancer, these tests are not for detecting other HPV-related problems, nor are they useful for women aged < 25 years or men of any age. Condoms used consistently and correctly can lower the chances of acquiring and transmitting HPV and developing HPV-related diseases, but because HPV can infect areas not covered by a condom, condoms might not fully protect; limiting the number of sex partners can reduce risk yet even persons with only one lifetime sex partner can get HPV, and abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method for preventing genital HPV infection.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111adpkz]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — Recommendations include "Routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or 12 years", with "Catch-up vaccination through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously". For adults, "shared clinical decision-making… is recommended for certain adults aged 27–45 years not vaccinated previously", and "HPV vaccination for all adults aged > 26 years" is not routine. Schedule guidance states, "A 2-dose vaccine schedule (at 0- and 6–12-month intervals) is recommended for persons who initiate vaccination before their 15th birthday", and "A 3-dose vaccine schedule (at 0-, 1–2-, and 6-month intervals) for immunocompromised persons regardless of age of initiation". Additional cautions and access notes include "HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women", availability "for eligible children and adolescents aged < 19 years through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program", strong safety data with " > 120 million doses of HPV vaccines distributed in the United States", and that "HPV vaccination has not been associated with initiation of sexual activity or sexual risk behaviors".

Human papillomavirus (HPV) warts — general precautions and adjunctive notes state that adequate topical anesthetics to the genital area should be given before caustic modalities are applied and that sexual contact should be limited while solutions or creams are on the skin. Although sinecatechins (15% ointment) applied TID up to 16 weeks is recommended for immunocompetent individuals, data are insufficient on safety and efficacy in HIV-infected individuals; additionally, cART has not been consistently associated with reduced risk of HPV-related cervical abnormalities in HIV-infected women.

### The need to optimize adolescent immunization [^114rKzHF]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) epidemiology — HPV can be transmitted with any genital-mucosal contact, and the lifetime risk of acquiring an HPV infection is > 80%; in the United States an estimated 79 million people are currently infected and approximately half of the 14 million new infections each year are in 15- through 24-year-old individuals; in a representative sample, just over 20% of 14- through 19-year-old girls were colonized with high-risk types; more than 26 000 new HPV-related cancers are diagnosed annually; without vaccination among girls 12 years of age and younger there would be an estimated 168 400 lifetime cases of cervical cancer and 54 100 cervical cancer deaths; comparing the prevaccine (2003–2006) with the vaccine era (2009–2012) showed a 64% decrease in 4vHPV type prevalence among girls 14 through 19 years of age and a 34% decrease among women 20 through 24 years of age.

### Immunocompetency status and its association with multicentric lower anogenital tract dysplasia [^1174KK8V]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Multicentric, human papillomavirus (HPV) associated lower genital tract disease includes preinvasive and invasive lesions at multiple anatomic sites and can be synchronous or metachronous. Identifying patients with multicentric disease is crucial because of associated high treatment failure and recurrence. This study evaluates clinicopathologic patterns in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients with multicentric lower anogenital disease.

Materials and Methods

Two-hospital retrospective study of 36 patients with histologic diagnoses of multicentric anogenital HPV-associated dysplasia was identified over a 25-year period. Patients were classified based on immune status: immunocompetent without HIV, immunocompetent with HIV, and immunocompromised. Histologic diagnoses, p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC), and in situ hybridization (ISH) for high-risk (HR) and low-risk (LR) HPV were reviewed.

Results

The most common sites of dysplasia were the anus (25%) and vulva (25%), with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) being the most frequent diagnosis (50%). Positive p16 IHC and HR-HPV ISH staining occurred in 71% and 81% of specimens, respectively. One-third of patients revealed a variation in IHC/ISH expression in lesions at the same anatomic sites at different time points. A significantly higher frequency of variation occurred in individuals living with HIV and immunocompromised individuals when compared to immunocompetent individuals.

Conclusions

This study supports the theory that some multicentric disease may arise from repeated infections with various HPV genotypes. The findings highlight the need for further research into genetic predispositions and other factors influencing the development of multicentric HPV-associated lesions in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) disease — additional considerations note that HIV-infected patients may have larger or more numerous warts and may not respond as well to therapy compared with HIV-uninfected individuals; topical cidofovir has activity against genital warts, but the product is not commercially available (CIII); intralesional interferon-alpha is usually not recommended because of high cost, difficult administration, and potential for systemic side effects (CIII); the rate of recurrence of genital warts is high despite treatment in HIV-infected individuals; and for oral warts there is no consensus, many anogenital treatments can be applied to oral mucosa, and surgery is the most common treatment for oral warts that interfere with function or for aesthetic reasons.

### Evidence-based treatment and prevention of external genital warts in female pediatric and adolescent patients [^114nLJ74]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

External anogenital warts, or condylomata acuminata, are caused by the proliferation of squamous epithelial cells secondary to human papillomavirus infection. In sexually active adults and adolescents, anogenital warts are a common sexually transmitted disease, but in children they may be a sign of sexual abuse. There are several treatment options available for anogenital warts, but no treatment has been proven to be the most efficacious, and recurrence after clinical clearance is common. Evidence-based treatment of genital warts is challenging because of the lack of controlled trials comparing treatments, especially in pediatric and adolescent populations. This paper discusses various treatment modalities such as physical destruction, cytotoxic agents, and immunomodulating therapies. Many variables influence the selection of a treatment, such as the size, quantity, and location of the warts; and the patient and provider preference, and its availability and cost. All treatments can cause local side effects, and patient tolerability must also be factored into treatment selection. Many treatments have similar clearance and recurrence rates, and none of the treatments completely eliminates the virus. With the numerous challenges surrounding the treatment of anogenital warts, the primary prevention of HPV infection through vaccination is a key component in decreasing the incidence of the disease.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) prevention in people with HIV — condoms and female condoms: Male condoms have benefits in reducing risk of transmission of nearly all sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (including HIV infection) during heterosexual intercourse and same-sex intercourse between men, and latex condoms provide a sufficient barrier to prevent passage of particles the size of HPV; consistent and proper use of latex male condoms has been associated with 70% lower incidence of oncogenic HPV infection among women, and among heterosexual men, consistent condom use was associated with 50% lower odds of HPV infection of the penis; a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of condom use in heterosexual couples found significantly more frequent clearance of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and HPV among women randomized to condom use, and of penile lesions among their male partners; in circumstances when a male condom cannot be used properly, a female condom (e.g., an FC1 or FC2 Female Condom) should be considered for heterosexual vaginal intercourse (AII) and for heterosexual or male same-sex anal intercourse (BIII).

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^116deRPX]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Cervical cancer screening research needs — average-risk individuals — emphasize improving uptake and adherence, evaluating self-sampling for hard-to-reach groups, clarifying strategies that allow cessation at age 65 years, and assessing test performance in vaccinated populations, including genotyping and longer intervals. Priorities include addressing rising adenocarcinoma rates, for which cytology is less preventive; evidence specific to adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma in situ remains limited, with some indication that primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing may improve early detection, but the optimal strategy for early adenocarcinoma detection is still unclear.

### A case-control study based on the national health and nutrition examination survey to evaluate the effects of human papilloma virus on bone health in women [^113LPgz3]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis (OP) is a prevalent chronic skeletal disease characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of bone structure. OP is of significant clinical importance as it is a major risk factor for fractures and has a substantial impact on human health and quality of life. Worldwide, there are over 200 million individuals affected by OP, with an approximate 40% prevalence rate in elderly populations in certain regions. The economic and social burdens imposed by OP and its associated fractures are substantial. Due to its multifactorial nature, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of emerging risk factors associated with the disease in order to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies for high-risk individuals.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most well-known viruses affecting humans, with a relatively high infection rate ranging from 2 to 44%. The majority of individuals will encounter HPV infection at some point in their lives. HPV has become the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide and is recognized as a causal factor for cervical cancer. It has also been implicated as a risk factor for other malignancies such as laryngeal carcinoma, anal squamous cell cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. The rate of HPV infection is significantly higher in women than in men. Similarly, being female is an independent risk factor for OP. A cross-sectional study has shown that women are more likely to develop osteoporosis than men. However, the association between HPV and BMD has not been confirmed. HPV infection is associated with chronic inflammation and immunosuppression, both of which are critical factors in the development of OP. For instance, a study supports the link between systemic (such as HIV, immunosuppressive drugs) and local immunosuppression (such as alterations in the vaginal microbiota) and an increased risk of poor prognosis in HPV and cervical diseases. Furthermore, HPV infection may increase the risk of certain types of breast cancer by inducing chronic inflammatory responses, with inflammatory factors such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α being expressed at higher levels in HPV-positive breast cancer patients compared to HPV-negative breast cancer patients and healthy controls. These findings suggest that HPV infection may affect bone health through similar inflammatory pathways, although this association has not been thoroughly investigated in the context of osteoporosis. Therefore, we aim to fill this knowledge gap through our research to explore the impact of HPV infection on women's bone health.

### Rate of human papillomavirus clearance after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [^1142vmzQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the rate of clearance of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection after surgical treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

Methods

One hundred nine women with CIN I-III, treated with cryosurgery or conization at a university hospital, were observed with cervical HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing by general primer polymerase chain reaction and HPV typing at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after treatment. Penile HPV DNA was analyzed from current sexual partners.

Results

Eighty-one percent of evaluable women were HPV DNA positive at treatment or enrollment. One year later, seven women (9%) remained positive for the same HPV type. Most women had cleared the HPV infection diagnosed at treatment within 3 months. The cryotherapy group had lower CIN grades, was younger, and had a slower HPV clearance rate (P < .002). Only four couples had HPV DNA of the same type detected.

Conclusion

Surgical treatment of CIN usually results in clearance of HPV infection within 3 months. Human papillomavirus DNA testing may be useful as a rapid intermediate end point for monitoring the efficacy of treatments.

### Incidence, clearance, and persistence of penile high-risk human papillomavirus among Rwandan men who have sex with men [^115qaEg3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Similarly, the HPV in Men study, done in Brazil, Mexico, and the United States, reported an hrHPV incidence of 22.2 per 1000 PMF. Type-specific incidence rates from the same study were 4.4 per 1000 person-months for HPV-16 (second highest after HPV-51) and 1.9 per 1000 person-months for HPV-18. There is a paucity of data on the persistence of penile hrHPV, a critical step in the carcinogenesis of HPV-related cancers, including penile cancer.

A number of factors are known to be associated with the incidence and clearance of penile hrHPV, including the number of sex partners: individuals with 2 to 5 sex partners have a lower likelihood of clearing their infection as compared with those with 0 or 1 partner. Studies that assessed the incidence, clearance, and persistence of anal hrHPV by HIV status found differences in MSMWH when compared with MSM who were HIV negative: MSMWH had higher incidence and lower clearance rates, and not being circumcised was associated with persistent anal hrHPV infection. These factors might be similar or different for the penis and, given the relationship between the anatomic sites, perhaps comparable.

Owing to the scarcity of data on the incidence, clearance, and persistence of penile hrHPV in Rwanda and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), as well as the relatively high incidence of penile cancer in some countries in SSA, such as Uganda, we sought to determine the incidence, clearance, and persistence of penile hrHPV among Rwandan MSM and to identify factors associated with persistent penile hrHPV infection.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: cervical cancer, version 1.2024 [^115K85u4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 Cervical Cancer — human papillomavirus (HPV), risk factors, and classification: Persistent HPV infection is the most important factor in the development of cervical cancer, and in high-incidence countries the prevalence of chronic HPV is approximately 10% to 20% versus 5% to 10% in low-incidence countries; HPV vaccines may also decrease the incidence of both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Although most cervical cancers are caused by HPV, around 5% of tumors are HPV-independent. Other epidemiologic risk factors include a history of smoking, parity, oral contraceptive use, early age of onset of coitus, larger number of sexual partners, history of sexually transmitted disease, certain autoimmune diseases, and chronic immunosuppression; smoking cessation should be advised in current smokers, and former smokers should continue to avoid smoking. In 2020 the World Health Organization subdivided cervical cancer into HPV-associated and HPV-independent tumors; among these, the HPV-associated SCC is the most prevalent subtype with very rare occurrences of HPV-independent SCC, and the HPV-independent AC has a less favorable prognosis as compared to the HPV-associated tumors.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) disease — impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART): Despite associations between HIV, CD4 cell count, and HPV-related cancers and precancers, the impact of ART on the incidence of HPV-related tumors is uncertain and may differ by tumor type. Some studies found decreased persistence/progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) with ART, including a study that distinguished between adherent and non-adherent ART use.

### Persistence and reappearance of high-risk human papillomavirus after conization [^1164UMEw]. Gynecologic Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Women with early cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and 3 (CIN2+) are treated by conization; however, they still have a higher risk for subsequent CIN2+ than the general female population. Persistence of high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) is a key factor in the development of CIN2+. We investigated persistence and reappearance of type-specific HR HPV infection after conization and evaluated possible co-factors.

Methods

During 2002–2006, cervical swabs from 604 women were collected before conization, at 4–6 months and at 8–12 months after conization. HPV was detected by HC2 and genotyped by LiPAv2. Information on co-factors was collected through a questionnaire. Associations were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

HR HPV persistence rate was 9.5%. The α5/6 species were more likely to persist than α9 species (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.11–4.70). For single infections, a doubling in viral load at enrolment increased the risk for persistence by 36% (95% CI, 1.13–1.63). In addition, margin status was associated with risk of persistence. Smoking, oral contraceptive use and severity of the cervical lesion did not significantly affect persistence. Among the HPV infections that had cleared, 2.2% reappeared.

Conclusion

Our study indicates that viral load is important in predicting HPV persistence. The α5/6 species were most likely to persist. However, most of these HPV types have a lower carcinogenic potential than the α7/α9 species and may be by-standers. Further studies are needed to assess whether pre-conization viral load can also predict subsequent CIN2+.

### Adjuvant human papillomavirus vaccination for patients undergoing treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 + [^116vw9h8]. ACOG (2023). High credibility.

Updated ACOG recommendation — vaccination scope during CIN 2+ treatment states that ACOG recommends adherence to current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for individuals aged 9–26 years and to consider adjuvant HPV vaccination for immunocompetent previously unvaccinated people aged 27–45 years who are undergoing treatment for CIN 2+, and this is in alignment with guidance developed by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology; details on shared clinical decision making for individuals aged 27–45 years not undergoing treatment are referenced in ACOG Committee Opinion No. 809.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — evidence in people with HIV — indicates that this trial and several other studies have established the safety and immunogenicity of HPV vaccines in a broad range of individuals with HIV infection. Some studies have demonstrated lower antibody levels in individuals with HIV infection than those who do not have HIV infection; however, the clinical significance of this observation is unknown. Studies have shown that HPV vaccination induces an anamnestic response in children and adults with HIV infection, and immune responses appear stronger among those with higher CD4 counts and suppressed HIV viral loads. Although there are no clinical trials to demonstrate HPV vaccine efficacy in prevention of oropharyngeal cancers, there is some evidence that the prevalence of oral vaccine-type HPV infections are reduced with vaccination, and one preliminary trial of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in adults with HIV infection older than 27 years suggested efficacy for prevention of oral HPV infection.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^112Y65Y2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Adults (27–45 years) — the HPV vaccine is licensed in the United States for women and men through age 45 years. Although administration is safe in patients aged 27–45 and can prevent new infections in women not previously exposed, most women in this age range will already have been exposed to HPV, and the overall public health benefit in women aged 27–45 years is markedly diminished compared with use in the target age range. For previously unvaccinated women aged 27–45 years, clinicians may use shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination.

### Exposure to microbial metabolite butyrate prolongs the survival time and changes the growth pattern of human papillomavirus 16 E6 / E7-immortalized keratinocytes in Vivo [^111cpj7G]. The American Journal of Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a ubiquitous human pathogen that can be cleared by host immunity. Nonetheless, a small percentage of the patients develop persistent infection with oncogenic HPV, which poses an increased risk of developing HPV-associated malignancy. Although cell-mediated immunity is a known systemic factor, local factors that influence persistent HPV infection have not been fully investigated. HPV-related head/neck cancers have a strong site preference for the oropharynx, suggesting the existence of unique local factors that promote HPV-induced oncogenesis. The human oropharynx often harbors anaerobic bacteria that produce a variety of byproducts, including butyrate. Because butyrate is a potent epigenetic modulator, it could be an environmental factor influencing the development of HPV-positive oropharyngeal malignancy. In this study, we showed that butyrate treatment changed the property of HPV16 E6/E7-immortalized keratinocytes. In vitro, the treatment increased the cells' migration ability, slowed the growth, and increased the genotoxic resistance. When implanted in the syngeneic mice, the treated keratinocytes survived longer and exhibited a different growth pattern. The survival advantage obtained after butyrate exposure may increase the susceptibility of HPV-infected oropharyngeal keratinocytes to further malignant transformation. These results suggest that fermentation products of tonsillar bacteria may play an important role in the long-term persistence of high-risk HPV infection, which is a critical risk factor for developing HPV-positive oropharyngeal malignancy.

### Lifestyle and reproductive risk factors associated with anal cancer in women aged over 50 years [^113KMyq7]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

In the past 20 years there has been more than a doubling in incidence of female squamous cell anal cancer registrations in the UK, the rise being most marked in middle-aged and older women. Incidence rates increase rapidly with age, and women in England have higher rates of anal cancer than men (see Figure 1, based on data from the). There are very few cases of anal cancer before age 40; in England in 2012 64% (665) of the 1043 registered anal cancer cases occurred in women and 88% (584) of the female cases were in women aged over 50 years.

High-risk human papillomavirus (HrHPV) infections, which cause the majority of cases of cervical cancer, are also responsible for between 80 and 90% of anal cancers. Similarly, HPV 16 and 18 appear to be the commonest HPV types associated with anal tumours. Despite the evidence of a strong association between high-risk strains of the HPV virus and several cancers, including anal cancer, HrHPV oncogenesis is puzzling; the majority of sexually active women are exposed to HPV infections during their lifetimes, but the anogenital cancers they cause remain relatively rare. Identification of other risk factors that have a role in HPV-related anogenital carcinogenesis is clearly important if we wish to identify individuals with an increased risk of developing an anal malignancy.

Several high-risk populations for anal cancer are already known, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals, organ transplant recipients, men who have sex with men (MSM), and women with a history of preinvasive or invasive cervical or vulval lesions. Most published research has focused on these groups, particularly HIV-positive MSM. The literature on the role of anal HPV infection in non-HIV infected individuals has also mostly examined risk in men, with twice as many studies involving males than females. Although older women account for a large proportion of those developing anal cancer, they have not been the focus of previous large-scale epidemiological research.

Other than HrHPV infection, risk factors for anal cancer in women, particularly older women who have the highest incidence of anal cancer, are unclear.

Our aim is to examine reproductive, lifestyle, hormonal, and other risk factors for incident anal cancers in women aged over 50 years in a large cohort of UK women.

### Factors associated with human papillomavirus vaccine series completion among adolescents [^11517uA4]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most cancers associated with the human papillomavirus are preventable through vaccination. However, adolescent series completion rates are at 75.8%. Two vaccine doses are recommended for adolescents, but factors influencing 2-dose series completion are not well explored. The purpose of this study is to examine individual-level and community-level factors associated with timely human papillomavirus vaccine series completion among adolescents in the Southeastern U.S.

Methods

Series completion was assessed from January 2018 to February 2019 among a cohort of adolescents initiating vaccination in 2017. Factors influencing overall series completion and timely series completion were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

Among the sample, 64.4% completed the vaccine series and 53.8% completed it timely (e.g., 14 months). Higher odds of series completion were among adolescents who were younger at vaccine initiation (AOR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.50, 2.50), who traveled moderate distances to the clinic (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.03, 2.56), and who lived in low-deprivation neighborhoods (AOR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.31, 2.60), and lower among Hispanic (AOR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.45, 0.87) and non-Hispanic Black (AOR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.54, 0.81) adolescents and among those without private insurance (AOR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.56, 0.83). Timely series completion resulted in similar findings; however, lower odds were among Hispanic (AOR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.43, 0.95) and non-Hispanic Black (AOR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.50, 0.92) adolescents than among non-Hispanic other adolescents.

Conclusions

Individual-level and community-level factors continue to influence adolescent series completion, despite a reduction in doses. Future research is needed to understand racial/ethnic and regional disparities in human papillomavirus vaccine series completion and to develop interventions to promote series completion.

### Male circumcision and genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in males and their female sexual partners: findings from the HPV infection and transmission among couples through heterosexual activity (HITCH) cohort study [^116tQ8aj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies examining the association between male circumcision (MC) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections have reported inconsistent results. We used data from the HPV Infection and Transmission Among Couples Through Heterosexual Activity (HITCH) cohort study to examine the association between MC and HPV infections in males and their female sexual partners.

Methods

We enrolled monogamous couples in a longitudinal study between 2005 and 2011 in Montreal, Canada. We used logistic and Poisson regression models with propensity score adjustment to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and rate ratios for the association between MC and the prevalence, transmission, and clearance of HPV infections.

Results

Four hundred thirteen couples were included in our study. The prevalence OR for the association between MC and baseline infections was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI].56–1.16) in males and 1.05 (95% CI, .75–1.46) in females. The incidence rate ratio for infection transmission was 0.59 (95% CI, .16–2.20) for male-to-female transmission and 0.77 (95% CI, .37–1.60) for female-to-male transmission. The clearance rate ratio for clearance of infections was 0.81 (95% CI, .52–1.24).

Conclusions

We found little evidence of an association between MC and HPV infection prevalence, transmission, or clearance in males and females. Further longitudinal couple-based studies are required to investigate this association.

### Sexually transmitted infections in youth with controlled and uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus infection [^111Bbpbx]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), disproportionately affect adolescents and young adults (AYAs) ages 13–24 years. Sexually transmitted infections likewise are a risk factor for HIV acquisition and transmission; however, there is a lack of data on STI acquisition in HIV-infected AYAs.

Methods

We determined the incidence of STIs in HIV-infected AYAs 12.5 < 25 years of age in the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) P1074 observational cohort study. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of HIV control (mean viral load < 500 copies/mL and CD4+ T cells > 500 cells/mm3 in the year preceding STI diagnosis) and other risk factors with STI occurrence.

Results

Of 1201 enrolled subjects, 1042 participants met age criteria and were included (49% male, 61% black, 88% perinatally infected; mean age 18.3 years). One hundred twenty participants had at least 1 STI on study, of whom 93 had their first lifetime STI (incidence rate = 2.8/100 person-years). For individual STI categories, 155 incident category-specific events were reported; human papillomavirus (HPV) and chlamydial infections were the most common. In the multivariable model, having an STI was associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.22), female sex (aOR = 2.65; 95% CI, 1.67–4.21), nonperinatal HIV acquisition (aOR = 2.33; 95% CI, 1.29–4.22), and uncontrolled HIV infection (aOR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.29–3.25).

Conclusions

Sexually transmitted infection acquisition in HIV-infected AYAs is associated with older age, female sex, nonperinatal HIV acquisition, and poorly controlled HIV infection. Substantial rates of STIs among HIV-infected AYAs support enhanced preventive interventions, including safe-sex practices and HPV vaccination, and antiretroviral adherence strategies.

Other considerations — vaccination in children and adolescents with HIV are as follows: For hepatitis A vaccine (HepA), "Postvaccination serology is recommended for patients with HIV following HepA, and, if lower than 10 mIU/mL, revaccination with a series of HepA can be considered". For hepatitis B vaccine, "postvaccination serology is recommended for people with certain risk factors, including HIV, and revaccination is recommended if levels are lower than 10 mIU/mL". Regarding measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), "Currently, the only vaccine for which there is a recommendation for revaccination is MMR, for which ACIP made specific recommendations for routine revaccination after initiation of ART", and individuals with perinatally acquired HIV vaccinated before effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) "should receive two appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine after effective ART has been established". For household contacts, "All members of a household who are aged > 6 months can receive yearly influenza vaccines", and contacts "can receive the LAIV or the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV); there is no preference between LAIV and IIV"; for varicella, "Immunization against varicella is encouraged" for contacts without evidence of immunity, transmission of vaccine virus "is rare", and if smallpox vaccine (ACAM2000) is needed, contact with the child or adolescent "should be avoided". For human papillomavirus (HPV), although immunocompetent initiators "between 9 and 14 years of age" may use a two-dose schedule "(0, > 6 months)", "a three-dose schedule (0, 1 to 2 months, > 6 months) is recommended for all children and adolescents who are immunocompromised, including those with HIV".

Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing — predictive value and triage in people with HIV — Observational epidemiologic studies supported the incorporation of cervical HPV testing for determining referral to colposcopy versus retesting in 1 year or during routine follow-up. Despite the very high prevalence of HPV in women with HIV, normal cytology with negative HPV co-testing had a strong negative predictive value with low 3- to 5-year incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN 2+) regardless of CD4 count, whereas the risk of precancer was high when oncogenic HPV was positive despite normal cervical cytology and several-fold greater still if HPV16 was specifically detected; additional studies showed oncogenic HPV testing had high sensitivity and negative predictive value in the triage of atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASC-US).

### High-risk human papillomavirus infection clearance following conization among patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasm grade 3 aged at least 45 years [^114Dukv7]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection clearance rates following successful cold knife conization and factors predictive of HPV clearance among patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasm grade 3.

Method

The present retrospective study analyzed clinical data from patients aged at least 45 years with cervical intraepithelial neoplasm grade 3 who had undergone successful cold knife conization and attended regular follow-up at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, China, between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2012. HPV clearance rates and potential indicators for HPV clearance were analyzed.

Results

Data from 156 patients were included; persistent high-risk HPV infection was recorded in 78 (50.0%), 45 (28.8%), 35 (22.4%), 24 (15.4%), and 21 (13.5%) patients at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months after conization, respectively. Clearance rates were significantly lower among patients aged at least 55 years compared with younger patients, with increased odds of persistent HPV infection at 8 months (odds ratio [OR] 4.038; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.766–10.839), 12 months (OR 5.923; 95% CI 2.450–16.604), 18 months (OR 5.957; 95% CI 2.031–17.469), and 24 months (OR 5.327; 95% CI 1.909–17.971) compared with patients aged 45–49 years.

Conclusion

Age was a prognostic factor for post-operative high-risk HPV infection clearance. Lower clearance rates were observed among patients aged at least 55 years.

Special populations — adolescents: Adolescent women (aged 20 and younger) have a very low risk for invasive cervical cancer, with 12 cases in 2002 in females 10 to 19 years old in the United States and an age-specific incidence of 1.5 per 100,000 for women 20 to 24 years old, compared with 11.4 per 100,000 for women 30 to 34 years old; at any single point approximately 20% to 25% of sexually active women younger than 21 years will be HPV DNA positive and approximately 80% will be HPV DNA positive at some point soon after initiating sexual activity, most infections spontaneously clear within 2 years, and therefore performing colposcopy for minor cytological abnormalities in adolescents should be discouraged.

### Willingness to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and influencing factors among male and female university students in China [^114ByPcK]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Individuals aged 18–26 years old, who are most often university students, have the highest rate of new HPV infection. The average age of sexual debut varies in different countries and cultural contexts. In Europe, America, and China, it was 19, 16, and 17 years old, respectively. With the declining age of sexual debut and compromised condom use, young Chinese students are susceptible to sexually transmitted infections including HPV. A cross‐sectional study aimed at university students in Jinan, China showed that gender was a significant factor of knowledge, attitude, and willingness toward HPV vaccination, which indicated that males and females might have different levels of knowledge and attitude to HPV vaccination, as well as dissimilar willingness to receive it. Compared with previous studies that aimed at students from specific regions in China, this study is a multicenter and school‐based survey on knowledge, attitude, and willingness toward HPV vaccination among university students in China. It aims to explore and compare the willingness to HPV vaccination, as well as influencing factors such as knowledge and attitude between male and female university students in China who have not been vaccinated against HPV, and thus to provide evidence for the future intervention of HPV vaccination and relevant policy‐making in China.

### Factors affecting completion of human papillomavirus vaccination series by gender in a predominantly hispanic border town community [^1149KntA]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for females and males aged 9 to 45. Nationally, the HPV vaccination rates are lower for males than females; however, this has not been studied in a US-Mexico border community. Our study aims to report the HPV vaccination completion by gender and determine which sociodemographic factors influence vaccination.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was conducted among uninsured and underinsured individuals aged between 9 and 26 years served through a community-based HPV vaccine program in El Paso, TX. Data collected included demographic information, psychosocial variables, and vaccine administration data. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic data. Unadjusted t test/Fisher exact test and multivariable relative risk regression were run on significant variables to determine the association with vaccine completion by gender.

Results

Most participants were female (63.4%), and an overall vaccine series completion was 30.67%. We found no significant difference in HPV vaccine completion rates by gender. Males who resided in the United States for more than a decade were 31% more likely to complete the vaccine series, and females who had 9 to 13 years of education had lower odds of vaccine completion. Knowledge significantly increased after the intervention for both genders (p = .002). There was no significant change in psychosocial variables from the preintervention to the immediate postintervention survey.

Conclusions

Our multicomponent, culturally tailored intervention may equally impact male and female participants and encourages all genders to complete their HPV vaccine series. Additional studies with a larger male sample are needed.

### What explains anorectal Chlamydia infection in women? Implications of a mathematical model for test and treatment strategies [^113fDWei]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

We incorporated site-specific natural clearance of the infections rather than individual-level clearance of infection. This means that when a woman is infected at both anatomical locations, she might clear the infection at one location, but not necessarily at the other. She would then be able to reinfect herself, thereby prolonging her infectious period, which might have led to an overestimation of the autoinoculation probability. While the possibility of site-specific clearance for chlamydia is still unknown, our assumption is in line with a previous modelling study looking at the role of site-specific infections in gonorrhoea transmission. Furthermore, a study on human papillomavirus acquisition and clearance among MSM estimated different clearance rates between the anorectal and urogenital locations, suggesting that individual-level clearance is not necessary.

The transmission probability per vaginal sex act found here was lower than that found in previous chlamydia models. Most pair models estimated transmission probabilities between 6% and 17%compared with 2% in our study. This can be explained by the extra force of infection from the autoinoculation process in the current model, where the probability of becoming vaginally infected can be seen as a combination of both probabilities. Furthermore, compared with the other models, we assumed more sex acts per week (since we model STI clinic visitors) and no duration of immunity, which results, with equal duration of infection, automatically in a lower probability of transmission per vaginal sex act. Our weekly probability of becoming infected either by vaginal sex or autoinoculation was 9%.

Our results are suggestive of a chlamydia autoinoculation process between anatomical sites in women. Support for an autoinoculation theory mainly comes from observational studies since hard evidence for this theory is lacking. For example, several studies found high anorectal detection rates in women not reporting anal intercourse. It is unknown whether other routes of transmission than autoinoculation could in part explain anorectal chlamydia detection. A recent study found that the anal use of fingers or toys was not associated with anorectal chlamydia detection, making this route of transmission less likely. Further observational evidence for autoinoculation processes comes from urinary tract infections, where bacteria that have their origin in the intestines invaded the urinary system. Moreover, our results that a large proportion (43%) of chlamydia infections at the urogenital site were caused by autoinoculation are also in line with studies showing high repeated urogenital chlamydia infection rates among women.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112hWCad]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

People with HIV aged 30 years and older — cervical cancer screening should continue throughout their lifetime (BIII). Either cytology only or cytology and HPV co-testing is acceptable for screening (BIII). A negative HPV test predicts prolonged low risk of cancer, and cytology/HPV co-testing can allow a prolonged cervical cancer screening interval in women with HIV who are older than 29 years and have normal cervical cytology with concurrent negative HPV testing. For people aged more than 65 years, it is recommended to continue cervical cancer screening because people with HIV are at higher risk for cervical cancer (BIII), while clinicians should consider other factors such as life expectancy and the risk for developing cervical cancer at this age.

Oral cancer risk assessment — major factors and attributable proportions: Tobacco and alcohol use are major risk factors for oral cancer, with a total of 20% to 30% of cases of oral cancer worldwide attributable to cigarette smoking and, in the United States, up to 75% of cases attributable to tobacco and alcohol use; additional risk factors include male sex, older age, use of betel quid, ultraviolet light exposure, infection with Candida or bacterial flora, and a compromised immune system, and sexually transmitted oral human papillomavirus infection has been recognized as a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^117TRkCw]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

L.1 Current considerations — The 2019 guidelines are designed to take into account factors that influence Clinical Action Thresholds, with screening history profoundly influencing risk estimates, specifically current HPV and cytology test results, previous HPV test results, and history of histologic HSIL; unknown history is considered separately as a risk factor. Additional factors considered because of associations with cervical cancer include HPV vaccination, age, hormonal contraception use, history of sexually transmitted infection, parity, cigarette smoking, obesity, and sexual behaviors including age of first intercourse and multiple partners. HPV vaccination at adolescence (generally before the age of 18 years) does seem to reduce the risk of HPV 16/18 infections and associated histologic HSIL, although HPV vaccination status was omitted from this version of the guidelines.

### Vulvar cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116tuqAB]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 — Vulvar cancer overview reports that in 2023, an estimated 6470 individuals will be diagnosed with vulvar cancer, and 1670 deaths are expected, that vulvar cancer accounts for 5% to 8% of gynecologic malignancies with a median age of diagnosis of 68 years, and that, based on SEER data, 5-year survival rates range from 85.6% for localized disease (stages I/II), to 47.5% for regional or locally advanced disease (stages III/IVA), and to 23.3% for stage IVB. Ninety percent of vulvar cancers are of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) histology; risk factors include increasing age, infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), cigarette smoking, inflammatory conditions affecting the vulva, and immunodeficiency, and most vulvar neoplasias are diagnosed at early stages. The International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD) in 2015 updated the description to three classes of vulvar lesions: 1) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) due to flat condyloma or HPV effect; 2) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL, formerly considered usual-type VIN); and 3) dVIN, and HPV-independent VIN is associated with a faster rate of progression to invasive SCC. HPV-associated SCC has a better prognosis than HPV-independent SCC, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) shows strong, diffuse, block-like positive nuclear and cytoplasmic staining with p16 and wild-type p53 (heterogeneous staining pattern). HPV-independent SCC is split into two main groups: those associated with TP53 mutations and those with wild-type TP53 status; the p53 abnormal, HPV-independent SCC usually occurs in older patients, is unifocal, and is associated with dVIN, with IHC usually showing aberrant p53 staining and negative or weak p16 staining, and the p53 abnormal SCCs have the worst clinical outcomes of the three molecular categories. Estimates of the percentage of vulvar cancers attributable to HPV infection range from conservative estimates of 30% to up to 69%, with a meta-analysis reporting an HPV prevalence of 39.7%; a recent meta-analysis showed the prevalence of HPV in vulvar cancer and VIN to be 39.1% and 76.1%, respectively, and of the HPV-positive disease, 78.1% were HPV-16, followed by HPV-33.

Table 3
Numbers of women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 at baseline and follow-up and HPV16 and HPV18 acquisition and clearance rates by age

*Clearance rates of HPV 16/18 were not calculated for individual ages because of insufficient numbers; CI, confidence interval.

Abnormal findings, including symptoms of mild severity in 10 women and moderate severity in 6 women, developed in 38 women in this study during a follow-up period of 11 years; severe dyskaryosis developed in 5 women. CIN or cancer was histologically confirmed in 8 women; CIN grade 1 was diagnosed in 4 women, CIN 3 was diagnosed in 3, and invasive squamous carcinoma was diagnosed in 1. Cytologic and histologic results stratified by HPV status in 1988 and 1991 are summarized in Table 4. Rates of cervical abnormality during follow-up were slightly higher for women who were HPV positive at baseline, although HPV status at either time was not significantly associated with subsequent abnormal cytologic results (Table 5). Two of the 5 women with severe dyskaryosis, however, had acquired HPV at the time of the second smear (Table 4). Both of these women were 51 years of age at baseline. Squamous carcinoma was diagnosed in 1 of these women in 1998 (7 years after HPV was detected). This woman was negative for HPV types 16 and 18. The other woman also had the cytologic diagnosis in 1998; however, no biopsy result was recorded on this occasion. This woman was positive for both HPV16 and HPV18 at baseline.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115bNVv3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Rationale — current guidelines from both the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force allow for use of HPV co-testing with cytology and a negative HPV test predicts prolonged low risk of cancer; cytology/HPV co-testing can allow for a prolonged cervical cancer screening interval in women with HIV infection who are older than 29 years and have normal cervical cytology with concurrent negative HPV testing; for women older than 65 years, it is recommended to continue cervical cancer screening, while clinicians should consider the life expectancy of the patient and the risk for developing cervical cancer at this age.

### Pathology characterization and detection of human papillomavirus type 16 in rectal squamous cell carcinomas [^112eDpPa]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rectal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare tumor with unresolved etiology. Human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals and solid organ transplant recipients experience > 30-fold and approximately 3-fold elevated rates of rectal SCC, respectively, suggesting immunosuppression plays a role. 1 Human immunodeficiency virus-infected homosexual men have > 60-fold higher rates of rectal SCC, similar to anal SCC. These patterns, which differ from the more common rectal adenocarcinoma (AdCA), raise the possibility of shared etiology between rectal and anal SCC, with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) being a likely candidate. 2.

### Human papillomavirus testing for the management of low-grade cervical abnormalities in the UK – influence of age and testing strategy [^115H4qHA]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The results of the UK pilot studies were encouraging with respect to the introduction of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing as a means to improve the management of low-grade cytological abnormalities. However, several important unresolved issues related to HPV triage remain, two of which are: what type of HPV test should be used and what age group should be targeted.

Objectives

To perform an evaluation of two commercial HPV detection tests and to correlate disease persistence and clearance with age and HPV status by the two tests.

Study Design

We performed an evaluation of two commercial HPV tests in a cross-sectional analysis of 322 cervical cytology specimens with low-grade abnormalities. A subset of these specimens were then examined longitudinally, in order to correlate disease persistence and clearance with age and HPV status by the two detection tests.

Results

The two tests performed similarly with respect to the longitudinal identification/prediction of high-grade cervical disease. Age did not appear to be a factor in determining which cases went on to manifest high-grade disease within 3 years of a low-grade result (p = 0.678).

Conclusions

This study weakens the case for age-adjusted HPV triage of low-grade cervical abnormalities.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^115qdZdv]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Medium credibility.

Updated recommendations for the use of typhoid vaccine — epidemiology, clinical course, and travel vaccination guidance note that the incubation period is 6–30 days, serious complications generally occur after 2–3 weeks of illness, and untreated illness can last a month; patients with untreated typhoid fever had case‑fatality rates > 10%, while with early and appropriate antibiotic treatment the overall case‑fatality rate is typically < 1%. In the United States, typhoid fever is uncommon with an average of about 400 cases reported annually during 2007–2011; approximately 90% of cases occur among returning travelers, > 75% of whom had been in India, Bangladesh, or Pakistan, and most travelers (≥ 55%) reported visiting friends or relatives. CDC recommends typhoid vaccination for travelers to many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, but, as of 2010, no longer recommends typhoid vaccine for travelers to certain Eastern European and Asian countries, and the importance of preventive measures is heightened by increasing resistance of Salmonella serotype Typhi to antimicrobial agents, including fluoroquinolones.

### Screening for oral cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113tLtgg]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Oral HPV epidemiology, risk factors, and trends: Sexually transmitted oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (HPV-16) has recently been recognized as an increasingly important risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer, and in the United States the prevalence of oropharyngeal cancer due to oral HPV infection is probably as high as 80% to 95%, with the prevalence of oral HPV infection associated with age, sex, number of sexual partners, and number of cigarettes smoked per day. Cancer registry data show that from 1988 to 2004, HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer decreased from 2.0 cases to 1.0 case per 100 000 persons while HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer increased more than 3-fold from 0.8 case to 2.6 cases per 100 000 persons. Overall oral HPV infection prevalence is estimated to be 6.9% in adults aged 14 to 69 years in the United States, but can be as high as 20% for persons who have more than 20 lifetime sexual partners or currently use tobacco (more than 1 pack of cigarettes per day); the prevalence of type-specific HPV-16 oral infection is estimated at 1% in adults aged 14 to 69 years (an estimated 2.13 million infected persons), and human papillomavirus-16 is associated with approximately 85% to 95% of cases of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. Up to 75% of cases of oral cancer may be attributed to tobacco and alcohol use, and since 1979, the incidence rate of oral cavity cancer in the United States has been decreasing because of the reduced consumption of alcohol and smoking prevalence.
