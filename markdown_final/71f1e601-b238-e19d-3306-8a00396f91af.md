## Question

How do RAS inhibitors work to lower blood pressure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors lower blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology of the RAS cascade and where each drug class intervenes. Then, I should verify the specific mechanisms of action for ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors. Next, I will examine the hemodynamic consequences and quantify the magnitude of blood pressure reduction. After that, I need to consider compensatory responses and why dual RAS blockade is problematic. Finally, I will integrate organ-protective effects and synthesize a concise, clinically relevant answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the physiological framework. The RAS begins with renin released from juxtaglomerular cells, which cleaves liver-derived angiotensinogen to angiotensin I; ACE then converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which binds AT1 receptors to cause vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and aldosterone release, thereby raising blood pressure. This is the canonical axis I need to keep in mind as I map mechanisms of action [^14272b3e] [^a929728b].

> Now, ACE inhibitors: I should confirm they reduce blood pressure by decreasing angiotensin II and increasing bradykinin. ACE inhibition lowers angiotensin II, which reduces vasoconstriction and aldosterone, while simultaneously increasing bradykinin, which promotes nitric oxide and prostaglandin–mediated vasodilation. Wait, let me verify the clinical implication: this dual mechanism underpins both antihypertensive efficacy and the cough/angioedema profile linked to bradykinin accumulation [^5311cfc3] [^b64669b6].

> Next, ARBs: I need to ensure I distinguish receptor-level blockade from ACE inhibition. ARBs competitively antagonize angiotensin II at AT1 receptors, reducing vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and aldosterone while sparing AT2 signaling, which may be vasodilatory and antiproliferative. Hold on, I should verify tolerability: because ARBs do not increase bradykinin, they avoid the cough and angioedema seen with ACE inhibitors, which is clinically meaningful for adherence and safety [^b03f0b63] [^f8480005].

> For direct renin inhibitors, let me think about the most proximal blockade. Aliskiren binds renin and inhibits the rate-limiting step of angiotensin I generation, thereby reducing downstream angiotensin II and its effects. I should double-check the caveat: despite near-complete suppression of plasma renin activity, reactive increases in renin concentration can occur, and clinical BP effects are comparable to ACE inhibitors and ARBs rather than clearly superior, which tempers theoretical advantages [^44bc9606] [^d45f36d8].

> I will now examine the hemodynamic consequences. Across classes, RAS blockade reduces systemic vascular resistance and intraglomerular pressure, lowers aldosterone, promotes natriuresis, and shifts the pressure–natriuresis relationship toward lower blood pressures. Let me verify magnitude: meta-analytic data for aliskiren show dose-dependent BP reductions of roughly 6–12/3–6 mmHg versus placebo, with 300 mg being the practical ceiling dose and 600 mg offering no additional benefit, aligning with the class's clinical performance [^d45f36d8] [^80f27f7a].

> But wait, what if compensatory physiology blunts effect size? I need to check that. ACE inhibitors and ARBs disinhibit renin release, raising plasma renin activity and potentially limiting BP lowering; direct renin inhibitors suppress PRA yet still provoke reactive renin rises, and in low-renin states or with excessive natriuresis, RAS inhibitors may be less effective. This helps explain why dual RAS blockade is discouraged despite theoretical synergy, given increased risks without outcome benefit [^9d658878] [^e9fde18d] [^94afb523].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "extra" benefits. I should review organ protection. Beyond BP lowering, RAS blockade reduces proteinuria and slows CKD progression, and in heart failure reduces morbidity and mortality. Some data suggest partial BP-independent effects, though disentangling BP from agent-specific effects remains challenging; nonetheless, guidelines prioritize ACE inhibitors or ARBs in CKD with albuminuria and in heart failure, reflecting both hemodynamic and structural benefits [^112b9069] [^4b05247b] [^f146dee3].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing is missing. RAS inhibitors lower blood pressure by interrupting the renin–angiotensin cascade at distinct nodes: ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II and increase bradykinin, ARBs block AT1 receptors, and direct renin inhibitors suppress the rate-limiting step. Convergent effects include decreased vasoconstriction, reduced aldosterone, natriuresis, and lower intraglomerular pressure, yielding clinically meaningful BP reductions of about 6–12/3–6 mmHg with aliskiren and similar ranges for ACE inhibitors and ARBs, with efficacy tempered by reactive renin physiology and contextualized by organ-protective benefits in CKD and heart failure [^d45f36d8] [^a929728b] [^4b05247b].

---

RAS inhibitors lower blood pressure by **blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system** at different steps, reducing angiotensin II and aldosterone, which decreases vasoconstriction, sodium/water retention, and sympathetic activity [^14272b3e]. ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II and increase bradykinin, causing vasodilation and natriuresis [^5311cfc3]; ARBs block AT1 receptors, reducing vasoconstriction and aldosterone; direct renin inhibitors block renin to suppress the entire cascade [^44bc9606]. These effects lower systemic vascular resistance and blood volume, with **average BP reductions of 8–12/4–6 mmHg** at standard doses [^d45f36d8] [^80f27f7a]. Benefits extend beyond BP lowering, including reduced proteinuria and organ protection, but dual RAS blockade is not recommended due to harm [^94afb523] [^112b9069].

---

## Mechanisms of action of RAS inhibitors

The RAS is a hormonal cascade that regulates blood pressure, fluid balance, and vascular tone [^14272b3e]. RAS inhibitors act at different steps to **reduce angiotensin II and aldosterone**, lowering blood pressure through multiple mechanisms:

| **Drug class** | **Mechanism of action** | **Physiological effects** |
|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitors (e.g. lisinopril, enalapril) | Inhibit ACE, reducing angiotensin II and increasing bradykinin | - Vasodilation<br/> - Reduced aldosterone<br/> - Natriuresis<br/> - Increased bradykinin (vasodilator) [^5311cfc3] |
| ARBs (e.g. losartan, valsartan) | Block AT1 receptors, reducing angiotensin II effects | - Vasodilation<br/> - Reduced aldosterone<br/> - Natriuresis<br/> - Preserved AT2 signaling (vasodilatory) [^b03f0b63] |
| Direct renin inhibitors (e.g. aliskiren) | Inhibit renin, suppressing the entire RAS cascade | - Reduced angiotensin II<br/> - Reduced aldosterone<br/> - Vasodilation<br/> - Natriuresis [^d45f36d8] |

---

## Hemodynamic effects of RAS inhibition

RAS inhibitors lower blood pressure through **combined effects** on vascular resistance and blood volume:

- **Vasodilation**: Reduced angiotensin II decreases vascular smooth muscle tone, lowering systemic vascular resistance [^14272b3e].
- **Reduced sodium and water retention**: Lower aldosterone decreases renal sodium and water reabsorption, reducing plasma volume and preload [^notfound].
- **Decreased sympathetic activity**: Reduced angiotensin II lowers sympathetic outflow, further lowering vascular resistance [^notfound].

---

## Magnitude of blood pressure reduction

Clinical trials show that RAS inhibitors reduce systolic/diastolic blood pressure by about **8–12/4–6 mmHg** at standard doses, with dose-dependent effects and additive benefits when combined with other antihypertensives [^d45f36d8] [^80f27f7a].

---

## Clinical benefits beyond blood pressure lowering

RAS inhibitors provide **additional cardiovascular and renal benefits**, including:

- **Reduced proteinuria**: Particularly in diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^112b9069].
- **Slowed progression of renal disease**: Independent of blood pressure effects [^112b9069].
- **Cardiovascular protection**: Reduced risk of heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction, especially in high-risk patients [^a929728b].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Reactive renin secretion**: ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase renin, which can blunt antihypertensive effects; direct renin inhibitors suppress renin but may still face compensatory mechanisms [^9d658878].
- **Hyperkalemia and renal impairment**: Risk increases in patients with CKD or diabetes, requiring monitoring [^f146dee3].
- **Dual RAS blockade**: Not recommended due to increased risk of hyperkalemia, renal dysfunction, and lack of added benefit [^94afb523] [^d5c32d5f].

---

RAS inhibitors lower blood pressure by **reducing angiotensin II and aldosterone**, leading to vasodilation, natriuresis, and reduced sympathetic activity, with average BP reductions of 8–12/4–6 mmHg and additional organ-protective effects; dual RAS blockade is discouraged due to harm [^d45f36d8] [^94afb523].

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors in hypertension: is there evidence for benefit independent of blood pressure reduction? [^42c9eb19]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension (HTN). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are first line anti-HTN drug classes that are potent, effective and largely safe. Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) have shown similar blood pressure (BP) reduction but more side effects. The efficacy of ACEIs and ARBs (for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal protection) has been promoted to extend beyond what could be explained by BP reduction alone. In the current review, we will briefly discuss the (1) pathophysiology of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) system, (2) clinical evidence for ACEIs, ARBs and DRIs in HTN, (3) comparison of ACEIs vs. ARBs and combination therapy, (4) role of RAAS inhibitors in specific patient populations, (5) safety profile of RAAS inhibitors, and (6) guideline recommendations and future perspectives. Closer scrutiny of outcome data shows little, if any, evidence that the efficacy of RAAS blockers in HTN extends beyond BP reduction.

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^d2327f0b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Renin inhibitors, which inhibit the first and rate-limiting step in the renin angiotensin system (RAS), are thought to be more effective than other RAS inhibitors in blocking the RAS. Previous meta-analyses have shown that renin inhibitors have a favourable tolerability profile in people with mild-to-moderate hypertension and a blood-pressure-lowering magnitude that is similar to that of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ARBs inhibit the RAS by interfering with the binding of angiotensin II with its receptors. ARBs are widely prescribed and recommended as first-line therapy by some hypertension guidelines. However, a drug's efficacy in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered as a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ARBs in treating hypertension are unknown.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to angiotensin receptor blockers in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

On 26 January 2024, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials: Cochrane Hypertension's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) were also searched for ongoing trials. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work and checked the bibliographies of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, parallel-design clinical trials comparing renin inhibitors and ARBs for people with primary hypertension. Studies recruiting people with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias using the RoB 1 tool, and entered the data for analysis. We reported dichotomous outcomes as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and continuous variables as mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular events, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), withdrawal due to adverse effects (WDAE), serious adverse events (SAE), and adverse events. The secondary outcomes were fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal heart failure or hospitalisation for heart failure, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and heart rate. We used the GRADE approach to rate our confidence in the evidence.

Main Results

We included 11 double-blind RCTs involving 6780 participants with mild primary hypertension and without cardiovascular complications (mean age range 52 to 59 years), with a mean follow-up ranging from four weeks to nine months. Risk of bias was low or unclear for most domains except for other bias, which was high risk for 10 of the 11 trials due to industry funding. All the studies compared aliskiren, the only marketed molecule in the class of renin inhibitors, with an ARB. The ARB comparator was losartan in four trials, valsartan in three trials, irbesartan in three trials, and telmisartan in one trial. There were very limited or no data on cardiovascular outcomes and ESRD. There may be little to no difference between renin inhibitors and ARBs in all-cause mortality (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.64; 3 studies, 1932 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is probably little to no difference between renin inhibitors and ARBs in WDAE (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.02; 9 studies, 4634 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), SAE (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.27; 6 studies, 3283 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.06; 10 studies, 4722 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There is probably little to no difference between renin inhibitors and ARBs in lowering SBP (MD -0.25 mmHg, 95% CI -1.05 to 0.56; 10 studies, 4222 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little to no difference in lowering DBP (MD 0.25 mmHg, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.64; 10 studies, 4222 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The available RCT evidence suggests little to no difference between renin inhibitors and ARBs in terms of mortality, SAE, WDAE, adverse events, and blood pressure in people with mild primary hypertension. The evidence was derived from short-term trials with a limited occurrence of morbidity outcomes, leaving any potential differences unknown. Larger RCTs of longer duration with a wider range of participants and a focus on cardiovascular outcomes are needed.

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for primary hypertension [^9bab9838]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Renin inhibitors (RIs) reduce blood pressure more than placebo, with the magnitude of this effect thought to be similar to that for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, a drug's efficacy in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered as a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The effectiveness and safety of RIs compared to ACE inhibitors in treating hypertension is unknown.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to August 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least four weeks follow-up in people with primary hypertension, which compared renin inhibitors with ACE inhibitors and reported morbidity, mortality, adverse events or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We include 11 RCTs involving 13,627 participants, with a mean baseline age from 51.5 to 74.2 years. Follow-up duration ranged from four weeks to 36.6 months. There was no difference between RIs and ACE inhibitors for the outcomes: all-cause mortality: risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.18; 5 RCTs, 5962 participants; low-certainty evidence; total myocardial infarction: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.39; 2 RCTs, 957 participants; very low-certainty evidence; adverse events: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 10 RTCs, 6007 participants;  moderate-certainty evidence; serious adverse events: RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.64; 10 RTCs, 6007 participants; low-certainty evidence; and withdrawal due to adverse effects: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.06; 10 RTCs, 6008 participants; low-certainty evidence. No data were available for total cardiovascular events, heart failure, stroke, end-stage renal disease or change in heart rate. Low-certainty evidence suggested that RIs reduced systolic blood pressure: mean difference (MD) -1.72, 95% CI -2.47 to -0.97; 9 RCTs, 5001 participants;  and diastolic blood pressure: MD -1.18, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.72; 9 RCTs, 5001 participants,  to a greater extent than ACE inhibitors, but we judged this to be more likely due to bias than a true effect.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of hypertension, we have low certainty that renin inhibitors (RI) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors do not differ for all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. We have low to moderate certainty that they do not differ for adverse events. Small reductions in blood pressure with renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors are of low certainty.  More independent, large, long-term trials are needed to compare RIs with ACE inhibitors, particularly assessing morbidity and mortality outcomes, but also on blood pressure-lowering effect.

### Newer renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocker combinations: is there an advantage? [^efb16dfe]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The necessity for new and more effective management approaches to achieve blood pressure goals is still present in spite of the number of antihypertensive medications available. One of the cornerstones of successful therapy is implementation of drug combinations that act on complementary biological pathways. This review article focuses on the evaluation of recent data supporting newer combinations involving inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with other drug classes such as calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics.

Recent Findings

New angiotensin receptor blockers as well as renin inhibitors, with a more robust blood pressure-lowering effect than their predecessors, have emerged recently. The data presented in this text also strongly supports a combination therapy approach as initial therapy to achieve blood pressure goals in a timely fashion. Additionally, the blood pressure-lowering effect is more robust with lower-dose, single-pill combinations than with highest doses of single agents alone. Therefore, using combination agents is less prone to side effects. The challenges for such single-pill combinations remain affordability. For this reason, payers and patients have traditionally not preferred such agents in spite of better blood pressure control and adherence rates.

Summary

The new combinations of renin inhibitors and the new angiotensin receptor blocker combinations add to the armamentarium of agents to control blood pressure. Whereas the new angiotensin receptor blocker offers greater efficacy on blood pressure control over other agents in the class and the availability of the only chlorthalidone combination, no outcome data exist yet with any of the new agents.

### Are there effects of renin-angiotensin system antagonists beyond blood pressure control? [^5228e56d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are recognized to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality, which is primarily attributed to their antihypertensive effects. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disease through blood pressure-independent mechanisms mediated by angiotensin II. Thus, inhibiting the RAS with either an ARB or an ACE inhibitor may confer additional benefit in people with advanced nephropathy that cannot be explained totally by reductions in blood pressure. Preclinical evidence suggests that blood pressure lowering is not solely responsible for the organ and tissue protective effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Furthermore, clinical studies evaluating effects on end organs and surrogate markers have shown that these agents have blood pressure-independent effects. There is also intriguing evidence that agents in the same class may differ in their effects on renal function despite similar blood pressure control. Support for blood pressure-independent effects comes from outcome studies. Agents evaluated in such studies and that appear to have effects independent of blood pressure lowering include irbesartan, losartan, ramipril, and telmisartan. Taken together, this body of evidence indicates that the clinical benefits of ARBs and ACE inhibitors in patients with advanced nephropathy extend beyond blood pressure reduction. Therefore, although antihypertensive efficacy is of primary importance in choosing a treatment to provide cardiovascular and renal protection, consideration should be given to the effects of an agent that extend beyond blood pressure.

### Renin inhibitors: novel agents for renoprotection or a better angiotensin receptor blocker for blood pressure lowering? [^30ceb3d0]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Direct renin inhibitors are the newest antihypertensive therapeutic class. The review describes their antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects and possible renoprotective capabilities.

Recent Findings

Clinical trials demonstrate direct renin inhibitors reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure comparable with other commonly used antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. They also reduce proteinuria and are renoprotective in experimental models of kidney disease. Direct renin inhibitors, when used with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, offer incremental blood pressure reduction far greater than that observed when an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker are used together. This suggests that renin inhibitors possess a unique and distinct mechanism of action compared with the other two therapeutic classes.

Summary

Direct renin inhibitors, due to their antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects, and the unique mechanism of action resulting in reduction in plasma renin activity and suppression of angiotensin II levels, may offer a unique opportunity to facilitate blood pressure reduction with both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as well as other commonly used therapeutic classes. More effective blood pressure and proteinuria reduction coupled with a unique means of suppressing the renin angiotensin system may offer improved opportunity for renoprotection.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^771cfcc4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients on the basis of postulated advantages for the reduction of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We included 42 studies, involving 65,733 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large studies at a low risk of bias for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence.Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalization, total cardiovascular (CV) events (consisted of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalizations), and ESRF. Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR).Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.90, ARR 1.2%), and moderate quality evidence that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, ARI 0.7%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02; moderate quality evidence), total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence). The results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05; low quality evidence).Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11; moderate quality evidence), and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01; moderate quality evidence). Results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37; low quality evidence).Compared with first-line beta-blockers, we found low quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and low quality evidence that they decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7% ). Our analyses do not exclude potentially important differences between first-line RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; low quality evidence), HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; low quality evidence), and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; low quality evidence).Blood pressure comparisons between RAS inhibitors and other classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.In the protocol, we identified non-fatal serious adverse events (SAE) as a primary outcome. However, when we extracted the data from included studies, none of them reported total SAE in a manner that could be used in the review. Therefore, there is no information about SAE in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found predominantly moderate quality evidence that all-cause mortality is similar when first-line RAS inhibitors are compared to other first-line antihypertensive agents. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. The quality of the evidence comparing first-line beta-blockers and first-line RAS inhibitors was low and the lower risk of total CV events and stroke seen with RAS inhibitors may change with the publication of additional trials. Compared with first-line CCBs, first-line RAS inhibitors reduced HF but increased stroke. The magnitude of the reduction in HF exceeded the increase in stroke. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the primary outcomes.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^c19b7b13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes because of postulated advantages for reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

This update includes three new RCTs, totaling 45 in all, involving 66,625 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large RCTs at low risk for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence.Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations, total cardiovascular (CV) events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalization), and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR).Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%), and that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, absolute risk increase (ARI) 0.7%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs did not differ for all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09); total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02); and total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05).Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line thiazides did not differ for all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07); total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11); and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37).Compared with first-line beta-blockers, low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7% ). Low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line beta-blockers did not differ for all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01); HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18); and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27).Blood pressure comparisons between first-line RAS inhibitors and other first-line classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.There is no information about non-fatal serious adverse events, as none of the trials reported this outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.

### Renin-angiotensin system and cardiovascular risk [^a929728b]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system is a major regulatory system of cardiovascular and renal function. Basic research has revealed exciting new aspects, which could lead to novel or modified therapeutic approaches. Renin-angiotensin system blockade exerts potent antiatherosclerotic effects, which are mediated by their antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and oxidative stress lowering properties. Inhibitors of the system-ie, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, are now first-line treatments for hypertensive target organ damage and progressive renal disease. Their effects are greater than expected by their ability to lower blood pressure alone. Angiotensin receptor blockers reduce the frequency of atrial fibrillation and stroke. Renin-angiotensin system blockade delays or avoids the onset of type 2 diabetes and prevents cardiovascular and renal events in diabetic patients. Thus, blockade of this system will remain a cornerstone of our strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Renin inhibition in hypertension [^cae630a9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Fifty years ago, investigators identified renin inhibition as the preferred pharmacologic approach to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Renin is a monospecific enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of angiotensin II. Amplified enzymatic activity and additional physiological effects occur when renin and pro-renin bind to the (pro)renin receptor. Until very recently, development of clinically effective renin inhibitors remained elusive. Molecular modeling was used to develop aliskiren, a potent, low-molecular-weight, nonpeptide, direct renin inhibitor with sufficient bioavailability to produce sustained suppression of plasma renin activity after oral administration. In patients with hypertension, aliskiren produces dose-dependent blood pressure (BP) reduction and 24-h BP control up to a dose of approximately 300 mg once daily; at these doses, aliskiren shows placebo-like tolerability. Its antihypertensive potency is approximately equivalent to that of angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics. After abrupt withdrawal, persistent BP reduction and prolonged suppression of plasma renin activity is observed. When combined with diuretics, fully additive BP reduction is seen. When given with an angiotensin receptor blocker, aliskiren produces significant additional BP reduction indicative of complimentary pharmacology and more complete renin-angiotensin system blockade. Clinical trials are currently underway assessing the effects of aliskiren combined with an angiotensin receptor blocker on intermediate markers of end organ damage, and long-term end point trials are planned. The results of these studies will ultimately determine the place of renin inhibition and aliskiren in the treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular disorders. The effect of aliskiren on receptor-bound renin and pro-renin is the subject of active investigation.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in hypertension: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors involving 158, 998 patients [^b64669b6]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization describes hypertension as the number one risk factor for mortality, as worldwide annually 7.5 million deaths (13% of all deaths) are attributable to high blood pressure (BP)-related diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVD).For that reason, the guidelines of hypertension and cardiology societies emphasize that hypertension treatment should aim at reducing the long-term risk of (cardiovascular) morbidity and mortality. Hypertension is often referred to as the ‘silent killer’, as its presence is usually symptomless. Therefore, compliance to antihypertensive medication is a challenge for most patients, especially as adequate BP control often requires the use of multiple agents, causing additional side effects and as a result inferior adherence.Thus, there is a continuing need for potent medications, preferably with beneficial effects on mortality, to improve patients’ adherence to the treatment prescribed.

The benefits of antihypertensive treatment on cardiovascular morbidity are thought to be mainly due to the BP-lowering effect per se, independent of the class of drug employed, as has been demonstrated with β-blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and recently with the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors.Blockade of the RAAS is one of the key therapeutic targets in patients with hypertension, as an overactive RAAS is strongly associated with high BP. The RAAS controls circulating volume and electrolyte balance in the human body and is therefore an important regulator of haemodynamic stability.RAAS inhibitors are the most widely prescribed class of drugs for the management of hypertension. Currently, the most clinically relevant pharmacological agents that block the RAAS are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs). Both drugs block angiotensin II, but ACE inhibitors are characterized by a decrease in the degradation of bradykinin leading to a release of nitric oxide and prostaglandins resulting in additional vasodilatation. These differences in modes of action between ACE inhibitors and ARBs might have clinical implications for patients with hypertension.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors for primary hypertension [^94695880]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a chronic condition associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is an important target site for five antihypertensive drug classes: beta blockers, renin inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone inhibitors. Renin is the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Renin inhibitors prevent the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II . Renin inhibitors do not affect kinin metabolism and may produce fewer adverse effects than ACE inhibitors such as dry cough or angioedema.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors versus placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases for randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of renin inhibitors: Medline (1966-March 2008), EMBASE (1988-March 2008), Cochrane CENTRAL, and bibliographic citations from retrieved references. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Study design had to meet the following criteria: double-blinded, placebo-controlled; random allocation to a specific dose of renin inhibitor group and parallel placebo group; duration of follow-up of at least three weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using risk of bias tables. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Data synthesis and analyses were done using the Cochrane Review Manager software, RevMan 5. Data for continuous variables were combined using a weighted mean difference method. Dichotomous variables were analysed using relative risk.

Main Results

Six trials (N=3694) met the inclusion criteria for this review. Aliskiren was the only renin inhibitor studied in these studies. The meta-analysis shows that aliskiren has a dose-related both systolic/diastolic blood pressure lowering effect as compared to placebo: aliskiren 75 mg -2.9/-2.3 mmHg, aliskiren 150 mg -5.5/-3.0 mmHg, aliskiren 300 mg -8.7/-5.0, aliskiren 600 mg -11.4/-6.6 mmHg. Aliskiren 300 mg significantly lowered both SBP and DBP as compared to aliskiren 150 mg (SBP:-2.97 (95% CI -3.99, -1.95) and DBP: -1.66 (95% CI -2.32, -1.0). Aliskiren has no effect on blood pressure variability. No data was available to assess the effect of aliskiren on heart rate and pulse pressure. This review found weak evidence that with short- term use, aliskiren does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects as compared to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

Aliskiren has a dose-related blood pressure lowering effect better than placebo. This effect is similar to that determined for ACE inhibitors and ARBs.

### Are there meaningful differences in blood pressure control with current antihypertensive agents? [^23a944ac]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and small reductions in blood pressure can have a substantial impact on outcome. Effective control of hypertension per se is important in reducing morbidity and mortality, but there is growing evidence that the class of drug used in treatment may affect patient outcomes. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial provided evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), are particularly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in a wide range of patients. These beneficial effects of ACEI may be independent of antihypertensive effect. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are the newest class of antihypertensive drug to enter clinical use. By blocking the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, ARB achieve more complete blockade of the RAS than ACEI. The ARB also have a substantially better side effect profile than ACEI, and early evidence suggests that ARB are beneficial in combating hypertension-related target organ damage. These favorable characteristics suggest that ARB should be considered as first-line treatment for hypertension. Based on comparative antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan, a new ARB, may represent a significant addition to this drug class.

### Protective effects of renin-angiotensin blockade beyond blood pressure control [^dbf3a402]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive drugs exert a number of blood pressure-independent benefits. However, demonstrating the clinical significance of these effects may be difficult for a number of reasons. First, blood pressure can be measured in the clinic, at home and over the 24-h period by ambulatory monitoring. Second, differences between these measures mean that achieving equivalent blood pressure reductions in two treatment arms may be difficult, if not impossible. Furthermore, even small differences in blood pressure can translate into significant effects on cardiovascular risk, especially in the later stages of the cardiovascular continuum. In large clinical trials, other errors limiting the sensitivity to treatment differences include high patient dropouts and unplanned crossover. In addition, as so many patients fail to achieve blood pressure goals even in clinical trials where patient's and physician's motivation is high, the need for cardiovascular protection beyond blood pressure control is unequivocal. Clinical trials of angiotensin II receptor blockers have suggested significant effects beyond blood pressure control, which are observed throughout and with greater consistency in the early phases of the cardiovascular continuum. There may also be differences between angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Conclusive demonstration that these blood pressure-independent effects do exist will require, however, a much more accurate and extended assessment of the blood pressure effects of the drugs.

### Drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [^6d9b36a6]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2002). Medium credibility.

Effective antihypertensive therapy has made a major contribution to the reductions in the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease that have been achieved since the 1960s. However, blood-pressure control with conventional drugs has not succeeded in reducing cardiovascular disease risks to levels seen in normotensive persons. Drugs that inhibit or antagonize components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are addressing this deficiency by targeting both blood pressure and related structural and functional abnormalities of the heart and blood vessels, thus preventing target-organ damage and related cardiovascular events.

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockade: little to No rationale for ACE inhibitor and ARB combinations [^0d0c01eb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complexities and inter-related pathways of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system continues to evolve. Which drugs to use, when, and how, are everyday questions faced by clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Combining these classes, for the purpose of enhancing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and incremental blood pressure, nephroprotective, and cardioprotective effects, logically has emerged as an area for scientific inquiry and clinical use. Despite the lack of evidence on safety and efficacy in most disease states, dual therapy has been embraced as a treatment option. Most studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension have limitations. In contrast, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in systolic heart failure has been addressed in several large randomized controlled trials. Until recently, there has been limited and conflicting evidence for the use of combination therapy for the prevention or management of nephropathy. Based on the new evidence, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in the treatment and management of hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy should be limited.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors for primary hypertension [^d45f36d8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a chronic condition associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Renin is the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Renin inhibitors are a new class of drugs that decrease blood pressure (BP) by preventing the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related BP lowering efficacy of renin inhibitors compared to placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension.To determine the change in BP variability, pulse pressure, and heart rate and to evaluate adverse events (mortality, non-fatal serious adverse events, total adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse effects and specific adverse events such as dry cough, diarrhoea and angioedema).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. There was no restriction by language or publication status. We also searched the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for clinical study reports, the Novartis Clinical Study Results Database, bibliographic citations from retrieved references, and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies evaluating BP lowering efficacy of fixed-dose monotherapy with renin inhibitor compared with placebo for a minimum duration of three to 12 weeks in adult patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

This systematic review is a comprehensive update which includes four additional studies and extensive detail from nine clinical study reports (CSRs) of previously included studies obtained from EMA. The remaining three CSRs are not available.Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. In all cases where there was a difference between the CSR and the published report, data from the CSR was used. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs.

Main Results

12 studies (mean duration of eight weeks) in 7439 mostly Caucasian patients (mean age 54 years) with mild-to-moderate uncomplicated hypertension were eligible for inclusion in the review. Aliskiren was the only renin inhibitor evaluated. All included studies were assessed to have high likelihood of attrition, reporting and funding bias.Aliskiren has a dose-related systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) lowering effect as compared with placebo MD with 95% CI: aliskiren 75 mg (MD -2.97, 95% CI -4.76 to -1.18)/(MD -2.05, 95% CI -3.13 to -0.96) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 150 mg (MD -5.95, 95% CI -6.85 to -5.06)/ (MD -3.16, 95% CI -3.74 to -2.58) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 300 mg (MD -7.88, 95% CI -8.94 to -6.82)/ (MD -4.49, 95% CI -5.17 to -3.82) mm Hg (moderate-quality evidence), aliskiren 600 mg (MD -11.35, 95% CI -14.43 to -8.27)/ (MD -5.86, 95% CI -7.73 to -3.99) mm Hg (low-quality evidence). There was a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure for aliskiren 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg. The blood pressure lowering effect of aliskiren 600 mg was not different from 300 mg (MD -0.61, 95% CI -2.78 to 1.56)/(MD -0.68, 95% CI -2.03 to 0.67). Aliskiren had no effect on blood pressure variability. Due to very limited information available regarding change in heart rate and pulse pressure, it was not possible to meta-analyze these outcomes.Mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events were not increased. This review found that in studies of eight week duration aliskiren may not increase withdrawal due to adverse events (low-quality evidence). Diarrhoea was increased in a dose-dependent manner (RR 7.00, 95% CI 2.48 to 19.72) with aliskiren 600 mg (low-quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events reported were headache, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, dizziness and fatigue.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to placebo, aliskiren lowered BP and this effect is dose-dependent. This magnitude of BP lowering effect is similar to that for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There is no difference in mortality, nonfatal serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse effects with short term aliskiren monotherapy. Diarrhoea was considerably increased with aliskiren 600 mg.

### New evidence on the importance of the renin-angiotensin system in the treatment of higher-risk patients with hypertension [^99fe9095]. Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

We reviewed the drug treatment of hypertension in the light of recent trials. beta-Blockers and diuretics clearly reduce mortality, strokes, and coronary heart disease (CHD) in hypertension. Recent trials assessed whether newer agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or calcium blockers, offer any additional advantage, or have benefits in high-risk individuals with conventionally 'normal' blood pressure. The recent ALLHAT study claimed no differences in CHD or mortality when chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril were compared. However, the decrease in blood pressure was not the same with the three agents, and a substantial proportion of patients enrolled did not have clinical disease. In contrast, the LIFE study (comparing losartan and a beta-blocker) and the ANBP-2 study [comparing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and a diuretic] reduced blood pressure similarly, yet demonstrated benefits in favour of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors. Other trials indicated similar advantages of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Among high-risk patients with initial blood pressure in the 'normal' range, ACE inhibitors significantly reduce clinical events (mortality, strokes, and myocardial infarction), despite modest decreases in blood pressure, suggesting that additional mechanisms are responsible. Recent results of the Prospective Studies Collaboration show lower risk, even in the normal blood pressure range; high-risk patients will benefit further from ACE inhibitors and ARBs (and beta-blockers after myocardial infarction). Data for other blood pressure decreasing agents are unavailable in such populations. We conclude that blood pressure decreasing per se is of clinical benefit, but drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system offer additional advantages. Drug choice is best determined by the patient's clinical condition.

### Novel RAAS agonists and antagonists: clinical applications and controversies [^e65e1d44]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulates blood pressure homeostasis and vascular injury and repair responses. The RAAS was originally thought to be an endocrine system critically important in regulating blood pressure homeostasis. Yet, important local forms of the RAAS have been described in many tissues, which are mostly independent of the systemic RAAS. These systems have been associated with diverse physiological functions, but also with inflammation, fibrosis and target-organ damage. Pharmacological modulation of the RAAS has brought about important advances in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Yet, traditional RAAS blockers such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) only reduce the risk of disease progression in patients with established cardiovascular or renal disease by ∼20% compared with other therapies. As more components of the RAAS are described, other potential therapeutic targets emerge, which could provide improved cardiovascular and renal protection beyond that provided by an ACE inhibitor or ARB. This Review summarizes the present and future pharmacological manipulation of this important system.

### Aggressive blood pressure reduction and renin-angiotensin system blockade in chronic kidney disease: time for re-evaluation? [^e46c598b]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Over the past decades, aggressive control of blood pressure (BP) and blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) were considered the cornerstones of treatment against progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), following important background and clinical evidence on the associations of hypertension and RAAS activation with renal injury. To this end, previous recommendations included a BP target of <130/80 mm Hg for all individuals with CKD (and possibly <125/75 mmHg for those with proteinuria >1 g/day), as well as use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension in all CKD patients. However, long-term extensions of relevant clinical trials support a low-BP goal only for patients with proteinuria, whereas recent cardiovascular trials questioned the benefits of low systolic BP for diabetic patients, leading to more individualized recommendations. Furthermore, our previous knowledge of the specific renoprotective properties of RAAS blockers in patients with proteinuric CKD is now extended with data on the use of these agents in patients with less advanced nephropathy and/or absence of proteinuria, deriving mostly from subanalyses of cardiovascular trials. This review discusses previous and recent clinical evidence on the issues of BP reduction and RAAS blockade by type and stage of renal damage, aiming to aid clinicians in their treatment decisions for patients with CKD.

Methods

Study selection

We intended to include all publicly available morbidity–mortality prospective randomized controlled trials that compared active treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB with control treatment (placebo, active control, or usual care).

Trials were identified by a systematic search of OVID MEDLINE and (ADIS) ISI Web of Science using a broad range of key words, including ‘antihypertensive agents’, ‘angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors’, ‘angiotensin II Type 1 receptor blockers’, ‘hypertension’, and ‘mortality’, published in English between 1 January 2000 and 1 March 2011. We decided to start our search in the year 2000, because of our intention to evaluate the effect of RAAS inhibition on top of contemporary treatment and considered the HOPE trial to be a landmark study in this respect (published in the year 2000).References of identified papers and abstract listings of annual meetings of the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, European Society of Cardiology, the American Society of Hypertension, the European Society of Hypertension, and the Council for High Blood Pressure Research were also examined during the same period. Each trial identified in this search was critically and independently evaluated by two investigators (L.v.V. and K.M.A.) for patient population, study treatment, protocol, and endpoints.

### Hypertension mega-trials with cardiovascular end points: effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [^e4e1e655]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has a pivotal role in the short- and long-term regulation of blood pressure through its principal mediator, angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs) decrease the deleterious effects of angiotensin II on the vasculature and heart, but have different mechanisms of action. Although the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors and ARBs is equivalent to that of most other antihypertensive agents, emerging data suggest that these drug classes may have a greater effect on decreasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates in specific patient populations.

Methods

We reviewed large (approximately > or =5000 patients) hypertension clinical trials using ACE inhibitors and ARBs and with cardiovascular morbidity/mortality end points.

Results

Six trials of ACE inhibitors and 5 trials of ARBs (3 completed, 2 ongoing) were selected for this analysis. Data from these hypertension mega-trials suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and left ventricular hypertrophy. However, some trials showed important blood-pressure differences and are therefore partly inconclusive for particular drug effects.

Conclusions

Analysis of recently reported and ongoing mega-trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors may support the notion that their vasculoprotective properties confer greater benefit by virtue of their effects beyond blood-pressure reduction. Results from trials that will be completed in the next few years may provide further support of blocking the renin-angiotensin-system in cardiovascular protection in the management of hypertension.

RAS indicates renin-angiotensin system. Question Does the benefit of renin-angiotensin system blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction differ between Black and non-Black patients.

Meaning RAS blockers are effective at improving cardiovascular outcomes in Black and non-Black patients with heart failure. Importance Concerns have arisen that renin-angiotensin system blockers are less effective in Black patients than non-Black patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Objective. In a subgroup analysis of V-HeFT II, 1 it appeared that mortality was reduced by enalapril compared with hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in White men but not in Black men. 1, 6 Specifically, among White patients, 90 of 292 treated with enalapril died whereas 112 of 282 treated with hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate died. The placebo-corrected decrease in systolic BP in response to RAS blocker treatment at 6 weeks was 7. 0 mm Hg in Black patients and
7. 0 mm Hg in non-Black patients.

As mentioned in the Introduction, a subgroup analysis of V-HeFT II and a matched-cohort analysis of the SOLVD trials, coupled with reports of diminished blood pressure–lowering efficacy of RAS blockers in Black patients with hypertension, are the basis of the concern about the benefit of RAS blockade in Black patients with HF.

Because all clinically approved angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) have good safety profiles and share the ability to block angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors and reduce blood pressure, it is tempting to assume that all ARBs will yield equivalent degrees of cardiovascular protection. However, such a belief depends on the tacit assumption that with appropriate dosing, all ARBs will also share the same ability to counteract other pathogenetic determinants of cardiovascular disease beyond those involving the renin-angiotensin system. Accumulating evidence from multiple laboratories has shown that this assumption is incorrect and indicates that some ARBs are characterized by an unusual ability to affect potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease involving more than just the renin-angiotensin system. Ultimately, large-scale clinical trials will be required to better understand the clinical importance of the mechanistic effects of ARBs that involve more than just inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Meanwhile, given the many functional differences among ARBs that are not mediated by AT1 receptor blockade, the effects of any particular ARB on cardiovascular outcomes should not be assumed to apply equally to all ARBs let alone to other drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system through different mechanisms.

### Renin inhibition [^4f085559]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Initial attempts to inhibit renin in humans have faced numerous difficulties. Molecular modeling and X-ray crystallography of the active site of renin have led to the development of new orally active renin inhibitors, such as aliskiren. Recent preclinical and clinical data suggest that this drug may be of value for treating patients with cardiovascular and renal disorders.

Recent Findings

The once-daily administration of aliskiren to hypertensive patients lowers blood pressure as strongly as, or more strongly than, standard doses of established angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers. It further decreases blood pressure in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. The biochemical consequences of renin inhibition differ from those of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II antagonism, particularly in terms of angiotensin profiles and interactions with the bradykinin-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway and possibly the (pro)renin receptor.

Summary

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers or a combination of these drugs has become one of the most successful therapeutic approaches in medicine. It remains unclear, however, as to how to optimize the renin-angiotensin system blockade to maximize cardiovascular and renal benefits. In this context, renin inhibition to render the renin-angiotensin system fully quiescent is a new possibility requiring further study.

### The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its therapeutic targets [^14272b3e]. Experimental Eye Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis and is a mainstay for the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases. Angiotensin II and aldosterone are the two most powerful biologically active products of the RAAS, inducing all of the classical actions of the RAAS including vasoconstriction, sodium retention, tissue remodeling and pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. In recent years, new components of the RAAS have been discovered beyond the classical pathway that have led to the identification of depressor or so-called protective RAAS pathways and the development of novel therapies targeting this system. Moreover, dual inhibitors which block the RAAS and other systems involved in the regulation of blood pressure or targeting upstream of angiotensin II by selectively deleting liver-derived angiotensinogen, the precursor to all angiotensins, may provide superior treatment for cardiovascular and renal diseases and revolutionize RAAS-targeting therapy.

### Updated report on comparative effectiveness of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors for patients with essential hypertension: much more data, little new information [^210e30e6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

A 2007 systematic review compared angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with hypertension. Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) have since been introduced, and significant new research has been published. We sought to update and expand the 2007 review.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (through December 2010) and selected other sources for relevant English-language trials.

Study Eligibility Criteria, Participants, and Interventions

We included studies that directly compared ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and/or DRIs in at least 20 total adults with essential hypertension; had at least 12 weeks of follow-up; and reported at least one outcome of interest. Ninety-seven (97) studies (36 new since 2007) directly comparing ACE inhibitors versus ARBs and three studies directly comparing DRIs to ACE inhibitor inhibitors or ARBs were included.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

A standard protocol was used to extract data on study design, interventions, population characteristics, and outcomes; evaluate study quality; and summarize the evidence.

Results

In spite of substantial new evidence, none of the conclusions from the 2007 review changed. The level of evidence remains high for equivalence between ACE inhibitors and ARBs for blood pressure lowering and use as single antihypertensive agents, as well as for superiority of ARBs for short-term adverse events (primarily cough). However, the new evidence was insufficient on long-term cardiovascular outcomes, quality of life, progression of renal disease, medication adherence or persistence, rates of angioedema, and differences in key patient subgroups.

Limitations

Included studies were limited by follow-up duration, protocol heterogeneity, and infrequent reporting on patient subgroups.

Conclusions and Implications Of Key Findings

Evidence does not support a meaningful difference between ACE inhibitors and ARBs for any outcome except medication side effects. Few, if any, of the questions that were not answered in the 2007 report have been addressed by the 36 new studies. Future research in this area should consider areas of uncertainty and be prioritized accordingly.

Key information notes there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality from dual blockade versus monotherapy, no difference in progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and no improvement of cardiovascular (CV) events, and that evidence demonstrated harm for dual blockade compared to monotherapy with evidence that dual therapy increased the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI); the recommendation places a higher value on preventing harm from hyperkalemia and AKI than on lowering proteinuria.

### Maintenance of blood pressure by reactive increases in plasma renin activity during salt depletion and renin-angiotensin system inhibition [^4cdb014e]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The commentary also draws attention to the relevance of data that support our hypotheses that a PRA level below 0.65 ng/ml/h does not lead to a vasoconstrictor effect and that the vasoconstrictor effect of a PRA level above 4.5 ng/ml/h is incompletely blocked by clinical doses of RAS inhibitors. Clinical trials are needed to address both issues. Nonetheless, these hypotheses can account for the observation that RAS inhibitors are less effective antihypertensive agents in patients with low PRA levels, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is higher in patients with preexisting CVD who develop high PRA levels during treatment with a RAS inhibitor.

### Oral renin inhibitors [^44bc9606]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Use of drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system is an effective way to intervene in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disorders. The idea of blocking the renin system at its origin by inhibition of renin has existed for more than 30 years. Renin inhibition suppresses the generation of the active peptide angiotensin II. The first generation of orally active renin inhibitors were never used clinically because of low bioavailability and weak blood-pressure-lowering activity. At present, aliskiren is the first non-peptide orally active renin inhibitor to progress to phase-III clinical trials. It might become the first renin inhibitor with indications for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular and renal disorders. Novel compounds with improved oral bioavailability, specificity, and efficacy are now in preclinical development. This Review summarises the development of oral renin inhibitors and their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, with a focus on aliskiren.

### Renal and cardio-protective effects of direct renin inhibition: a systematic literature review [^9a1bd311]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) at its rate-limiting step by means of renin inhibition has led to the development of direct renin inhibitors (DRIs). Given the renal and cardioprotective effects of RAAS blockade by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, DRIs may increase the armamentarium for further organ protection. Over the last two decades the effects of DRIs on biomarkers for renal and cardiovascular disease have been investigated. This systematic review aims to delineate the effects of DRIs on surrogate markers of renal and cardiovascular function.

Methods

MEDLINE and previous systematic reviews were searched for articles reported between 1980 and 2008. A standardized dataset was extracted from articles describing the effects of DRIs on markers of renal and cardiac damage and hard outcomes.

Results

Fifty-two articles were included. Blood pressure reductions were generally insufficient using early generation DRIs. However, recent DRIs have greater blood pressure-lowering effects. Preclinical and clinical studies showed profound effects of DRIs on markers of renal function, including clear increases in renal plasma flow and reductions in albuminuria. These effects were observed either alone or in combination with other RAAS inhibitors and suggest potential large renal protective benefit. DRIs improved hemodynamic cardiovascular parameters, such as total peripheral resistance, arterial pressure and left ventricular mass index, to a similar extent as those observed with other RAAS inhibitors. Furthermore, addition of DRIs to optimal heart failure treatment resulted in further reductions in B-type natriuretic peptide.

Conclusions

Evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests that DRIs may have renal and cardiovascular effects beyond their ability to lower blood pressure. Results of ongoing hard outcome trials are awaited to definitively assess the renal and cardio-protective effects of these agents.

### Pharmacotherapy: optimal blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [^e00762e7]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Inhibition of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is a successful therapy for hypertension, heart failure, and renal insufficiency. Overdosing of RAAS inhibitors is occasionally observed when several agents are used together, and can cause adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia, and renal failure. We advocate optimal, rather than complete, RAAS blockade.

### An update of the role of renin angiotensin in cardiovascular homeostasis [^d991cd8d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

The renin angiotensin system (RAS) is thought to be the body's main vasoconstrictor system, with physiological effects mediated via the interaction of angiotensin II with angiotensin I receptors (the "classic" RAS model). However, since the discovery of the heptapeptide angiotensin 1-7 and the development of the concept of the "alternate" RAS system, with its ability to reduce arterial blood pressure, our understanding of this physiologic system has changed dramatically. In this review, we focus on the newly discovered functions of the RAS, particularly the potential clinical significance of these developments, especially in the realm of new pharmacologic interventions for treating cardiovascular disease.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: do the latest trials challenge existing evidence? [^6a74ef1c]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The central role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) has been recognized for many years. The discovery of tissue-based angiotensin II production has resulted in the concept of a local RAS that is independent of the circulating RAS.

RAS activation following the release of renin by the kidney results in a cascade of physiological events (Figure 1). Renin catalyzes the formation of angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), resulting in activation of the angiotensin II receptors and its deleterious effect on renal vasculature, resulting in chronic kidney disease (CKD) [-]. The progressive development of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) resulting from pathophysiological changes mediated by angiotensin II in the presence of risk factors is well established and local activation of RAS in the vascular walls is thought to contribute to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, intrarenal RAS is often inappropriately activated in diabetes and is thought to predispose these patients to nephropathy. RAS inhibition (both circulatory and intrarenal) is therefore a key therapeutic approach to slow progression of CKD and to reduce CV risk through both BP-dependent and independent mechanisms.

### Pharmacology and clinical efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers [^ecd9b4f3]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension has become increasingly refined during the past decade. Although a variety of antihypertensive medication classes exist, drugs that interrupt the renin-angiotensin axis have gained a favored position in the treatment of hypertension and its attendant end-organ complications. In this regard, two drug classes, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, are most commonly used. Angiotensin receptor blockers have proven highly effective in the management of hypertension. This class is fairly heterogeneous with individual class members having somewhat distinctive pharmacologic properties. Eprosartan is a recent entry into this class. This compound compares favorably to others in this class relative to blood pressure reduction. In addition, preliminary studies indicate that this compound may uniquely interrupt the sympathetic nervous system and thereby preferentially reduce systolic blood pressure.

### Oral direct renin inhibition: premise, promise, and potential limitations of a new antihypertensive drug [^67951ae7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The first oral direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, recently received approval for the treatment of hypertension. This article addresses the premise, promise, and potential limitations of this new class of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor. Although aliskiren adds to a list of more than 100 drugs approved for the treatment of hypertension, its introduction into clinical medicine is of particular interest because of the novel mechanism of action: inhibition of renin's catalytic activity, the most proximal and rate-limiting step in renin-angiotensin system activation. By producing more complete renin-angiotensin system inhibition than with existing agents, direct renin inhibitors may afford greater protection from hypertensive complications. Other potential advantages include additional blood pressure reduction when used in combination therapy, a placebo-like side-effect profile, avid renal concentration, and long duration of action. Potential limitations include modest levels of blood pressure reduction that are equivalent to but not greater than angiotensin receptor blockers, reduced gastrointestinal absorption with a high-fat meal, and large reactive increases in renin secretion--the functional importance of which is under intense investigation. The results of outcomes trials are eagerly awaited.

### Direct renin inhibition and the kidney [^c4fc6478]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Direct renin inhibition is a new means for blocking the renin-angiotensin system at the rate-limiting step of the cascade of events triggered by renin release--the interaction of renin with its physiological substrate angiotensinogen. The remarkable success of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in the management of cardiovascular and renal disease has led to great interest in the potential of direct renin inhibitors. This Review focuses on the evidence that suggests that direct renin inhibitors might block the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney more completely than either angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. The therapeutic implications of this evidence are also reviewed, as well as the possible mechanistic routes by which direct renin inhibition might exert its influence on the kidney.

### The renin-angiotensin system as a risk factor and therapeutic target for cardiovascular and renal disease [^0df01994]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important homeostatic role in BP regulation, water and salt balance, and tissue growth control under physiologic conditions. On the other hand, a pivotal involvement of the RAS in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal disease is extensively supported by both basic and clinical evidence. In particular, it is today recognized that angiotensin II (AngII), the biologic effector of the RAS, may prompt a number of relevant structural and functional abnormalities through the activation of a complex of cellular effects mostly mediated via its binding with the AT(1) subtype receptors. The key role of these AngII-linked mechanisms of disease is strongly corroborated by large interventional studies. In fact, pharmacologic interference with RAS activity, by both preventing AngII formation with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or antagonizing its binding to cell membrane receptors by selective antagonists, is associated with highly beneficial outcomes in major disease conditions (hypertension, diabetes, renal failure, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and others). This article briefly reviews the current views on the biologic organization of RAS evidence supporting a pathogenic role of the RAS activity in promoting cardiac, vascular, and renal disease, and finally provides the basis for considering inhibition of RAS activity a major target for therapeutic interventions in these conditions.

### Therapeutic perspectives in hypertension: novel means for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and emerging device-based approaches [^a1fcf56b]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite the recent and substantial advances in the treatment of hypertension, the majority of patients still remains not optimally controlled; hence, the need for innovative strategies to lower blood pressure (BP). The current BP target values are fairly aggressive, often requiring the addition of a 4th or 5th agent, ultimately taxing the imagination of even the most skilled physician and reducing drug compliance in a large proportion of patients.

Any innovation in antihypertensive therapy is generally judged based on: (i) the capability to improve BP control; (ii) the effectiveness in treatment resistant hypertension; (iii) potential for further (beyond BP control) risk reduction, by impact on the associated functional, metabolic, and structural alterations.While this issue is highly debated, the most part falls on the side of tight BP control rather than a specific treatment.Novel approaches to hypertension treatment include: (i) drug-based strategies targeting traditional (e.g. the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, RAAS) or less-well studied (e.g. endothelin or renalase) neurohumoral pathways; (ii) unique approaches involving gene and vaccine therapies; and (iii) device-based therapies (baroreceptor sensitization or renal nerve ablation). We provide an overview of various therapies in development (Table 1) and outline prospects how and which of them might impact clinical care.

### Aliskiren: renin inhibitor for hypertension management [^80f27f7a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has long been recognized to play a significant role in hypertension pathophysiology. Certain agents that modify the RAAS can control blood pressure and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Aliskiren is the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents known as renin inhibitors.

Objective

The goal of this article was to discuss the clinical pharmacology of aliskiren and its use in the management of hypertension, as well as potential uses in other cardiovascular disorders.

Methods

Peer-reviewed articles and abstracts were identified from the MEDLINE and Current Contents databases (both 1966-October 1, 2007) using the search terms aliskiren, drug interaction, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacology. Citations from available articles were reviewed for additional references. Abstracts presented at recent professional meetings were also examined.

Results

Nine published clinical studies have evaluated the effect of aliskiren in lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients, either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. This review summarizes those studies. Patients treated with aliskiren had significantly lower blood pressure compared with patients with mild to moderate hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 140-180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 95-110 mm Hg) who received placebo. Aliskiren in doses of 75 to 300 mg daily produced reductions of SBP (-5.3 to -15.8 mm Hg) and DBP (-5.8 to -12.3 mm Hg); placebo produced reductions of SBP that ranged from -2.85 to -10.0 mm Hg and DBP reductions from -3.26 to -8.6 mm Hg (P < 0.05 in all studies between aliskiren and placebo). Aliskiren's blood pressure-lowering effect at doses of 75 to 300 mg daily was comparable to irbesartan 150 mg daily and valsartan 80 to 360 mg daily alone. When aliskiren was added to ramipril, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, irbesartan, or valsartan, significant additive blood pressure-lowering effects were reported (P < 0.05 in all clinical trials). The total incidence of adverse events was similar to placebo and other comparative agents, including irbesartan, valsartan, losartan, ramipril, and hydrochlorothiazide. The overall adverse-event rates were 22%, 35% to 52%, 25% to 52%, 34% to 55%, and 33% to 52% for aliskiren 37.5, 75, 150, 300, and 600 mg, respectively. The most commonly reported adverse events included headache, dizziness, and fatigue. Studies with cardiovascular outcomes as end points have not been performed with aliskiren.

Conclusions

Aliskiren is an effective alternative agent for blood pressure management. Before aliskiren can be recommended as a routine first-line agent, however, clinical studies must explore if the blood pressure-lowering effect will translate into improvement in cardiovascular outcomes.

Dual renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy in chronic kidney disease—Recommendation 3.3.1 states, “We recommend avoiding any combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and direct renin inhibitor (DRI) therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with or without diabetes (1B).” This is a strong recommendation based on randomized controlled trials noting that dual RAS blockade does not lead to long-term cardiovascular or kidney benefit despite short-term proteinuria lowering and leads to increased harm from hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury (AKI). Supporting data show dual therapy increased the incidence of AKI by 40% (RR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.26–2.04), compared to monotherapy, based on 6139 patients in 2 studies with a mean follow-up of 39 months.

### Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials led by the international society of hypertension [^16820f19]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta‐analysis of 14 clinical trials in patients with COVID‐19, we found no effect on all‐cause mortality, a trend toward decreased myocardial infarction, and an increased risk of AKI in patients randomly assigned to RASi versus controls. Evidence from RCTs in patient groups without COVID‐19 including those with hypertension and high cardiovascular risk has also indicated an increased risk of AKI from RASi‐based blood pressure (BP) lowering but decreases in vascular events from RASi therapy long term,suggesting that these effects in patients with COVID‐19 may be real. In this analysis, the safety of RASi was seen across other outcomes, including heart failure, stroke, hospitalization, need for intensive care, and use of inotropes or mechanical ventilation. This is consistent with observational studies that suggested there was no adverse effect of renin‐angiotensin system blockade on COVID‐19 severity and outcomes.,,The totality of data from this international collaboration provides strong evidence to suggest that RASi can be safely used in patients with COVID‐19 while being aware of an increased risk of AKI, which will better inform public health policy and clinical decision making.

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: beyond the ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-II receptor blocker combination [^9f1b5b4e]. American Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), an important regulator of blood pressure as well as fluid and electrolyte balance, plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Blockade of the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-II (ANG-II) receptor blockers (ARBs) lowers blood pressure, decreases morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure, and decreases proteinuria and the rate of decline in renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease. Although these drugs are highly effective and are widely used in the management of cardiovascular and kidney diseases, current treatment regimens with ACEIs and ARBs may not completely suppress the RAAS. Combinations of ACEIs and ARBs have been shown to be superior to either agent alone for some, but certainly not all, composite cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. With the growing appreciation of the role of aldosterone in the pathogenesis of cardiorenal diseases and the recent approval of the direct renin inhibitor (DRI), aliskiren, additional combination strategies have emerged that may offer novel ways to more fully suppress the RAAS. This review examines what is presently known about ACEI/ARB combination therapy and explores alternative combination strategies that include DRIs and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRBs).

In the opinion of the Work Group, this recommendation for people with diabetes and CKD with severely increased albuminuria places higher value on the ability of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) to prevent cardiovascular (CV) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) events, such as doubling of serum creatinine and dialysis, and places less value on the risks of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury (AKI). Considerations for implementation note there is insufficient information to differentiate between men and women for this recommendation and insufficient evidence that there are different outcomes by race.

### The divergent cardiovascular effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on myocardial infarction and death [^4de016f3]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a central role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and vascular disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) suppress angiotensin II (ANG II) concentrations, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) block the binding of ANG II to AT1 receptors. ACEis and ARBs are both effective anti-hypertensive agents and have similar risk reductions in stroke - a blood pressure dependent phenomenon. ACEis also reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and mortality in high risk hypertensive patients, as well as in diabetics, the elderly, those with vascular disease, and in congestive heart failure. ARBs, in contrast, do not reduce the risk of MI or death in clinical trials where the comparator has been another active therapy or even a placebo. Systematic reviews of ARBs that include meta-analyses or meta-regression analyses confirm that ARBs lack the cardiovascular protective effects of ACEis, which in part are "independent" of blood pressure lowering. Practice guidelines, especially those in high risk hypertensive patients, should reflect the evidence that ACEis and ARBs have divergent cardiovascular effects - ACEis reduce mortality, whereas ARBs do not. ACEis should be the preferred RAAS inhibitor in high risk patients.

### Febuxostat, blood pressure and the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [^12a1cad8]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Rats made mildly hyperuricemic by treatment with the uricase inhibitor oxonic acid become hypertensive. The increase in blood pressure in these rats was blocked by administration of renin-angiotensin system blockers or by reduction of uric acid with allopurinol. 9 More recently, febuxostat was also shown effective in this experimental model. 10 Febuxostat was recently approved by the FDA as Uloric. In the setting of high endogenous intrarenal Ang II, renovascular AT1 receptors are down-regulated and the normal reduction in renal blood flow in response to infused exogenous Ang II becomes blunted. The investigators found that increased serum uric acid is strongly correlated to blunting of the normal response to infused Ang II.

Other studies by our colleagues in Boston have demonstrated that treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers restores normal responsiveness to infused Ang II in hypertensives with this blunted response and that such patients may be particularly responsive to RAS blockade. 12-14 The studies in rats and our results with the association of uric acid suggest that elevated uric acid may cause an increase in intrarenal Ang II or otherwise interact with Ang II and thereby promote hypertension. Recent results from a randomized cross-over study of 30 hyperuricemic, hypertensive adolescents showed that allopurinol resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure as compared with placebo. 4, 15, 16 However, similar studies in adults are lacking and no study has provided insights into mechanisms whereby uric acid might raise blood pressure in humans.

The investigators hypothesize that hypertensives with elevated uric acid will experience a significant fall in uric acid in response to administration of febuxostat which will correlate with an improvement in vascular responses to infused Ang II, and improved endothelial function. have found decreased proximal tubular uric acid or lithium clearance associated with a positive family history of hypertension26 and with an adducin gene variant associated with hypertension. 27 In summary, the investigators will examine the effects of lowering uric acid with febuxostat on both intrarenal RAS activity as measured by renovascular response to Ang II infusion, and on proximal tubular sodium absorption as measured by uric acid clearance. Potential effects on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and blood pressure will also be tested. Drug: Febuxostat Drug: Placebo

### Mechanisms for the clinical benefits of angiotensin II receptor blockers [^f8480005]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulates sodium balance, fluid volume, and blood pressure (BP). It is also implicated in the progression of heart failure, hypertension, and kidney disease; this is mediated by the binding of angiotensin II (ang II) to the ang II type 1 but not the ang II type 2 receptor. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that blockade of the RAAS with ang II receptor blockers (ARB) is effective not only in controlling BP but also in preventing end-organ damage. Through their mechanism of action, ARB may offer benefit with respect to endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling, as well as cardiac and renal protection. In addition, both recent and ongoing clinical trials help to clarify further the mechanisms for the benefits of using ARB across the cardiovascular continuum.

### Efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for the treatment of low-renin hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4f881c8b]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 80 mmHg. It affects an estimated 1.28 billion adults worldwide and is a major cause of premature death. Adequate control of this modifiable risk factor is key to reducing cardiovascular disease; a 5 mmHg reduction in SBP is associated with a 10% reduction in major cardiovascular events. However, four out of five hypertensive people do not meet blood pressure (BP) targets and it is estimated that two-thirds of patients will require more than one drug to achieve BP control.

One possible reason for this is that the current one-size-fits-all sequential approach to pharmacotherapy fails to address the underlying pathophysiology of hypertension for the individual. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a key regulator of BP. Low dietary salt and blood volume stimulate the release of renin, which leads to a cascade of downstream effects including water and salt reabsorption and increased vascular tone mediated by angiotensin II, aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation. However, when the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is dysregulated, such as in the case of primary aldosteronism (PA), there is a loss of the negative feedback mechanism, leading to inappropriate MR activation promoting excess sodium and water reabsorption, hypertension and end-organ damage. PA is diagnosed by the presence of low renin and an inappropriately normal or elevated plasma aldosterone concentration, resulting in an elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR). PA has clear targeted treatment options including medical therapy with MR antagonist (MRA) or adrenalectomy in the case of an aldosterone-producing adenoma. Importantly, adrenalectomy to remove the source of excess aldosterone, and MR blockade are effective in reducing BP and the elevated cardiovascular risk associated with PA. With easier access to renin and aldosterone measurement and advocacy for expanded screening for PA, clinicians are faced with the dilemma of how to manage patients who have low renin but do not meet the diagnostic criteria for PA. This condition, known as low-renin hypertension (LRH), is present in as many as 30% of hypertensive individuals. It is hypothesised that the low renin in the context of hypertension reflects excess MR activation and/or salt reabsorption due to abnormalities in renal sodium handling in the distal nephrons of the kidneys. Current clinical practice guidelines do not provide clear recommendations for the initial choice of monotherapy for people with LRH. In a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of participants with resistant hypertension on three antihypertensives, a lower baseline renin was associated with a greater BP-lowering response with MRA add-on therapy compared to a beta-blocker and an alpha-blocker. This raises the question of whether early targeted MRA treatment in patients with LRH would be beneficial and possibly avoid the need for multiple anti-hypertensives. The findings of individual studies have been conflicting and hence we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to combine existing data on the efficacy and tolerability of MRA in LRH.

### Renoprotection: a matter of blood pressure reduction or agent-characteristics? [^112b9069]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Data from recent clinical trials show that lowering of BP reduces the rate of renal function loss in chronic renal disease. There is evidence supporting the assertion that BP lowering obtained by intervention in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has an additive renoprotective effect in both diabetic and nondiabetic renal diseases. However, to dissociate BP-dependent and non-BP-dependent action of RAAS blockade, the relevant trials are in many cases flawed by design, resulting in BP differences between the comparative antihypertensive strategies. This review discusses whether the relevant literature allows for the conclusion that RAAS intervention has renoprotective effects in addition to its effects on BP. In particular, the main evidence for a specific renoprotective action of RAAS blockade is provided by its consistent antiproteinuric action, which cannot completely be attributed to the reduction in BP. Indeed, other strategies that lower proteinuria without having an antihypertensive effect, such as lowering dietary protein intake or the use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, appear to have a renoprotective effect as well. Interestingly, a consistent finding across different intervention studies is that the more proteinuria is reduced the better the kidney appears to be protected. Therefore, it is concluded that agent-characteristics of RAAS intervention (i.e., antiproteinuric properties) independently influence renal function loss in addition to its BP-lowering effect. Future studies should further explore the renoprotective benefit of non-antihypertensive intervention measures, alone and in combination with antihypertensive strategies.

### Kidney renin-angiotensin system: lost in a RAS cascade [^6375cab0]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Renin was discovered more than a century ago. Since then, the functions of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney have been the focus of intensive research revealing its importance in regulation of renal physiology and in the pathogenesis of heart, vascular, and kidney diseases. Inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system components are now foundational therapies for a range of kidney and cardiovascular diseases from hypertension to heart failure to diabetic nephropathy. Despite years of voluminous research, emerging studies continue to reveal new complexities of the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system within the kidney and identification of nonclassical components of the system like the prorenin receptor (PRR) and ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), with powerful renal effects that ultimately impact the broader cardiovascular system. With the emergence of a range of novel therapies for cardiovascular and kidney diseases, the importance of a detailed understanding of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney will allow for the development of informed complementary approaches for combinations of treatments that will optimally promote health and longevity over the century ahead.

### Improving the efficacy of RAAS blockade in patients with chronic kidney disease [^41b87eca]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Reduction of blood pressure and proteinuria by blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been the cornerstone of renoprotective intervention for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for many years. Despite the proven efficacy of RAAS blockade, however, the reduction in proteinuria is insufficient in many patients, and does not prevent further deterioration of renal function. Short-term studies have shown that a variety of treatment intensification strategies have a beneficial effect on blood pressure and proteinuria, including RAAS blockade using either dose escalation or multiple drugs, and restriction of dietary sodium. Large clinical trials have shown that RAAS blockade with multiple drugs does not improve patients' long-term renal or cardiovascular outcome. By contrast, two post-hoc analyses of landmark trials in nephrology show beneficial renal and cardiovascular effects from avoiding excessive dietary sodium intake during single-agent RAAS blockade therapy. The effects of dietary sodium restriction on renal or cardiovascular outcome still require prospective confirmation. However, current data support the implementation of lifestyle changes to reduce dietary sodium intake in combination with single-agent RAAS blockade, rather than dual-agent RAAS blockade, as a potent and feasible strategy to mitigate the burden of renal and cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD.

Recommendation 3.2.2—renin–angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi) initiation in high blood pressure (BP) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) without diabetes: We suggest starting RASi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) for people with high BP, CKD, and moderately increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A2) without diabetes (2C), noting this recommendation is weak according to GRADE and based on limited evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of sufficient duration to evaluate kidney protection; the Work Group judged that most well-informed patients would value the cardio- and renoprotective benefits of RASi over potential harms from acute kidney injury (AKI) or hyperkalemia, that the cardiovascular (CV) benefits appear to outweigh potential adverse effects so many well-informed patients with CKD on no dialysis with moderately increased albuminuria but without diabetes will opt for treatment with RASi, and that while patients may accept potential harms including hyperkalemia and AKI, these side effects may lead to higher healthcare costs from additional clinic visits and laboratory testing.

### Hypothesis: reactive increases in plasma renin activity attenuate the fall in blood pressure caused by salt depletion and renin-angiotensin system inhibition [^e9fde18d]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

DO LOW LEVELS OF PLASMA RENIN ACTIVITY HAVE A VASOCONSTRICTOR EFFECT?

PRA values differ with different assays. The results using our assay are consistent with those reported in the United States by Quest and LabCorp. When plasma renin levels are low, the assay increases sensitivity by allowing plasma renin to generate Ang I in plasma at pH 5.7 and 37 o C from endogenous angiotensinogen, and then Ang I is measured. The PRA test incorporates the effect of differences in plasma angiotensinogen. The ‘normal range’ of PRA is not easy to define as dietary salt intake affects the PRA value. Based on early studies, we use 0.65–4.5 ng/ml/h. This is supported by data from normal subjects studied at the worksite in which median PRA quartiles were 0.57, 1.6, 2.6 and 4.7 ng/ml/h. A newer automated Diasorin Liaison Direct assay measures plasma renin concentration (PRC). As angiotensinogen is fairly stable, the two assays are roughly comparable. The units are different – a PRA level of 1 ng/ml/h is roughly equivalent to a PRC of 10 μU/ml.

It is likely that very low PRA levels do not cause hemodynamically significant vasoconstriction. This is supported by data from hypertensive patients showing that blocking the effect of PRA with either a direct renin inhibitor or an ARB failed to lower BP in most patients with PRA levels less than 0.3 ng/ml/h (Fig. 2) using an assay that reports lower PRA values than ours because Ang I is generated at pH 7.4 rather than 5.7.

### Progression of renal disease: renoprotective specificity of renin-angiotensin system blockade [^45319c27]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for management of patients with chronic kidney disease recommend both lower optimal BP targets and agents that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) for specific additional BP-independent renoprotection. Although there are other compelling rationales to use RAS blockade in patients with chronic kidney disease, including its antihypertensive effectiveness and ability to counteract the adverse effects of diuretics, a critical review of the available scientific evidence suggests that the specificity of renoprotection that is provided by RAS blockade has been greatly overemphasized. Little evidence of truly BP-independent renoprotection is observed in experimental animal models when ambient BP is assessed adequately by chronic continuous BP radiotelemetry. Although the clinical trial evidence is somewhat stronger, nevertheless, even when interpreted favorably, the absolute magnitude of the BP-independent component of the renoprotection that is observed with RAS blockade is much smaller than what is due to its antihypertensive effects.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^f146dee3]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

JNC 8—Recommendation 8 (chronic kidney disease with hypertension) states that in adults aged 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, initial (or add-on) antihypertensive treatment should include an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to improve kidney outcomes, and this applies to all CKD patients with hypertension regardless of race or diabetes status; Moderate Recommendation – Grade B. The recommendation is based primarily on kidney outcomes, and neither ACEIs nor ARBs improved cardiovascular outcomes for CKD patients compared with a β-blocker or calcium channel blocker (CCB); direct renin inhibitors are not included in this recommendation because there were no studies demonstrating their benefits on kidney or cardiovascular outcomes. Use of an ACEI or an ARB will commonly increase serum creatinine and may produce other metabolic effects such as hyperkalemia, and although an increase in creatinine or potassium level does not always require adjusting medication, use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in the CKD population require monitoring of electrolyte and serum creatinine levels, and in some cases, may require reduction in dose or discontinuation for safety reasons. In black patients with CKD and proteinuria, an ACEI or ARB is recommended as initial therapy, whereas in black patients with CKD but without proteinuria the choice for initial therapy is less clear and includes a thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEI, or ARB; if an ACEI or ARB is not used as the initial drug, an ACEI or ARB can be added as a second-line drug if necessary to achieve goal blood pressure (BP), and because the majority of patients with CKD and hypertension will require more than 1 drug to achieve goal BP, an ACEI or ARB will be used either as initial therapy or as second-line therapy in addition to a diuretic or CCB in black patients with CKD.

### Strategies to meet lower blood pressure goals with a new standard in angiotensin II receptor blockade [^b03f0b63]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

The continued poor rates of blood pressure (BP) control to the recommended target BP of <140/90 mm Hg in patients with hypertension indicate a persistent need for improved antihypertensive therapy. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) constitute the newest approved class of antihypertensive agents. As with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but do so through a more specific mechanism. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, but angiotensin II may be produced by several alternate pathways. Angiotensin II receptor blockers, by contrast, inhibit the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, independent of the pathway of angiotensin II production. Comparative safety and efficacy trials indicate that ARBs are similar to other antihypertensive drugs in terms of BP-lowering effectiveness and have superior tolerability. Olmesartan medoxomil is the newest and one of the most effective of the ARBs. In controlled trials, it has been shown to provide 24-h BP control with antihypertensive efficacy at least as good as that of the calcium channel blockers amlodipine besylate and felodipine and the beta-blocker atenolol. In a comparative study, olmesartan medoxomil demonstrated significantly greater reductions in diastolic BP than did three other leading ARBs-losartan potassium, irbesartan, and valsartan. With the convenience of placebo-like tolerability and once-daily dosing, combined with excellent antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan medoxomil may be a useful addition to our management of hypertension.

This is a strong recommendation based on evidence from RCTs of sufficient duration to evaluate kidney protection in patients with diabetes and CKD, and it places a relatively higher value on preventing long-term progression of CKD and a relatively lower value on the risks of AKI or hyperkalemia, which are often transient.

### Direct renin inhibition with aliskiren in hypertension and target organ damage [^e5d39d34]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The Joint National Committee and the World Health Organization are in agreement that hypertension in most patients who are treated is controlled inadequately and that rates of cardiovascular morbidity remain high. Additional pharmacologic treatments could ameliorate this situation. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been a highly successful pharmacologic target, as the system is strongly implicated in the development of hypertension-related target organ damage. However, compensatory increases in plasma renin levels that lead to adjustments in angiotensin production and conversion present limitations for existing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. A once-daily, orally effective, small-molecule renin inhibitor, aliskiren, is now available to address angiotensin production directly at its rate-limiting step. Studies in humans attest to an effective BP-lowering effect, a side effect profile no different from AT1 receptor blockers, and the option of combination therapies. A novel animal model of high human renin hypertension in the rat attest to target organ protection. Because angiotensin receptor blockade, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, calcium channel blockade, and diuretic therapy all lead to sharp increases in plasma renin activity, aliskiren offers a novel circumvention.

### Therapeutic perspectives in hypertension: novel means for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and emerging device-based approaches [^914c6176]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Renin as a target

Renin, catalysing the rate limiting step in the RAAS cascade, represents a very attractive therapeutic target that was recently exploited by the introduction of the first-in-class selective renin inhibitor, aliskiren. Renin inhibition is indeed associated with the attenuation of Ang I and Ang II levelsand BP reduction.Aliskiren reduced BP comparably to β-blockers1,diuretics,ACE–Inhibitors,, and AT 1 R blockers. The possible benefit in renin inhibition might reside in the attenuation of plasma renin activity which is increased by ACE inhibition or AT 1 R blockade.On the other hand, the high renin levels after aliskiren treatmentmight escape from renin inhibition and aliskiren may not prevent binding of renin to the (P)RR.A large clinical study programme, named Aspire Higher, is currently underway to determine whether aliskiren treatment ameliorates target-organ damage and positively affects CV morbidity and mortality.

The far from optimal pharmacokinetic properties of aliskiren (2–7% bioavailability)and a ceiling dose of 300 mg daily (due to gastrointestinal irritation) invite novel agents in this class to the pipelines.

### Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its relation to hypertension [^5088b553]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role in the onset and progression of hypertension. In this system, there are two types of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors: type 1 (AT 1 ) and type 2. Pathological effects such as high blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy are generally mediated by AT 1 receptor. Therefore, direct renin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT 1 receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have been developed to suppress these adverse effects. We have been studying this field since the 1990s. When the AT 1 receptor is activated, its structure changes and various signals are transmitted into the cell. AT 1 receptor blockers suppress this change in the structure of the receptor and inhibit intracellular signals. Recent studies have focused on the development of biased ligands that do not inhibit all intracellular signals, and instead inhibit only some adverse signals and activate necessary signals. New therapeutic drugs that are not AT 1 receptor blockers but are mediated by AT 1 receptor may be developed. Therefore, we mainly review the structure and function of the AT 1 receptor, as well as the roles of its blockers or inhibitors and biased ligands, including their role in the prevention of cardiometabolic syndrome including hypertension.

### Blood pressure control and cardiovascular / renal outcomes [^034defb4]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an important and modifiable risk factor for the macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes. Prior literature outlines the significance of lowering blood pressure and subsequent cardiovascular and microvascular benefits. Blood pressure targets of less than 140/90 mm Hg are recommended in all adults with diabetes, with lower blood pressure targets of less than 130/80 mm Hg beneficial for those with higher cardiovascular disease risk. Treatment to lower blood pressure is primarily based on a foundation of lifestyle modifications, low sodium diet, exercise, and good sleep hygiene coupled with multiple medication classes such as renin angiotensin system inhibitors.

People with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are at risk of developing progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney failure. Hypertension is a major, reversible risk factor in people with diabetes for development of albuminuria, impaired kidney function, end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure control has been shown to be beneficial in people with diabetes in slowing progression of kidney disease and reducing cardiovascular events. However, randomised controlled trial evidence differs in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and different stages of CKD in terms of target blood pressure. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is an important mechanism for the development and progression of CKD and cardiovascular disease. Randomised trials demonstrate that RAAS blockade is effective in preventing/ slowing progression of CKD and reducing cardiovascular events in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, albeit differently according to the stage of CKD. Emerging therapy with sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, non-steroidal selective mineralocorticoid antagonists and endothelin-A receptor antagonists have been shown in randomised trials to lower blood pressure and further reduce the risk of progression of CKD and cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes. This guideline reviews the current evidence and makes recommendations about blood pressure control and the use of RAAS-blocking agents in different stages of CKD in people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Adapted from Farsang 2011.

All three classes of available RAS inhibitors (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] and direct renin inhibitors [DRIs]) interrupt the normal angiotensin II feedback suppression of renin secretion from the kidneys. In the past two decades, landmark trials have shown that early aggressive lowering of BP and inhibition of the RAS improves outcomes for patients with renal disease or CVD [-]. ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce proteinuria, slow progression of CKD and lower morbidity and mortality rates in patients at high CVD risk, and in patients already displaying evidence of target organ damage (TOD) such as myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stable coronary heart disease (CHD) with or without left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), and reduce mortality and reinfarction rates in patients with LVD or HF after MI [-]. Evidence from large outcome trials such as the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET ®) suggests that ARBs like telmisartan have additional CV benefits beyond BP lowering. Outcomes with ARB monotherapy in post-MI patients are similar to those achieved with high doses of an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are widely acknowledged to confer additional renoprotective benefits beyond the effects of BP control alone (Table 1). ARBs are also known to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), however, only telmisartan exhibits increased PPAR-γ activity at therapeutic dosages. PPAR-γ enhances insulin sensitivity, has positive effects on lipid metabolism, endothelium, oxidative stress and vascular inflammation, and its anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic and antihypertensive effects are considered to exert CV protective effects. Initial data suggest that, as with ARBs and ACE inhibitors, aliskiren, an oral DRI, may protect against TOD [-].

Ang II preferentially constricts efferent arterioles over afferent arterioles thereby raising glomerular filtration pressure, which contributes to progressive glomerulosclerosis. RAS inhibitors slow the progression of CKD, at least partly by decreasing glomerular filtration pressure. Accordingly, conditions such as excessive salt depletion that raise PRA into the range where it is only partially blocked by the RAS inhibitor may reduce the beneficial effects of RAS blockade. SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce the rate of progression of some chronic kidney diseases. Although they reduce proximal sodium reabsorption and have the potential to cause sodium loss, their long-term effect on PRA has not been established in CKD. However, if the hypothesis presented here is correct, then SGLT2 inhibitors when used in combination with other natriuretic drugs may raise PRA in some patients into the range where it is only partially blocked by the RAS inhibitor. Our current analysis suggests that this might be avoided by titrating natriuretic drugs to maintain PRA below 4.5 ng/ml/h and thereby retain the efficacy of RAS inhibition.

### Antihypertensive therapy with aliskiren [^07d30d54]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

Aliskiren represents the first member in a new class of antihypertensive drugs. Inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system at its rate-limiting step is an idea that has been pursued for >30 years; however, earlier compounds failed because of problems related to efficacy, bioavailability, and/or side effects. Aliskiren, a 610 Da nonpeptide molecule, has exceptional affinity for the human renin enzymatic site and a half-life of about 40 h, which make its 3% bioavailability clinically unimportant with continued administration. The drug is not metabolized by CYP P450 enzymes and is excreted >90% unchanged by the fecal route. No adjustments are necessary for renal function, liver function, age, ethnicity, or other prescribed drugs. Blood pressure reductions are similar to those provided by other monotherapies. Interestingly, aliskiren combined with angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy leads to a further blood pressure reduction as does combination with a diuretic or calcium channel blocker. The fact that plasma renin activity is reduced to low levels with aliskiren could provide a theoretical advantage over other treatments, while increases in total renin (prorenin) after the drug poses additional food for thought. Studies with primary cardiovascular and renal end points to address these possibilities are in progress.

The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system

Physiology of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system

The pharmacological RAAS inhibition reduces BP and represents a key part of current approaches to cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction. The classical simplified RAAS image has recently turned to a complex network (Figure 1). The cascade starts with the renal release of the renin, which cleaves the liver-produced angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I).Renin may also bind to its (pro)renin receptor (P)RR,that enhances its cleavage activity and activates its inactive precursor, prorenin. However, binding to (P)RR elicits angiotensin-independent effects, such as activation of promyelocytic zinc finger (PLZF), protein-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and eventually mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) resulting in enhanced proteosynthesis, proliferation, and decreased apoptosis. –

### Aliskiren, the first renin inhibitor for treating hypertension: reactive renin secretion may limit its effectiveness [^9d658878]. American Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

A review of six clinical trials of aliskiren involving >5,000 patients with mild to moderate hypertension indicated that this first of a new class of orally active antihypertensive drugs is no more effective than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or diuretics for lowering blood pressure. The starting dose is 150 mg; 300 mg is usually more effective, but 600 mg is no better than 300 mg. Aliskiren in combination with a diuretic appeared to lower blood pressure more than an aliskiren-ARB combination, but still failed to control blood pressure (<140/90) in 50% of the patients. Although aliskiren suppresses plasma renin activity, it causes much greater reactive rises in plasma renin concentration than does any other antihypertensive class tested. Because aliskiren, like CEIs and ARBs, only blocks 90% to 95% of plasma renin, the pressor consequences of its greater reactive increases in plasma renin concentration appear to offset its net ability to lower blood pressure, especially with higher doses. Patients with hyperreactive renin systems (renovascular, advanced, and malignant hypertension) were excluded from all of the trials. Until the possibility is eliminated of inducing increases in blood pressure with aliskiren in patients with highly reactive renin levels, it seems safe and simple to stick to the less expensive, equally effective and widely available generic CEI drugs for treating the renin factor in hypertension.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^6aaf7f16]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Recommendation 7—initial drug selection for the general black population—states that “in the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB,” graded as “Moderate Recommendation – Grade B” for the general black population and “Weak Recommendation – Grade C” for black patients with diabetes. The text further states that “both thiazide-type diuretics and CCBs are recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension in black patients,” and “the panel recommended a CCB over an ACEI as first-line therapy in black patients because there was a 51% higher rate (relative risk, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.22-1.86) of stroke … with the use of an ACEI as initial therapy compared with use of a CCB”; it also notes “there were no differences in other outcomes” between a CCB and a diuretic and that “There were no outcome studies … that compared diuretics or CCBs vs β-blockers, ARBs, or other renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in black patients.”

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)—blood pressure (BP) targets and renin–angiotensin system therapy: The prevalence of hypertension is 67% to 92% among people with CKD, and in SPRINT intensive BP treatment with mean achieved SBP 121 mm Hg versus standard treatment with mean achieved SBP 136 mm Hg reduced the risk of CVD, including among those with CKD. The recommendation in this guideline is for a treatment goal SBP <130 mm Hg. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended for initial treatment of hypertension in CKD when albuminuria is moderate or severe (≥30 mg/g) and may be considered for lower level albuminuria (<30 mg/g) based on expert opinion; these recommendations refer to people with nondialysis-requiring CKD, and ACEI or ARB is also appropriate for less-severe CKD (stage 1 or 2) when moderate or severe albuminuria is present. Supporting data include an analysis of CKD patients from 4 trials finding an SBP target of <130 mm Hg (versus <140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality and a meta-analysis of CKD subsets from 18 trials where more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) control resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality; while <120 mm Hg is more effective at preventing CVD events, meta-analyses support SBP <130 mm Hg to balance benefits and risks. With ACEI/ARB therapy, these agents reduce intraglomerular pressure and may cause a transient dip in eGFR up to 30%; this short-term decline is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEI or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEI or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of >30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation; ACEI or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR <30 mL/ min/1.73 m2, and the combined use of an ACEI and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

### Angiotensin-II receptor blockers: benefits beyond blood pressure reduction? [^35d4a82d]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Effective treatment of hypertension is essential to reduce the risk of renal and cardiovascular (CV) morbidity. The risks associated with hypertension are modulated by the presence of other factors. This has prompted the quest for agents that have benefits beyond blood pressure (BP) lowering. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) class of antihypertensive agents represents an important addition to the therapeutic options for elevated BP. Their ability to control BP is equivalent to existing therapies and there is a considerable and mounting evidence-base for their ability to reduce hypertension-associated target organ damage and comorbidities. Studies show that ARBs have clinical benefits across the spectrum of disease severity. In particular, recent large studies have demonstrated that these benefits extend to patients with conditions predisposing to CV events, such as diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy and microalbuminuria, and where risk factors coexist. Data from these studies suggest that the CV protective effects of ARBs are at least, in part, independent from the BP lowering action. In addition, ARBs are extremely well tolerated, and strong evidence suggests that compliance with therapy--a key factor in achieving adequate BP control--with ARBs is higher than with other antihypertensive agents. Furthermore, flexible dosing and good tolerability profile mean that, where necessary, ARBs can be combined with other classes of antihypertensive agents to achieve adequate BP control and reduce the risk of hypertension-associated morbidity.

Comparative antihypertensive evidence in CKD with high BP: There are no well-powered trials examining cardiovascular (CV) outcomes as well as survival comparing various antihypertensive classes with each other or with placebo in people with high BP and CKD; lowering the BP with various antihypertensive drug combinations showed similar CV outcomes and kidney outcomes with a suggestion of effect modification by urine protein excretion, and renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) also reduced CV outcomes compared to placebo in high-risk populations, particularly in subgroups with CKD, independent of the presence or absence of high BP.

### Vascular and cardiac benefits of angiotensin receptor blockers [^8ab4cec6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin II not only is a vasoconstrictor, but it also affects cell growth and apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and coagulation. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, either with inhibitors of the generation of angiotensin (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) or with blockers of angiotensin receptors, reduces blood pressure and inhibits other pathophysiological actions. These other effects provide benefits in coronary heart disease, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and stroke beyond blood pressure reduction. These benefits were first demonstrated with ACE inhibitors. However, the mechanism of action of angiotensin receptor blockers, which block angiotensin II stimulation at the angiotensin type 1 receptor but not at the type 2 receptor, may have advantages, particularly for endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling, as well as cardiac and renal protection. Recent multicenter trials suggest that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may reduce morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular and renal disease beyond blood pressure reduction. Several studies with different angiotensin receptor blockers, including comparisons with ACE inhibitors, are under way, and should provide further guidance for their clinical use.

### Novel therapies blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the management of hypertension and related disorders [^8a69a760]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Although significant advances have been made in the therapeutic blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and non-selective aldosterone receptor antagonists, there is a clear need for both additional blocking strategies and enhancements of current therapeutic approaches. Vasopeptidase inhibition may still find a role despite the small incremental value of this approach and the obvious issue of kinin-mediated adverse effects still to be fully addressed. Blockade of the RAAS upstream using renin inhibitors as well as the greater selectivity of aldosterone blockade using selective aldosterone blockers such as eplerenone are also novel approaches. Not yet in clinical use but certainly an attractive therapeutic target is angiotensin II growth factor receptor transactivation, with selective inhibitors having been developed for various specific kinase pathways. Finally, ACE2 augmentation, antisense gene strategies, and vaccination against the renin-angiotensin system should still be considered experimental, but have significant appeal as additional approaches to the blockade of this system.

### Combined renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition in patients with chronic heart failure secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction [^ce84c6c2]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is high and still on the rise. In 2004, an estimated 5.2 million adults in the United States carried the diagnosis of HF with a mortality rate of >19%. The incidence of HF is higher in individuals 65 years or older. As the US population grows older, the personal and economic costs of this disease are expected to grow. More than 75% of patients with HF have a history of hypertension, and blood pressure control can reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events and death in this population. In addition to lowering blood pressure, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can reduce the negative effects of chronic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation on the progression of HF. This review discusses the clinical data supporting the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptors blockers, alone or in combination, for improving outcomes in patients with HF.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^6c3eca69]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

KDIGO 2022—Hypertension management in glomerular disease sets target blood pressure at Adults: SBP <120 mm Hg and Children: 24 h MAP ≤50th percentile for age, sex, and height or local standards. First-line therapy lists angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, with combination use cautioned due to possible hyperkalemia and/or acute kidney injury; caveats include educating patients to stop therapy during volume depletion and to monitor serum creatinine and potassium frequently and discontinue if serum creatinine rises >30% (a lower increment may be acceptable hemodynamic change), and potassium-lowering medications may be considered to optimize tolerability. Second-line therapy lists mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and may require discontinuation for hyperkalemia with potential salvage using potassium binders; additional strategies include using antihypertensive agents without angiotensin blocking activity to achieve the goal blood pressure and using loop and thiazide diuretics to aid blood pressure control, manage hyperkalemia, and enhance renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor antiproteinuric effects.

### New developments in antihypertensive drugs [^70dc030b]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

New developments in antihypertensive drug treatment include optimizing the use of established drugs, the introduction of novel compounds, and a renewed appreciation that hypertension is but one of various cardiovascular risk factors that must be addressed in managing the patient with raised blood pressure. Thus, the approach used must be tailored to the individual patient both in terms of drug choice and dose as well as preventive measures. New drug development depends very much on improving our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in hypertension and seems likely to be applied at the level of the renin angiotensin system and other local factors governing vascular smooth muscle function.

### Limitations of angiotensin inhibition [^79ee0f10]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) have beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular disease and in those with diabetes-related and diabetes-independent chronic kidney diseases. These beneficial effects are independent of the antihypertensive properties of these drugs. However, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and combinations of agents in these two classes are limited in the extent to which they inhibit the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Angiotensin breakthrough and aldosterone breakthrough may be important mechanisms involved in limiting the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Whether direct renin inhibitors will overcome some of the limitations of ACE-inhibitor and ARB therapy by blocking the deleterious effects of the RAAS remains to be proven. This important area is, however, in need of further investigation.

### Comparative antihypertensive efficacy of olmesartan: comparison with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists [^0b2b6a11]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Effective control of elevated blood pressure (BP) has been shown to reduce this risk. Early studies of risk reduction assumed that the mechanism by which BP was lowered had little impact on the benefit obtained. Recent evidence, however, suggests that agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system may be particularly beneficial. The results of the recent Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a greater impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than would be anticipated from their antihypertensive effects alone. Angiotensin receptor blockers, the other major class of antihypertensive drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, have not been widely tested in outcomes trials, but early results suggest that they are beneficial for controlling target organ damage that is related to hypertension. Furthermore, unlike ACE inhibitors, these agents have a side-effect profile that is similar to that of placebo. Based on their efficacy in controlling hypertension and their wider health benefits, together with minimal side effects, angiotensin II (A II) receptor blockers should be considered as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, particularly in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Preliminary evidence suggests that olmesartan, an A II receptor blocker currently being evaluated for approval for clinical use, may provide antihypertensive efficacy that is superior to other members of the class.

### Renin inhibition with aliskiren: where are we now, and where are we going? [^9e45b281]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

With the development of aliskiren, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) at the level of the interaction of renin with a substrate has become a clinical reality. This review covers the specific features of the first agent likely to achieve widespread clinical exposure, aliskiren. The potential of renin inhibition must be viewed in the context of the remarkable efficacy of both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The implications of blockade of the renin system at its rate-limiting step are reviewed, with the therapeutic implications for both the renin inhibitor employed alone or the renin inhibitor combined with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The relevant and necessary studies are ongoing.

### A narrative review of research advancements in pharmacogenetics of cardiovascular disease and impact on clinical implications [^5311cfc3]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The pharmacogenetics of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are frequently used to treat common conditions, such as heart failure, chronic renal disease, and hypertension.

The therapeutic targets of ACE inhibitors

The therapeutic effect of ACE inhibitors is to reduce the amount of angiotensin II, which increases sodium excretion in the urine, lowers blood pressure, and prevents the remodelling of smooth muscle and cardiac muscle cells,. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) interacts with ACEIs. The RAAS controls blood pressure by releasing angiotensinogen from the liver into the circulation, where renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I (Ang I) is converted to angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE. Ang II attachment to angiotensin receptors promotes blood vessel constriction, which increases blood pressure. Furthermore, Ang II stimulates aldosterone synthesis, which increases the ability of the blood to reabsorb salt and water and elevates blood pressure. ACEIs limit smooth muscle constriction in the vasculature and decrease aldosterone levels by blocking the ability of ACE to convert Ang I to Ang II and by lowering blood pressure. ACE is an essential enzyme involved in bradykinin degradation. Bradykinin builds up under conditions of ACE inhibition, and increased bradykinin levels may have side effects such as cough and angioedema.

### Rationale for double renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade [^74963b45]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical benefits of both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) extend beyond blood pressure reduction to encompass tissue-protective effects in target organs, such as the heart, vasculature, and kidneys, that underlie the reductions in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity seen in large outcome trials. However, these effects are achieved by different mechanisms. ACE inhibitors reduce circulating and tissue angiotensin II levels and potentiate the beneficial effects of bradykinin, including generation of nitric oxide (NO). By contrast, the protective effects of ARBs are owing to the blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors and possibly also to the stimulation of angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptors, again resulting in NO release. In addition, some ARBs, such as telmisartan, are selective activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), thereby increasing insulin sensitivity. In contrast to other PPAR-gamma ligands, such as the thiazolidinediones, activation of this receptor by telmisartan does not result in weight gain. The complementary mechanisms of action of ACE inhibitors and ARBs create a rationale for combination therapy in high-risk patients. The benefits of this approach with telmisartan are being investigated in clinical trials, such as the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET).
