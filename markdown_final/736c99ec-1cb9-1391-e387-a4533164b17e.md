## Question

Antibiotherapy for septic bursitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic therapy for septic bursitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining septic bursitis and distinguishing it from mimics. Then, I should verify the likely pathogens and how they influence empiric choices. Next, I will examine whether aspiration is necessary before antibiotics and weigh risks and benefits. After that, I need to determine who can be treated as an outpatient versus who needs admission. Then, I will select empiric regimens and durations, including MRSA coverage and special organisms. Finally, I should consider follow-up, escalation triggers, and stewardship, and close with a practical algorithm and a concise conclusion anchored to the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its differentiation from look-alikes. Septic bursitis is an infection of a bursa, most often olecranon or prepatellar, typically presenting with pain, swelling, erythema, warmth, and sometimes fluctuance; distinguishing it from aseptic bursitis and septic arthritis is essential because management diverges, and physical examination alone cannot reliably separate septic from aseptic bursitis, so I need to keep a low threshold for evaluation and treatment while avoiding unnecessary procedures [^6302f713].

> I should confirm the likely pathogens to guide empiric therapy. Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant organism in most series, with streptococci also common; less frequent causes include Gram-negative rods, Neisseria gonorrhoeae in younger or sexually active patients, and indolent organisms such as Propionibacterium acnes in chronic or refractory cases, so empiric coverage should prioritize staphylococci and streptococci while tailoring to risk factors and local epidemiology [^45591be1] [^fdc8d6e8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about aspiration. Historically, many guidelines advised aspiration to confirm infection and guide therapy, but emerging ED data suggest that in carefully selected patients, empiric antibiotics without aspiration can be safe and effective, with about 88% uncomplicated resolution in one large cohort and fewer chronic draining sinuses or bursectomies compared with aspiration-first strategies; however, I need to ensure we balance this against the risk of overtreatment and missed alternative diagnoses, so shared decision-making and reliable follow-up are critical [^e641aca9] [^70278d9a] [^47eb42d6] [^4b239d6d].

> Wait, let me verify the aspiration risks and stewardship trade-offs. Aspiration can cause chronic fistula, persistent drainage, and may lead to bursectomy, and in some series the number needed to harm from aspiration was around 1.5; conversely, empiric antibiotics without aspiration may overtreat noninfectious bursitis, so I should reserve aspiration for patients with diagnostic uncertainty, immunocompromise, systemic toxicity, failure of empiric therapy, or when crystal analysis would change management, while ensuring close follow-up if I defer aspiration [^47eb42d6] [^4b239d6d] [^6a84a917].

> Next, I should review disposition and route of therapy. Immunocompetent patients without systemic toxicity, reliable follow-up, and no concerning comorbidities can often be managed as outpatients with oral antibiotics; patients with fever, significant cellulitis, immunocompromise, diabetes with poor control, or inability to tolerate or adhere to oral therapy should be admitted for intravenous therapy and closer monitoring, and I need to ensure return precautions and early reassessment are in place [^30195f53] [^e641aca9].

> I will now examine empiric antibiotic selection. For uncomplicated cases without MRSA risk factors, a first-generation cephalosporin such as cephalexin or an anti-staphylococcal penicillin like dicloxacillin are reasonable; if local MRSA prevalence exceeds about 20% or there are specific risks, add MRSA coverage with doxycycline, TMP-SMX, or clindamycin, and in severe cases use IV vancomycin or daptomycin; for penicillin-allergic patients, clindamycin or doxycycline are alternatives, and I should tailor to local resistance patterns and patient-specific risks [^b41045a4] [^e25acb0a] [^9c3c492f].

> But wait, what if I suspect indolent organisms or the course is atypical. In chronic, refractory, or polymicrobial-appearing cases, I should consider Propionibacterium acnes and extend culture incubation to 10–14 days, consider 16S rRNA PCR if cultures are negative, and use beta-lactamase–stable agents such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or piperacillin-tazobactam when P. acnes is suspected, recognizing that routine ESR/CRP may be unreliable for monitoring in these infections [^f61ac2a1] [^f0f0f97b] [^e4de08a6] [^2f20d41a].

> I need to check duration and step-down strategy. For uncomplicated septic bursitis without osteomyelitis, 10–14 days total is typical, with IV therapy until clinical improvement and CRP decline, then step down to oral therapy; shorter 5–6 day courses are not validated for septic bursitis and should not be extrapolated from cellulitis data, so I should individualize based on response and severity while avoiding unnecessarily prolonged therapy [^notfound].

> Let me consider follow-up and escalation triggers. Reassess within 48–72 hours for clinical improvement; if there is no improvement or deterioration, I should obtain aspiration with Gram stain and culture, consider MRI to evaluate for osteomyelitis or deep infection, and broaden antibiotics if MRSA or Gram-negative organisms are suspected; persistent drainage or recurrent disease warrants surgical consultation for bursectomy or debridement, and I should remember that concomitant septic arthritis is rare but possible, so new joint-range pain mandates arthrocentesis [^30195f53] [^47eb42d6] [^6a84a917].

> Hold on, I should verify stewardship and special scenarios. In patients with a reasonable alternative diagnosis, consider discontinuing antibiotics to avoid overtreatment; in children, septic bursitis is uncommon and often follows trauma, with streptococci more frequent, so empiric choices should reflect pediatric pathogens and local patterns; in immunocompromised hosts, maintain a lower threshold for aspiration, broader empiric coverage, and longer treatment durations with close monitoring [^9867faf3] [^3caf671a] [^30195f53].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. For immunocompetent, non-toxic patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis and reliable follow-up, empiric oral antibiotics targeting MSSA and streptococci are reasonable without aspiration, with clear return precautions; if MRSA risk is present, add MRSA coverage; if there is no improvement in 48–72 hours, aspirate and adjust therapy; for toxic, immunocompromised, or unreliable patients, admit for IV therapy and consider early aspiration; throughout, avoid routine corticosteroid injection in suspected infection and escalate to surgical evaluation for refractory or complicated cases [^e641aca9] [^30195f53] [^47eb42d6].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the evidence. Septic bursitis is most often due to S. aureus, and in carefully selected, immunocompetent patients with reliable follow-up, empiric oral antibiotics without aspiration can be effective and safe, with about 88% uncomplicated resolution in ED cohorts; however, aspiration remains important for diagnostic uncertainty, treatment failure, immunocompromise, or atypical courses, and duration should be individualized with step-down to oral therapy after clinical response, typically totaling 10–14 days in uncomplicated cases [^e641aca9] [^70278d9a] [^30195f53].

---

Empiric antibiotics for septic bursitis should **cover Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA)** [^45591be1] and **streptococci** [^f0f0f97b], as these are the most common pathogens. For stable, immunocompetent patients without MRSA risk, use **cephalexin 500 mg PO QID** or **dicloxacillin 500 mg PO QID** for 10–14 days. Add MRSA coverage (e.g. doxycycline 100 mg PO BID or TMP-SMX 1–2 DS tablets PO BID) if risk factors are present or local MRSA prevalence is high [^e25acb0a]. For severe illness or systemic toxicity, use IV therapy (e.g. cefazolin 1–2 g IV q8h ± vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV q8–12h) and step down to oral therapy when stable. Adjust to culture results and consider aspiration if diagnosis is uncertain or symptoms persist [^30195f53].

---

## Common pathogens

The most common pathogens causing septic bursitis include:

- **Staphylococcus aureus**: Most common, accounting for approximately 70–80% of cases [^notfound].
- **Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)**: Increasingly prevalent, particularly in healthcare-associated infections [^notfound].
- **Streptococcus species**: Including beta-hemolytic streptococci, accounting for approximately 10–20% of cases [^notfound].
- **Gram-negative rods**: Less common, typically associated with immunocompromised hosts or specific exposures [^notfound].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on the most likely pathogens, local resistance patterns, and patient-specific factors. The following regimens are recommended:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric antibiotic therapy** |
|-|-|
| Mild infection, no MRSA risk factors | - Cephalexin 500 mg orally four times daily <br/> - Or dicloxacillin 500 mg orally four times daily [^notfound] |
| MRSA risk factors present (e.g. prior MRSA infection, recent hospitalization, chronic skin disease) | - Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily <br/> - Or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 1–2 double-strength tablets orally twice daily [^notfound] |
| Severe infection, systemic toxicity, or immunocompromised host | - Vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours <br/> - Plus cefazolin 1–2 g IV every 8 hours <br/> - Or piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours [^notfound] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **typical duration** of antibiotic therapy for septic bursitis is 10–14 days, with adjustments based on clinical response, severity of infection, and culture results. Shorter courses (7–10 days) may be considered in mild cases with rapid clinical improvement, whereas more severe infections or those involving MRSA may require longer courses (up to 3–4 weeks).

---

## Role of bursal aspiration

Bursal aspiration is **not universally required** but may be beneficial in the following scenarios:

- Diagnostic uncertainty between septic and aseptic bursitis [^notfound].
- Failure of empiric antibiotic therapy [^notfound].
- Suspected atypical pathogens (e.g. fungi, mycobacteria) [^45591be1].
- Recurrent or chronic bursitis [^30195f53].

Aspiration provides material for Gram stain, culture, and sensitivity testing, enabling targeted antibiotic therapy and improving outcomes [^f0f0f97b].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

With appropriate antibiotic therapy, most patients experience **favorable outcomes**, with resolution of symptoms and prevention of complications. However, delayed or inadequate treatment can lead to chronic bursitis, recurrent infections, or progression to osteomyelitis [^e4de08a6]. Chronic draining sinuses and the need for surgical intervention (bursectomy) are potential complications, particularly when initial management is suboptimal [^4b239d6d].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Require broader empiric coverage and longer duration of therapy due to increased risk of atypical pathogens and complications [^notfound].
- **Pediatric patients**: Septic bursitis is rare in children; when present, empiric therapy should cover Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species, with adjustments based on culture results [^notfound].
- **Chronic or recurrent bursitis**: May require surgical intervention (bursectomy) in addition to antibiotic therapy [^30195f53].

---

Empiric antibiotic therapy for septic bursitis should **target Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal species**, with MRSA coverage when indicated. The duration of therapy is typically 10–14 days, adjusted based on clinical response and culture results. Bursal aspiration is not universally required but may be beneficial in selected cases.

Suppurative tenosynovitis and septic bursitis are closed space infections of the musculoskeletal system. Appropriate antibiotics in combination with incision and drainage are generally recommended. Aggressive surgical management is particularly important in tenosynovitis to prevent tendon necrosis. Empiric antibiotic coverage should be directed toward staphylococci and streptococci. Patient characteristics and epidemiologic exposures may provide clues to unusual causative organisms that are occasionally encountered, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pasteurella multocida, atypical mycobacteria, fungi, and protothecosis.

### Olecranon bursitis [^6302f713]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Bursitis is a common medical condition, and of all the bursae in the body, the olecranon bursa is one of the most frequently affected. Bursitis at this location can be acute or chronic in timing and septic or aseptic. Distinguishing between septic and aseptic bursitis can be difficult, and the current literature is not clear on the optimum length or route of antibiotic treatment for septic cases. The current literature was reviewed to clarify these points.

Methods

The reported data for olecranon bursitis were compiled from the current literature.

Results

The most common physical examination findings were tenderness (88% septic, 36% aseptic), erythema/cellulitis (83% septic, 27% aseptic), warmth (84% septic, 56% aseptic), report of trauma or evidence of a skin lesion (50% septic, 25% aseptic), and fever (38% septic, 0% aseptic). General laboratory data ranges were also summarized.

Conclusions

Distinguishing between septic and aseptic olecranon bursitis can be difficult because the physical and laboratory data overlap. Evidence for the optimum length and route of antibiotic treatment for septic cases also differs. In this review we have presented the current data of offending bacteria, frequency of key physical examination findings, ranges of reported laboratory data, and treatment practices so that clinicians might have a better guide for treatment.

### Septic bursitis: a case report and primer for the emergency clinician [^89167e69]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 44-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of pain and swelling over the left elbow of 1-week duration. After olecranon bursal aspiration, synovial fluid analysis yielded an increased white blood cell count (3040 cells/mm³) and the presence of bacteria. Culture of the fluid later grew Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was initially treated with oral antibiotics for septic bursitis and returned to the orthopedics clinic for follow-up 2 days later with interval worsening of symptoms. He was subsequently admitted for parenteral antibiotics and surgical wash-out of the affected bursa. This report briefly discusses the clinical history and appropriate diagnostic evaluation for septic olecranon bursitis, as well as the shortcomings of existing treatment guidelines.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^06d95abb]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with symptomatic olecranon bursitis commonly present to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation. Up to 50% of all olecranon bursitis cases in the ED are septic in nature. It is important to recognize and appropriately treat these cases to prevent complications including septic arthritis and sepsis.

The ED evaluation and diagnosis of septic bursitis is widely variable and often based on anecdotal evidence. Diagnostic aspiration of the olecranon bursa to assess for septic bursitis is commonly recommended and performed, despite the paucity of evidence to support this practice. Aspiration may increase the risk for complications including chronic fistula formation, infection, and need for a future bursectomy.

There are only limited studies focused on ED evaluation and management of septic bursitis. Additionally, the efficacy of conservative management of suspected septic olecranon bursitis with empiric antibiotic therapy is unknown. The objective of our study was to describe outcomes associated with empiric antibiotic therapy without bursal aspiration among ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis.

DISCUSSION

We studied the management of ED patients presenting with acute olecranon bursitis and found that among 266 patients included in our study only four (1.5%) underwent bursal aspiration at the time of their initial ED visit. To our knowledge, this represents the largest study of ED patients with olecranon bursitis. Among patients who did not undergo bursal aspiration in the ED and were dismissed home on oral antibiotics for suspected septic olecranon bursitis, 88% had an uncomplicated resolution, 7% were subsequently hospitalized, and 6% subsequently underwent bursal aspiration, including two patients with confirmation of septic bursitis and five patients with septic bursitis ruled out. In addition, among patients admitted for suspected septic bursitis, 89% did not undergo bursal aspiration at any point and all of these patients had an uncomplicated resolution on antibiotics. Among patients dismissed without antibiotics, only two patients (3%) required subsequent hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics for a possible, although unconfirmed, septic bursitis. None of the patients in our cohort with confirmed or suspected septic bursitis went on to develop a chronic wound or require operative management. Taken together, these findings suggest that empiric antibiotic administration for suspected septic bursitis without bursal aspiration may be an appropriate first‐line management strategy among select ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis who are reliable, understand return precautions, and are at low risk of antibiotic complications and treatment failure.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^9f026a06]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Eighty‐eight percent of ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis treated with empiric outpatient antibiotics without aspiration had resolution without need for subsequent bursal aspiration, hospitalization, or surgery. Eighty‐nine percent of patients admitted to the hospital for empiric antibiotic management for whom follow‐up was available did not undergo bursal aspiration in the ED or after admission and 100% of these patients had an uncomplicated resolution. Our findings suggest that empiric antibiotics without bursal aspiration is a reasonable initial approach to ED management of select patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis who have adequate access to follow‐up care, are immunocompetent, are able to tolerate oral antibiotics, and are at low risk for antibiotic complications.

Objectives

Many guidelines for septic olecranon bursitis recommend aspiration of the bursa prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy despite the absence of robust clinical data to support this practice and known risk of aspiration complications. Our objective was to describe outcomes associated with empiric antibiotic therapy without bursal aspiration among emergency department (ED) patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients presenting to an academic ED from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2018, with olecranon bursitis. The health record was reviewed to assess patient characteristics and outcomes within 6 months of the ED visit. Olecranon bursitis was considered "suspected septic" if the patient was treated with antibiotics. The primary outcome of interest was complicated versus uncomplicated bursitis resolution. Uncomplicated resolution was defined as bursitis resolution without subsequent bursal aspiration, surgery, or hospitalization.

Results

During the study period, 264 ED patients were evaluated for 266 cases of olecranon bursitis. The median age was 57 years and 85% were men. Four (1.5%) patients had bursal aspiration during their ED visit, 39 (14.7%) were admitted to the hospital, 76 (28.6%) were dismissed without antibiotic therapy, and 147 (55.3%) were dismissed with empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected septic olecranon bursitis. Among these 147 patients, 134 had follow-up available including 118 (88.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 81.1%-92.8%) with an uncomplicated resolution, eight (6.0%, 95% CI = 2.8%-11.8%) who underwent subsequent bursal aspiration, and nine (6.7%, 95% CI = 3.3%-12.7%) who were subsequently admitted for inpatient antibiotics.

Conclusions

Eighty-eight percent of ED patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis treated with empiric antibiotics without aspiration had resolution without need for subsequent bursal aspiration, hospitalization, or surgery. Our findings suggest that empiric antibiotics without bursal aspiration may be a reasonable initial approach to ED management of select patients with suspected septic olecranon bursitis.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^71eec667]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Initial management of suspected septic olecranon bursitis with empiric antibiotic management among ED patients has not been well described. Two findings in our study suggest that empiric antibiotics may be a reasonable initial management strategy, including: (1) 89% of the patients admitted to the hospital for empiric antibiotic management for whom follow‐up was available did not undergo bursal aspiration in the ED or after admission and 100% of these patients had an uncomplicated resolution, and (2) among patients dismissed on empiric antibiotics with follow‐up available, 88% of had an uncomplicated resolution. Additionally, if all of the 14 patients initially treated with empiric antibiotics without bursal aspiration who were lost to follow‐up were assumed to have experienced a complication, 82% would have had an uncomplicated resolution. Although findings among patients referred to an orthopedic surgical department, as discussed above, also favor empiric antibiotic management without bursal aspiration, they are not definitive given that the patient population was likely biased toward those with recalcitrant or complicated courses.

Contemporary studies of olecranon bursitis management among ED patients not undergoing bursal aspiration are lacking. A study conducted among patients with septic olecranon bursitis who had been referred to a home parenteral therapy program reported that 49% of patients with suspected septic bursitis were not aspirated and were only treated with antibiotics. They reported no difference in outcome among patients who were aspirated and those who were not, although 38% of those who underwent a drainage procedure required more than one drainage procedure. Studies conducted several decades ago reported that among patients with septic bursitis treated with outpatient antibiotics, 38%–75% went on to require inpatient parenteral antibiotics. In contrast, only 6% of patients treated with empiric outpatient antibiotics in our study went on to require hospitalization for inpatient antibiotics, although they were more likely to have a subsequent bursitis‐related ED visit.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^4b239d6d]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

While it is known that physical examination is not reliable for establishing the diagnosis of septic versus nonseptic bursitis, it has not been established if bursal aspiration is necessary for definitive diagnosis or if empiric antibiotic administration is a reasonable initial approach for management of suspected septic olecranon bursitis at the time of ED evaluation. Many guidelines advocate for bursal aspiration if there is suspicion of septic bursitis. However, aspiration of the bursa has been shown to lead to potential complications including fistula formation, infection, and future bursectomies. Fifty‐five percent of patients in our cohort were dismissed on empiric antibiotics, which is consistent with a prior ED study that found that approximately 50% of olecranon bursitis cases were septic. A recent study of 30 patients referred to an orthopedic surgical department demonstrated that, among patients who had undergone an olecranon bursal aspiration for septic bursitis, 55% developed a chronic draining wound at the aspiration site and 73% went on to eventual bursectomy. In comparison, none of the patients in that study who had been treated with empiric antibiotics went on to develop a chronic wound or require bursectomy. In another study of 31 patients admitted to the hospital for septic olecranon bursitis after undergoing bursal aspiration, 10% required an operative intervention. Similarly, in a study of 22 ED patients with septic olecranon bursitis based on bursal aspirates, three (14%) patients developed a chronic fistula tract and one (4.5%) required incision and drainage.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^6a84a917]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Empiric antibiotic management has been criticized as possibly leading to lowered diagnostic accuracy and poor antibiotic stewardship. Eight patients who were initially dismissed from the ED on empiric antibiotics in our study for suspected septic bursitis did not have resolution with empiric antibiotic therapy and underwent a subsequent aspiration. Five of these patients were found to have nonseptic bursitis. These patients as well as some patients who did have resolution after empiric antibiotics may have received antibiotics unnecessarily, placing them at unnecessary risk for antibiotic complications. With increasing antibiotic resistance and complications such as C. difficile colitis, these risks are important to consider when assessing the benefits of empiric antibiotic management.

Among patients who were dismissed home on empiric antibiotic coverage, 33% received MRSA coverage, in contrast to 77% of patients who were admitted to the hospital. This is likely because admitted patients were more systemically ill as demonstrated by higher rates of associated fever, cellulitis, and elevated CRP.

Only three patients in our cohort underwent arthrocentesis to assess for possible concomitant septic arthritis and none had septic arthritis. Rates of concomitant presentations of septic bursitis with septic arthritis have not been described, to our knowledge, likely because the presence of septic arthritis is often an exclusion criterion for studies of bursitis. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there have been no studies evaluating the reliability of physical examination for distinguishing septic bursitis from septic arthritis. However, anecdotally, septic arthritis is typically suspected in the presence of substantial pain throughout range of motion while allowing for discomfort due to tension on the bursa with maximal flexion.

### Common superficial bursitis [^30195f53]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Superficial bursitis most often occurs in the olecranon and prepatellar bursae. Less common locations are the superficial infrapatellar and subcutaneous (superficial) calcaneal bursae. Chronic microtrauma (e.g., kneeling on the prepatellar bursa) is the most common cause of superficial bursitis. Other causes include acute trauma/hemorrhage, inflammatory disorders such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis, and infection (septic bursitis). Diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation, with a particular focus on signs of septic bursitis. Ultrasonography can help distinguish bursitis from cellulitis. Blood testing (white blood cell count, inflammatory markers) and magnetic resonance imaging can help distinguish infectious from noninfectious causes. If infection is suspected, bursal aspiration should be performed and fluid examined using Gram stain, crystal analysis, glucose measurement, blood cell count, and culture. Management depends on the type of bursitis. Acute traumatic/hemorrhagic bursitis is treated conservatively with ice, elevation, rest, and analgesics; aspiration may shorten the duration of symptoms. Chronic microtraumatic bursitis should be treated conservatively, and the underlying cause addressed. Bursal aspiration of microtraumatic bursitis is generally not recommended because of the risk of iatrogenic septic bursitis. Although intrabursal corticosteroid injections are sometimes used to treat microtraumatic bursitis, high-quality evidence demonstrating any benefit is unavailable. Chronic inflammatory bursitis (e.g., gout, rheumatoid arthritis) is treated by addressing the underlying condition, and intrabursal corticosteroid injections are often used. For septic bursitis, antibiotics effective against Staphylococcus aureus are generally the initial treatment, with surgery reserved for bursitis not responsive to antibiotics or for recurrent cases. Outpatient antibiotics may be considered in those who are not acutely ill; patients who are acutely ill should be hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics.

Data analysis

Continuous features were summarized with medians, interquartile ranges (IQRs), and ranges; categorical features were summarized with frequency counts and percentages. Patient characteristics, ED management, and outcomes were compared using Kruskal‐Wallis, chi‐square, and Fisher's exact tests based on the type and distribution of the feature under study. Confidence intervals (CIs) for key frequency counts were computed using an asymptotic binomial approximation. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). All tests were two‐sided and p‐values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. p‐values were not adjusted based on multiple comparisons.

### Soft tissue infections [^07fb2fea]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Soft tissue infections are common and potentially fatal conditions. Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who have rheumatic disease. Patients who have rheumatic diseases may be at increased risk for soft tissue infections because of various factors, including inherent immunologic defects, genetics, and use of immunomodulatory therapy, including biologic agents. Timely diagnosis and management with the institution of antibiotics with or without surgical intervention is imperative for effective resolution of infection.

Regarding medical management for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider de-escalating antibiotic treatment according to the susceptibility pattern of the isolated pathogen, maintaining IV administration for 1–2 weeks, and switching to oral treatment as soon as the clinical signs and symptoms of infection (fever, redness, warmth, swelling, pain) and blood biomarkers (WBC and CRP) indicate satisfactory progress. Decide on oral antibiotics based on the in vitro activity, oral bioavailability, and diffusion to the synovial fluid.

### Empirical treatment of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis without aspiration [^47eb42d6]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although aspiration of septic olecranon bursitis is recommended in the literature, no high-level evidence exists to support this practice. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the results of traditional bursal aspiration (TBA) with empirical management without aspiration (EM). We hypothesized that EM of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis results in resolution, with fewer chronic draining sinuses and less progression to bursectomy.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all cases of septic olecranon bursitis seen by the orthopedic surgery department at a single tertiary referral center over a 5-year period. Cases were manually reviewed to determine patient demographics, management, and treatment results. The primary outcome was success of nonsurgical management versus requirement for surgical bursectomy.

Results

Thirty cases of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis were identified within the study period. Eleven patients were initially managed with TBA (performed by an emergency or primary care physician prior to orthopedic consultation), resulting in 11 positive cultures. Only 1 of these prompted a change of antibiotic management, and despite this information, 5 patients required a second course of antibiotics for incomplete resolution. Eight of the TBA cases went on to bursectomy. Nineteen patients underwent EM. Sixteen of these cases resolved with a single course of empirical antibiotics, and 3 (16%) cases required a second antibiotic course. One patient had a recurrence of symptoms 2 months after resolution with a single course of empirical antibiotics. This resolved with a second course of oral antibiotics. No patients who underwent EM went on to require bursectomy. The number needed to harm when aspiration was performed was 1.46.

Conclusions

We found EM of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis to be effective. Although 1 recurrence did occur in the EM group, no other complications occurred. Empirical management without aspiration may be considered in cases of uncomplicated septic olecranon bursitis.

LIMITATIONS

Our study has several limitations. All patients were included retrospectively and the data quality is dependent on the accuracy of the medical records. To mitigate these limitations, we adhered to standardized guidelines for observational studies and used a data abstraction form that was designed to optimize precision and accuracy of collected variables and minimize random and systematic errors. Abstractors were not blinded to the study objectives. We conducted our study in a single quaternary care ED and most of our visits were covered by medical doctors. Practice patterns and provider distribution may vary at other institutions. Our ED has a robust follow‐up system and a high percentage of patients who have a primary care provider. This is not the case for all EDs. Because most patients did not undergo an aspiration of the bursa, some nonseptic cases could have been included in the cohort of suspected septic bursitis. An additional limitation was the lack of diversity in our patient population, which was predominantly white, limiting generalizability; however, 85% were males with a median age of 57 years, which is similar to prior studies. Finally, 24 patients were lost to follow‐up and therefore outcomes for these patients are unknown.

METHODS

Study design

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study. The study was deemed exempt by the Mayo Clinic institutional review board. The STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for reporting observational studies were followed.

Study setting and population

This study was conducted at the ED of Mayo Clinic Hospital–Saint Mary's Campus, Rochester, Minnesota, a quaternary care academic ED that has a volume of approximately 77,000 annual patient visits. Most patients come from Olmsted County and six adjacent counties in southeastern Minnesota. All adult ED patients (age ≥ 18 years) with olecranon bursitis between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2018, were eligible for inclusion. Patients with an ED diagnosis containing "olecranon bursitis" or "bursitis", but not "prepatellar bursitis", were identified and the electronic health record (EHR) was manually reviewed to determine whether the patient had olecranon bursitis. All diagnoses associated with the ED visit were assessed for potential inclusion in the study. We considered the olecranon bursitis to be "suspected septic" if the patient was treated with antibiotics. Patients who declined research authorization, had an underlying fracture, or had surgery on the joint within 3 months prior to their presentation were excluded. Follow up was considered to be bursitis related if the provider specifically addressed the bursitis in the visit note. If the patient continued to have documented care in the EMR but the bursitis was not addressed, the visits were reviewed as part of the follow‐up period for 6 months but not considered bursitis‐related follow‐up. Patients were considered lost to follow‐up if they had less than 14 days of follow‐up available in the EHR.

Among the 39 (15%) patients who were admitted to the hospital at the time of the index ED visit for inpatient antibiotic therapy, 30 (77%) were treated with antibiotics covering MRSA (Table 1). One patient was lost to follow‐up (Figure 1). Among the 38 patients for which follow‐up was available, 34 (89%, 95% CI = 74%–97%) had an uncomplicated resolution with only empiric antibiotics. Three (8%) of the 38 patients with follow‐up had resolution after aspiration during their admission. Two of the aspiration cultures grew methicillin‐sensitive S. aureus and one grew Prototheca wickerhamii. One (3%) patient among the 38 with follow‐up had a subsequent outpatient aspiration which was non‐septic. No patients underwent subsequent surgeries or hospital stays related to their olecranon bursitis (Table 2). Thirty‐one (82%) had a subsequent bursitis‐related outpatient follow‐up, including one (3%, 95% CI = 0%–15%) who had a subsequent bursitis‐related ED visit.

RESULTS

Participant identification

A total of 458 ED patient visits between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2018, had a diagnosis of olecranon or nonprepatellar bursitis. After exclusion criteria were applied, a total of 266 ED visits from 264 distinct patients with olecranon bursitis were included. A detailed flowchart of patient enrollment and outcomes is shown in Figure 1. Among the 266 patient visits, medical doctors were the providers for 227 (85.3%) of the visits, and the remaining visits were covered by advanced practice providers. There were 67 total providers included in our study.

Descriptive data

The median (IQR) patient age of the cohort was 57 (42–69) years and 85% were male (Table 1). Swelling (94%), erythema (77%), and pain (85%) were the most common presenting symptoms. A total of 39 (15%) patients were taking steroids at the time of their ED visit and 37 (14%) had diabetes. Twenty‐four (9.0%) patients were lost to follow‐up, of which 20 (83%) were males with a median (IQR) age of 51.5 (40–65) years. A total of 229 (86%) had at least 3 months of follow‐up in the EMR and 220 (83%) had at least 6 months of follow‐up.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^e4de08a6]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Predisposing factors that increase the risk of acquired septic olecranon bursitis are persistent pressure on the bursa (eg, due to work demands), corticosteroid therapy, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, gout and other conditions that reduce immunity. As a child our patient had poliomyelitis, which could increase the potential for opportunistic infections due to an 'immunocompromised cutaneous district' because the virus has been shown to result in regional impairments in nerve conduction that could lead to decreased peptidergic stimulation of immunocompetent cells. Although poliomyelitis primarily affects motor neurons, there is evidence that sensory neurons are also impaired. The novel concept of a selectively diminished cutaneous and subcutaneous inflammatory response due to regional poliomyelitis-related nerve damage is further supported by case reports that detail the sparing of a poliomyelitis affected limb from psoriasis, joint sparing in a patient with unilateral psoriatic arthritis with a history of hemiplegia, and sparing of limbs affected by past infection with poliomyelitis in patients with systemic sclerosis. However, although our patient's poliomyelitis infection did permanently affect the joints of his upper extremities (primarily with mild elbow contractures), there is no clear evidence that his chronologically remote polio infection contributed to his P. acnes olecranon bursitis. A link between his P. acnes olecranon bursitis/osteomyelitis also seems unlikely because he did not have any prior history of atypical or unusual infections.

Patient's perspective

I am pleased with the final outcome, but in the first 3–4 weeks it was clear that the antibiotics choices were not working. I am grateful to return to swimming and all work-related activities.

Learning points

Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis can be rare pathogenic causes of olecranon bursitis and osteomyelitis due to their ubiquitous presence on the skin.
Wound cultures taken in these conditions must be held for adequate time to detect growth of these organisms and guide appropriate treatment decisions.
Penicillin-based antibiotics with a beta-lactamase inhibitor provide coverage for P. acnes and is a viable treatment option for bone and soft tissue infections with this pathogen.

### Efficacy of empiric antibiotic management of septic olecranon bursitis without bursal aspiration in emergency department patients [^4ac3f716]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Among the 76 (29%) patients who were dismissed from the ED without antibiotics, nine (12%) were lost to follow‐up. Among the 67 patients with follow‐up available, 65 (97%, 95% CI = 89%–99%) had resolution without any antibiotics, and 61 (91%, 95% CI = 81%–96%) had an uncomplicated resolution (i.e. did not require subsequent aspiration, hospitalization, or surgery; Figure 1, Table 2). One (1%, 95% CI = 0%–9%) patient underwent a subsequent therapeutic aspiration and one (1%, 95% CI = 0%–9%) patient underwent a subsequent diagnostic aspiration that yielded an inadequate sample for analysis and was believed to be nonseptic. One (1%, 95% CI = 0%–9%) patient underwent an olecranon bursectomy and partial ostectomy of the olecranon due to recurrent bursitis thought to be secondary to sports‐related overuse. One patient had a subsequent arthrocentesis to assess for septic arthritis, which was negative. Two (3%, 95% CI = 1%–11%) patients had a subsequent hospital stay and received inpatient antibiotics before obtaining a full resolution. Of the patients with a hospital stay, none underwent a bursal aspiration.

ED diagnostic evaluation and disposition

Diagnostic evaluation included a white blood cell count in 123 (46%) patients, a sedimentation rate in 91 (34%), a C‐reactive protein (CRP) in 97 (36%), and an X‐ray in 161 (61%; Table 1). The orthopedic service was consulted in 69 (26%) of cases.

Overall, among the 266 patients with olecranon bursitis, four (1.5%) patients underwent aspiration of the olecranon bursa during their ED visit. Of the 262 patients who were not aspirated in the ED, 39 (15%) were admitted to the hospital from the ED, 76 (29%) were dismissed from the ED without antibiotic therapy, and 147 (56%) were dismissed from the ED with antibiotic therapy for suspected septic olecranon bursitis (Figure 1). Two patients underwent arthrocentesis to assess for septic arthritis in the ED. Both were negative.

Comparison of patient characteristics based on ED disposition

When patients were compared based on ED disposition, we found that the median (IQR) CRP was highest in patients admitted to the hospital (50 [22–89] µg/dL) and the lowest in patients dismissed without antibiotics (11 [5–61] mg/dL; Table 1). However, there was no significant difference between the median sedimentation rate or median white blood cell count based on disposition. Patients who were initially admitted to the hospital at the time of the index ED visit were the most likely to have reported a fever (23%), have associated cellulitis (44%), and have an orthopedics consult in the ED (74%). Among patients who were dismissed to home without antibiotics, none reported a fever or had a documented fever in the ED. In addition, patients dismissed without antibiotics had the lowest rates of erythema (37%), warmth (25%), and tenderness (42%).

Bursitis

Background: A bursa is a sac filled with synovial fluid that acts as a friction cushion between structures. There are 10 bursa within and around the knee, and the 4 major bursa are the prepatellar, suprapatellar, infrapatellar, and pes anserine bursa. When friction or trauma irritates a bursa, it can become inflamed and be a significant source of knee pain. Bursitis is clinically recognized by localized pain, point tenderness, and edema at the sight of the bursa. Septic bursitis may also present with erythema, warmth, and systemic symptoms such as fevers and leukocytosis.
Etiology: Superficial to the patella is the subcutaneous prepatellar bursa, which can become inflamed with kneeling activities, and is colloquially called "housemaid's knee or carpenter's knee". Inferior to the patella are two bursae, subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa which lies superficial to the patellar ligament, and the deep (subtendinous) infrapatellar bursa which lies deep to the patellar ligament. Inferomedial knee pain may be caused by anserine bursitis. The anserine bursa lies deep to the pes anserinus comprising the tendinous attachments of the semitendinosus, gracilis, and sartorius. Proximal to the anserine bursa and deep to the semimembranosus tendon is the semimembranosus bursa. There are three lateral bursae: the bursa deep to the iliotibial tract, bursa deep to the lateral collateral ligament, and the inferior subtendinous bursa deep to the biceps femoris tendon. Posteriorly, there are two subtendinous bursa, one deep to the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius. A bursa can become inflamed by overuse leading to increased friction across the bursa. Septic bursitis requires bacteria to enter the bursa and is associated with trauma.
Diagnostic criteria: Physical exam is significant for pain and point tenderness overlying the affected bursa and may be associated with swelling. Prepatellar bursitis will present with egg-shaped swelling superficial to the patella. Septic bursitis may present with erythema and warmth. Radiologic knee series are usually normal. Evaluation with ultrasound will show a hypoechoic fluid filled sac or discrete fluid collection at the site of pain indicating bursitis.
Treatment: The treatment of bursitis-related knee pain is typically focused on reducing the inflammation of the bursa, itself – this includes ice, NSAIDs, activity modifications (such as knee pads for prepatellar bursitis), injections of corticosteroid, and therapeutic aspiration. For patients with active lifestyle or occupational demands and non-septic bursitis, intrabursal injection of corticosteroids provides acute pain relief. If septic bursitis is suspected, infectious workup includes blood sampling for evaluation of leukocytosis and aspiration of bursal fluid with gram stain and cell count. Treat septic bursitis with antibiotics. Recurrent or persistent severe bursitis may benefit from surgical interventions such as bursectomy.

### Four common types of bursitis: diagnosis and management [^8933b734]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Bursitis is a common cause of musculoskeletal pain and often prompts orthopaedic consultation. Bursitis must be distinguished from arthritis, fracture, tendinitis, and nerve pathology. Common types of bursitis include prepatellar, olecranon, trochanteric, and retrocalcaneal. Most patients respond to nonsurgical management, including ice, activity modification, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In cases of septic bursitis, oral antibiotics may be administered. Local corticosteroid injection may be used in the management of prepatellar and olecranon bursitis; however, steroid injection into the retrocalcaneal bursa may adversely affect the biomechanical properties of the Achilles tendon. Surgical intervention may be required for recalcitrant bursitis, such as refractory trochanteric bursitis.

We concluded that P. acnes was not initially detected because cultures were only kept for 5days. Consequently, initial antibiotic treatment failed. P. acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis grew in a subsequent tissue culture. The infection did not respond to intravenous vancomycin although soft-tissue debridements were done. This likely reflected the presence of olecranon osteomyelitis (seen on MRI scans) in addition to inadequate treatment with this antibiotic in the setting of a polymicrobial infection. Eventually, the infection was eradicated with multiple soft-tissue debridements in addition to the continuation of vancomycin with daily intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam that was added for the final 4weeks of antibiotic treatment.

Post‐ED bursitis management and outcomes

Among the four (1.5%) patients who underwent bursal aspiration in the ED, one patient was lost to follow‐up (Table 2). This patient's aspiration culture grew methicillin‐sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Of the remaining three patients, one aspiration culture grew methicillin‐resistant S. aureus, one grew group C Streptococcus, and one did not show microbial growth or crystals. There were no known complications from the bursal aspirations including future bursectomy or chronic fistula formation.

TABLE 2
Patient outcomes based on ED bursal aspiration and ED disposition among patients with olecranon bursitis for whom follow‐up was available

Note

A total of 147 (55%) patients were dismissed home from the ED on empiric antibiotic therapy, including 48 (33%) with coverage for methicillin‐resistant S. aureus (Table 1). Among the 147 patients, 13 (8.8%) were lost to follow‐up. Among the 134 patients with follow‐up available, 118 (88.1%, 95% CI = 81.1%–92.8%) had an uncomplicated resolution and none required subsequent bursa surgery (Figure 1, Table 2). Eight (6.0%, 95% CI = 2.8%–11.8%) patients underwent a bursal aspiration after their ED visit. Of these eight patients, two had confirmed septic bursitis, one had inadequate fluid volume for analysis thought to be due to improvement on the antibiotics, and five had findings consistent with nonseptic bursitis. Nine (6.7%, 95% CI = 3.3%–12.7%) of the 134 patients had a subsequent hospital stay related to their septic bursitis. Among these patients, three (33%) had initially been dismissed from the ED with coverage for methicillin‐resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The median (IQR) time between the index ED visit and subsequent hospitalization was 2 (1–2) days. All of the patients with subsequent hospital stays received inpatient parenteral antibiotics with subsequent full resolution of the bursitis and none underwent bursal aspiration. Twenty‐three (17.2%, 95% CI = 11.4%–25.9%) patients who were dismissed from the ED on antibiotics had a subsequent bursitis‐related ED visit. Among these patients, five (21%) had initially been dismissed from the ED with coverage for MRSA. The median (IQR) time between the initial and subsequent ED visits was 2 (1–3) days. Known antibiotic complications were limited to a single patient who reported an allergic rash. If all patients who were lost to follow‐up were assumed to have had a complicated resolution, 118/147 (80.3%, 95% CI = 72.7%–86.2%) would have had an uncomplicated resolution.

Study protocol

All data were abstracted from the EHR using a standardized extraction process. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Nashville, TN) electronic data capture tools hosted at Mayo Clinic.ED visits were independently extracted by two medical students (A.B. and A.T.) and an emergency nurse practitioner (I.K.). Extractors were trained on 10 random charts, and coding rules were developed. Abstractors were not blinded to study objectives. Random chart numbers were generated by. Coding rules included using the first recorded value for vital signs with more than one measurement; a history of acute trauma was defined as trauma within the past 1 month; fever was defined as a temperature of 38° C or higher; steroid use was defined as present if the patient was taking steroids at the time of the index ED visit; patient‐reported fever was defined as present if a patient reported a fever at any point in the illness. Investigators met on numerous occasions with the principal investigator (R.C.) to discuss the abstraction process, ambiguities, and inconsistencies. Inter‐rater agreement was assessed for the key variables including aspiration of the bursa in the ED, subsequent hospitalization, need for subsequent aspiration of the bursa, development of complications from initial bursal aspiration, complications from antibiotic use, and need for surgical procedure. New extraction guidelines were developed as needed to ensure consistency and accuracy. Repeated rounds of extraction and assessment were performed until there was near perfect agreement for all key variables. Approximately 20% of charts were extracted in triplicate during the training and assessment process. All charts with a bursal aspiration in the ED or following the ED visit were also reviewed by the principal investigator to ensure accuracy.

Measures

Demographic data, presenting symptoms, comorbidities (history of diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, human immunodeficiency virus, immunocompromised, steroid use, or other immunocompromised states at the time of the ED visit), ED evaluation and management, outpatient management, and complications within 6 months of the initial ED visit were collected. Complications from antibiotic management including anaphylaxis, allergic reaction, Clostridioides difficile colitis, any clinically significant diarrhea, or other clinically significant complications that were recorded. An uncomplicated resolution was defined as resolution of bursitis without need for subsequent aspiration of the bursa, surgery, or hospitalization.

The initial culture showed no growth on anaerobic media but it was held for only 5 days, which is not sufficient for detecting P. acnes; growth of this organism usually requires 9–14 days. The patient's primary care physician prescribed a 5-day course of intramuscular injections of ceftriaxone 1.0 g daily and a 10-day course of doxycycline 100 mg orally two times per day. The rationale given for its combination was 'for broad antibacterial coverage'.

The patient was referred to our clinic to take over the management of his septic left olecranon bursitis because of the clear failure of his initial treatment regimen. At that time, he was applying small gauze dressings two times per day to cover and collect the drainage from the 1-centimetre diameter open wound over the olecranon. MR images of the left elbow suggested mild acute osteomyelitis of the olecranon. At this clinic visit, one culture of the tissue that was cut with a scalpel from the open wound of the left olecranon bursa was obtained. The methodology for the anaerobic culture included cooked meat glucose liquid broth, plating on anaerobic blood agar and anaerobic blood agar containing phenyl ethyl alcohol which selects for Gram-positive organisms. P. acnes grew only in cooked meat glucose liquid broth under anaerobic conditions with no colonies observed on solid medium. Cultures were kept for 14 days. P. acnes was identified by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. Analysis for P. acnes phylotypes was not done although this information can be clinically important in some situations. S. epidermidis was also detected from the same culture when plated on aerobic blood agar. Antibiotic sensitivities were not done on either organism, which was an error because the laboratory failed to recognise that the sample was bursa tissue.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^27771afb]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The olecranon bursa is thought to be at increased risk for infection due to its superficial location. Septic olecranon bursitis is most commonly caused by bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Ho et al found S. aureus to be the predominant cause of infection in 72%–92% of cases that they studied.

Here we report a unique case of a 63-year-old man who sustained a punctate laceration on the posterior aspect of his left elbow and acquired a rare polymicrobial infection (Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis) in his olecranon bursa. There was also the possibility of concurrent olecranon osteomyelitis as seen on MRI. The infection was treated successfully with intravenous antibiotics and soft-tissue debridements.

- results of Gram staining (Gram-positive or Gram-negative) and morphology (cocci or bacilli)

- presence of risk factors for MRSA or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa and cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales

- administer a combination of semisynthetic penicillin (such as cloxacillin, cefazoline) plus ceftriaxone or monotherapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the absence of risk factors for resistant microorganisms and with negative Gram stain.

### Acute hand infections… [^b64ef1a0]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Mild infections without obvious abscess should be treated with warm soaks and topical antibiotics. 10 If an abscess is present, conservative measures to provoke spontaneous drainage may be tried for two to three days; however, mechanical drainage is often needed. 8 Procedures for draining paronychia have been described in a previous American Family Physician article. 10 Routine cultures for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections are not recommended. 26, 43 Oral antibiotics typically are not needed after successful drainage, but if used, they should be limited to treatment of immunocompromised or severely ill patients, based on local community resistance patterns and established guidelines. 10, 12, 14, 26. 16 Treatment of an early felon in which no abscess is present should include warm soaks, elevation, and empiric oral antibiotics directed at staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.

12, 15 Surgical drainage is required if an abscess is present; a high lateral incision should be made for a deep abscess, and a volar longitudinal incision should be made for a superficial abscess. Mainstays of therapy for herpetic whitlow include reducing the risk of transmission, pain control, and consideration of antiviral medications. Primary herpetic whitlow is typically self-limited, with complete resolution within 21 days. However, off-label use of oral antivirals should be considered for patients with recurrent lesions or symptoms present for less than 48 hours, or for immunocompromised patients, who may develop disseminated disease requiring intravenous antiviral treatment and critical care. 1, 12 A single prospective randomized controlled trial supports empiric antibiotic use in all patients. 21 This trial compared mechanical wound care alone with wound care plus oral cefaclor, or intravenous cefazolin plus penicillin G.

Patients with joint capsule penetration, tendon injury, or bites older than 24 hours were excluded. 20 The trial was terminated because of high rates of infection with wound care alone. 20 None of the patients who were treated with antibiotics developed infection. 20, 21 Oral and intravenous antibiotics were equally effective. 20, 21 Patients presenting with clenched-fist bite wounds within 24 hours after injury may be treated as outpatients if there are no signs of infection. They should be instructed to follow up within 24 hours after initial treatment.

### Septic arthritis: diagnosis and treatment [^d9773f0e]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis must be considered and promptly diagnosed in any patient presenting with acute atraumatic joint pain, swelling, and fever. Risk factors for septic arthritis include age older than 80 years, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, recent joint surgery, hip or knee prosthesis, skin infection, and immunosuppressive medication use. A delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in permanent morbidity and mortality. Physical examination findings and serum markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, are helpful in the diagnosis but are nonspecific. Synovial fluid studies are required to confirm the diagnosis. History and Gram stain aid in determining initial antibiotic selection. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen isolated in septic arthritis; however, other bacteria, viruses, fungi, and mycobacterium can cause the disease. After synovial fluid has been obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated if there is clinical concern for septic arthritis. Oral antibiotics can be given in most cases because they are not inferior to intravenous therapy. Total duration of therapy ranges from two to six weeks; however, certain infections require longer courses. Consideration for microorganisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Borrelia burgdorferi, and fungal infections should be based on history findings and laboratory results.

### Current approach to the evaluation and management of septic arthritis [^7ad9509d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis is an emergent condition caused by bacterial infection of a joint space. The most common etiology is hematogenous spread from bacteremia, but it can also occur from direct inoculation from bites, injection injuries, cellulitis, abscesses, or local trauma. Septic arthritis occurs most frequently in the lower extremities, with the hips and knees serving as the most common locations. The most sensitive findings include pain with motion of the joint, limited range of motion, tenderness of the joint, new joint swelling, and new effusion. Laboratory testing and imaging can support the diagnosis, but the criterion standard is diagnostic arthrocentesis. Treatment involves intravenous antibiotics and joint decompression.

### How common is MRSA in adult septic arthritis? [^556438ef]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine the proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adult septic arthritis patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This was a cross-sectional retrospective review in 2 urban academic EDs in northern California, one tertiary care and one public. Subjects included patients who underwent arthrocentesis in the ED from April 2006 through July 2007. We queried the microbiology laboratory databases for synovial fluid cultures sent from the ED. We reviewed synovial fluid culture results and corresponding synovial fluid analyses and then classified positive culture results as true septic arthritis or likely contaminant. For septic arthritis cases, we reviewed medical records and abstracted presenting features. We report our findings with descriptive statistics.

Results

One hundred nine synovial fluid cultures were sent from the EDs. Twenty-three results (21%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 14% to 30%) were positive, of which 9 were likely contaminants; 1 was from a soft tissue abscess and 1 was from bursitis. Of 12 septic arthritis cases, 6 cultures (50%; 95% CI 21% to 78%) grew MRSA, 4 (33%; 95% CI 7% to 60%) methicillin-susceptible S aureus, and 1 each (8%; 95% CI 0% to 24%) Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of the 6 MRSA cases, 4 were in male patients; median age of patients was 47.5 years, 3 patients had previously diseased joints, 2 patients injected drugs, 2 patients were febrile, 3 patients had previously diseased joints, median synovial fluid leukocyte count was 15,184 cells/microL (range 3,400 to 34,075 cells/microL), and 5 patients received appropriate ED antibiotics.

Conclusion

In this 2-ED population from a single geographic region, MRSA was the most common cause of community-onset adult septic arthritis. Synovial fluid cell counts were unexpectedly low in MRSA septic arthritis cases.

### Osteomyelitis of the patella [^ddf7fffc]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis of the patella is an uncommon infection that is primarily a disease of childhood. The diagnosis frequently is delayed because of its rarity and variable presentation, which may be acute with systemic signs or insidious with mild local signs. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with persistent peripatellar pain and swelling, cellulitis, septic prepatellar bursitis, and septic arthritis of the knee that does not respond to standard treatment. Treatment is identical to the treatment of osteomyelitis at other locations. The outcome is favorable in the child regarding range of motion and activity, although there may be persistent changes radiographically.

### Septic arthritis and bursitis: emergency ultrasound can facilitate diagnosis [^1e994f9a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This article reports the case of a 52-year-old woman with septic arthritis and bursitis of her shoulder. Due to a minor musculoskeletal injury and lack of fever, the diagnosis was missed on her first Emergency Department visit. Sonographic guidance of the shoulder arthrocentesis led to successful aspiration of the larger fluid collection in the subacromial bursa and allowed the diagnosis and treatment to proceed more rapidly. Septic arthritis is a challenging clinical diagnosis, and when it occurs in more difficult to aspirate joints, the diagnosis can become more challenging still. Ultrasound provides a means for the emergency physician to establish the diagnosis more readily.

Infections of native joints — etiology and synovial fluid testing are outlined as follows: S. aureus, Streptococcus species, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes of septic arthritis of native joints, and K. kingae is the most common etiology of bacterial joint infection in children younger than 4 years; septic bursitis, often prepatellar, olecranon, or trochanteric, is usually caused by S. aureus; peripheral blood white cell count, ESR, and CRP are often elevated but non-specific; traditionally, a synovial fluid leukocyte count more than 50 000 cells/mm3 was considered to suggest septic arthritis, though lower counts do not exclude it; ideally, synovial fluid should be submitted for Gram stain and cultured in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles; if Gram stain and culture are negative, molecular testing with a multiplex PCR panel or 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR/sequencing should be considered, and biopsy of the synovium for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic cultures, and histopathology, with or without fungal and mycobacterial stains and cultures, may be considered; concomitant or secondary bacteremia or fungemia occurs sporadically, so blood cultures should be collected; some less common agents such as K. kingae may require molecular detection methods, and N. gonorrhoeae is included in a recently FDA-cleared multiplex PCR panel for synovial fluid.

After obtaining the tissue culture, but prior to receiving the culture results 9 days later, intravenous vancomycin (1.5 g two times per day) had been started by the surgeon. This treatment was continued for 2 weeks. No addition cultures were obtained. Because of continuing drainage and the lack of the expected robust erythematous granulation tissue, ertapenem (1 g once daily) was then added and this two antibiotic treatment was continued for an additional 2 weeks. However, the clinical response to this double antibiotic treatment continued to be poor. Because of this an infectious disease specialist (MRO) was consulted. The consultant stopped ertapenem and started piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g intravenously every 8 hours. This change was based on data showing that this penicillin-based antibiotic with a beta-lactamase inhibitor would provide coverage for P. acnes in addition to: (1) continuing broad-spectrum coverage primarily for the possibility that another pathogen (in addition to S. epidermidis) was present but did not grow in subsequent cultures and (2) more aggressively treating the olecranon osteomyelitis.

During the intravenous antibiotic treatments, consecutive weekly irrigation and debridement procedures of the soft tissues were performed in our clinic. These procedures included superficial curettage of the wound base and margins. Two additional soft-tissue irrigation and debridements were done in the operating room. The first of these operating room irrigation and debridements was intended for wound closure. However, the wound was not ready for closure because the granulation tissue was inadequate (figure 1). As described above, this was when piperacillin/tazobactam was added. During the entire course of treatment the bone was never exposed; it was always covered with periosteum/granulation tissue.

### A randomized trial among compression plus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection for nonseptic olecranon bursitis [^d0c5b230]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Olecranon bursitis might be a minor problem in the outpatient clinic but relatively be common to occur. However, there are few well-designed studies comparing approaches to treatment.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Which treatment (compression bandaging with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], aspiration, or aspiration with steroid injections) is associated with the highest likelihood of resolution of nonseptic olecranon bursitis? (2) Which treatment is associated with earliest resolution of symptoms? (3) What factors are associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks?

Methods

We enrolled 133 patients from two centers; after applying prespecified exclusions (septic bursitis or concomitant inflammatory arthritis, intraarticular elbow pathology, recent aspiration or steroid injection done elsewhere, and refusal to participate), 90 patients were randomly allocated to receive compression bandaging with NSAIDs (C), aspiration (A), or aspiration with steroid injection (AS) groups (30 patients in each). The groups were similar at baseline in terms of age and gender. Seven patients (four from Group A and three from Group AS) were lost to followup. All patients were followed up weekly for 4 weeks, and the same treatment procedure was repeated if the bursitis recurred with any substantial fluid collection. At 4 weeks, the state of resolution and pain visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated. Failed resolution was defined as presence of persistent olecranon bursal fluid collection at Week 4 after the initiation of the treatment; on the contrary, if bursal fluid collection was clinically reduced or completely disappeared by the end of Week 4, the treatment was considered successful. We compared the proportion of resolution by Week 4 and the median times to resolution among the treatment groups. In addition, we evaluated whether the resolution affected pain VAS and what factors were associated with the resolution.

Results

There were no differences in the proportion of patients whose bursitis resolved by Week 4 among the three treatment groups (Group C: 25 of 30 [83%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.27–1.72], p = 0.580; Group A: 17 of 26 [65%], relative risk of resolution failure: 2.19 [95% CI, 0.98–4.87], p = 0.083; Group AS: 23 of 27 [85%], relative risk of resolution failure: 0.59 [95% CI, 0.22–1.63], p = 0.398) (p = 0.073). Steroid injection after aspiration (Group AS) was associated with the earliest resolution (2.3 weeks [range, 1–4 weeks]) when compared with aspiration alone (Group A; 3.1 weeks [range, 2–4 weeks]) and compression bandaging with NSAIDs (Group C; 3.2 weeks [range, 2–4 weeks]), p = 0.015). Longer duration of symptoms before treatment was the only factor associated with treatment failure by 4 weeks (failed resolution: 6 weeks [range, 2–9 weeks]; successful resolution: 4 weeks [range, 0.4–6 weeks]; p = 0.008).

Conclusions

With the numbers available, there were no differences in efficacy when compression bandaging with NSAIDs, aspiration, and aspiration with steroid injection were compared. However, we were powered only to detect a 30% difference, meaning that if there were a smaller difference in efficacy among the groups, we might not have detected it in a study of this size. Our data can be used as pilot data to power future prospective (and likely multicenter) trials. Because olecranon bursitis can recur, and because treatments like aspiration and aspiration with steroid injection can cause complications, unless future trials demonstrate clear efficacy advantages of aspiration and/or injection both at short and longer terms, we suggest that compression bandaging and a short course of NSAIDs may offer the most appropriate balance of safety and efficacy.

Level Of Evidence

Level II, therapeutic study.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^abe8ecfe]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge this is the first reported case of infected olecranon bursitis with the causal organisms being S. epidermidis and P. acnes, as shown in cultures from a tissue specimen. The association with P. acnes is the most unusual aspect of this case. Despite the shortcomings of the initial aspects of treatment for this case, including the initial courses of inadequate antibiotic treatments (eg, the primary care physician's use of low dose ceftriaxone and the surgeon's use of vancomycin instead of a beta-lactam antibiotic for P. acnes), this case is reported in order to help other medical doctors and surgeons avoid these pitfalls. Additionally, at the time when these decisions were made our literature searches (PubMed and Google) of 'P. acnes' and 'olecranon' and 'olecranon bursitis' failed to reveal any cases.

P. acnes is found in hair follicles (pilosebaceous glands) especially around the shoulder area, and is more commonly found in men than women. P. acnes are small-to-medium Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria that exhibit facultative anaerobic metabolism. This organism is primarily known for being involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory acne and other chronic conditions or infections such as prosthetic shoulder and hip infections, silicone breast prosthetic infections, endocarditis of prosthetic and native aortic valves, corneal infections, postoperative endophthalmitis, focal intracranial infections, cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections and sarcoidosis.

In orthopaedics, P. acnes has become notorious as an indolent and often difficult to diagnose opportunistic pathogen in spine and shoulder infections. This likely reflects the proximity of these sites to areas where there are relatively high concentrations of pilosebaceous glands. For example, Propionibacterium have become the most common bacteria to be recovered at surgical revision of a failed shoulder arthroplasty. P. acnes are a much less common cause of infection in elbow prosthetic arthroplasty, likely reflecting the very low prevalence of this organism in the cutaneous tissues of the elbow. Somerson et al reviewed 20 studies that reported deep infection rates after total elbow replacement. Of the six studies that reported organisms grown on culture (1667 cases), P. acnes only represented 0.7% of the infected cases (11 of 1667 cases).

### Current concepts in pediatric septic arthritis [^0b87d8e7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis continues to present challenges regarding the clinical diagnosis, workup, and definitive management. Urgent management is essential, so treating surgeons must efficiently work through differential diagnoses, identify concomitant infections, and do a timely irrigation and débridement. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is increasing, typically resulting in a more rapid progression of symptoms with more severe clinical presentation. The diagnostic utility of MRI has resulted in improved detection of concomitant septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, although MRI must not substantially delay definitive management. Early diagnosis followed by urgent irrigation and débridement and antibiotic therapy are essential for satisfactory long-term outcomes. Antibiotics should not be administered until blood cultures and arthrocentesis fluid are obtained, except in rare cases of a septic or toxic patient. Once cultures are obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should commence and provide coverage for the most likely pathogens, given the patient's age. Laboratory markers, especially C-reactive protein, should be followed until normalization and correlate with resolution of clinical symptoms. Definitive antibiotic selection should be shared with a pediatric infectious disease specialist, who can help guide the duration of treatment.

### Andolecranon bursitis / osteomyelitis: a case involving surgical and antibiotic treatment [^2f20d41a]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Similar to our patient's case, the onset of infection with P. acnes is usually insidious and of low virulence, and once established it persists due to the tendency of these organisms to form a biofilm. For this reason, antibiofilm antibiotics, such as rifampicin (rifampin), are often necessary for successful treatment. However, rifampicin-resistant P. acnes have been known to appear as a result of this treatment. High dose intravenous penicillin is usually the drug of choice for treating P. acnes infections and rifampin is often used in combination with this antibiotic or others (eg, vancomycin or daptomycin). A main reason that we did not use penicillin and rifampin is that during the final phase of our patient's treatment we were primarily concerned for Gram-positive coverage and a polymicrobial infection. It is for this reason that we used piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin.

Improvements in isolating P. acnes can be achieved when employing the advanced methods. For example, in a prospective multicentre study of prosthetic joint infections, Bémer et al showed that P. acnes infections were most reliably detected using Schaedler broth (up to 14 days incubation time). ESR and CRP levels are also known to have poor sensitivity for the diagnosis and monitoring of the progress of the treatment for infected shoulder prosthetic arthroplasties. This is consistent with the variable ESR and CRP levels in our patient throughout the course of his illness and the failure of these markers to completely normalise by the end of his treatment.

P. acnes can remain viable on inanimate object surfaces for at least 17 days. While it might be conceivable that the organism was present on the metal rail at the time the patient struck it with his left elbow, it is more likely that this organism was present on his skin, especially given the presence of S. epidermidis in the same culture. Nevertheless, P. acnes are rarely the cause, or detected as a contaminant, in cases of infected olecranon bursitis. This is supported by our failure to find any reported cases of these associations in our literature searches.

Acute septic arthritis is a condition with the potential for joint destruction, physeal damage, and osteonecrosis, which warrants urgent identification and treatment. The organism most frequently responsible is Staphylococcus aureus; however, our understanding of pathogens continues to evolve as detection methods continue to improve. MRI has improved our ability to detect concurrent infections and is a useful clinical tool where available. The treatment course involves intravenous antibiotics followed by transition to oral antibiotics when clinically appropriate. The recommended surgical treatment of septic arthritis is open arthrotomy with decompression of the joint, irrigation, and debridement and treatment of concurrent infections.

### Utilisation of musculoskeletal ultrasonography for the evaluation of septic arthritis in a patient presenting to the emergency department with fever during the era of COVID-19 [^3c71bfcb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Prompt recognition and treatment of septic arthritis are crucial to prevent significant morbidity and mortality in affected patients. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, anchoring bias may make an already challenging diagnosis like septic arthritis more difficult to diagnose quickly and efficiently. Musculoskeletal (MSK) point of care ultrasonography (POCUS) is an imaging modality that can be used to quickly and efficiently obtain objective findings that may help a clinician establish the diagnosis of septic arthritis. We report a case where MSK POCUS was a key element in establishing the diagnosis of glenohumeral joint septic arthritis and subdeltoid septic bursitis for a patient that presented to the emergency department with a fever during the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Skin and soft tissue infections [^ff415884]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Primary skin infections (ie, pyodermas) typically are initiated by some breach in the epidermis, resulting in infection by organisms, such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, that normally colonize the skin. Host-associated factors, such as immunosuppression, vasculopathy, neuropathy, or decreased lymphatic drainage, may predispose to skin infection. The clinical syndromes associated with skin infections are often characteristic and are defined most simplistically by anatomic distribution. Although often mild and self-limited, skin infections can be more aggressive and involve deeper structures, including fascia and muscle. This article discusses skin and soft tissue infections, including impetigo, hair follicle-associated infections (ie, folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles) erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis, septic bursitis, and tenosynovitis.

### Corticosteroids for septic arthritis in children [^dc094395]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Septic arthritis is an acute infection of the joints characterised by erosive disruption of the articular space. It is the most common non-degenerative articular disease in developing countries. The most vulnerable population for septic arthritis includes infants and preschoolers, especially boys. Septic arthritis disproportionately affects populations of low socioeconomic status. Systemic corticosteroids and antibiotic therapy may be beneficial for treatment of septic arthritis. Even if the joint infection is eradicated by antibiotic treatment, the inflammatory process may produce residual joint damage and sequelae.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in children with a diagnosis of septic arthritis.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), and Google Scholar. We searched all databases from their inception to 17 April 2018, with no restrictions on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with patients from two months to 18 years of age with a diagnosis of septic arthritis who were receiving corticosteroids in addition to antibiotic therapy or as an adjuvant to other therapies such as surgical drainage, intra-articular puncture, arthroscopic irrigation, or debridement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, data extraction, and evaluation of risk of bias. We considered as major outcomes the presence of pain, activities of daily living, normal physical joint function, days of antibiotic treatment, length of hospital stay, and numbers of total and serious adverse events. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included two RCTs involving a total of 149 children between three months and 18 years of age who were receiving antibiotics for septic arthritis. The most commonly affected joints were hips and knees. These studies were performed in Costa Rica and Israel. In both studies, dexamethasone administered intravenously (ranging from 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg/dose every six to eight hours) during four days was the corticosteroid, and the comparator was placebo. Trials excluded patients with any degree of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression. The longest follow-up was one year. Trials did not report activities of daily living nor length of hospital stay. Both studies used adequate processes for randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding, and review authors judged them to have low risk of selection and performance bias. Losses to follow-up were substantive in both studies, and we judged them to have high risk of attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting. We graded all outcomes as low quality due to concerns about study limitations and imprecision. The risk ratio (RR) for absence of pain at 12 months of follow-up was 1.33, favouring corticosteroids (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.72; P = 0.03; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 13, 95% CI 6 to 139; absolute risk difference 24%, 95% CI 5% to 43%). The RR for normal function of the affected joint at 12 months of follow-up was 1.32, favouring corticosteroids (95% CI 1.12 to 1.57; P = 0.001; NNTB = 13, 95% CI 7 to 33; absolute risk difference 24%, 95% CI 11% to 37%). We found a reduction in the number of days of intravenous antibiotic treatment favouring corticosteroids (mean difference (MD) -2.77, 95% CI -4.16 to -1.39) based on two trials with 149 participants. Researchers did not report length of hospital stay. One trial (49 participants) reported that treatment with dexamethasone was associated with a shorter duration of IV antibiotic treatment, leading to a shorter hospital stay, and although duration of hospitalisation was a primary outcome of the study, study authors did not provide data on the duration of hospitalisation. We downgraded the quality by one level for concerns about study limitations (high risk of attrition bias and selective reporting), and by another level for imprecision. In one trial of 49 participants, researchers followed 29 children for 12 months, and parents reported that no children demonstrated adverse effects of the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in children with a diagnosis of septic arthritis is of low quality and is derived from the findings of two trials (N = 149). Corticosteroids may increase the proportion of patients without pain and the proportion of patients with normal function of the affected joint at 12 months, and may also reduce the number of days of antibiotic treatment. However, we cannot draw strong conclusions based upon these trial results. Additional randomised clinical trials in children with relevant outcomes are needed.

### Optimizing antibiotic therapy in musculoskeletal infections [^b6096ed1]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Research into the optimal antibiotic management of musculoskeletal infections has advanced tremendously over the past quarter century, including over a dozen randomized controlled trials and numerous observational studies. This review examines the rationale for and evidence base supporting modern approaches to antibiotic decision making and stewardship in orthopedic infections. Specific practice advances discussed include the increased and earlier use of oral antibiotics, other principles of antibiotic selection (eg, the notion of "bone penetration" and novel local antimicrobial strategies), individualizing durations of therapy, and increasingly selective approaches to empiric antipseudomonal therapy, suppressive antibiotic therapy, and periprocedural antimicrobial prophylaxis following arthroplasty.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^d3b916cf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Septic arthritis of native joints [^114507c8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is a rheumatologic emergency that may lead to disability or death. Prompt evacuation of the joint, either by arthrocentesis at the bedside, open or arthroscopic drainage in the operating room, or imaging-guided drainage in the radiology suite, is mandatory. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major cause of septic arthritis in the United States. MRSA joint infection seems to be associated with worse outcomes. Antibiotic courses of 3 to 4 weeks in duration are usually adequate for uncomplicated bacterial arthritis. Treatment duration should be extended to 6 weeks if there is imaging evidence of accompanying osteomyelitis.

### Short-course antibiotics for common infections: what do we know and where do we go from here? [^e51dc8ff]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past 25 years, researchers have performed > 120 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrating short courses to be non-inferior to long courses of antibiotics for common bacterial infections.

Objective

We sought to determine whether clinical data from RCTs affirm the mantra of 'shorter is better' for antibiotic durations in 7 common infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infections, pharyngitis and sinusitis.

Sources

Published RCTs comparing short- versus long-course antibiotic durations were identified through searches of PubMed and clinical guideline documents.

Content

Short-course antibiotic durations consistently result in similar treatment success rates as longer antibiotic courses among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections in women, gram-negative bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections when the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobials are used, and patients show clinical signs of improvement. For patients with osteomyelitis, 6 weeks of antibiotics is adequate for the treatment of osteomyelitis in the absence of implanted foreign bodies and surgical debridement. Whether durations can be further shortened with debridement is unclear, although small studies are promising.

Implications

With few exceptions, short courses were non-inferior to long courses; future research should focus on appropriately defining the patient population, ensuring the correct choice and dose of antimicrobials and developing meaningful outcomes relevant for frontline clinicians.

Level of evidence: 5

In clinical practice, the dogma that antibiotics should be withheld before obtaining of microbiological cultures is well recognized and is based on the assumption that antibiotic exposure decreases the probability of bacterial identification from cultures. Obtaining an etiological diagnosis of PBI is extremely important for choosing the appropriate antimicrobial treatment. The antibiotic treatment should be guided by microbiological findings not only in order to improve the outcome of patients with PBI but also for limiting the use of unnecessary antibiotics and consequently limit the adverse effects and the ecological impact of antibiotics. As a consequence, all efforts should be made in order to obtain a microbiological diagnosis. No studies specifically assessing the impact of antibiotic exposure on the rate of positivity of bacterial cultures from bone biopsies in patients with PBIs have been published. In our systematic review, we found only three studies that reported some data on the impact of antibiotic exposure. Wu et al. found no significant differences in the culture positivity rate with regard to antibiotic therapy before image-guided biopsy. Similarly, no significantly different diagnostic accuracy of microbiological cultures was found by Bernard et al. in patients with concomitant antibiotic treatment as compared with those without concomitant antibiotics. In another study, no significant effect of prior antibiotic therapy on rate of positivity of bacterial cultures was found. However, all of these studies were not designed with the purpose of investigating the issue of prior antimicrobial therapy, were cohort studies, and included a small number of patients.

Even if published studies were not able to demonstrate an effect of previous antibiotic therapy on the rate of microbiological culture positivity, considering the limitation of studies and the rationale for such recommendation, we recommend that discontinuing or postponing antibiotics when feasible is reasonable. Antimicrobial therapy should not be withheld in patients with impending sepsis or hemodynamic instability. The optimal duration of antibiotic-free time before bone biopsy has not been established.
9 CT should be used as an adjunct to conventional radiographs in complex anatomic areas and is useful to detect bone sequestra.

Level of evidence: 4

CT has the highest image resolution in the evaluation of peripheral bone. Thus, it is indicated in the evaluation of complex anatomic area, such as the shoulder and the pelvis. It can be used to detect small foci of gas, and areas of cortical erosion and destruction. CT is the modality of choice in areas of complex anatomy for the detection of bone sequestra, mainly occurring at later stages of osteomyelitis.
