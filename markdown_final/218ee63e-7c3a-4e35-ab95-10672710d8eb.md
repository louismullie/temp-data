## Question

Max tylenol allowed per 24 hours

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the maximum amount of Tylenol (acetaminophen) allowed per 24 hours. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard adult maximum daily dose. Then, I should verify pediatric weight-based limits and the absolute cap. Next, I will consider special populations such as those with liver disease, alcohol use, or low body weight. After that, I need to check how combination products and different routes of administration affect the total. Finally, I will review safety data and overdose thresholds to ensure the guidance is clinically sound and reference-supported.

> Let me first confirm the standard adult maximum. For adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg or more, the maximum total acetaminophen dose from all sources and routes is 4,000 mg per 24 hours, with typical dosing of 650 mg every 4 hours or 1,000 mg every 6 hours and a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses, which is consistently stated in FDA labeling for intravenous acetaminophen and echoed in professional guidelines and product labeling for oral formulations [^1159vpjH] [^114mx156] [^113K1tY1] [^116Re65Q].

> Wait, let me verify pediatric dosing because it is weight-based and easy to misstate. For children, the usual dose is 10–15 mg/kg every 4–6 hours as needed, with a maximum of 75 mg/kg per 24 hours, but not to exceed 4,000 mg per day regardless of weight; this cap is emphasized in pediatric dental pain guidance and aligns with IV labeling for children 2–12 years and broader pediatric references, and I should double-check that infants under 2 years have even lower daily maxima, which the IV label confirms at 50–60 mg/kg/day depending on age [^11344m4G] [^112DMVSP] [^116E2Cwg] [^112PhME9].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and risk modifiers. In chronic liver disease, many experts recommend a lower daily maximum, often around 3,000 mg/day or even 2,000 mg/day in advanced disease, and severe hepatic impairment is a contraindication for IV acetaminophen; chronic alcohol use, malnutrition, and enzyme inducers also increase hepatotoxic risk, so a more conservative ceiling is prudent in those settings, and some rheumatology and specialty guidelines explicitly suggest 3 g/day when used chronically or in patients at risk [^112WnnZb] [^116ozWAs] [^114Gxxiq] [^112vLMK9] [^115s7iRt].

> I need to ensure I account for total acetaminophen exposure across all sources. The 4,000 mg/day limit applies to the cumulative amount from prescription and over-the-counter products, including combination opioids, cold medications, and different routes such as oral, rectal, and IV; exceeding this threshold increases the risk of dose-dependent hepatotoxicity, and unintentional overdose from multiple products is a major contributor to acetaminophen-related liver injury, so I should confirm patients are tallying all sources before advising on safety [^1159vpjH] [^114mx156] [^115Y2yEc] [^111uj7P6].

> Let me consider formulation-specific nuances. Some extended-release oral products have slightly lower labeled maxima around 3,900 mg/day, and certain IV pediatric regimens cap at 3,750 mg/day in smaller adults, but these are exceptions; the general adult ceiling remains 4,000 mg/day from all sources, and I should not let these edge cases obscure the overarching limit unless a specific label directs otherwise [^111dZcY4] [^11537zHd] [^112Fjz3e] [^113dnT6R].

> Next, I should review safety data and overdose thresholds to contextualize the limit. Acetaminophen is a dose-dependent hepatotoxin; ingestion above 4 g within 24 hours or repeated supratherapeutic dosing increases risk of acute pericentral liver injury, and emergency care with N-acetylcysteine is indicated when risk is present based on dose, timing, and labs; importantly, many cases are unintentional, underscoring why strict adherence to the 4,000 mg/day cap and careful source accounting are essential [^115Y2yEc] [^114svRWo] [^112fA4RV] [^115s7iRt].

> But wait, what if someone argues for a universal 3,250 mg/day cap? I should double-check the origin of that lower number. Some formularies and older advisory discussions proposed 3,250 mg/day as a more conservative maximum, yet current FDA labeling and major guidelines still recognize 4,000 mg/day as the labeled maximum for healthy adults, with professional discretion to use lower limits in at-risk patients; therefore, 3,250 mg/day is a cautious, not universal, ceiling and should be individualized rather than applied broadly [^114pezxJ] [^113kHyvB] [^114i69cA].

> Final answer, keeping it clinically precise: For healthy adults and adolescents weighing 50 kg or more, the maximum Tylenol (acetaminophen) dose is 4,000 mg per 24 hours from all sources and routes, typically given as 650 mg every 4 hours or 1,000 mg every 6 hours with at least 4 hours between doses; for children, do not exceed 75 mg/kg per 24 hours and never more than 4,000 mg per 24 hours, and consider lower limits such as 3,000 mg/day or less in those with liver disease, chronic alcohol use, malnutrition, or when used long term, always ensuring the total daily acetaminophen from all medications is counted toward the limit [^1159vpjH] [^114mx156] [^11344m4G] [^112vLMK9].

---

The maximum recommended daily dose of Tylenol (acetaminophen) is **4,000 mg per 24 hours** for healthy adults, from all sources (oral, IV, rectal, and combination products) [^1159vpjH] [^114mx156]. For patients with liver disease, chronic alcohol use, or those at higher risk of hepatotoxicity, **limit total daily intake to 3,000 mg or less**. Exceeding 4,000 mg in 24 hours increases the risk of severe liver damage, including acute liver failure [^115Y2yEc] [^115s7iRt].

---

## Maximum recommended daily dose

- **Standard adult dose**: 4,000 mg per 24 hours (all routes and products combined) [^1159vpjH] [^114mx156].
- **High-risk patients**: ≤ 3,000 mg per 24 hours (e.g. liver disease, chronic alcohol use, malnutrition, enzyme inducers) [^111MmeuP] [^115s7iRt].
- **Pediatric dose**: 10–15 mg/kg per dose every 4–6 hours; maximum 75 mg/kg per day, not to exceed 4,000 mg/day [^11344m4G] [^112PhME9].

---

## Clinical implications of exceeding the maximum dose

Exceeding 4,000 mg/day can cause **severe hepatotoxicity**, including acute liver failure, and may be fatal [^115Y2yEc] [^112v5s5W]. Unintentional overdose is common due to use of multiple acetaminophen-containing products [^111uj7P6] [^113kHyvB].

---

## Special considerations and patient populations

- **Liver disease**: Use caution; consider lower daily limits or avoid use.
- **Chronic alcohol use**: Increased hepatotoxic risk; use lower limits.
- **Malnutrition/enzyme inducers**: Higher risk; use caution.
- **Pediatric patients**: Weight-based dosing; maximum 75 mg/kg/day, not to exceed 4,000 mg/day [^11344m4G] [^112PhME9].

---

## Maximum recommended daily dose of Tylenol

| **Patient population** | **Maximum daily dose** |
|-|-|
| Healthy adults | 4,000 mg |
| High-risk adults (liver disease, chronic alcohol use, malnutrition, enzyme inducers) | ≤ 3,000 mg |
| Pediatric patients | 75 mg/kg/day (≤ 4,000 mg/day) |

---

The maximum recommended daily dose of Tylenol is **4,000 mg per 24 hours** for healthy adults, with lower limits for high-risk patients and pediatric weight-based dosing.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse (see WARNINGS).

Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24–72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly (see WARNINGS).

Initial Dosage

Initiating Treatment with TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg are associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions and are not associated with greater efficacy.

The usual adult dosage is:

TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets (codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain.

TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets (codeine 60 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take one tablet every 4 hours as needed for pain.

The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours, based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.

Conversion from Other Opioids to TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets

There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.

### Emergency department patient knowledge concerning acetaminophen (paracetamol) in over-the-counter and prescription analgesics [^1174Ri8s]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to evaluate patient knowledge of the acetaminophen (paracetamol) content of commonly used pain medications and the maximum daily recommended dose of acetaminophen.

Methods

A prospective, convenience sample of emergency department patients were enrolled. Data were recorded using a standardised questionnaire over 4 months.

Results

1009 patients were enrolled. 492 patients (49%) did not know if Tylenol contained acetaminophen (paracetamol). The majority (66–90%) of patients did not know if Lortab, Vicodin, Percocet, non-aspirin pain reliever, ibuprofen, Motrin, or Advil contained acetaminophen. 568 patients (56%) reported not knowing the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen and only 71 patients (7%) reported the correct daily dose.

Conclusions

Patient knowledge of the acetaminophen content of commonly used analgesic medications and its maximum recommended daily dose is limited. This may contribute to unintentional repeated supratherapeutic ingestion (RSTI) of acetaminophen, or overdose.

### Acetaminophen and the U.S. acute liver failure study group: lowering the risks of hepatic failure [^112v5s5W]. Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause for calls to Poison Control Centers (> 100,000/year) and accounts for more than 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and an estimated 458 deaths due to acute liver failure each year. Data from the U.S. Acute Liver Failure Study Group registry of more than 700 patients with acute liver failure across the United States implicates acetaminophen poisoning in nearly 50% of all acute liver failure in this country. Available in many single or combination products, acetaminophen produces more than 1 billion US dollars in annual sales for Tylenol products alone. It is heavily marketed for its safety compared to nonsteroidal analgesics. By enabling self-diagnosis and treatment of minor aches and pains, its benefits are said by the Food and Drug Administration to outweigh its risks. It still must be asked: Is this amount of injury and death really acceptable for an over-the-counter pain reliever?

### Developing consumer-centered, nonprescription drug labeling a study in acetaminophen [^111uj7P6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the U.S., acetaminophen overdose has surpassed viral hepatitis as the leading cause of acute liver failure, and misuse contributes to more than 30,000 hospitalizations annually. Half to two thirds of acetaminophen overdoses are unintentional, suggesting the root cause is likely poor understanding of medication labeling or failure to recognize the consequences of exceeding the recommended maximum daily dosage.

Purpose

Elicit subject feedback about active ingredient and dosing information on over-the-counter (OTC) acetaminophen and elicit feedback on proposed plain-language text and icons.

Methods

Six focus groups, preceded by individual interviews, were conducted in April 2010 among 45 adults in two cities from two clinics and an adult basic education center. The individual interviews evaluated knowledge of OTC pain relievers, attention to product label information and literacy level while the group discussion elicited preference for label messages and icons. Analyses were conducted from April to June 2010.

Results

Forty-four percent read at or below the 6th-grade level. Individual interviews revealed that < 50% of participants routinely examine product label information. Only 31% know acetaminophen is in Tylenol®. The groups achieved consensus on a preferred icon for acetaminophen, desired explicit statement of potential liver damage in the warning against simultaneous use of acetaminophen products, and indicated preference for an icon and wording for maximum dose.

Conclusions

With the high prevalence of OTC use, a consumer-centered approach to developing icons and messages to promote awareness and safe use of acetaminophen could benefit consumers.

### Are recommended doses of acetaminophen effective for children aged 2 to 3 years? A pharmacokinetic modeling answer [^116S3KrS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acetaminophen (APAP) elixir is a widely used pediatric antipyretic medication. It has been shown that up to 30% of febrile children presenting to a large urban pediatric emergency department received inadequate APAP dosages at home with errors primarily due to age-based dosing. Parental education material in the form of weight-based dosing guides has been proposed; however, validation of current recommended APAP dosages using pharmacokinetic models is needed. This study used a mathematical model of APAP absorption to predict plasma concentrations and to compare them with the range required to reach and achieve antipyresis (10–20 μg/mL).

Methods

A common APAP preparation (Children's Tylenol Elixir) was tested (children aged 2–3 years, 10.9–15.9 kg). The manufacturer's suggested dose of 160 mg was compared with the standard 10 to 15 mg/kg dose range.

Results

The model predicts a peak plasma concentration between 6.38 and 8.55 μg/mL for 10 mg/kg dose and 9.57 and 12.8 μg/mL for 15 mg/kg dose. The manufacturer's suggested dose of 160 mg was tested across the limits of the weight range (10.9–15.9 kg). A peak plasma concentration between 9.36 and 12.6 μg/mL was found for the lower weight limit (10.9 kg child) and 6.42 to 8.61 μg/mL for the upper weight limit (15.9 kg child).

Conclusions

With the use of this model, the 10 mg/kg dose does not reach the plasma concentration value for antipyresis (10–20 μg/mL), whereas 15 mg/kg is adequate only if assuming a greater absorption constant. The 160 mg dose is effective only for children weighing 10.9 kg. Individual differences in drug bioavailability, volume of distribution, and absorption/elimination constants undoubtedly exist, and future studies directly measuring plasma APAP concentration and pharmacokinetics are needed. However, these results indicate that dosages for APAP in children should be weight based and manufacturers should review their dosing recommendations.

Outcomes of interest

The outcomes of interest were quantity and timing of administration of narcotic and non-narcotic analgesia provided postoperatively on the ward, the associated pain scores while in hospital, and the type and dosing of analgesia provided in the discharge prescription. All opioid doses were converted to OME to facilitate comparisons. Patients were categorized into one of four patterns based on their needs while in hospital: (1) opioid and non-opioid analgesia — defined as those who received both opioid and non-opioid analgesia, this included combination opioids, consisting of a single tablet containing both opioid and non-opioid medication, specifically Percocet (acetaminophen 325 mg/oxycodone 5 mg); (2) opioid-only analgesia, defined as those who received only opioids while in hospital; (3) non-opioid analgesia only; (4) no analgesia at all.

In regard to standard practices at the time of study, there was no standardized pain management guideline or pathway in hospital or for discharge prescriptions. Pain management was determined by a physician assistant and surgical residents. They were supervised by 12 faculty attendings. Patients did not routinely receive intraoperative nerve blocks, nor intravenous Toradol or acetaminophen. There are no electronic health order sets or prescription templates for prescribing. Prescribed opioids included hydromorphone, morphine, Percocet, oxycodone, and Tylenol #3.

Patient demographic information (age, gender, diagnosis, history of opioid abuse and comorbidities) was recorded for all eligible patients, as was the postoperative LOS from arrival on the surgical ward to discharge from hospital in hours, the timing of analgesic medication administration, the last documented numerical pain score (scale of 1–10) within 12 hours of discharge, and the discharge prescription. The discharge prescription daily dosing was calculated as the maximum as-needed dosing available as specified in the prescription.

Because the average LOS on the postoperative ward was less than 24 hours, opioid dosing was calculated hourly according to the formula: Hourly dosing = (total dose)/(hours on ward). To facilitate comparisons this value was then extrapolated to the 24 hours' dosing.

Addiction, Abuse and Misuse

TYLENOL with Codeine exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing TYLENOL with Codeine tablets, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions (see WARNINGS).

Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products (see WARNINGS). Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to

complete a REMS-compliant education program,
counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products.
emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacist, and
consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety.

Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression

Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of TYLENOL with Codeine tablets. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of TYLENOL with Codeine tablets or following a dose increase (see WARNINGS).

Accidental Ingestion

Accidental ingestion of TYLENOL with Codeine tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of TYLENOL with Codeine tablets (see WARNINGS).

Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Children

Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Most of the reported cases occurred following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine due to a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 polymorphism (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers, Nursing Mothers). TYLENOL with Codeine is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Avoid the use of TYLENOL with Codeine tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS).

### Acetaminophen for osteoarthritis [^1176HSdV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is also important to consider. This update to the original 2003 review includes nine additional RCTs.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, arthrotec, celecoxib, naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (up to July 2005), EMBASE (2002-July 2005), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ACP Journal Club, DARE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (all from 1994 to July 2005). Reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles were also hand searched.

Selection Criteria

Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in OA were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pain, physical function and global assessment outcomes were reported. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMD). Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk (RR) and the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated.

Main Results

Fifteen RCTs involving 5986 participants were included in this review. Seven RCTs compared acetaminophen to placebo and ten RCTs compared acetaminophen to NSAIDs. In the placebo-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was superior to placebo in five of the seven RCTs and had a similar safety profile. Compared to placebo, a pooled analysis of five trials of overall pain using multiple methods demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.04), which is of questionable clinical significance. The relative percent improvement from baseline was 5% with an absolute change of 4 points on a 0 to 100 scale. The NNT to achieve an improvement in pain ranged from 4 to 16. In the comparator-controlled RCTs, acetaminophen was less effective overall than NSAIDs in terms of pain reduction, global assessments and in terms of improvements in functional status. No significant difference was found overall between the safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs, although patients taking traditional NSAIDS were more likely to experience an adverse GI event (RR 1.47, (95% CI 1.08 to 2.00). 19% of patients in the traditional NSAID group versus 13% in the acetaminophen group experienced an adverse GI event. However, the median trial duration was only 6 weeks and it is difficult to assess adverse outcomes in a relatively short time period.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence to date suggests that NSAIDs are superior to acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with OA. The size of the treatment effect was modest, and the median trial duration was only six weeks, therefore, additional considerations need to be factored in when making the decision between using acetaminophen or NSAIDs. In OA subjects with moderate-to-severe levels of pain, NSAIDs appear to be more effective than acetaminophen.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (Tylenol with codeine) [^115rJCb4]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Controlled Substance

TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets contain codeine. Codeine in combination with acetaminophen, is a Schedule III controlled substance.

Abuse

TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets contain codeine, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids, including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion (see WARNINGS).

All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.

Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.

Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful, or potentially harmful, consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.

"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care providers. "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.

Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.

TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.

Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.

Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Children

Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Codeine is subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to an increased exposure to the active metabolite morphine. Based upon post-marketing reports, children younger than 12 years of age appear to be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine, particularly if there are risk factors for respiratory depression. For example, many reported cases of death occurred in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to its respiratory depressant effects. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:

TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets are contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets are contraindicated for post-operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Avoid the use of TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as post-operative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression (see WARNINGS).
As with adults, when prescribing codeine for adolescents, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose (see OVERDOSAGE).

Nursing Mothers

At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets.

### Randomized clinical trial of hydrocodone / acetaminophen versus codeine / acetaminophen in the treatment of acute extremity pain after emergency department discharge [^114ovJW3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to test the hypothesis that hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Vicodin [5/500]) provides more efficacious analgesia than codeine/acetaminophen (Tylenol #3 [30/300]) in patients discharged from the emergency department (ED). Both are currently Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Schedule III narcotics.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial of patients with acute extremity pain who were discharged home from the ED, comparing a 3-day supply of oral hydrocodone/acetaminophen (5 mg/500 mg) to oral codeine/acetaminophen (30 mg/300 mg). Pain was measured on a valid and reproducible verbal numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10, and patients were contacted by telephone approximately 24 hours after being discharged. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in improvement in pain at 2 hours following the most recent ingestion of the study drug, relative to the time of phone contact after ED discharge. Secondary outcomes compared side-effect profiles and patient satisfaction.

Results

The median time from ED discharge to follow-up was 26 hours (interquartile range [IQR] = 24 to 39 hours). The mean NRS pain score before the most recent dose of pain medication after ED discharge was 7.6 NRS units for both groups. The mean decrease in pain scores 2 hours after pain medications were taken were 3.9 NRS units in the hydrocodone/acetaminophen group versus 3.5 NRS units in the codeine/acetaminophen group, for a difference of 0.4 NRS units (95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.3 to 1.2 NRS units). No differences were found in side effects or patient satisfaction.

Conclusions

Both medications decreased NRS pain scores by approximately 50%. However, the oral hydrocodone/acetaminophen failed to provide clinically or statistically superior pain relief compared to oral codeine/acetaminophen when prescribed to patients discharged from the ED with acute extremity pain. Similarly, there were no clinically or statistically important differences in side-effect profiles or patient satisfaction. If the DEA reclassifies hydrocodone as a Schedule II narcotic, as recently recommended by its advisory board, our data suggest that the codeine/acetaminophen may be a clinically reasonable Schedule III substitute for hydrocodone/acetaminophen at ED discharge. These findings should be regarded as tentative and require independent validation in similar and other acute pain models.

2.1 General Dosing Information

Acetaminophen Injection may be given as a single or repeated dose for the treatment of acute pain or fever. No dose adjustment is required when converting between oral acetaminophen and Acetaminophen Injection dosing in adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg and above. Calculated maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is based on all routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral, and rectal) and all products containing acetaminophen. Exceeding the maximum mg/kg daily dose of acetaminophen as described in Tables 1 to 3 may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death. To avoid the risk of overdose, ensure that the total amount of acetaminophen from all routes and from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended dose.

2.2 Recommended Dosage: Adults and Adolescents

Adults and adolescents weighing 50 kg and over: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 1,000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 1,000 mg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 4,000 mg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

Adults and adolescents weighing under 50 kg: the recommended dosage of Acetaminophen Injection is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single-dose of Acetaminophen Injection of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

2.3 Recommended Dosage: Children

### Tramadol hydrochloride [^113YRVjK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Tramadol hydrochloride tablets has been given in single oral doses of 50, 75 and 100 mg to patients with pain following surgical procedures and pain following oral surgery (extraction of impacted molars).

In single-dose models of pain following oral surgery, pain relief was demonstrated in some patients at doses of 50 mg and 75 mg. A dose of 100 mg tramadol hydrochloride tablets tended to provide analgesia superior to codeine sulfate 60 mg, but it was not as effective as the combination of aspirin 650 mg with codeine phosphate 60 mg.

Tramadol hydrochloride tablets has been studied in three long-term controlled trials involving a total of 820 patients, with 530 patients receiving tramadol hydrochloride tablets. Patients with a variety of chronic painful conditions were studied in double-blind trials of one to three months duration. Average daily doses of approximately 250 mg of tramadol hydrochloride tablets in divided doses were generally comparable to five doses of acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg (TYLENOL with Codeine #3) daily, five doses of aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg daily, or two to three doses of acetaminophen 500 mg with oxycodone hydrochloride 5 mg (TYLOX) daily.

Titration Trials

In a randomized, blinded clinical study with 129 to 132 patients per group, a 10-day titration to a daily tramadol hydrochloride tablets dose of 200 mg (50 mg four times per day), attained in 50 mg increments every 3 days, was found to result in fewer discontinuations due to dizziness or vertigo than titration over only 4 days or no titration. In a second study with 54 to 59 patients per group, patients who had nausea or vomiting when titrated over 4 days were randomized to re-initiate tramadol hydrochloride tablets therapy using slower titration rates.

A 16-day titration schedule, starting with 25 mg every morning and using additional doses in 25 mg increments every third day to 100 mg/day (25 mg four times per day), followed by 50 mg increments in the total daily dose every third day to 200 mg/day (50 mg four times per day), resulted in fewer discontinuations due to nausea or vomiting and fewer discontinuations due to any cause than did a 10-day titration schedule.

### The FDA acetaminophen advisory committee meeting-what is the future of acetaminophen in the United States? The perspective of a committee member [^113kHyvB]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Unintentional acetaminophen toxicity is a common problem throughout the world but particularly in the more developed countries. To deal with the problem, several countries have attempted to decrease the risk of acetaminophen overdose by reducing package sizes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convened a joint meeting recently of three Advisory Committees to consider the issue of unintentional acetaminophen-related toxicity and to explore strategies to address the problem.

Proposals and Recommendations

Three strategies addressed the issue of dose reduction as a way to decrease morbidity and mortality. The FDA proposed a decrease in the maximum daily dose from 4,000 to 3,250 mg, reducing the maximum individual dose from 1,000 to 650 mg and relegating 500 mg tablets to prescription status. The Committees voted in favor of each of those initiatives. Restricting the number of doses that could be purchased by regulating package sizes, as has been done in some European countries, was proposed, but rejected by the Committees. Proposals also addressed the elimination of nonprescription and prescription acetaminophen combination products (e.g., multi-symptom cold relief combinations and acetaminophen/opioid combinations) as a strategy to decrease unintentional poisoning when individuals unknowingly take different products, all of which contain acetaminophen. The Committees rejected the proposal to eliminate the nonprescription combinations but recommended the elimination of prescription combination products. Currently, liquid acetaminophen is available in the United States in three different concentrations. To reduce the confusion associated with the variance in concentrations the Committees voted to have a single concentration for all acetaminophen liquid products. Finally, the Committees voted, almost unanimously, to encourage the FDA to place a boxed warning in the product information to create awareness among prescribers and pharmacists about acetaminophen toxicity and to educate their patients accordingly.

Conclusions

Many of the recommendations were not evidence-based but instead have an anecdotal basis. However, the Committees are advisory to the FDA, their recommendations are not binding and it remains to be seen which of the recommendations will be implemented.

2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

2.1 General Dosing Information

OFIRMEV may be given as a single or repeated dose for the treatment of acute pain or fever. No dose adjustment is required when converting between oral acetaminophen and OFIRMEV dosing in adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg and above. Calculated maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is based on all routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral, and rectal) and all products containing acetaminophen. Exceeding the maximum mg/kg daily dose of acetaminophen as described in Tables 1–3 may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death. To avoid the risk of overdose, ensure that the total amount of acetaminophen from all routes and from all sources does not exceed the maximum recommended dose.

2.2 Recommended Dosage: Adults and Adolescents

Adults and adolescents weighing 50 kg and over: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 1000 mg every 6 hours or 650 mg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of OFIRMEV of 1000 mg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 4000 mg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

Adults and adolescents weighing under 50 kg: the recommended dosage of OFIRMEV is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours or 12.5 mg/kg every 4 hours, with a maximum single dose of OFIRMEV of 15 mg/kg, a minimum dosing interval of 4 hours, and a maximum daily dose of acetaminophen of 75 mg/kg per day (includes all routes of administration and all acetaminophen-containing products including combination products).

### An updated review on the metabolite (AM404)-mediated central mechanism of action of paracetamol (acetaminophen): experimental evidence and potential clinical impact [^112AdWeb]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The maximum single dose of paracetamol for pain or fever treatment is 1 g every 4–6 hours as needed, up to a recommended maximum daily dose of 4 g. It is well established that paracetamol is clinically effective under the recommended daily dose and has a well-tolerable safety profile. Paracetamol-related adverse events are rare in healthy adults receiving a daily dose of ≤ 4 g/day. Thus, several guidelines recommend paracetamol as an optimal option for mild-to-moderate pain conditions, such as headache and migraine attacks, postoperative pain and chronic osteoarthritis for limited duration of treatment (however, with some discrepancies here, according to guidelines).

Interestingly, the analgesic effect of paracetamol has a distinct dose-response, according to experimental models and consumers' experience. The French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) recommended initiating paracetamol with the minimum dose. In a recent focus review, studies comparing the analgesic response to higher (1 g) and lower (500–650 mg) doses of paracetamol were retrieved and summarized. Both direct and indirect comparisons demonstrated analgesic superiority of higher single dose compared to lower single doses, highlighting that a higher single dose of paracetamol for a short duration (4–5 days) poses more benefit than lower single doses. This observation is consistent with the successful experimental demonstration in healthy volunteers of a lack of acetaminophen ceiling effect on R-III nociceptive flexion reflex. In terms of safety, a Cochrane review concluded that the rate of adverse events was similar between the higher and lower single doses of paracetamol. This was in line with another clinical trial showing similar rates of treatment-related adverse events between the higher and lower single doses of paracetamol.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^112v8aUY]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acetaminophen overdose:

- **Definition**: Acetaminophen overdose is defined as the ingestion of a dose of acetaminophen that exceeds the recommended limit, typically > 4 g within a 24-hour period or excessive doses over several days.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acetaminophen overdose involves its action as a dose-dependent hepatotoxin, causing acute pericentral liver injury. Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver, and in overdose situations, its toxic metabolite can cause hepatocellular necrosis. In some cases, renal insufficiency can also occur, attributed to cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase isoenzymes present in the kidney.
- **Epidemiology**: In 2021, US poison control centers recorded over 80,000 cases related to acetaminophen products. The incidence of acetaminophen overdose in Iceland is estimated at 16 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of acetaminophen overdose can include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, mental status changes. Hepatotoxicity is indicated by elevated liver enzymes, and in severe cases, it can lead to ALF, characterized by encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The severity of liver damage, as indicated by laboratory tests such as serum transaminases and coagulation profile, is a key determinant of prognosis. The prognosis in acetaminophen-related ALF is related to the degree of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and acidosis.

Rumack-Matthew nomogram — risk stratification timing, categories, limitations, and repeated supratherapeutic ingestion criteria are outlined: it is "a tool used to stratify patients at risk for hepatotoxicity after a single acute acetaminophen ingestion at a known point in time", and a serum level "taken after 4 hours and before 24 hours postingestion" is plotted to classify "no risk, possible risk, or probable risk", which "is often used to determine whether or not NAC is indicated". Although "some experts will use the nomogram to stratify patients with multiple ingestions within an 8-hour period", patients with "delayed presentation (> 24 hours after ingestion), an unknown time or duration of ingestion, ingestion of extended-release preparation, or a repeated supratherapeutic ingestion cannot be risk stratified". Repeated supratherapeutic ingestions involve multiple doses "during a period of greater than 8 hours" with "a cumulative dosage of greater than 4 g per 24 hours", and two case series reported "approximately 30%" of admitted overdose patients had such patterns, which were associated with "a worse prognosis than patients admitted after acute overdose".

### Initial and subsequent dosing of rectal acetaminophen in children: a 24-hour pharmacokinetic study of new dose recommendations [^113haUo1]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have determined that an initial rectal acetaminophen dose of approximately 40 mg/kg is needed in children to achieve target antipyretic serum concentrations. The timing and amount of subsequent doses after a 40-mg/kg dose has not been clarified for this route of administration. Based on the authors' previous pharmacokinetic data, they examined whether a 40-mg/kg loading dose followed by 20-mg/kg doses at 6-h intervals maintain serum concentrations within the target range of 10–20 microg/ml, without evidence of accumulation.

Methods

Children (n = 16) received rectal acetaminophen (40 mg/kg) and up to three additional doses of 20 mg/kg at 6-h intervals. Venous blood samples were taken every 30 min for 4 h, then every 60 min for 4 h, and every 4 h for 16 h. The authors assessed whether their published pharmacokinetic parameters predicted the acetaminophen concentrations in the present study. They also assessed their dosing regimen by determining the fraction of time each individual maintained the target concentration.

Results

All patients received the initial loading dose; 10 of 16 patients received three subsequent doses. Serum concentrations with the initial dose were in the target range 38 ± 25% of the time. With subsequent dosing, the target range was maintained 60 ± 29% of the time. The highest serum concentration with initial or subsequent dosing was 38.6 microg/ml. Pharmacokinetic parameters from the earlier study predicted the serum concentrations observed for both initial and subsequent doses.

Conclusions

A rectal acetaminophen loading dose of 40 mg/kg followed by 20-mg/kg doses every 6 h results in serum concentrations centered at the target range of 10–20 microg/ml. There was large interindividual variability in pharmacokinetic characteristics. There was no evidence of accumulation during the 24-h sampling period.

### Benzhydrocodone and acetaminophen (Apadaz) [^116FZ5jP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

APADAZ should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of APADAZ for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
The total dosage of APADAZ and any concomitant acetaminophen-containing products should not exceed 4000 mg of acetaminophen in a 24-hour period.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with APADAZ. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### An integrated safety analysis of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen (maxigesic / combogesic) in adults [^116DTuCc]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

APAP and IBP are two analgesic compounds with a long history of use, and both are considered safe and well tolerated at maximum recommended OTC daily doses. The major safety risks of APAP (hepatic injury) and IBP (gastric bleeding and thromboembolic) are largely related to dose. Using a combination addresses these risks by providing superior analgesia without transgressing daily OTC dose limits. Combinations containing APAP and IBP are beneficial as there is less opportunity for drug interactions due to their distinct metabolic pathways. Providing an FDC without an opioid also limits the risk of overdosing, as patients attempt to increase their opioid intake due to tolerance and dependence.

Clinical safety data obtained from clinical trials with both the FDC 325/97.5 and the FDC 500/150 demonstrate the safety and tolerability of an FDC of APAP and IBP at or below maximum OTC daily doses of 4,000 mg, and in the case of IBP, well below maximum daily dose of 2,400 mg. This is supported by safety data from a variety of FDC formulations reported previously, including a large meta-analysis of the literature. When taken at full doses, the cumulative daily consumption of APAP and IBP from the FDC 325/97.5 is 97.5% of that from the FDC 500/150. This permitted the pooling of data for the analysis of safety. Among a pooled safety population of 922 patients, 521 AEs were reported. Data from these 922 subjects demonstrated that the superior analgesic efficacy obtained by combining APAP and IBP did not come at the expense of safety or tolerability. During the double-blind period (24–48 hours), treatment with the FDC did not increase the incidence of AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, or the proportion of subjects experiencing at least one AE relative to either monotherapy group or placebo. There was no increase in the percentage of AEs deemed possibly or probably related to the study medication. The FDC did not differ in the percentage of AEs rated as severe. The incidence of common AEs was also unchanged. The FDC did not alter the rates of GI AEs or postoperative bleeding compared with either monotherapy or placebo. There were also no appreciable changes to hemoglobin and liver biochemistry levels compared to the APAP monotherapy during the open-label phase of one study (AFT-MX-6E). The additional analgesia provided by the FDC does not come at the cost of a reduction in tolerability. The FDC provides a well tolerated and effective means of analgesia for mild–moderate pain, which can be used as an alternative or adjunct to opioid use post surgery.

### Relation of health literacy to exceeding the labeled maximum daily dose of acetaminophen [^116aq4Hx]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen is a commonly used analgesic/antipyretic; overdoses can lead to liver damage. Little is known about the relationship of health literacy to exceeding the recommended maximum daily dose (4 g).

Methods

Subjects were recruited at 23 U.S. malls in 2011. Health literacy was measured by Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), classified as very low (VLL, score < 45); low (LL, 45–60); or adequate (AL, > 60). Participants completed a 7-day acetaminophen use diary by daily telephone interview; an exit interview covered demographics, physical/mental health, medical history, medication label reading, and medication-taking knowledge/attitudes. Acetaminophen products were identified from a comprehensive list; subjects were not required to know their medications contained acetaminophen. Seven hundred fifty-six subjects aged ≥ 18 years had taken acetaminophen in the past 30 days and completed 7 diary days with ≥ 1 day of acetaminophen use, plus the exit survey. Analysis was conducted in 2012–2014.

Results

VLL were more likely than AL individuals to exceed 4 g on ≥ 1 day (OR [95% CI] = 3.8 [1.5, 9.6]; 4.0 [1.3, 12] after controlling for five REALM score-related factors). On usage days, VLL individuals were also more likely to exceed 4 g (3.3 [1.1, 10], by generalized estimating equations; 2.4 [0.9, 6.6], direct effect after accounting for mediation by other deviations from label recommendations).

Conclusions

VLL individuals exceed the recommended maximum acetaminophen dose more often than AL individuals. Other identified characteristics related to health literacy do not explain this, but it is partly mediated by increased frequency of other label deviations.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112dgYFH]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115bZfD2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs. However, experts agreed there is a need for thresholds as benchmarks and suggested including them in the supporting text after the main recommendation statement. Experts also agreed with separating recommendations on dosage into a recommendation applying to patients starting opioids and patients already receiving opioids.

When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8). The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). For example, a label for hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg) and acetaminophen (300 mg) states that the usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every 4–6 hours as needed for pain, and the total daily dosage should not exceed eight tablets. Clinicians should use additional caution when initiating opioids for patients aged ≥ 65 years and patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of a potentially smaller therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and overdose (see Recommendation 8). Formulations with lower opioid doses (e.g. hydrocodone bitartrate 2.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) are available and can facilitate dosing when additional caution is needed. Product labeling regarding tolerance includes guidance for patients already taking opioids. In addition to opioids, clinicians should consider cumulative dosages of other medications, such as acetaminophen, that are combined with opioids in many formulations and for which decreased clearance of medications might result in accumulation of medications to toxic levels.

### National poison center calls before vs after availability of high-dose acetaminophen (paracetamol) tablets in Switzerland [^115nQMPQ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is an antipyretic and analgesic drug with a weak anti-inflammatory action. Since its clinical introduction in 1955, acetaminophen has become the most widely used analgesic-antipyreticand accounts for nearly half of all pain medication prescriptions in Switzerland. Worldwide, acetaminophen is widely available via prescription or over the counter (OTC), with the most common formulations being 500-mg and 1000-mg oral tablets. The therapeutic dose for those aged 12 years and older is 1000 mg every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 4000 mg. Among children younger than 12 years, weight-based dosing is recommended (ie, 10–15 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours), with a maximum daily dose of 75 mg/kg. When used within this therapeutic dosage, acetaminophen is considered among the safest pain medications available. As such, it is indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain and/or fever. However, daily doses exceeding the therapeutic maximum can cause hepatoxicity, and severe toxic effects can occur with doses exceeding 10 000 mg in adults or 150 to 200 mg/kg in children.

In many Western countries, acetaminophen poisoning is the leading cause of liver failure, and researchers have identified that prolonged exposure to high daily doses can increase the risk of liver failure and death. Thus, in light of the limited evidence of a clinical benefit for musculoskeletal conditions, headache and migraine, or dental pain, concerns regarding the benefit-risk profile of acetaminophen have been raised. In August 2020, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) released draft guidance on chronic pain management, in which acetaminophen (paracetamol) is no longer recommended because of its unfavorable benefit-risk profile.

Access to high doses of acetaminophen may increase the risk of unintentional poisonings owing to a combination of underestimating the risks and lack of clinical effect in pain management, leading to up-dosing. Several studies have linked OTC acetaminophen availability to higher acetaminophen-related inquiries to poison information centers and acetaminophen-related mortality. As a result, many European countries — including the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden — have implemented pack size restrictions for OTC sales. However, changes in legislations for OTC restrictions have so far only identified modest reductions in mortality and poisonings in some regions, and the association with liver transplantation remains limited.

Table 5 — pharmacologic management of pain (acetaminophen/paracetamol) details first-line use, dosing, and hepatotoxicity cautions: Adults and adolescents oral dosing is 325 to 650 mg every 4 to 6 h as needed or 1000 mg every 6 h as needed; maximum dose 4000 mg/day. Intravenous (IV) dosing for ≥ 50 kg is 650 mg every 4 h or 1000 mg every 6 h; maximum single dose 1000 mg/dose; maximum daily dose 4000 mg/day, and for < 50 kg is 12.5 mg/kg every 4 h or 15 mg/kg every 6 h; maximum single dose 15 mg/kg/dose (≤ 750 mg/dose); maximum daily dose 75 mg/kg/day (≤ 3750 mg/day). Children oral dosing is 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose every 4 to 6 h as needed; do not exceed 5 doses in 24 h; maximum daily dose 75 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 4000 mg/day); IV for < 50 kg follows 12.5 mg/kg every 4 h or 15 mg/kg every 6 h as needed; maximum single dose 15 mg/kg/dose (≤ 750 mg/dose); maximum daily dose 75 mg/kg/day (≤ 3750 mg/day). Infants/children < 2 years old have a maximum daily dose 60 mg/kg/day. The table lists acetaminophen/paracetamol as first-line pharmacologic therapy, included in many over-the-counter combination products, without anti-inflammatory activity, and notes that due to risk for hepatotoxicity some experts recommend a lower maximum dose of 3000 mg/day in adults with normal liver function when used for longer durations (> 3 days), with an even lower total daily dose (e.g., 2000 mg/day) or avoidance preferred for specified risk factors.

Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity — diagnosis and management for intentional versus unintentional overdose are contrasted by timing, dose patterns, coingestants, laboratory features, and treatments. Time course differs as "Single time point" versus "Several days of repeated use", and dosing descriptions include "Supratherapeutic (typically > 4 g over 24 h)" and "Repeated therapeutic (up to 4 g per day) or supratherapeutic dosing". Intentional cases show "24–72 h: rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L… total bilirubin is typically < 10 mg/dL" with peaks at "72–96 h", while unintentional cases are often delayed but still have a "rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L". Risk assessment states to "Use modified Rumack-Matthew nomogram to estimate risk of hepatotoxicity", whereas in repeated-use cases levels are "Often undetectable at initial presentation" and "APAP-protein adducts useful but assay not commercially available". Gastrointestinal decontamination for intentional overdose includes "Activated charcoal (1 g/kg, max dose 50 g) if within 4 h of ingestion", whereas for unintentional overdose it is "Usually not helpful nor recommended". N-acetylcysteine regimens include oral "140 mg/kg load followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 h" and intravenous dosing with "150 mg/kg load over 15–60 min, followed by 50 mg/kg (12.5 mg/kg/h)… then 100 mg/kg (6.25 mg/kg/h) over 16 h (overall total 300 mg/kg over 24 h)", with continuation "at 6.25 mg/kg/h until ALT is decreasing and INR is < 2". For acute liver failure risk, the table advises "Close monitoring in intensive care unit and consider prompt referral to a liver transplant center". Coingestants differ, with "Diphenhydramine and other sedatives" in intentional cases and "Opioids often used in combination" in unintentional cases.
