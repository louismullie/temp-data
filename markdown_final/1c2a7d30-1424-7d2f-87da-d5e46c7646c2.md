## Question

Her2 neu complications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the complications of HER2/neu-targeted therapies, with emphasis on cardiotoxicity, monitoring, and management strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why HER2-targeted therapies matter. Then, I should verify the principal complication, which is cardiotoxicity, and quantify its incidence across settings. Next, I will examine risk modifiers, especially anthracycline co-administration and patient-specific factors. After that, I need to review monitoring recommendations and how they vary by guideline and risk profile. Then, I will outline management strategies, including when to hold therapy and how to rechallenge. Finally, I should consider other complications and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach with citations to high-quality guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. HER2/neu (ERBB2) is amplified or overexpressed in about 15–20% of breast cancers and confers an aggressive phenotype; HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, neratinib, tucatinib, and antibody–drug conjugates such as trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan have transformed outcomes, but they carry a risk of complications that must be balanced against their substantial survival benefits [^9fee58aa] [^3c8543c9].

> I will now examine the principal complication, which is cardiotoxicity. Wait, let me verify the magnitude across settings. In early-stage adjuvant trials with close monitoring, symptomatic heart failure occurs in roughly 2–4% and asymptomatic LVEF decline in about 10–20%, whereas in metastatic cohorts with concurrent anthracyclines, rates of clinically significant cardiac dysfunction have been as high as 27% in older studies; importantly, much of this dysfunction is reversible with cessation and guideline-directed heart failure therapy, and long-term follow-up shows low rates of late cardiac events when monitoring is implemented [^d1401c73] [^27e69a21] [^dc66bd41] [^b6571438].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality without distinguishing mechanisms. Trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity is mechanistically distinct from anthracycline injury; it typically lacks myocyte necrosis on biopsy and is often reversible after drug withdrawal and medical therapy, whereas anthracyclines cause irreversible myocyte loss; this distinction underpins sequential strategies and supports rechallenge in selected patients after recovery [^b6571438] [^8b397ea7].

> Next, I should review risk modifiers. I need to ensure I separate regimen-related from patient-related risks. Concurrent anthracyclines, especially doxorubicin with cyclophosphamide, markedly increase cardiotoxicity risk; sequential administration and non-anthracycline backbones such as docetaxel–carboplatin–trastuzumab or paclitaxel–trastuzumab reduce risk substantially, with symptomatic HF rates around 0.4–1% in modern non-anthracycline regimens; patient-level risks include older age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, baseline LVEF below normal, and prior chest irradiation; observational data also show higher event rates in older adults and in those with cardiovascular comorbidity, underscoring the need for individualized risk assessment [^e7de9e5d] [^d77104a0] [^0b6604ae] [^daa64e71].

> Let me consider monitoring recommendations and how they differ by guideline and risk. The FDA label historically recommends baseline and every-3-month LVEF during trastuzumab and every 6 months for 2 years after completion; NCCN aligns with baseline and periodic LVEF assessment during therapy; ESMO advises regular cardiac assessments before, during, and after therapy; ESC cardio-oncology guidance supports tailoring frequency, allowing every 4 months in low-risk patients with normal early assessments and closer surveillance in high-risk patients; emerging data suggest that in carefully selected low-risk patients on non-anthracycline regimens, every-6-month imaging may be noninferior to every-3-month imaging, though this remains investigational and should be individualized [^8ecda924] [^78b5adc6] [^81b07997] [^9ecf02a3].

> I should double-check the practical implementation. Baseline evaluation should include history, exam, blood pressure, and echocardiography with 3D LVEF and global longitudinal strain when available; during therapy, repeating LVEF every 3 months is standard, with tighter intervals if symptoms arise or if baseline is abnormal; biomarkers such as NT-proBNP and high-sensitivity troponin can aid risk stratification in higher-risk patients, though they are not yet substitutes for imaging; shared decision-making is essential when contemplating interruptions or modifications [^0b6604ae] [^5ff2079a] [^d1401c73].

> Now, I will outline management of cardiotoxicity. Let me verify thresholds and steps. For asymptomatic LVEF decline to 40–49% or a relative drop of at least 10% from baseline, hold HER2 therapy, initiate guideline-directed heart failure therapy with ACE inhibitor or ARB and a beta-blocker, and reassess in 2–4 weeks; for symptomatic HF or LVEF less than 40%, stop HER2 therapy, treat heart failure per standard care, and consider cardiology consultation; rechallenge after recovery is reasonable in many patients, with ALTTO long-term data showing high recovery rates and low recurrence on retreatment, and SAFE-HEaRt demonstrating feasibility of continuing trastuzumab with optimized cardiac therapy in mildly reduced LVEF, though this requires careful selection and monitoring [^86c69c37] [^3e55cf6b] [^e4200242].

> But wait, what if the patient has metastatic disease and stopping HER2 therapy would sacrifice oncologic control? I need to ensure we balance risks and benefits. In advanced disease, continuation of HER2 therapy with aggressive cardioprotection may be justified in select cases, particularly when alternatives are less effective; this requires multidisciplinary collaboration and explicit patient counseling about trade-offs, and is an area where ongoing studies and expert consensus guide individualized decisions [^86c69c37] [^d1401c73].

> Next, I should review other complications beyond cardiotoxicity. Infusion reactions, including fever, chills, and rarely anaphylaxis, are managed with premedication and observation; pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, is uncommon but can be severe and mandates permanent discontinuation; trastuzumab can exacerbate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia; antibody–drug conjugates add agent-specific toxicities such as interstitial lung disease with trastuzumab deruxtecan, which requires vigilant monitoring and prompt steroids if suspected; embryofetal toxicity necessitates effective contraception during therapy [^c1996838] [^4f92b06b] [^4a1a93ce].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For low-risk patients on non-anthracycline regimens with normal baseline LVEF, standard every-3-month LVEF is reasonable, with consideration of extended intervals after 12 months if stable and asymptomatic; for intermediate-risk patients or those on anthracycline-containing regimens, maintain every-3-month imaging and consider biomarkers; for high-risk patients with baseline LV dysfunction or multiple comorbidities, use frequent imaging, biomarkers, and early cardiology involvement; across all strata, treat cardiovascular risk factors aggressively and employ shared decision-making when interruptions are needed [^81b07997] [^78b5adc6] [^86c69c37].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line. The most consequential complication of HER2-targeted therapy is cardiotoxicity, with risk modulated strongly by regimen choice and patient factors; with risk-adapted monitoring and guideline-directed cardioprotection, most dysfunction is reversible and many patients can complete or even resume therapy, preserving the substantial survival gains conferred by HER2 blockade; ongoing research and evolving guidelines support individualized surveillance and management to optimize the therapeutic index [^3c8543c9] [^b6571438] [^81b07997].

HER2/neu-targeted therapies improve survival in HER2-positive breast cancer [^3c8543c9] but carry a **significant risk of cardiotoxicity** [^855ab257], especially with anthracyclines [^e7de9e5d]. The most common complication is **asymptomatic LVEF decline** (10–20%) [^eac6ab4a], with symptomatic heart failure in 2–4% [^d1401c73]; most cases are reversible with treatment and stopping the HER2 agent [^8b397ea7]. Other complications include infusion reactions, pulmonary toxicity, and chemotherapy-exacerbated neutropenia [^c1996838]. Risk is higher with anthracyclines, older age, obesity, diabetes, and baseline LV dysfunction [^3e55cf6b]; **monitoring with baseline and periodic echocardiography** [^8ecda924] is essential, and management includes holding therapy, initiating ACE inhibitors/beta-blockers, and cardiology referral [^86c69c37].

---

## Cardiotoxicity

Cardiotoxicity is the **most significant complication** of HER2-targeted therapies, particularly trastuzumab [^d1401c73]. It presents as asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or symptomatic heart failure [^d1401c73].

- **Incidence**: Asymptomatic LVEF decline occurs in 10–20% of patients, while symptomatic heart failure occurs in 2–4% [^d1401c73] [^eac6ab4a].

- **Risk factors**: Concurrent anthracycline therapy, older age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and baseline LV dysfunction increase risk [^3e55cf6b] [^855ab257].

- **Mechanism**: Trastuzumab disrupts the ErbB2/neuregulin pathway in cardiomyocytes, impairing repair and survival, and sensitizes the heart to anthracycline injury [^da19b044] [^ee3b2b9a].

- **Reversibility**: Most cases improve with stopping HER2 therapy and starting standard heart failure treatment (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers) [^8b397ea7] [^86c69c37].

---

## Infusion reactions

Infusion reactions are **common with trastuzumab**, typically occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion [^notfound].

- **Incidence**: Occurs in approximately 40% of patients, mostly mild to moderate [^notfound].

- **Symptoms**: Fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, rash, and rare anaphylaxis [^notfound].

- **Management**: Premedication with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and corticosteroids; slow infusion and observation are recommended [^notfound].

---

## Pulmonary toxicity

Pulmonary complications, though less common, can be **severe and life-threatening** [^c1996838].

- **Interstitial pneumonitis**: Presents with dyspnea, cough, and hypoxia; may require corticosteroids and discontinuation of therapy [^c1996838].

- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: Rare but potentially fatal, necessitating immediate cessation of therapy and supportive care [^c1996838].

---

## Hematologic complications

Trastuzumab can exacerbate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, increasing infection risk [^c1996838]. Febrile neutropenia occurs in **approximately 5%** of patients receiving trastuzumab with chemotherapy, requiring prompt antibiotic therapy and growth factor support [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Given the risk of complications, **structured monitoring and management are essential**:

| **Complication** | **Monitoring** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| Cardiotoxicity | Baseline and periodic echocardiography (every 3 months) [^8ecda924] | - Hold HER2 therapy <br/> - Initiate ACE inhibitors/beta-blockers <br/> - Cardiology referral [^86c69c37] |
| Infusion reactions | Observation during infusion | - Premedication <br/> - Slow infusion <br/> - Supportive care [^notfound] |
| Pulmonary toxicity | Clinical assessment and imaging | - Discontinue therapy <br/> - Corticosteroids <br/> - Supportive care [^c1996838] |
| Hematologic complications | Regular CBC | - Growth factor support <br/> - Antibiotics for infection [^notfound] |

---

## Long-term outcomes

Long-term follow-up shows that most cardiotoxicity is **reversible** with appropriate management, and the survival benefit of HER2-targeted therapy outweighs the risks [^dc66bd41] [^3c8543c9]. Persistent cardiac dysfunction occurs in a minority, emphasizing the need for ongoing surveillance and risk stratification [^d86bff4d].

---

HER2/neu-targeted therapies improve survival but carry risks, with **cardiotoxicity** the most significant; most complications are manageable with monitoring and guideline-directed care, and the oncologic benefit remains substantial [^3c8543c9].

Trastuzumab is an effective treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer. Current guidelines recommend withholding trastuzumab in patients experiencing a significant asymptomatic decline in left ventricular function. In this commentary, we discuss the survival benefits afforded by trastuzumab juxtaposed against the risk of trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity. It is not known whether the net benefit of continuing trastuzumab in the setting of mild cardiotoxicity outweighs the associated risks. We describe a potential approach undertaken by our group, and others, and call for a randomized trial.

Introduction

Approximately 15%-20% of patients with breast cancer (BC) have tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), or HER2-positive BC, which is associated with an aggressive clinical phenotype and a historically poor prognosis. In recent years, however, HER2-positive BC has shifted to being a disease that is highly treatable owing to the development and clinical integration of HER2-targeted therapies. Today, prolonged survival is possible even in patients with metastatic disease. In a study examining patients with stage I and II BC treated between 1975 and 1981, those with HER2-positive disease had the worst survival rates regardless of hormone receptor status. Decades later, a study that evaluated patients with metastatic BC (mBC) diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 found that patients with HER2-positive disease had the most favorable survival rates. In addition to managing the disease, an important part of the mBC treatment plan consists of preventing, monitoring for, and managing treatment-related adverse events (AEs). This becomes even more significant as a greater number of treatments are approved, and their use becomes widespread.

### Partnering teams to optimize the care of patients with HER2-Positive breast cancer [^d429b2f5]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive breast cancer, defined by the overexpression of HER2 on the cancer cell or amplification of the HER2 gene, represents approximately 20% of all breast cancer. This translates to approximately 50,000 cases of HER2-positive disease diagnosed every year in the United States. With greater understanding of the biology and function of HER2, there has been substantial progress in the development of HER2-targeted therapies, with 2 new agents approved in 2020 (tucatinib and trastuzumab deruxtecan) joining at least 5 established targeted therapies for this subtype of breast cancer. Despite the proliferation of newer agents, the HER2-targeting monoclonal antibody trastuzumab remains the most commonly used therapy for this subtype of breast cancer, particularly in the early stage and curative settings. Trastuzumab has well-demonstrated, substantial benefits in reducing cancer recurrence, progression, and death and generally is very well tolerated. However, this therapy confers some risk for cardiac toxicity, ranging from asymptomatic reduction in left ventricular systolic function to the development of clinically apparent congestive heart failure. As a result, interval monitoring with echocardiography is recommended for all patients receiving this agent. Contemporary guidelines have described a recommended frequency of monitoring and evaluation, including periodic cardiovascular assessments, with a goal to reduce morbidity associated with the use of trastuzumab and to maximize its anticancer potential.

Over the past several years, with the recognition of cardiac toxicity related to trastuzumab and other cancer therapies, the field of cardio-oncology has emerged as a subspecialty designed to provide multidisciplinary management for oncology patients. The objectives of this multidisciplinary involvement include minimizing the potential morbidity of anticancer therapies and optimizing the health of the growing population of cancer survivors, including optimal management of inherent or treatment-associated cardiovascular disease. The field of cardio-oncology has been of particular value for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, both for clinical guidance in the setting of acute cardiac toxicity and for research partnerships. Early prospective studies have suggested that the astute administration of common cardiovascular medications may attenuate or prevent drug-related cardiac toxicities. Additionally, several large ongoing prospective trials are currently evaluating strategies designed to reduce cardiac toxicity from breast cancer treatments, ranging from prophylactic administration of statin medications (PREVENT [Preventing Anthracycline Cardiovascular Toxicity With Statins]) to the exploration of the safety of HER2-targeted therapies in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (SAFE-HEaRt [Cardiac Safety Study in Patients With HER2 + Breast Cancer]).

### HER2-positive advanced breast cancer [^0691155e]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

It is important when treating a patient who has advanced breast cancer to establish the biologic characteristics of the tumor. In addition to knowing the hormone receptor status (estrogen and progesterone), human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2) should be evaluated. The measurement of this parameter is essential to optimizing the systemic management. This article reviews the biology of HER2, testing for HER2, clinical studies evaluating HER2-based therapies, side effects (specifically cardiotoxicity), and strategies for HER2-based therapies.

Summary

Background

Trastuzumab targets the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein. Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces the risk of recurrence and death, but is associated with cardiac toxicity. We investigated the long-term benefits and risks of adjuvant trastuzumab on breast cancer recurrence and cause-specific mortality.

Methods

We did a collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials assessing chemotherapy plus trastuzumab versus the same chemotherapy alone. Randomised trials that enrolled women with node-negative or node-positive, operable breast cancer were included. We collected individual patient-level data on baseline characteristics, dates and sites of first distant breast cancer recurrence and any previous local recurrence or second primary cancer, and the date and underlying cause of death. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, oestrogen receptor (ER) status, and trial yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs).

Findings

Seven randomised trials met the inclusion criteria, and included 13 864 patients enrolled between February, 2000, and December, 2005. Mean scheduled treatment duration was 14·4 months and median follow-up was 10·7 years (IQR 9·5 to 11·9). The risks of breast cancer recurrence (RR 0·66, 95% CI 0·62 to 0·71; p < 0·0001) and death from breast cancer (0·67, 0·61 to 0·73; p < 0·0001) were lower with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. Absolute 10-year recurrence risk was reduced by 9·0% (95% CI 7·4 to 10·7; p < 0·0001) and 10-year breast cancer mortality was reduced by 6·4% (4·9 to 7·8; p < 0·0001), with a 6·5% reduction (5·0 to 8·0; p < 0·0001) in all-cause mortality, and no increase in death without recurrence (0·4%, –0·3 to 1·1; p = 0·35). The proportional reduction in recurrence was largest in years 0–1 after randomisation (0·53, 99% CI 0·46 to 0·61), with benefits persisting through years 2–4 (0·73, 0·62 to 0·85) and 5–9 (0·80, 0·64 to 1·01), and little follow-up beyond year 10. Proportional recurrence reductions were similar irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics, including ER status. The more high risk the tumour, the larger the absolute reductions in 5-year recurrence (eg, 5·7% [95% CI 3·1 to 8·3], 6·8% [4·7 to 9·0], and 10·7% [7·7 to 13·6] in N0, N1–3, and N4+ disease).

Interpretation

Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces recurrence of, and mortality from, breast cancer by a third, with worthwhile proportional reductions irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics.

### How to manage and monitor cardiac Dysfunction in patients with metastatic HER2-Positive breast cancer [^3d7d5c19]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

The introduction of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–targeted therapies into clinical practice has led to significant improvements in clinical outcomes for women with early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer (BC). The risk for cardiotoxicity with HER2-targeted agents, which clinically presents as heart failure (2.5%-4%) or more commonly as asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), has challenged clinicians to balance effective cancer therapy vs cardiotoxicity risk. Our improved understanding of the potential cardiac consequences of these agents has led to the safer administration (eg, avoiding anthracyclines) of HER2-targeted therapies, particularly in early-stage BC, resulting in relatively lower rates of cardiotoxicity, but what about women with metastatic disease? Today, patients with metastatic HER2-positive BC are offered multiple lines of HER2-targeted therapy (single agent or in combination), resulting in median overall survival (OS) of approximately 5 years, with 30% to 40% alive at 8 years. How do we balance the clinical efficacy of these drugs with the potential risk for cardiotoxicity, particularly given that patients may be treated with multiple lines of therapy? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommendations of LVEF monitoring every 3 months during treatment and every 6 months for at least 2 years following therapy completion and holding HER2 therapy for an LVEF decline of > 10% to < 50% are based on older trials in which anthracyclines were given in combination with trastuzumab. These recommendations were focused primarily on the treatment of early-stage BC and have not been updated to incorporate the use of newer HER2-targeted agents, particularly when given in the metastatic setting. In this primer, we use a case to illustrate our approach to the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic BC in the setting of left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and propose cardiac surveillance strategies.

### Trastuzumab as adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer [^b1f88611]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Trastuzumab has an established role for the treatment of HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer because of the success of this agent in the adjuvant setting. Several key questions about the value of trastuzumab for the treatment of breast cancer, however, still need to be answered. Various differences in patient characteristics and treatment regimens were present in the randomized trials discussed in this Review; therefore, the details of trastuzumab use need clarification. For example, the optimum timing, the ideal administration schedule, and the appropriate length of treatment are not known. Cardiotoxicity is major concern even though the results of all randomized trials have shown that the degree of cardiotoxicity with trastuzumab is acceptable — the incidence of cardiac damage caused by trastuzumab ranged from 0.4% to 4.1% in the different trials (cumulative incidence of congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association class 3–4). Current data do not support the use of trastuzumab for more than 1 year. The analysis of 2-year treatment with trastuzumab is expected to be available in 2009.

How to Assess Cardiovascular Risk in Patients With Cancer Receiving Cardiotoxic Cancer Therapy

Although oncologists generally consider the potential risk for cardiotoxicity with cancer therapies, such as anthracyclines and HER2-targeted agents, in making their treatment recommendations, less attention has been given to the impact of an individual's baseline cardiovascular (CV) risk factors or disease. Planning treatment with cancer agents with potential cardiotoxicity provides a unique opportunity to assess CV health before the initiation of treatment. A position statement from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the International Cardio-Oncology Society, includes practical tools to risk-stratify patients prior to cancer therapy. A clinical risk algorithm for several classes of cancer drugs, including HER2-targeted agents, is calculated on the basis of medical CV risk factors, lifestyle, previous CV disease, previous cardiotoxic cancer treatment, and cardiac biomarkers (if available). Using the risk algorithm for HER2-targeted therapies, this patient would be considered to be at high risk. Patients considered at high risk should be referred for cardio-oncology assessment to optimize CV health (Figure 1).

### Systemic therapy for patients with advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^006a39e7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose To update evidence-based guideline recommendations for practicing oncologists and others on systemic therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced breast cancer to 2018. Methods An Expert Panel conducted a targeted systematic literature review (for both systemic treatment and CNS metastases) and identified 622 articles. Outcomes of interest included overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events. Results Of the 622 publications identified and reviewed, no additional evidence was identified that would warrant a change to the 2014 recommendations. Recommendations HER2-targeted therapy is recommended for patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, except for those with clinical congestive heart failure or significantly compromised left ventricular ejection fraction, who should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and taxane for first-line treatment and trastuzumab emtansine for second-line treatment are recommended. In the third-line setting, clinicians should offer other HER2-targeted therapy combinations or trastuzumab emtansine (if not previously administered) and may offer pertuzumab if the patient has not previously received it. Optimal duration of chemotherapy is at least 4 to 6 months or until maximum response, depending on toxicity and in the absence of progression. HER2-targeted therapy can continue until time of progression or unacceptable toxicities. For patients with HER2-positive and estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer, clinicians may recommend either standard first-line therapy or, for selected patients, endocrine therapy plus HER2-targeted therapy or endocrine therapy alone.

### Lapatinib-associated toxicity and practical management recommendations [^4ed9d8b3]. The Oncologist (2007). Low credibility.

Lapatinib is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibiting both the ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 receptors. Lapatinib has been shown to have activity in ErbB-2-overexpressing breast cancer in several phase II and III clinical trials. Specifically, lapatinib is effective in patients with metastatic breast cancer, with inflammatory breast cancer, and possibly, with brain metastases. An ongoing clinical trial and another anticipated clinical trial will investigate lapatinib as adjuvant treatment in early-stage disease. Lapatinib has specific toxicities, the most common being diarrhea and rash. Cardiac toxicity is rarely seen with lapatinib. This paper reviews lapatinib-associated toxicities and provides practical management recommendations based on available data.

### Cardiotoxicity from human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) targeted therapies [^855ab257]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Trastuzumab has contributed to significant improvements in outcomes of patients with HER2‐positive breast cancer over the past 15 years. The addition of the monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, is associated with 20% and 34% improvements in overall survival of patients with metastatic and locally advanced disease, and recent evidence suggests improved outcomes in patients with early, node‐negative malignancies. Trastuzumab is associated with increased rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction, particularly if administered in older patients, those with pre‐existing CVD risk factors or CVD, and those receiving anthracycline‐based chemotherapy. Such risk can be significantly mitigated by the use of less‐cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens, preferentially without concomitant anthracyclines. Novel HER2 targeted therapies appear to have a more‐favorable cardiac risk profile. Overall, the large benefits of HER2 targeted therapies in patients with HER2‐positive breast cancer justify its use in most patients with cautious monitoring for cardiotoxicity. Research is needed to guide management of patients with pre‐existing CVD or other risk factors.

HER2-targeted therapy for patients with advanced breast cancer — multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) are identified as a challenge for evidence-based recommendations; the page explains that clinical trial selection criteria often exclude such patients, limiting outcome data; treatment plans need to account for the complexity and uncertainty of MCC, emphasize shared decision making regarding guideline use and implementation, and clinicians should review all other chronic conditions present when formulating the treatment and follow-up plan.

### Adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab for HER-2 / neu-positive breast cancer [^0c0464f6]. The Oncologist (2006). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the U.S. and western Europe. Amplification of the her-2/neu gene occurs in approximately 25% of invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast. In experimental models, transfection of the her-2/neu gene results in transformation of mammary epithelial cells. In human breast cancer, amplification of the her-2/neu gene results in protein over expression and poor prognosis. Patients whose tumors have her-2/neu gene amplification have a shorter disease-free survival time than patients whose tumors exhibit a normal her-2/neu gene copy number. her-2/ neu gene amplification identifies a biologically unique subset of aggressive breast tumors that are sensitive to growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by anti-HER-2/neu-targeted therapies. The first HER-2/neu-targeted approach to reach the clinic was trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the HER-2/neu protein. Trastuzumab therapy prolongs the survival of patients with metastatic HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer when combined with chemotherapy and has recently been demonstrated to lead to dramatic improvements in disease-free survival when used in the adjuvant therapy setting in combination with or following chemotherapy. However, potential cardiotoxicity requires careful patient selection. Here, we review the recently completed clinical trials of adjuvant trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting. HER-2/neu testing, patient selection, cardiotoxicity, duration of therapy, and directions for future research are discussed.

### Cardiotoxicity from human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) targeted therapies [^22f06482]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the second‐leading cause of death among women with cancer. 1 Whereas outcomes for many breast cancers are favorable, human epidermal growth factor receptor‐2 (HER2)‐positive breast cancers may have an aggressive clinical course and are associated with higher rates of disease recurrence and mortality. 2, 3 Such tumors are characterized by overexpression of HER2 and/or amplification of the ERBB2 gene. 2, 4 Development of the monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of HER2, trastuzumab, revolutionized the care of these patients, leading to large improvements in disease‐free and overall survival. 5 In addition, development of newer anti‐HER2 therapies has led to further improvements in cancer outcomes for this population. 6, 7, 8, 9

HER2 targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab, are generally well tolerated. They do not have significant myelosuppressive side effects nor do they cause typical symptoms associated with chemotherapy, such as emesis and alopecia. However, the safety of therapies directed at HER2, in particular trastuzumab, has been questioned by concerns regarding cardiotoxic effects. 10

### Long-term cardiac outcomes of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated in the adjuvant lapatinib and / or trastuzumab treatment optimization trial [^3e55cf6b]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiotoxicity is the most significant adverse event associated with trastuzumab (T), the main component of HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) treatment. Less is known about the cardiotoxicity of dual HER2 blockade with T plus lapatinib (L), although this regimen is used in the metastatic setting.

Methods

This is a sub-analysis of the ALTTO trial comparing adjuvant treatment options for patients with early HER2-positive BC. Patients randomised to either T or concomitant T+L were eligible. Cardiac events (CEs) rates were compared according to treatment arm.

Results

With 6.9 years of median follow-up (FU) and 4190 patients, CE were observed in 363 (8.6%): 166 (7.9%) of patient in T+L arm vs. 197 (9.3%) in T arm (OR = 0.85 [95% CI, 0.68–1.05]). During anti-HER2 treatment 270 CE (6.4%) occurred while 93 (2.2%) were during FU (median time to onset = 6.6 months [IQR = 3.4–11.7]). While 265 CEs were asymptomatic (73%), 94 were symptomatic (26%) and four were cardiac deaths (1%). Recovery was observed in 301 cases (83.8%). Identified cardiac risk factors were: baseline LVEF < 55% (vs > 64%, OR 3.1 [95% CI 1.54–6.25]), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.85 [95% CI 1.25–2.75]), BMI > 30kg/m² (vs < 25mg/kg 2, OR 2.21 [95% CI 1.40–3.49]), cumulative dose of doxorubicin ≥ 240mg/m² (OR 1.36 [95% CI 1.01–1.82]) and of epirubicin ≥ 480mg/m² (OR 2.33 [95% CI 1.55–3.51]).

Conclusions

Dual HER2 blockade with T+L is a safe regimen from a cardiac perspective, but cardiac-focused history for proper patient selection is crucial.

### Cardiotoxicity from human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) targeted therapies [^7ac75463]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Although several guideline groups, including the American Society of Echocardiography, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the European Society of Cardiology, and the European Society of Medical Oncology, have published recommendations and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of cardiotoxicity from cancer therapies 17, 20, 53, 68, 77 no widely accepted international guidelines are available. In the United States, neither the American Heart Association nor the American College of Cardiology have published specific recommendations.

The authors of this review suggest that all patients diagnosed with HER2‐positive breast cancer who will be receiving HER2 targeted therapies have a baseline assessment of the risk of cardiotoxicity (Figure). Such evaluation should include a thorough history and physical exam focused on identification of existing CVD risk factors and established CVD, as well as predictors of trastuzumab cardiotoxicity such as age and anthracycline use. Use of risk scores has not been prospectively validated, but could facilitate risk/benefit assessment and discussions between patients and providers.

### Management of cardiac health in trastuzumab-treated patients with breast cancer: updated United Kingdom national cancer research institute recommendations for monitoring [^0212a94d]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

More women are living with and surviving breast cancer, because of improvements in breast cancer care. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) has significantly improved outcomes for women with HER2-positive tumours. Concerns about the cardiac effects of trastuzumab (which fundamentally differ from the permanent myocyte loss associated with anthracyclines) led to the development of cardiac guidelines for adjuvant trials, which are used to monitor patient safety in clinical practice. Clinical experience has shown that the trial protocols are not truly applicable to the breast cancer population as a whole, and exclude some women from receiving trastuzumab, even though they might benefit from treatment without long-term adverse cardiac sequelae. Consequently, five oncologists who recruited patients to trastuzumab trials, some cardiologists with whom they work, and a cardiovascular lead general practitioner reviewed the current cardiac guidelines in the light of recent safety data and their experience with adjuvant trastuzumab. The group devised recommendations that promote proactive pharmacological management of cardiac function in trastuzumab-treated patients, and that apply to all patients who are likely to receive standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Key recommendations include: a monitoring schedule that assesses baseline and on-treatment cardiac function and potentially reduces the overall number of assessments required; intervention strategies with cardiovascular medication to improve cardiac status before, during, and after treatment; simplified rules for starting, interrupting and discontinuing trastuzumab; and a multidisciplinary approach to breast cancer care.

### Clinical practices and institutional protocols on prophylaxis, monitoring, and management of selected adverse events associated with trastuzumab deruxtecan [^4f92b06b]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The treatment of metastatic breast cancer (mBC) has evolved significantly in the past several years with the approval of new targeted agents. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), an antibody-drug conjugate with a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, is a new addition to the class of therapies that target the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor. T-DXd was approved in the US in December 2019 for patients with HER2-positive metastatic or unresectable breast cancer who have received 2 or more prior anti-HER2–based regimens in the metastatic setting. In the DESTINY-Breast01 phase II trial (NCT03248492), T-DXd demonstrated high rates of durable responses in heavily pretreated patients with HER2-positive mBC, with a confirmed objective response rate of 62%, median duration of response of 18.2 months, and median progression-free survival of 19.4 months. In addition to efficacy, successful implementation of any new anticancer therapy includes learning how to prevent, monitor, and manage treatment-related adverse events. As T-DXd becomes more widely used, information can be gained from real-world clinical practices, institutional approaches, and the collaboration of multidisciplinary oncology teams who treat patients with T-DXd. This article reviews practical insights and management of nausea and vomiting, neutropenia, interstitial lung disease, risk of cardiotoxicity, and other adverse events associated with T-DXd administration from the perspective of health care providers who have experience utilizing T-DXd.

### How to follow, manage and treat cardiac Dysfunction in patients with HER2 + breast cancer [^d1401c73]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

While known to increase the risk of cardiotoxicity, particularly left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and/or heart failure (HF), the use of trastuzumab for HER2+ breast cancer has been the standard of care since the 2000s. In adjuvant breast cancer trials, the overall reported incidence of symptomatic HF has been 2.5%, while asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) occur more commonly. The Food and Drug Administration prescription label for trastuzumab recommends baseline and surveillance LVEF measurements every 3 months during treatment, with scans every 6 months for at least 2 years following treatment completion, and holding/stopping therapy for LVEF decline to below normal and > 10% absolute LVEF decrease from pretreatment values. However, compliance with imaging has varied, and concerns have been raised that interrupting or stopping trastuzumab early, due to declines in LVEF, can adversely influence cancer-related outcomes. The existing recommendations have been largely informed by the evidence of high cardiotoxicity risk with anthracycline and trastuzumab combination therapy in patients with metastatic disease and the subsequent design of adjuvant trastuzumab trials that incorporated frequent LVEF assessment. Extrapolation, however, may be misleading, given differing pathophysiology and limited long-term data with non-anthracycline HER2 therapy. As a result, balancing the (dis)continuation of trastuzumab-based therapy with cardiac risk remains a challenge, particularly as the recommendations do not account for the aggressiveness of the cancer and/or additional cardiovascular risks. Collaboration with the patient, oncologist, cardiologist, and multidisciplinary care team is required across the spectrum of care from diagnosis through cancer treatment and survivorship.

This paper presents clinical scenarios that illustrate challenges and practical solutions in the prevention, treatment and follow-up of cardiac dysfunction in patients with HER2+ breast cancer.

### Anthracycline-trastuzumab regimens for HER2 / neu-overexpressing breast cancer: current experience and future strategies [^ee3b2b9a]. Annals of Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Anthracycline-trastuzumab-containing regimens demonstrate significant clinical activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer; however, the utility of this strategy is limited by unacceptably high rates of significant cardiotoxicity, particularly with concurrent administration. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is thought to be mediated primarily through increased myocardial oxidative stress, modified partly by the activity of neuregulins. Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity is thought to be mediated by the ErbB/neuregulin system, with exposure to trastuzumab partly blocking the protective effect of neuregulins on the myocardium. As a result, trastuzumab increases the risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Several strategies have been adopted in attempts to minimize cardiotoxicity, including patient selection on the basis of preexisting cardiac risk, monitoring of cardiac function during treatment, and early management of cardiac dysfunction. The use of less cardiotoxic anthracyclines may be one strategy to lessen the risk of cardiotoxicity. Liposomal doxorubicin products offer similar efficacy compared with conventional doxorubicin, with significantly less cardiotoxicity, and have been successfully used in combination with trastuzumab in the metastatic and neo-adjuvant setting. Clinical trials are currently underway to assess the safety of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin during concurrent administration with trastuzumab compared with standard sequential treatment using conventional doxorubicin in the adjuvant setting.

### Management of advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer and brain metastases: ASCO guideline update [^c9eed9d7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Research limitations and future directions — limitations of the research include the lack of specific data on patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, how to measure efficacy, efficacy of various chemotherapy agents, the benefits and risks of lapatinib alone or with capecitabine, and long-term toxicities of radiation therapy; when there is a lack of multiple robust comparative studies, this precludes strong recommendations on the basis of high-quality evidence, and the Expert Panel strongly urges researchers to conduct such trials, noting that ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate.

### Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive breast cancer: does estrogen receptor status define two distinct subtypes? [^26023b87]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) overexpression occurs in ∼20% of breast cancers and has historically been associated with decreased survival. Despite substantial improvements in clinical outcomes, particularly with the emergence of HER2-targeted therapy, a substantial minority of patients still relapses, and progression is inevitable in metastatic disease. Accumulating data indicate that HER2-positive disease is itself a heterogeneous entity.

Methods and Results

In this article, we qualitatively review the data supporting the classification of HER2-positive disease as at least two separate entities, distinguished by estrogen receptor (ER) status. We summarize differences in clinical outcomes, including response to neoadjuvant therapy, timing and patterns of dissemination, efficacy of therapy in the metastatic setting and survival outcomes.

Conclusions

The collective data are sufficiently strong at this point to propose that ER status defines two distinct subtypes within HER2-positive breast cancer, and we highlight the implications of this knowledge in future research, including understanding of the basic biology of HER2-positive breast cancer and the design of future clinical trials.

### Safety of continuing trastuzumab despite Mild Cardiotoxicity: a phase I trial [^60a7062c]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. One in 5 women with breast cancer has human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)–positive disease. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody acting on the HER2 receptor. It results in improved overall survival and reduced risk of recurrent disease in early stage HER2-positive breast cancer. Cardiotoxicity, which manifests as impaired left ventricular (LV) function, and in some cases clinical heart failure, is the most common dose-limiting toxicity associated with trastuzumab therapy. Trastuzumab cardiotoxicity is often mild, however. In series of patients with trastuzumab cardiotoxicity, trastuzumab did not cause cardiac myocyte necrosis, and impaired LV function (as measured by LV ejection fraction [LVEF]) generally returns toward baseline following discontinuation of trastuzumab.

Breast cancer clinical practice guidelines recommend withholding or discontinuing trastuzumab if LV function declines by greater than 10% to 15%, or below the lower limit of normal (< 54% for women). Although cardiotoxicity can be life-threatening, there is evidence to indicate that incomplete trastuzumab therapy leads to worse cancer outcomes, including higher cancer recurrence rates and higher mortality rates. These observations led us to question current guidelines that suggest holding or discontinuing trastuzumab therapy in the presence of LV myocardial injury (and especially when LV injury is mild).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers are effective at improving LVEF in nonischemic cardiomyopathy, including chemotherapy-induced LV dysfunction. We speculated that the use of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers could prevent further decline in LV function in patients with trastuzumab cardiotoxicity.

The primary objective of the SCHOLAR (Safety of Continuing Chemotherapy in Overt Left Ventricular Dysfunction Using Antibodies to Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2) trial was to determine the safety and tolerability of a strategy of continued administration of trastuzumab in combination with therapy for LV myocardial injury (by using ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers) in patients with stage I to III HER2-positive breast cancer and LV injury secondary to trastuzumab. The secondary objective was to measure the change in LVEF with ongoing trastuzumab (coupled with standard-of-care treatments for LV impairment) in patients experiencing mild or moderate cardiotoxicity.

### Trastuzumab cardiotoxicity: biological hypotheses and clinical open issues [^da19b044]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Trastuzumab has significantly improved the prognosis of breast cancer patients overexpressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). This result has been achieved in all disease settings, by increasing overall survival in early stage and advanced disease and by increasing pathological complete responses in neoadjuvant disease.

Objective

Although the greatest impact of this monoclonal antibody has been seen in the adjuvant setting, by increasing disease-free survival and overall survival rates an increased rate of both symptomatic and non-symptomatic cardiac toxicity has also been observed.

Methods

In the following review, the different mechanisms of trastuzumab cardiac toxicity are described and, in addition, the clinical data coming from both trials and meta-analyses is discussed.

Results

While there is strong evidence for the incidence of trastuzumab-related cardiac toxicity, there is still little known on the exact pathogenesis of this toxicity. Interestingly, both experimental and clinical data suggest that trastuzumab may sensitize cardiomyocytes to injuries and stress from administration of anthracyclines. This has led to a proposed novel mechanism of cardiotoxicity that appears to be quite different from the anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity. Trastuzumab does not seem to cause any overt ultrastructural abnormality; it does, however, lead to myocardial dysfunction.

Conclusion

Most of the proposed hypotheses seems to be related to the activity of trastuzumab in interfering with the ERBB-2 receptor. Indeed, data from clinical trials in the adjuvant setting report increased cardiac toxicity in those patients who previously received anthracyclines.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 Breast Cancer — In BCIRG 006, 3222 patients with HER2-positive disease were randomized to AC-T, AC-TH, or TCH. At 65-month follow-up, AC-TH had a hazard ratio (HR) for disease-free survival (DFS) of 0.64 versus AC-T, and TCH had an HR for DFS of 0.75 versus AC-T. An overall survival (OS) advantage was reported for both trastuzumab-containing arms compared to AC-T (HR for AC-TH vs. AC-T = 0.63; HR for TCH vs. AC-T = 0.77). Cardiac toxicity was significantly lower with TCH than AC-TH, with 9.4% patients with > 10% relative decline in left ventricular ejection fraction compared with 18.6%, and congestive heart failure (CHF) was more frequent with AC-TH than TCH (2% vs. 0.4%). Analysis by critical clinical event showed more distant breast cancer recurrences with TCH (144 vs. 124) but fewer cardiac events with TCH compared with AC-TH (4 vs. 21).

### Effect of metformin vs placebo on invasive disease-free survival in breast cancer… [^32326709]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

eFigure. Exploratory analysis of the effect of metformin vs placebo on invasive disease–free survival and overall survival in ERBB2 positive breast cancer by rs11212617 SNP status Data Sharing Statement aInformation obtained in screening potential patients was not consistently collected across sites. None of the 3 secondary outcomes analyzed in the ER/PgR+ group had statistically significant differences. Grade 3 nonhematological toxic events occurred more frequently in patients taking metformin than in patients taking placebo. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in the metformin vs placebo groups were hypertension, irregular menses, and diarrhea. ERBB2 status did not have a significant impact on the effect of metformin vs placebo on invasive disease-free and overall survival outcomes.

Analyses focused on hypotheses that metformin would be beneficial among those with ERBB2+ breast cancer, notably among those with any C allele of the rs11212617 SNV. Four serious adverse events were reported. Nonhematological grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported for 391 patients in the metformin and 328 in the placebo group; the most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher included hypertension, irregular menses, and diarrhea.

The exploratory analyses in ERBB2+ breast cancer were informed by the METTEN study, 14 which reported an increased pathological complete response rate when metformin was added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and ERBB2-targeted therapy in patients with ERBB2+ breast cancer with any C allele of the rs11212617 SNV; a similar benefit was not seen among those with the AA genotype.

HER2-positive breast cancer — trastuzumab addition to chemotherapy and TCH regimen: The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy was associated with a reduction in risk of recurrence (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21–0.83; P = 0.01), with no statistically significant differences in OS (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.16–1.08; P = 0.07); at 5-year follow-up, distant DFS (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38–1.12; P = 0.12) and OS (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.27–1.11; P = 0.094) were higher relative to 3 years. The TCH regimen is a preferred regimen, especially for those with risk factors for cardiac toxicity, based on the results of the BCIRG 006 study.

### Management of trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction [^e9a6a073]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Trastuzumab is the standard of care for the treatment of patients with ERB2-positive breast cancer. In a minority of patients, trastuzumab is associated with an increased incidence of cardiac dysfunction that ranges from asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction to symptomatic heart failure. In trials in the adjuvant setting, the difference in the incidence of cardiac events between the control and trastuzumab-containing arms was less than 4%. The baseline evaluation and oncologic setting (adjuvant versus metastatic disease) drive algorithms for the cardiac monitoring and management of these patients. When a patient develops documented left ventricular dysfunction, standard treatments for the management of heart failure should be prescribed. Trastuzumab cardiac dysfunction is an important clinical entity that can be managed effectively and individualized to maximize the cancer treatment benefit and minimize the risk and consequences of cardiac dysfunction.

### Cardiac safety of reduced cardiotoxicity surveillance during HER2-Targeted therapy [^eac6ab4a]. JACC: CardioOncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cancer therapy–related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD), defined by clinical heart failure (HF) or asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), is a primary adverse effect of therapies used to treat breast cancers that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Early clinical trial data have shown that sequential treatment with anthracyclines and trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against HER2, is associated with a 2%-4% risk of HF (ie, symptomatic CTRCD) and ∼10%-20% risk of LVEF decline (ie, asymptomatic CTRCD). To screen for CTRCD, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and other professional societies established guidelines recommending LVEF assessments every 3 months during HER2-targeted therapy. These guidelines were based on the cardiac surveillance protocols from several landmark clinical trials of trastuzumab. However, the treatment landscape for HER2-positive breast cancer is changing, with declining use of anthracyclines in favor of non-anthracycline regimens that are associated with lower risk of CTRCD. This trend in clinical practice raises the question of whether less frequent cardiac surveillance may be appropriate for patients receiving treatment regimens associated with low risk for CTRCD, such as non-anthracycline regimens, in which the risks of HF and asymptomatic LVEF decline are < 1% and < 5%, respectively, but cardiac safety data to support this approach are lacking.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a prospective single-arm study to evaluate the safety of reduced cardiac surveillance in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer receiving non-anthracycline regimens. We hypothesized that the cardiac safety of CTRCD surveillance performed every 6 months would be noninferior to standard — care CTRCD surveillance every 3 months (based on published literature) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer at low risk for CTRCD. We report the cardiac safety results of the overall study population.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women globally. Subtypes of breast cancer are defined by the tumor's morphology and intrinsic molecular classifications. Tumors that do not overexpress the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein are characterized based on the presence of hormone receptors (HR) and are classified as either HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). For HR-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, the current standard of care includes endocrine-based therapy in combination with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitors and other sequenced targeted agents. However, endocrine resistance will eventually occur, leaving sequential chemotherapy-based strategies as the next treatment option. Similarly, until recently, single-agent chemotherapy was the standard of care beyond the first-line for advanced TNBC.

### Minimizing cardiotoxicity while optimizing treatment efficacy with trastuzumab: review and expert recommendations [^2cd185e4]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the therapeutic benefit of trastuzumab in women with breast cancer. However, a small but not insignificant proportion of patients have experienced trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity during these trials. This phenomenon is generally characterized by an asymptomatic reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or, less often, congestive heart failure (CHF). Concomitant anthracycline therapy significantly increases the risk for cardiotoxicity during trastuzumab treatment, and such regimens are therefore not recommended. The cardiac dysfunction associated with trastuzumab is most often reversible upon discontinuation of treatment and initiation of standard medical therapy for CHF. Prior to treatment initiation, a risk-benefit analysis should be performed for each individual patient, including a thorough assessment of potential risk factors and cardiac function. Cardiac monitoring should be continued throughout trastuzumab therapy and the follow-up period, because early recognition of trastuzumab-associated cardiac dysfunction can allow effective medical intervention. Following the occurrence of asymptomatic LVEF reduction or CHF and appropriate medical intervention, reintroduction of trastuzumab may be considered in patients following resolution of normal cardiac function, or in those for whom the benefit of antitumor therapy outweighs the risk for CHF.

HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer — first-line anti-HER2 therapy: The NCCN Panel included T-DM1 as an option for treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, but pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and a taxane remains the preferred first-line regimen based on data demonstrating improved overall survival compared to trastuzumab and a taxane. First-line trastuzumab in combination with selected chemotherapy is an additional option, with randomized trials showing benefit when adding trastuzumab to paclitaxel with or without carboplatin, docetaxel, or vinorelbine, and trastuzumab plus capecitabine has shown efficacy as a first-line trastuzumab-containing regimen. The NCCN Panel believes the 27% frequency of significant cardiac dysfunction with trastuzumab and doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide in the metastatic setting is too high for use of this combination outside the confines of a prospective clinical trial.

### Cardiovascular toxicity of novel HER2-Targeted therapies in the treatment of breast cancer [^60bd5c06]. Current Oncology Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

HER2-targeted therapies have led to improved clinical outcomes in early and advanced breast cancer (BC). We review the long-term cardiotoxicity of HER2-targeted therapy in early and advanced BC, our current knowledge of cardiotoxicity of novel HER2-targeted therapies, and propose a cardiac monitoring (CM) strategy for this population.

Recent Findings

Long-term data from studies with HER2-targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting have failed to demonstrate an increase in cardiotoxicity over time, and rates of cardiotoxicity seen with novel HER2 agents remain low. Despite over a decade of experience with HER2-targeted therapy, CM in clinical practice is inconsistent in patients with early BC and almost non-existent in advanced BC. Long-term follow-up of clinical trials with HER2-targeted agents in early and advanced BC has failed to demonstrate increased rates of cardiotoxicity over time, attesting to the long-term safety of this class of drugs for the majority of patients, although the long-term cardiac safety of newer HER2 agents in the non-clinical trial setting is largely unknown. We propose CM incorporating clinical history, cardiac imaging, and biomarkers.

### How to follow, manage and treat cardiac Dysfunction in patients with HER2 + breast cancer [^0b6604ae]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case 1

A 55-year-old postmenopausal woman with no known preexisting cardiovascular (CV) risk factors is diagnosed with a stage I HER2+ breast cancer. With no high-risk tumor features (node negative, small tumor) her oncologist recommends paclitaxel weekly for 12 weeks with trastuzumab every 3 weeks for 12 months.

The planned cancer treatment is considered low risk for cardiac dysfunction, with no anthracycline chemotherapy and a single HER2-targeted agent. The patient herself is also categorized as low risk given absence of CV risk factors. She should undergo standard baseline CV assessment, including history and examination, blood pressure (BP) measurement, and lipid panel (Table 1). All patients initiating HER2-targeted therapies should receive baseline LVEF assessment, ideally using echocardiography incorporating 3-dimensional LVEF and global longitudinal strain (GLS). For follow-up imaging, current Food and Drug Administration and the American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging statements recommend 3-monthly LVEF measurements during treatment and 6-monthly assessment for 2 years in survivorship. In contrast, the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines indicate that imaging frequency should be "determined by providers based on clinical judgment and patient circumstances". The discrepancy between the documents may reflect significant difference in publication date (∼15 years) with a growing evidence that CV and cancer factors may modulate cardiotoxicity risk.

Table 1
Proposed Framework for Cardiology and Oncologic Risk Stratification for Cardiac Monitoring With Trastuzumab-Based Therapies in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer

Our patient, without CV risk factors and receiving taxane-trastuzumab therapy, has a low risk of symptomatic HF (0.4%) and we believe that it is reasonable to use provider judgment to personalize imaging frequency. In contrast, in a patient with CV risk factors, and/or abnormal baseline imaging, serial LVEF measurements would be indicated. Preventive strategies are unlikely to provide significant benefit in this context, and there is little evidence for routine serial blood biomarker surveillance. In the survivorship period, monitoring CV risk factors continues to be of importance given CV risk remains elevated in survivors even 7+ years after diagnosis.

### Resource guide: preoperative management of patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy [^70794aca]. ASBrS (2025). High credibility.

Monoclonal antibodies — perioperative management of trastuzumab and pertuzumab: Available literature suggests that both agents can be safely administered during the preoperative and postoperative periods, while cardiotoxicity risk varies by co-administered drugs with higher rates for trastuzumab plus doxorubicin (13%) or trastuzumab, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (27%) versus trastuzumab and epirubicin (5%) or trastuzumab and pertuzumab (4%). Food and Drug Administration guidelines recommend an ECHO every three months during treatment with any HER2-targeting therapy, and in the preoperative setting cardiac workup before surgery should be informed by existing cardiac comorbidities, surveillance during treatment, cardiotoxicity severity, and new symptoms; patients with no history of cardiac disease, negative ECGs, and normal quarterly ECHOs do not warrant additional cardiac testing, whereas those with a history of cardiac disease, new cardiac symptoms, or an abnormal ECG or ECHO warrant repeat cardiac testing and possibly consultation with cardiology before surgery. Regarding wound healing, one study of patients undergoing breast surgery 4–6 weeks after therapy showed a higher rate of wound complications among lumpectomy patients who received the combination versus trastuzumab alone, and in reconstruction cohorts the combination had a higher incidence of wound dehiscence and a greater need for reoperation; in that reconstruction cohort, surgery was performed approximately 6 weeks after the last dose, while there was no significant difference in complication rates between trastuzumab alone and no HER2-directed agents. Overall, these studies indicate that the combination may influence wound healing; however, they do not provide conclusive evidence to warrant discontinuing trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the perioperative setting.

Alternative taxanes may be substituted for medical necessity and, if replacing weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, the weekly dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel should not exceed 125 mg/m². It is acceptable to change the administration sequence to taxane (with or without HER2-targeted therapy) followed by AC.

Updated APHINITY results with a median follow-up of 8 years confirm the benefit of adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in node positive disease. Trastuzumab given in combination with an anthracycline is associated with significant cardiac toxicity and concurrent use of trastuzumab and pertuzumab with an anthracycline should be avoided.

### Reversibility of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity: new insights based on clinical course and response to medical treatment [^8b397ea7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Trastuzumab is an important biologic agent with significant activity in breast cancers that overexpress the HER2/neu marker. However, trastuzumab is associated with cardiotoxicity that has not yet been fully explored. We present our experience with patients who developed trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity.

Patients and Methods

Over a 4-year period, 38 patients with HER2/neu-positive breast cancer were referred for suspected trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. All patients had previously received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Results After doxorubicin but before trastuzumab, the mean (± standard deviation) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.61 ± 0.13, and the LVEF decreased to 0.43 ± 0.16 after trastuzumab (P < .0001). After withdrawal of trastuzumab, the LVEF increased to 0.56 ± 0.11. Mean time to recovery of LVEF was 1.5 months and was temporally associated with medical treatment in 32 (84%) of the 38 patients but occurred without treatment in six patients (16%). Increases in LVEF were noted in 37 of the 38 patients. Twenty-five of these patients were re-treated with trastuzumab; three patients had recurrent left ventricular dysfunction, but 22 patients (88%) did not. All re-treatment patients continued on their therapeutic regimen for heart failure when rechallenged with trastuzumab. Nine patients underwent endomyocardial biopsy. Ultrastructural changes were not seen.

Conclusion

Patients who develop cardiotoxicity while receiving trastuzumab therapy generally improve on removal of the agent. The mechanism of trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction is different from that of anthracycline cardiotoxicity, in part, demonstrated by the absence of anthracycline-like ultrastructural changes. Reintroducing trastuzumab may be appropriate for some individuals who previously have experienced trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction.

### SAFE-HEaRt: rationale and design of a pilot study investigating cardiac safety of HER2 targeted therapy in patients with HER2-Positive breast cancer and reduced left ventricular function [^e4200242]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies have survival benefit in adjuvant and metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer but are associated with cardiac dysfunction. Current U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommendations limit the use of HER2 targeted agents to patients with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function.

Methods

The objective of the SAFE-HEaRt study is to evaluate the cardiac safety of HER2 targeted therapy in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with optimized cardiac therapy. Thirty patients with histologically confirmed HER2 positive breast cancer (stage I-IV) and reduced LVEF (40% to 49%) who plan to receive HER2 targeted therapy for ≥ 3 months will be enrolled. Prior to initiation on study, optimization of heart function with beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors will be initiated. Patients will be followed by serial echocardiograms and cardiac visits during and 6 months after completion of HER2 targeted therapy. Myocardial strain and blood biomarkers, including cardiac troponin I and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, will be examined at baseline and during the study.

Discussion

LV dysfunction in patients with breast cancer poses cardiac and oncological challenges and limits the use of HER2 targeted therapies and its oncological benefits. Strategies to prevent cardiac dysfunction associated with HER2 targeted therapy have been limited to patients with normal LVEF, thus excluding patients who may receive the highest benefit from those strategies. SAFE-HEaRt is the first prospective pilot study of HER2 targeted therapies in patients with reduced LV function while on optimized cardiac treatment that can provide the basis for clinical practice changes. The Oncologist 2017;22:518–525 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) targeted therapies have survival benefit in adjuvant and metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer but are associated with cardiac dysfunction. To our knowledge, SAFE-HEaRt is the first clinical trial that prospectively tests the hypothesis that HER2 targeted therapies may be safely administered in patients with mildly reduced cardiac function in the setting of ongoing cardiac treatment and monitoring. The results of this study will provide cardiac safety data and inform consideration of clinical practice changes in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and reduced cardiac function, as well as provide information regarding cardiovascular monitoring and treatment in this population.

### Cardiotoxicity from human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) targeted therapies [^27e69a21]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The Cardiac Risks of HER2 Targeted Therapies

The first signal for cardiotoxicity associated with trastuzumab did not appear until the first phase III trial of the monoclonal antibody in patients with metastatic breast cancer published in 2001. In this study, risk of symptomatic or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was highest among individuals who received trastuzumab in combination with anthracycline and cyclophosphamide, followed by those who received the monoclonal antibody in combination with paclitaxel, as compared with either chemotherapeutic regimen alone (incidence, 27% versus 13% versus 8% versus 1%, respectively). 5 Additionally, a significant proportion of these patients developed New York Heart Association class III or IV HF (incidence; 16%, 2%, 3%, and 1%, respectively). 5 Such differences in the rates of cardiac dysfunction with the use of different chemotherapeutic regimens raised suspicion for a synergism between trastuzumab and anthracycline. Given these unexpectedly high rates of HF, subsequent trials of trastuzumab adopted stringent criteria for patient enrollment excluding those at increased risk for cardiac adverse events. Exclusion criteria have included: history of uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmias, valvular disease, coronary artery disease, HF, or asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Enrollment of a lower‐risk population, implementation of strict protocols for monitoring of cardiac function, and changes in chemotherapeutic regimens so that anthracyclines were not given concurrently with trastuzumab or were omitted, likely explain the lower rates of cardiotoxicity observed in the subsequent trials of the monoclonal antibody.

### Heart failure and breast cancer therapies: moving towards personalized risk assessment [^d86bff4d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Perhaps as a result of close cardiac monitoring, subsequent clinical trials of trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting have demonstrated a lower incidence of cardiotoxicity, typically defined as either symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) or asymptomatic decline in left ventricular systolic function (cardiomyopathy). In large, randomized clinical trials, the incidence of symptomatic CHF ranged from 0.6% to 4.1% while the incidence of cardiomyopathy is higher at 3% to 19%. – The differences in the reported incidence may be related to several factors including differences in treatment regimens, differences in definitions of cardiomyopathy, and variation in the imaging modalities used to assess EF. Despite these sources of heterogeneity, it is clear that trastuzumab is associated with a small increased risk of clinical congestive heart failure and a larger increased risk of cardiomyopathy, especially on the background of anthracycline therapy. However, these risks are juxtaposed against the consistent finding in clinical trials that trastuzumab significantly decreases the risk of cancer recurrence and increases survival in women with HER2‐positive disease.

An important, unanswered question is the clinical significance of the cardiotoxicity associated with HER2‐targeted therapies. In clinical trials involving trastuzumab, the majority of patients who developed heart failure or cardiomyopathy improved clinically, and most experienced an improvement in EF although approximately one‐third of patients had some degree of persistent LV systolic dysfunction.– In two trials testing trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting, there were no cardiac deaths in the trastuzumab arms at a median follow‐up of 3.6 and 5.4 years, respectively. In addition, new‐onset cardiomyopathy can interrupt and influence the course of cancer therapy. In clinical trials, 2% to 8% of HER2‐positive breast cancer patients were not candidates for trastuzumab due to LV dysfunction or cardiac symptoms after completing an anthracycline‐containing regimen. Similarly, the development of cardiac events, many of them asymptomatic, during treatment with trastuzumab can lead to interruption or cessation of treatment in up to 16% of women with a proven survival benefit. –

### How to follow, manage and treat cardiac Dysfunction in patients with HER2 + breast cancer [^5ff2079a]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Before treatment initiation, risk factors should be aggressively treated (in this case with antiplatelet agents, high-dose statin therapy, target systolic BP < 130 mm Hg, healthy exercise, and diet). The administration of HER2 therapies can be achieved at relatively low risk in asymptomatic patients with mild cardiac dysfunction (LVEF 40% to 49%) provided they are closely monitored. Although data are limited, consensus recommendations suggest a role for cardioprotection with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and/or beta-blockers. In addition to continued cardiac imaging, monitoring of blood biomarkers (NT-proBNP, troponin) may be beneficial in individuals with cardiac dysfunction who are continuing HER2 therapies, to assist with risk stratification and diagnosis of symptomatic HF.

During treatment with HER2 therapies, patients with metastatic disease should initially undergo recommended 3-monthly serial imaging initially. If LVEF is stable for 12 months and the patient remains asymptomatic, the frequency can potentially be reduced to 6 monthly intervals, particularly if biomarkers remain stable. This decision should be individualized. Any symptoms of HF warrant urgent reassessment and a low threshold for holding treatment. Any decision to interrupt or terminate HER2 treatment should be made after discussion between oncology and cardiology, with close involvement of the patient.

Data for the cardiotoxicity of second- and third-line treatments in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer (including trastuzumab conjugates such as trastuzumab emtansine, trastuzumab deruxtecan, lapatinib, neratinib, and tucatinib) are limited, and screening should follow the principles used for first-line treatments until further data are available. Alternatives to HER2 therapies in patients with performance status > 1 who are at very high CV risk or who develop cardiotoxicity include taxanes, capecitabine, and gemcitabine; serial cardiac monitoring is not required for these patients. However, most patients will continue on trastuzumab-based therapy with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, in which case, monitoring should be continued in a risk-stratified approach.

### Assessing cardiac safety in oncology drug development [^29aa1280]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinically meaningful end points: Lessons from trastuzumab

It is clearly important to monitor safety signals that are clinically meaningful. For example, in early phase III clinical trials in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, trastuzumab was associated with significant cardiac dysfunction and symptomatic heart failure in almost 25% of the patients. As a result, in subsequent adjuvant studies, routine imaging was required for patients receiving trastuzumab at baseline and every 3 months during 1 year of treatment. In this setting, trastuzumab became rather safe, and incidence of symptomatic heart failure in adjuvant trials was consistently less than 3%. The most common abnormality detected during routine imaging is a significant decline in LVEF; however, the association between an asymptomatic LVEF decline and the risk of subsequent clinical heart failure has not been fully elucidated in this population. Given the inherent variability of LVEF measurement, there is also a risk that patients may be wrongly identified as having cardiotoxicity, which may compromise delivery of curative therapy. Overall, the current available evidence is insufficient to support a specific schedule of cardiac imaging during trastuzumab-based treatment, and further investigation is needed to determine whether routine cardiac monitoring results in improved CV outcomes. A more promising approach might be to use existing tools to identify those at highest risk and only apply stringent cardiac monitoring strategies to these individuals. Until such data become available, it is reassuring to know that the rate of symptomatic HF is low based on clinical trial data when routine cardiac monitoring is performed. The goal should be to carry out the right testing and monitoring in the right patient at the right time. In clinical practice, cardiovascular risk factors alone have not been able to predict which patients will develop trastuzumab cardiotoxicity, and the variability in cardiac adverse effects from trastuzumab suggests that genetics may play a role in a patient's individual risk for cardiotoxicity.

To advance understanding of the optimal management of patients with trastuzumab toxicity, the recently completed SAFE-HEaRt study evaluated cardiac safety of HER2 targeted therapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and mildly reduced LVEF (≥ 40% no symptoms of heart failure). This investigation tested the hypothesis that initiation or continuation of trastuzumab may be safe in patients with mildly reduced LVEF if they concomitantly receive optimal cardiac therapy including β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Future areas of study may incorporate newer techniques using hiPSC-CMs to predict the cardiotoxic response to trastuzumab.

### Trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction [^a9bd3cca]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

The use of trastuzumab in the adjuvant and metastatic treatment of breast cancer is associated with both symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiotoxicity. The long-term significance of these events, isolating known cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines from those of trastuzumab, and the appropriateness of referring to trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity as reversible rather than responsive to trastuzumab withdrawal and heart failure medical therapy, are issues that continue to be debated. This article provides an overview of the available cardiac safety data from the major trastuzumab clinical trials in breast cancer, highlighting areas of ongoing controversy. Important recent data documenting the occurrence and prognostic use of cardiac troponin I elevations among patients treated with trastuzumab are placed into context with the mechanistic insight these data provide and the implications for clinical practice today.

### Cardiotoxicity from human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) targeted therapies [^b6571438]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation

Cardiac adverse effects from trastuzumab therapy involve decreases in the left ventricular systolic function with or without clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF). Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) typically manifest during the course of treatment and long‐term follow‐up data up to 10 years do not show evidence of late‐onset cardiac dysfunction associated with HER2 targeted therapy. 11, 12, 13 Additional key features that differentiate cardiotoxicity associated with trastuzumab use from that associated with anthracycline therapy, which may occur late and be irreversible, are lack of ultrastructural changes in endomyocardial biopsy specimens, and possible reversibility of cardiac dysfunction. 14, 15

Although various groups have proposed a set of criteria to define cardiotoxicity from cancer therapies (Table 1), none have been uniformly accepted. 16, 17, 18, 19 The use of various definitions for cardiac adverse events in the trastuzumab trials makes direct comparison of these studies difficult and limits our understanding of the true clinical burden of cardiotoxicity associated with HER2 targeted therapies.

### Drug insight: intracellular inhibitors of HER2 – clinical development of lapatinib in breast cancer [^66c871fd]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

Targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) in breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress HER2 has been clearly demonstrated to be effective in clinical trials with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. Not all patients, however, respond to trastuzumab therapy. Lapatinib is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2 and the EGFR. Preclinical data reveal that lapatinib has activity in trastuzumab-resistant cell lines as well as synergistic activity with trastuzumab. In a pivotal phase III trial, a combination of lapatinib and capecitabine significantly decreased the risk of disease progression relative to capecitabine alone in women with HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab. Other trials are evaluating lapatinib in inflammatory breast cancer — for which encouraging data have been reported — in combination with hormone therapy, in combination with trastuzumab, and as an adjunct to adjuvant therapy for early-stage disease. Notably, lapatinib has not been associated with serious or symptomatic cardiotoxicity in clinical trials. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and might therefore have a role in preventing central-nervous-system progression. These features make lapatinib an ideal agent to evaluate more fully in HER2-positive metastatic and early-stage breast cancer.

### Cardioprotection for anti-HER2 therapy: considerations for primary prevention and use in mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^706eafc0]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes current HER2-targeted therapies and clinical studies that have investigated primary and secondary prevention of cardiac dysfunction for HER2+breast cancer patients undergoing targeted therapy.

Recent Findings

Primary and secondary prevention clinical trials highlight the importance of cardioprotective measures during HER2+cancer treatment. Together, these studies suggest the safety of neurohormonal drugs, the importance for an individualized approach in starting cardiopreventive therapies, and the potential to expand HER2+treatment options to patients with cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac dysfunction is a concerning adverse effect for HER2-targeted treatment. The goal of primary and secondary prevention is to prevent (further) cardiac function decline and heart failure symptoms, while delivering appropriate cancer therapy. Clinical trials investigating preventative therapies in the context of primary and secondary prevention are paving the path for reducing adverse cardiac effects and expanding treatment options for patients previously unable to undergo HER+therapy.

### Clinical cardiac tolerability of trastuzumab [^9b2797f3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

This review provides an update on the current understanding of the clinical cardiac tolerability of trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody effective in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer overexpressing or amplifying HER2.

Methods and Results

We produced a summary of currently available information regarding the incidence and natural history of trastuzumab-associated cardiac dysfunction. Data from new, prospective clinical studies that incorporate close cardiac monitoring and standardized follow-up in patients with either advanced or earlier stages of breast cancer are also presented, and hypotheses regarding potential mechanisms of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity are discussed. Patients treated with trastuzumab in the pivotal trials were found to have increased risk for cardiac dysfunction, mostly when used concurrent with anthracyclines. Recent trials have required more stringent and consistent cardiac monitoring criteria and excluded patients with abnormal cardiac function, pre-existing heart disease, and/or high cumulative doses of anthracyclines. Decreases of ejection fraction and a few cases of congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring medical therapy have been detected. Improvements in ejection fraction and the symptoms of CHF have been subsequently noted in a significant number of these patients.

Conclusion

Trastuzumab is associated with an increased risk of asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, and, in a small number of patients, CHF that is almost always responsive to medical management. This risk is greatest in patients receiving concurrent anthracyclines. More data are needed to help elucidate the pathophysiology of this syndrome.

### Cardiotoxicity from human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) targeted therapies [^86c69c37]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

We recommend lifestyle modification to all patients as well as optimization of medical management of CVD risk factors. Weight gain is common following the diagnosis of breast cancer and associated with poor outcomes. 100 Counseling on weight loss, avoidance of weight gain, and routine physical activity may have a particularly important role in this population. If patients with pre‐existing CVD or baseline low LVEF (< 50%) are not already on an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and a beta‐blocker, initiation should be considered.

We suggest initiation of an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker followed by a beta‐blocker for any evidence of significant cardiac injury, including: asymptomatic decrease in LVEF ≥ 10% or to ≤ 50%, or a relative change in global longitudinal strain ≥ 15%. The treating oncologist and cardiologist should collaborate to determine the course of care, but in most cases it is appropriate to temporarily discontinue HER2 targeted therapy if LVEF decreases to < 50% or if the patient develops symptoms of HF. Rechallenge may be considered if there is partial or complete recovery on repeat assessment of cardiac function at 4 weeks.

There are no data on the ideal strategy for management of patients with pre‐existing cardiac conditions or with persistent left ventricular dysfunction despite discontinuation of therapy. Patients and providers should engage in a careful review of the possible risks and benefits of starting/continuing trastuzumab versus progressive cardiac dysfunction in a shared decision‐making process. The balance might favor continued therapy with the monoclonal antibody among those with advanced breast cancer, whereas the decision might be more difficult for patients with early stages of the disease. There are several factors to consider in this decision, for example: (1) the degree of cardiac dysfunction; (2) whether there is further reduction in ejection fraction with continued therapy after the initiation of HF medical therapy; (3) the degree of HF symptoms; and (4) the risk of cancer progression. The results of the ongoing SAFEHEART trial are expected to help inform this decision.

Close collaboration between oncologists and cardiologists is key for successful prevention and management of cardiotoxicity from cancer therapies. We suggest that high‐risk patients, especially those with pre‐existing CVD, and patients who develop cardiac dysfunction be referred for consultation with a cardiologist, ideally someone with cardio‐oncology expertise. Clinical decisions about discontinuation of therapy ought to be informed by both providers and shared with patients, in a collaborative process.

### Cardiac toxicity from breast cancer treatment: can we avoid this? [^b2b0ac81]. Current Oncology Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Breast cancer therapies, such as anthracyclines, trastuzumab, and chest irradiation, have well-established cardiotoxicities that lead to adverse outcomes. Here, we will review strategies to mitigate these cardiotoxicities.

Recent Findings

Recent consensus guidelines have established criteria for the identification and surveillance of breast cancer patients at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. Dose reduction, liposomal doxorubicin, and dexrazoxane may be considered in high-risk patients receiving anthracyclines. Anthracycline-free regimens should be considered in high-risk patients with HER-2+ breast cancer, if appropriate. Data to support the routine use of concomitant neurohormonal blockade or statins to prevent anthracycline- and trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy is not yet available. Strategies that minimize radiation dose to the heart such as deep inspiration and intensity-modulated radiation are recommended to prevent radiation-induced cardiotoxicity. Identification of high-risk patients, aggressive management of underlying cardiovascular risk factors, consideration of cardioprotective strategies, and routine surveillance of left ventricular function before and after therapy are recommended to reduce breast cancer treatment-associated cardiotoxicities.

Risk of Cardiotoxicity Outside of Clinical Trials

Experience outside of clinical trials suggests higher risks of cardiac toxicity associated with trastuzumab compared with that reported in clinical trials. 50 In a retrospective analysis of older women with early‐stage breast cancer, compared with patients who did not receive either adjuvant chemotherapy or trastuzumab, use of trastuzumab alone or the combination of trastuzumab and anthracycline were associated with absolute increases in the adjusted incidence rate of HF or cardiomyopathy of 14% and 23.8%. 51 Similarly, in a retrospective analysis of women treated for metastatic breast cancer at the MD Anderson where 5% had a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), 26.5% of those who received HER2 targeted therapies had symptomatic HF, which was reversible in the majority of cases. 52 Data from the health maintenance organization Cancer Research Network reported the cumulative incidence of HF at 1 and 5 years was 6.2% and 20.1% for women who received a combination of anthracycline and trastuzumab and 3.6% and 12.1% for women who received trastuzumab alone. 50 Such cumulative incidence increased significantly, with increasing age at cancer diagnosis being as high as 40.7% among women who were aged ≥ 75 years and received a combination of anthracycline and trastuzumab. 49 Importantly, there were significant differences in the number of comorbidities of each treatment group, which may reflect treatment selection biases by providers. The increased rates of cardiotoxicity in such observational studies likely reflect the use of trastuzumab in older populations with more‐adverse cardiac risk profiles and reduced cardiac reserve.

### Human epidermal growth factor receptor family-targeted therapies in the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer [^dfb9f51b]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

Breast cancer characterized by overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) has been associated with more aggressive disease progression and a poorer prognosis. Although an improved understanding of breast cancer pathogenesis and the role of HER2 signaling has resulted in significant survival improvements in the past 20 years, resistance to HER2-targeted therapy remains a concern. A number of strategies to prevent or overcome resistance to HER2-targeted therapy in breast cancer are being evaluated. This article provides a comprehensive review of (a) the role of HER2 signaling in breast cancer pathogenesis, (b) potential receptor and downstream therapeutic targets in breast cancer to overcome resistance to HER2-targeted therapy, and (c) clinical trials evaluating agents targeting one or more members of the HER family and/or downstream pathways for the treatment of breast cancer, with a focus on metastatic disease.

BC Therapy‐Related Cardiovascular Risk Factors

It is well established that anthracycline triggers cardiac dysfunction in a dose‐dependent fashion. Traditionally, the lifetime cumulative doxorubicin dose was limited to 400 mg/m 2 to prevent anthracycline‐induced cardiomyopathy. However, recent studies have shown that the risk of HF is significantly increased even at a lower doxorubicin dose than previously reported, and anthracycline‐related symptomatic HF can occur at a doxorubicin dose lower than 300 mg/m 2. These results suggest that there is no absolute safe dose threshold for anthracycline. In this respect, we treated the dose of anthracycline not as a simple categorical variable but as a complex categorical variable (1 point per 100 mg/m 2 doxorubicin equivalent dose rounded to the nearest integer). This approach can provide more individualized risk stratification, especially for patients with BC whose chemotherapy included anthracycline. Although anti‐HER2 treatment improves disease‐free and overall survival in HER2/neu‐positive patients with BC, it may increase the risk of cardiotoxicity. In this study, however, trastuzumab was not a significant risk factor for MACE. There could be several explanations for the inconsistent results. First, the end point of this study was limited to symptomatic HF. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of trastuzumab‐related symptomatic HF was relatively low, ranging from 0% to 3.9%, whereas a decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction (with or without symptoms) was observed in one‐third of the patients with BC who received trastuzumab. Contrary to anthracycline‐induced cardiomyopathy, the cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab is usually reversible after cessation of the trastuzumab and treatment with HF medications. So, this study may have limitations in detecting trastuzumab‐induced cardiac toxicity. Second, only 11.9% of the patients in this study were administered anti‐HER‐2 treatment. Therefore, the notion that the use of HER‐2 blocking monoclonal antibodies is not a cardiovascular risk factor could not be generalized from our findings. Careful monitoring of cardiovascular events is essential for patients with BC who receive chemotherapy that includes HER‐2 blocking antibodies. Several studies have reported that selective estrogen modulators are associated with ischemic stroke and that aromatase inhibitors, relative to selective estrogen receptor modulators, increase the risk of cardiovascular events. However, endocrine therapy, including treatment with selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors, was not a significant risk factor in our study. Contrary to the previous studies, our study included Asian subjects who are relatively young and less obese. The inconsistent findings regarding endocrine therapy may have resulted from the heterogeneity of the study population. Given that preexiting risk factors play an important role in the development of anti‐HER‐2 treatment‐related cardiotoxicity, this heterogeneity of the study population may also contribute to the inconsistent results regarding the effect of anti‐HER‐2 on MACE in this study.

### Trastuzumab-containing regimens for metastatic breast cancer [^246d0740]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with breast cancer are classified as having cells that over-express the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (known as HER2-positive) or not (HER2-negative). Typically, patients with HER2-positive disease have a worse prognosis. Trastuzumab is a selective treatment that targets the HER2 pathway. The available evidence supporting trastuzumab regimens mostly relies upon surrogate endpoints and, although the efficacy results seem to support its use, other uncertainties have been raised about its net benefit in relation to transient cardiac toxicity and a long-term increased risk of metastasis to the central nervous system.

Objectives

To assess the evidence on the efficacy and safety of therapy with trastuzumab (overall) and in relation to the type of co-administered regimen and the line of treatment, i.e. first-line or beyond progression, in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's (CBCG) Specialised Register and used the search strategy developed by the CBCG to search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL (2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal and ClinicalTrials.gov (up to 17 January 2013).

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or targeted agents in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data from published trials. We used hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes and risk ratio (RRs) for binary outcomes. Subgroup analyses included type of regimen (taxane-containing, anthracycline-containing, aromatase inhibitor-containing or other) and treatment line (first-line, beyond progression).

Main Results

The review found seven trials, involving 1497 patients, which met the criteria to be included. The trials were generally of moderate methodological quality; two studies have not published their results on overall survival so the presence of selective outcome reporting bias cannot be ruled out. None of the studies used blinding to treatment allocation, though this is unlikely to have biased the results for overall survival. Studies varied in terms of co-administered regimen and in terms of treatment line. In four studies, trastuzumab was administered with a chemotherapy, such as a taxane-containing, anthracycline-containing or capecitabine-containing regimen. Two studies considered postmenopausal women and administered trastuzumab with hormone-blocking medications, such as an aromatase inhibitor. One study administered trastuzumab in addition to lapatinib. Five studies out of seven included women treated with trastuzumab administered until progression as first-line treatment and two studies considered trastuzumab beyond progression. The combined HRs for overall survival and progression-free survival favoured the trastuzumab-containing regimens (HR 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.94, P = 0.004; and HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.70, P < 0.00001, respectively; moderate-quality evidence). Trastuzumab increased the risk of congestive heart failure (RR 3.49, 90% CI 1.88 to 6.47, P = 0.0009; moderate-quality evidence) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline (RR 2.65, 90% CI 1.48 to 4.74, P = 0.006). For haematological toxicities, such as neutropenic fever and anaemia, there was no clear evidence that risks differed between groups, while trastuzumab seemed to raise the risk of neutropenia. The overall survival improvement was maintained when considering patients treated as first-line or patients receiving taxane-based regimens. The progression-free survival improvement was maintained when considering patients receiving taxane-based regimens, and patients treated as first-line or subsequent lines. Few data were collected on central nervous system progression. Similarly, few studies reported on quality of life and treatment-related deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

Trastuzumab improved overall survival and progression-free survival in HER2-positive women with metastatic breast cancer, but it also increased the risk of cardiac toxicities, such as congestive heart failure and LVEF decline. The available subgroup analyses are limited by the small number of studies. Studies that administered trastuzumab as first-line treatment, or along with a taxane-based regimen, improved mortality outcomes. The evidence to support the use of trastuzumab beyond progression is limited. The recruitment in three out of seven studies was stopped early and in three trials more than 50% of patients in the control groups were permitted to switch to the trastuzumab arms at progression, making it more difficult to understand the real net benefit of trastuzumab. Trastuzumab is generally used for women with HER2-positive early breast cancer in clinical practice, while women enrolled in most of the trials in the metastatic setting were naive to trastuzumab. The effectiveness of trastuzumab for women relapsing after adjuvant trastuzumab is therefore still an open issue, although it is likely that the majority are being offered it again.

5.4	Pulmonary Toxicity

Herceptin use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity.

5.5	 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia

In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3–4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving Herceptin in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received Herceptin and those who did not [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Racial and socioeconomic disparities in cardiotoxicity among women with HER2-Positive breast cancer [^63b9464c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer and cardiovascular-specific mortality are higher among blacks compared with whites, but disparities in cancer therapy-related adverse cardiovascular outcomes have not been well studied. We assessed for the contribution of race and socioeconomic status on cardiotoxicity among women with HER2-positive breast cancer. This retrospective cohort analysis studied women diagnosed with stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer from 2004–2013. All underwent left ventricular ejection fraction assessment at baseline and at least one follow-up after beginning trastuzumab. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between race and socioeconomic status (SES) on cardiotoxicity, defined by clinical heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV) or asymptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction decline (absolute decrease ≥ 10% to < 53%, or ≥ 16%). Blacks had the highest prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and increased BMI. Neighborhood-level SES measures including household income and educational attainment were lower for blacks compared with whites and others. The unadjusted cardiotoxicity risk was significantly higher in black compared with white women (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.42 to 3.10). In a multivariable analysis, this disparity persisted after controlling for relevant cardiovascular risk factors (adjusted OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.84). Additional models adjusting for SES factors of income, educational attainment, and insurance status did not significantly alter the association between race and cardiotoxicity. In conclusion, black women are at increased risk of cardiotoxicity during HER2-targeted breast cancer therapy. Future etiologic analyses, particularly studies exploring biologic or genetic mechanisms, are needed to further elucidate and reduce racial disparities in cardiotoxicity.

Regarding medical management for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to management of early breast cancer, adjuvant systemic therapy, triple-negative, ESMO 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that HER2- tumors with 1–9% estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor expression (estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor-low) represent a heterogenous group, with some exhibiting biological behavior similarly to triple-negative breast cancers. Adjust therapeutic strategies accordingly, as this may result in a higher response to chemotherapy response and reduced endocrine therapy efficacy compared to classical HR+ breast cancer.

### Examining cardiotoxicity with HER2 Therapies [^198e97f2]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although these data are instructive, a number of questions remain regarding the optimal surveillance method, interval, and duration of monitoring for patients who receive HER2-targeted therapy. The current cardiac imaging modality and interval were largely adopted for monitoring because this was the strategy used in the first generation of adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy trials. Data suggested that cardiac magnetic resonance imaging might provide high reproducibility and sensitivity to detect cardiotoxicity. Biomarkers in lieu of imaging (e.g. troponin, natriuretic peptides, and myeloperoxidase) might also predict cardiotoxicity. Alternative and complementary testing to echocardiography and LVEF monitoring should be further explored, especially if there is an opportunity for early and effective intervention. Optimal timing of testing for decreased LVEF has not been well-established. Thirteen-year registry data showed that decreases in LVEF during the first 3 months predicted heart failure. Patients who had decreased LVEF were more likely to have received anthracyclines and have a lower LVEF at baseline; no trastuzumab-related cardiac deaths were reported. Similarly, the current analysis found no association between surveillance adherence and heart failure.

Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity generally occurs during the treatment period; long-term follow-up of early adjuvant therapy trials suggested that this is largely reversible. In contrast, a more recent study showed a slightly higher risk of heart failure at short- and long-term follow-up in patients who received trastuzumab, albeit in a population in which > 85% of patients received anthracyclines in varying doses. Mortality was similar. This is particularly important considering the improved outcomes of patients with HER2 positive breast cancer, including those with advanced stage disease.

Looking to the future, designing clinical trials that standardize cardiotoxicity reporting and develop alternatives to echocardiography, including biomarkers and other imaging modalities, are needed. To improve the therapeutic index of HER2-targeted therapy, we must focus cardioprotective interventions on those at highest risk of cardiotoxicity. Preventing progression to heart failure in those with early declines in LVEF may improve both quality of life and mortality.

### Trastuzumab-associated cardiac adverse effects in the herceptin adjuvant trial [^e39331a1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to investigate trastuzumab-associated cardiac adverse effects in breast cancer patients after completion of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy.

Patients and Methods

The Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial is a three-group, multicenter, open-label randomized trial that compared 1 or 2 years of trastuzumab given once every 3 weeks with observation in patients with HER-2-positive breast cancer. Only patients who after completion of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy had normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≥ 55%) were eligible. A repeat LVEF assessment was performed in case of cardiac dysfunction.

Results

Data were available for 1,693 patients randomly assigned to 1 year trastuzumab and 1,693 patients randomly assigned to observation. The incidence of trastuzumab discontinuation due to cardiac disorders was low (4.3%). The incidence of cardiac end points was higher in the trastuzumab group compared with observation (severe congestive heart failure [CHF], 0.60% v 0.00%; symptomatic CHF, 2.15% v 0.12%; confirmed significant LVEF drops, 3.04% v 0.53%). Most patients with cardiac dysfunction recovered in fewer than 6 months. Patients with trastuzumab-associated cardiac dysfunction were treated with higher cumulative doses of doxorubicin (287 mg/m² v 257 mg/m²) or epirubicin (480 mg/m² v 422 mg/m²) and had a lower screening LVEF and a higher body mass index.

Conclusion

Given the clear benefit in disease-free survival, the low incidence of cardiac adverse events, and the suggestion that cardiac dysfunction might be reversible, adjuvant trastuzumab should be considered for treatment of breast cancer patients who fulfill the HERA trial eligibility criteria.

### Clinical trial results of a HER2 / neu (E75) vaccine to prevent recurrence in high-risk breast cancer patients… [^ca73b038]. ASCO (2005). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose E75 is an immunogenic peptide from the HER2/ neuprotein that is highly expressed in breast cancer. We are conducting a clinical trial of an E75 + granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor vaccine to assess safety, immunologic response, and the prevention of clinical recurrences in patients with disease-free, node-positive breast cancer. Patients and Methods Fifty-three patients with NPBC were enrolled and HLA typed. HLA-A2 +patients were vaccinated, and HLA-A2 −patients are observed prospectively as clinical controls. Local/systemic toxicities, immunologic responses, and time to recurrence are being measured. Results Only minor toxicities have occurred. All patients have demonstrated clonal expansion of E75-specific CD8. +T cells that lysed HER2/ neu-expressing tumor cells. An optimal dosage and schedule have been established.

Patients have developed delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to E75 postvaccination compared with controls. HLA-A2 +patients have been found to have larger, more poorly differentiated, and more hormonally insensitive tumors compared to HLA-A2 −patients. Despite this, the only two deaths have occurred in the control group. The disease-free survival in the vaccinated group is 85. 7% compared to
59. 8% in the controls at 22 months' median follow-up with a recurrence rate of 8% compared to 21%, respectively. Median time to recurrence in the vaccinated patients was prolonged, and recurrence correlated with a weak delayed-type hypersensitivity response. Conclusion This HER2/ neu vaccine is safe and effective in eliciting a peptide-specific immune response in vivo. Induced HER2/ neuimmunity seems to reduce the recurrence rate in patients with NPBC.

### Heart failure and breast cancer therapies: moving towards personalized risk assessment [^f3c717ab]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardio‐oncology, a new clinical discipline focused on the cardiovascular care of cancer patients, represents a new avenue for interdisciplinary collaboration between clinical oncologists and cardiologists as well as between basic scientists and clinical investigators. Many of these collaborations have been driven by the emergence of novel targeted therapies that have revolutionized cancer treatment but also have the potential for cardiovascular toxicity.

The recent history of treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer is an early example of how unanticipated cardiotoxicity has led to collaborative efforts to address the problem. HER2, a proto‐oncogene encoding the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase, is amplified in > 20% of patients with breast cancer, resulting in HER2 receptor overexpression and an aggressive phenotype associated with high metastatic potential and short survival. The development of trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, over the past 15 years has led to significant improvements in the survival of patients with HER2‐positive breast cancer. A pivotal study by Slamon et al demonstrated a clear benefit of trastuzumab in metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. However, there was an alarming rate of cardiotoxicity with 27% of patients who received trastuzumab concurrently with traditional chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) developing either symptomatic heart failure or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. As a result of these data, initial regulatory approval of trastuzumab for metastatic breast cancer was accompanied by caveats with respect to cardiac safety. Several requirements were instituted for therapy in practice. First, all patients would undergo frequent periodic monitoring of cardiac function with determination of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) during the course of trastuzumab treatment. Second, trastuzumab would be administered sequentially after treatment with anthracycline‐based chemotherapy under the assumption that synergistic toxicity could result if the 2 agents were given concomitantly. These stipulations were not only applied to patient care but also to subsequent clinical trials involving trastuzumab, especially as this agent was being tested in the adjuvant setting, to increase the chance of disease‐free survival. In the oncology community, these initial observations with cardiotoxicity also led to a debate regarding the added value of anthracyclines for patients with curable, early‐stage HER2 positive breast cancer being treated with trastuzumab.

### Vinorelbine plus trastuzumab combination as first-line therapy for HER 2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients: an international phase II trial [^66d3885f]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Advances in understanding breast cancer biology have led to the development of targeted anticancer treatment. HER 2/neu gene amplification, identified in 20–30% of breast cancers, is a prognostic marker for poor clinical outcomes. Trastuzumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of the HER 2 receptor and inhibits the proliferation of human tumour cells overexpressing the HER 2 protein. Trastuzumab has demonstrated antitumour activity in metastatic breast cancer in first-line treatment, or in patients who have tumour progression after chemotherapy. Preclinical studies indicated synergistic or additive interactions for trastuzumab with different chemotherapy agents. Two randomised trials comparing trastuzumab plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone demonstrated an improved outcome for patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. However, trastuzumab therapy can be associated with cardiac toxicity. Retrospective analyses have found that concomitant use with anthracyclines and advanced age are predictive factors of trastuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction.

Among chemotherapeutic agents used in the management of metastatic breast cancer, vinorelbine has demonstrated the greatest antitumour synergy with trastuzumab in preclinical models. Furthermore, the weekly administration of both agents and the lack of overlapping toxicity between these drugs make this combination suitable for further investigation. Several single institution or national phase II trials have been conducted with this regimen as first-line therapy or in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer. These studies consistently demonstrated high efficacy with limited toxicities.

This international, open-label, phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this combination as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer.

### Treatment of breast cancer in a patient with sickle cell disease [^a69155a2]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We present a woman in her 30s with sickle cell disease (SCD) treated with monthly exchange transfusions who had suffered cerebrovascular complications, presented with a 4-cm left breast mass and was ultimately diagnosed with Estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (ER+HER2/Neu+) invasive ductal carcinoma with axillary metastasis. She was treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy, followed by a left-modified radical mastectomy and had residual invasive disease. She received postmastectomy radiation followed by adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine. Given the ER positivity, she also began adjuvant ovarian suppression (OS) and an aromatase inhibitor (AI). Throughout treatment, her SCD remained well-controlled, highlighting the potential for effective and tolerable cancer therapy in patients with SCD and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. This case underscores the importance of tailored oncological management and the need for further research on chemotherapy safety in this population.

### Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeted therapies in breast cancer [^b2d70049]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was acknowledged as an important therapeutic target in breast cancer more than 25 years ago. Subsequently, significant basic science and translational discoveries have resulted in the approval of four HER2-targeted therapies over the past 15 years. This editorial discusses future challenges regarding selection and development of treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer, which can only be met by continuing to support research efforts into the basic mechanisms by which cancer cells escape targeted therapies. Identifying specific molecular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity or resistance to each HER2-targeted agent will ultimately allow individualized therapy for each patient.

### Is cardiotoxicity being adequately assessed in current trials of cytotoxic and targeted agents in breast cancer? [^c7c0ca55]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

The cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines, trastuzumab and other agents is of special importance to adjuvant breast cancer patients whose life expectancy is restored to normal but who may be left with cardiac abnormalities that can present years later. We systematically reviewed the design of current trials (including adjuvant studies) on the clinicaltrials.gov Web site. Surprisingly few specify primary or secondary cardiac end points. Although cardiac ultrasound (echocardiography) and multiple uptake gated acquisition scintigraphy remain the most frequent techniques for estimating left ventricular ejection fraction, there is no consistency in the degree of reduction from baseline or absolute value taken as indicating cardiotoxicity. The details given do not suggest that diastolic function (which may give earlier warning of problems) is a focus of interest. There is growing interest in troponin as a marker of myocyte death and brain natriuretic peptide as a marker of myocardial stress and possible heart failure (though their clinical usefulness has still to be adequately defined). The duration of follow-up in many adjuvant studies may not be sufficient to determine the risk of late cardiac events. The findings indicate a need to study and standardize cardiac toxicity assessments in oncology trials.

### Trastuzumab-associated cardiac events at 8 years of median follow-up in the herceptin adjuvant trial (BIG 1–01) [^dc66bd41]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To document the rate and outcome of trastuzumab-associated cardiac dysfunction in patients following 1 or 2 years of adjuvant therapy.

Patients and Methods

The Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial is a three-arm, randomized trial comparing 2 years or 1 year of trastuzumab with observation in 5,102 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive early-stage breast cancer. Cardiac function was closely monitored. Eligible patients had left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 55% at study entry following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. This 8-year median follow-up analysis considered patients randomly assigned to 2 years or 1 year of trastuzumab or observation.

Results

The as-treated safety population for 2 years of trastuzumab (n = 1,673), 1 year of trastuzumab (n = 1,682), and observation (n = 1,744) is reported. Cardiac adverse events leading to discontinuation of trastuzumab occurred in 9.4% of patients in the 2-year arm and 5.2% of patients in the 1-year arm. Cardiac death, severe congestive heart failure (CHF), and confirmed significant LVEF decrease remained low in all three arms. The incidence of severe CHF (0.8%, 0.8%, and 0.0%, respectively) and confirmed significant LVEF decrease (7.2%, 4.1%, and 0.9%, respectively) was significantly higher in the 2-year and 1-year trastuzumab arms compared with the observation arm. Severe CHF was the same for 2-year and 1-year trastuzumab. Of patients with confirmed LVEF decrease receiving 2-year trastuzumab, 87.5% reached acute recovery. Of patients with confirmed LVEF decrease receiving 1-year trastuzumab, 81.2% reached acute recovery.

Conclusion

Long-term assessment at 8-year median follow-up confirms the low incidence of cardiac events for trastuzumab given sequentially after chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and cardiac events were reversible in the vast majority of patients.

### Cardiac safety of reduced cardiotoxicity surveillance during HER2-Targeted therapy [^9ecf02a3]. JACC: CardioOncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Evidence to support the optimal timing of cardiac imaging for CTRCD surveillance before and during cardiotoxic cancer therapy remains limited, and the value of this practice is influenced by several different factors, including the class of cancer therapy used, the likelihood and clinical severity of CTRCD, and overall prognosis of the patient. As patients with HER2-positive breast cancer increasingly receive non-anthracycline chemotherapy regimens associated with low CTRCD risk, this raises the question of whether routine cardiac imaging for CTRCD surveillance every 3 months (as recommended by current guidelines) is necessary. In the present prospective study, we show that reduced CTRCD surveillance (every 6 months) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer receiving a non-anthracycline–based regimen is noninferior to more frequent guideline-recommended cardiac imaging every 3 months (per historical control), with incidences of HF and asymptomatic CTRCD of 0% and 0.5%, respectively. Furthermore, reduced CTRCD surveillance was feasible for 73.2% of enrolled patients in an intention-to-treat analysis and for 79.9% of patients in a per-protocol analysis. Deviation from the reduced schedule of CTRCD surveillance occurred to evaluate for possible cardiac symptoms in 10.0% of patients; however, none were diagnosed with symptomatic CTRCD. Overall, our findings suggest that reducing the frequency of cardiac imaging for CTRCD surveillance may be appropriate in patients receiving HER2-targeted regimens associated with low risk of CTRCD.

The therapeutic window of HER2-targeted agents such as trastuzumab, which are mainstays for treatment of HER2-overexpressing solid tumors, is limited by risk of CTRCD, especially when administered sequentially with anthracycline chemotherapy. Non-anthracycline regimens that are associated with low risk of CTRCD have been developed for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer and are endorsed by the NCCN, based on trials in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and metastatic settings. In a single-arm phase II trial of adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab for patients with stage I-II HER2-positive breast cancer, incidence of HF was 0.5% and asymptomatic LVEF decline was 3.2%. Similarly, in neoadjuvant trials of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab administered with non-anthracycline chemotherapy, < 1% of patients developed HF and ∼3%-4% developed asymptomatic LVEF decline. Importantly, patients enrolled in these trials underwent frequent LVEF assessment every 2 to 4 cycles (∼6–12 weeks) of HER2-targeted treatment for CTRCD surveillance and were carefully monitored with cardiac safety stopping rules.

### Association of cardiovascular disease risk factors with late cardiotoxicity and survival in HER2-positive breast cancer survivors [^587140ae]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Breast cancer and cardiovascular (CV) diseases often share the same risk factors. It is increasingly important to identify risk factors for CV events in patients with high-risk breast cancer and explore optimal treatment regimens.

Experimental Design

Early HER2-positive breast cancer patients at our institution between January 1998 and October 2009 were reviewed. Primary outcome was late-severe-CV-event-free survival, and late severe CV events were defined as cardiovascular death, cardiomyopathy, symptomatic heart failure, and myocardial infarction developing 2+ years after breast cancer diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazard regressions, and restricted mean survival time were used to evaluate outcomes.

Results

We identified 2,448 consecutive eligible patients with a median follow-up time of 111.0 months (interquartile range, 52.0–151.8 months). One hundred and thirty-six patients had late severe CV events and 752 died of any cause [533 (70.9%) died of primary breast cancer; 12 (1.6%) died of cardiovascular disease]. Hypertension [HR, 1.546; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.030–2.320; P = 0.036] and history of coronary artery disease (CAD; HR, 3.333; 95% CI, 1.669–6.656; P < 0.001) were associated with worse late-severe-CV-event-free survival. Anthracycline-containing regimens (HR, 1.536; 95% CI, 0.979–2.411; P = 0.062) was not a significant risk factor for CV events in multivariate analysis. Regimens containing both anthracycline and anti-HER2 therapy were prognostic for better OS (HR, 0.515; 95% CI, 0.412–0.643; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Hypertension and CAD history were independent prognostic factors for late severe CV events. Adding anti-HER2 agents to anthracycline-containing regimens did not substantially increase the risk for late severe cardiotoxicity and conferred better overall survival.

Invasive breast cancer — adjuvant systemic therapy after preoperative therapy (HR-positive/HER2-positive) indicates for ypT0N0 or pCR that endocrine therapy (category 1) + complete (up to) 1 year of HER2-directed therapy with trastuzumab (category 1) ± pertuzumab is used, with trastuzumab + pertuzumab (category 1) if node positive at initial staging. Consider extended adjuvant neratinib following adjuvant trastuzumab-containing therapy for patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive disease with the perceived high risk of recurrence; the benefit or toxicities associated with extended neratinib in patients who have received pertuzumab or ado-trastuzumab emtansine is unknown. Updated results from the adjuvant APHINITY trial in HER2-positive early breast cancer, with a median follow-up of 8.4 years, have confirmed the benefit of adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in preventing recurrences.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:

Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Infusion Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Pulmonary Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving Herceptin in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia. Adverse reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of Herceptin treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) that were increased (≥ 5% difference) in the Herceptin arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia.

The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of treatment on the Herceptin-containing arm in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia.

Adjuvant Breast Cancer

The information below reflects exposure to one-year Herceptin therapy across three randomized, open-label studies, Studies 1, 2, and 3, with (n = 3678) or without (n = 3363) trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.

European Heart Journal: Cardiovascular Imaging (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, more specifically with respect to patients receiving anti-HER2 therapies (management of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction), EHA/ESC/ESTRO/IC-OS 2022 guidelines recommend to consider continuing HER2-targeted therapy with more frequent cardiac monitoring in patients developing asymptomatic moderate (LVEF 40–49%) cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction.
