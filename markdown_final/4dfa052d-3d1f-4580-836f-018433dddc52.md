## Question

What are the risks associated with HRT in postmenopausal women?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational randomized evidence and absolute risk framing. Then, I should verify how risks vary by timing of initiation and age. Next, I will examine formulation-specific risks, including estrogen–progestin versus estrogen-alone and route of administration. After that, I need to review cancer risks, including breast, endometrial, and ovarian. I will then consider cardiovascular and thromboembolic risks, followed by cerebrovascular and dementia risks. Finally, I should integrate guideline-based counseling, risk mitigation strategies, and a concise synthesis of absolute risks to guide shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the foundational evidence base and absolute risk framing. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials provide the highest-quality data for combined estrogen–progestin and estrogen-alone regimens, showing that combined therapy increases coronary events, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and breast cancer, while reducing fractures and colorectal cancer; absolute excesses were on the order of 7–8 additional events per 10,000 woman-years for CHD, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and invasive breast cancer over about 5 years, with corresponding reductions in hip fractures and colorectal cancer, and no significant effect on all-cause mortality during the trial [^111Um91k] [^112bLkXm]. Hold on, I should verify the absolute risk language I'm using; NAMS operationalizes "rare" as less than 10 events per 10,000 women per year, which aligns with how these WHI absolute differences are typically communicated in practice [^111KHkfi].

> Next, I should review how timing of initiation modifies risk. The timing hypothesis is supported by multiple analyses: when therapy is started in women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause, absolute risks of CHD, stroke, and VTE are lower, and some observational reanalyses suggest neutral or favorable effects on CHD and mortality, whereas initiation after 60 or more than 10 years post-menopause carries higher absolute risks and less favorable benefit–risk profiles; this is consistently reflected in NAMS and Endocrine Society guidance and in cardiovascular reviews [^111ioqqJ] [^112PurCg] [^114WrBok]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude claim; yes, NAMS notes that absolute attributable risks are low in the 50–59 or within-10-year group and higher when starting at older ages or further from menopause, reinforcing individualized risk assessment rather than a blanket cutoff [^115G8fey].

> I will now examine formulation-specific risks, starting with combined estrogen–progestin versus estrogen-alone. Combined therapy is consistently associated with higher breast cancer risk than estrogen-alone, with risk rising with duration and appearing earlier with continuous daily progestogen; estrogen-alone in women after hysterectomy did not increase breast cancer in the WHI and may reduce it, though observational data suggest risk can emerge with very long-term use, so I need to be cautious in extrapolation [^111Um91k] [^111sjpgh]. Let me double-check the large meta-analytic estimates; the Lancet individual participant meta-analysis shows excess breast cancer risk even in years 1–4 for combined therapy and a smaller but definite excess for estrogen-alone, with risk approximately doubling from years 5–14 and attenuating after cessation, which supports counseling on duration and regimen choice [^1172ubhQ] [^111kTSx7].

> Now, route of administration matters for thrombotic risk, so I should confirm that. Oral systemic estrogen increases VTE risk via hepatic first-pass effects, whereas transdermal estrogen has not been associated with increased VTE in observational syntheses and is preferred in women with higher thrombotic risk; micronized progesterone may be less thrombogenic than some synthetic progestins, though comparative randomized data are limited, so I should frame this as risk-mitigation rather than risk elimination [^116Z1oMG] [^113r69Zv]. Hold on, I should verify whether lower oral doses reduce VTE; yes, lower-dose oral estrogen likely confers less VTE risk than higher doses, but transdermal remains the preferred route when VTE risk is a concern [^116Z1oMG].

> Let me consider endometrial risk next. Unopposed systemic estrogen substantially increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, so in women with a uterus, a progestogen is required; continuous combined therapy provides the most protective endometrial profile, whereas sequential regimens carry more risk than continuous, and dose minimization of progestogen can be balanced against endometrial protection in shared decision-making [^11414ULv] [^114j5jMk]. I should confirm that vaginal estrogen for GSM does not materially increase endometrial risk; low-dose vaginal estrogen has minimal systemic exposure and is not associated with increased endometrial hyperplasia in trials, supporting its use for genitourinary symptoms when systemic therapy is not indicated [^111ZzYLd].

> Breast cancer risk deserves careful quantification and counseling. The WHI combined-therapy arm showed a modest increase in invasive breast cancer, while the estrogen-alone arm in hysterectomized women did not show an increase and may have shown a decrease; however, large observational meta-analyses indicate a duration-dependent increase for both combined and estrogen-alone therapy, with higher risk for daily continuous progestogen and attenuation with cessation, and some excess persisting beyond 10 years after long use [^111Um91k] [^1172ubhQ] [^111kTSx7]. Wait, I should double-check the absolute risk translation; for 5 years of use starting at 50, the Lancet estimates roughly 1 extra case per 50 users of combined therapy and 1 per 200 users of estrogen-alone, with risk scaling with longer duration, which is useful for shared decision-making discussions [^1172ubhQ] [^111kTSx7].

> I need to check ovarian cancer risk as well. Observational data suggest a small increase in ovarian cancer with long-term estrogen-only therapy, with risk rising after about 5 years and returning toward baseline after cessation; given heterogeneity and confounding, I should present this as a possible small risk signal rather than a definitive causal effect, especially when counseling on duration [^notfound]. But wait, what if the patient has a BRCA mutation or strong family history; in that context, individualized oncology input is prudent because baseline risk and gene–environment interactions may alter the risk–benefit calculus for systemic therapy [^113bk3sm].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular and thromboembolic risks with attention to timing. The WHI combined-therapy trial showed increased risks of CHD, stroke, and VTE, with absolute excesses in the range of 6–8 per 10,000 woman-years over about 5 years; importantly, subgroup analyses and subsequent meta-analyses suggest lower absolute risks and more favorable CHD profiles when therapy is initiated in women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause, though VTE risk remains elevated even in earlier initiators [^111Um91k] [^116rZnfb]. Hold on, I should verify the VTE point; yes, even in women starting within 10 years of menopause, VTE risk is increased, albeit with smaller absolute excess than in older starters, reinforcing the role of route and dose selection to mitigate thrombosis [^116rZnfb] [^116Z1oMG].

> I will now examine cerebrovascular outcomes and dementia. WHI and pooled analyses show an increased risk of ischemic stroke with systemic hormone therapy, with the highest risks observed when initiation occurs after age 60 or more than 10 years post-menopause; in women aged 65 years or older, systemic therapy also increased the risk of dementia, whereas no cognitive benefit was observed in younger initiators, so timing and age at initiation materially affect this risk domain [^111Um91k] [^1123aAk6] [^111bY2xw]. Wait, let me verify the dementia signal; the increased dementia risk was seen in the late-initiation cohort and is not generalizable to younger, newly menopausal users, which is crucial for counseling on timing [^1123aAk6].

> Let me synthesize absolute risk to make this concrete. For women initiating combined therapy at age 50–59, the absolute excess risk of breast cancer is about 3 per 1,000 over 5 years, VTE about 8 per 10,000 per year, stroke about 8 per 10,000 per year, and CHD about 7 per 10,000 per year; for estrogen-alone, breast cancer risk is lower, with an excess near 1 per 1,000 over 5 years, and VTE risk is also lower than with combined therapy, though still present with oral formulations; these figures align with WHI and NAMS risk communication guidance and help contextualize rare but important harms [^111P6Njs] [^111KHkfi] [^111Um91k]. I should confirm that these are population averages; individual risk varies with baseline VTE, stroke, and breast cancer risk, so personalized calculators and shared decision tools are appropriate adjuncts [^114WrBok].

> Next, I should review guideline-based counseling and risk mitigation. Major societies converge on using HRT primarily for bothersome vasomotor or genitourinary symptoms, avoiding routine use for chronic disease prevention, and individualizing based on age, time since menopause, comorbidities, and preferences; when used, employ the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration, prefer transdermal estrogen when VTE risk is a concern, and use micronized progesterone when a progestogen is needed, with annual reassessment of risks and benefits [^111ioqqJ] [^112PurCg] [^114UWJ1K]. Hold on, I should verify the stance on prevention; USPSTF issues a D recommendation against MHT for primary prevention of chronic conditions, which supports focusing indications on symptom control and select bone-health scenarios rather than cardioprotection or cancer prevention [^112RSuzA] [^112RSuzA].

> I need to ensure contraindications and special populations are addressed. Systemic HRT is contraindicated in women with prior venous thromboembolism, active or recent breast cancer, undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding, or high cardiovascular risk profiles, and caution is warranted in women with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack; in women with a uterus, unopposed estrogen should be avoided, and in BRCA carriers or those with substantial breast cancer risk, individualized oncology input is advised before systemic therapy [^114ExMCw] [^113bk3sm]. Let me reconsider the VTE point; transdermal therapy is reasonable in women with elevated VTE risk who strongly desire systemic therapy after counseling, acknowledging observational data and the absence of definitive randomized comparisons [^116Z1oMG].

> Finally, I should double-check that the practical counseling points are explicit. Women should be counseled that combined therapy carries higher breast cancer risk than estrogen-alone, that risks rise with duration and with later initiation, that transdermal estrogen reduces thrombotic risk compared with oral, that vaginal estrogen is effective and safe for GSM with minimal systemic risk, and that therapy should be periodically re-evaluated with consideration of tapering or discontinuation once symptoms abate or new risk factors arise [^1172ubhQ] [^111ioqqJ] [^111ZzYLd]. If I missed anything, I should verify with shared decision tools and risk calculators to ensure the discussion is tailored to the patient's baseline risks and preferences, which is central to contemporary menopausal care [^114WrBok].

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women carries **modest absolute risks** that vary by age, timing, regimen, and duration [^115G8fey]. The main risks are **breast cancer** with combined estrogen–progestin (especially with long-term use) [^1172ubhQ], venous thromboembolism (VTE) [^111Um91k], and stroke, with no clear increase in coronary heart disease when started in women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause [^114WrBok]. Estrogen-only therapy is associated with a lower breast cancer risk than combined therapy [^1172ubhQ] and does not increase endometrial cancer risk when used without a progestogen [^notfound]. Transdermal estrogen lowers VTE risk compared with oral forms [^116Z1oMG]. HRT is not recommended for primary prevention of chronic conditions [^112RSuzA], and decisions should be individualized with the lowest effective dose and periodic reassessment [^1157hBxF].

---

## Breast cancer risk

- **Combined estrogen–progestin therapy**: Increases breast cancer risk with long-term use; risk rises with duration and is higher with daily progestogen [^1172ubhQ] [^111kTSx7].
- **Estrogen-only therapy**: Lower breast cancer risk than combined therapy; some data suggest a slight increase only with prolonged use [^1172ubhQ] [^111sdCaC].
- **Timing and duration**: Risk increases with longer use and is higher when started soon after menopause; risk declines after stopping [^1172ubhQ] [^115fTnoy].

---

## Cardiovascular risk

- **Coronary heart disease (CHD)**: Increased risk with combined therapy, especially when started in women over 60 or > 10 years postmenopause; no clear increase when started in women < 60 or within 10 years of menopause [^114WrBok] [^111Um91k].
- **Stroke**: Increased risk of ischemic stroke with both estrogen-only and combined therapy, particularly in older women or those starting > 10 years postmenopause [^114WrBok] [^112QPREW].
- **Venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: Increased risk with oral estrogen, especially with high doses; transdermal estrogen has lower VTE risk [^116Z1oMG] [^1178U8Q1].

---

## Endometrial cancer risk

Unopposed estrogen increases **endometrial cancer risk** [^1123aAk6]; adding a progestogen mitigates this risk [^1146ThMd]. Combined therapy with adequate progestogen does not increase endometrial cancer risk [^111Um91k].

---

## Ovarian cancer risk

Long-term estrogen-only therapy may be associated with a **slight increase in ovarian cancer risk**; combined therapy does not show a consistent increase [^1123aAk6] [^116EhNVU].

---

## Dementia and cognitive effects

Starting HRT after age 65 may increase **dementia risk**; no clear cognitive benefit or harm when started in younger women [^1123aAk6].

---

## Other risks

Other risks include **gallbladder disease**, with an increased risk of gallstones and cholecystitis with estrogen therapy [^111bZDtk], and **urinary incontinence**, with an increased risk reported with both estrogen-only and combined therapy [^1123aAk6].

---

## Factors influencing risk

- **Age and timing**: Risks are lower when HRT is started in women < 60 or within 10 years of menopause; risks rise with age and time since menopause [^114WrBok] [^115G8fey].
- **Regimen**: Transdermal estrogen has lower VTE risk than oral; micronized progesterone may have lower breast cancer risk than synthetic progestins [^116Z1oMG].
- **Duration**: Longer use increases breast cancer and other risks; use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^1172ubhQ] [^113CmpaW].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Indications**: HRT is appropriate for bothersome vasomotor symptoms and osteoporosis prevention in appropriately selected women [^111ioqqJ] [^116L6LEC].
- **Contraindications**: Avoid in women with breast cancer, VTE, stroke, or high cardiovascular risk [^114ExMCw] [^1164dZpo].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess risks and benefits annually; individualize therapy and use the lowest effective dose [^114UWJ1K] [^1157hBxF].

### Assessing benefits and harms of hormone replacement therapy: clinical applications [^113U5vbf]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

An estimated one third of postmenopausal women in the United States use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat symptoms of menopause and prevent chronic conditions. In the context of this widespread use, evidence has been growing about the potential harms of HRT, particularly regarding long-term use. Physicians and patients are often confused about how to use results of studies in individual cases. This article applies the current state of evidence for the benefits and harms of HRT to management decisions in 4 clinical situations. Patient preferences, as well as evidence, are important for these decisions. Benefits and harms need to be readdressed periodically to apply newly published evidence and to reassess emerging risks, comorbidities, and needs of individuals.

### Hormone-replacement therapy and breast cancer [^114iPu97]. The Lancet: Oncology (2002). Medium credibility.

Hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has been available for many years, but the important question of its place in development and progression of breast cancer remains controversial; provision of reliable risk estimates has been hampered by a lack of controlled data. Observational evidence suggests that the risk of breast cancer may be increased only if HRT is used long term (ie, for longer than 10 years) and that the risk falls when use ceases. Systematic bias and the lack of adequately powered studies prevent any firm clinical recommendations about the prescription of differing HRT regimens and risk, or the effect of HRT on breast-cancer proliferation and mortality. This review aims to summarise current clinical data, justifying the need for prospective controlled trials in healthy women as well as those at higher risk of breast cancer or with a personal history of the disease.

### Current perspectives on benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy [^1123uSfv]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen alone or with added progestin relieves menopausal symptoms and physical changes associated with depleted endogenous estrogen levels. Estrogen replacement has also demonstrated a clear benefit in the prevention of osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy with added progestin maintains spinal bone density, protects against postmenopausal hip fractures, and provides these benefits even when therapy is started after age 60. More recently, additional benefits have emerged. Current estrogen and hormone replacement therapy users have a 34% reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer and a 20% to 60% reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Until recently, the body of evidence indicated that hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only reduced cardiovascular disease risk by 40% to 50% in healthy patients; whether the findings of 3 ongoing trials will change this conclusion is pending availability of the final results. The many benefits of estrogen and hormone replacement therapy must be weighed against a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer diagnosis with use for 5 or more years, but which disappears following cessation of therapy. Overall, estrogen and hormone replacement therapy improves the quality of life and increases life expectancy for most menopausal women.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^116DhHJr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Women are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with men. While traditional risk factors for CVD seem to disproportionately affect women and contribute to this disparity, increased prevalence of CVD at midlife calls into question the contribution of menopause. Given the potential role that declining hormone levels play in this transition, menopause hormone therapies (MHT) have been proposed as a strategy for risk factor reduction. Unfortunately, trials have not consistently shown cardiovascular benefit with use, and several describe significant risks. Notably, the timing of hormone administration seems to play a role in its relative risks and benefits. At present, MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. For women who may benefit from the associated vasomotor, genitourinary, and/or bone health properties of MHT, CVD risks should be taken into account prior to administration. Further research is needed to assess routes, dosing, and formulations of MHT in order to elucidate appropriate timing for administration. Here, we aim to review both traditional and sex-specific risk factors contributing to increased CVD risk in women with a focus on menopause, understand cardiovascular effects of MHT through a review of several landmark clinical trials, summarize guidelines for appropriate MHT use, and discuss a comprehensive strategy for reducing CV risk in women.

### When is it appropriate to prescribe postmenopausal hormone therapy? [^1164dZpo]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence and consensus-based recommendations for the use of hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women.

Design

Using evidence from clinical trials and other publications, a multidisciplinary group of women's health experts developed consensus-based recommendations for HT use in more than 300 clinical scenarios. These panelists utilized the RAND Appropriateness Method and a quantitative scale to rate the appropriateness of treatment options for women with various risk factors and clinical scenarios.

Results

The panel judged it appropriate to prescribe all forms of HT to women with intolerable menopause symptoms and usual (age-expected) risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), venous thromboembolism (VTE), or stroke. Use of HT was judged not appropriate for the clinical scenarios of bone preservation, cosmetic appearance, current memory loss, loss of libido, or CVD protection. For a woman still using HT after 5 or more years, it was considered appropriate to recommend the options of stopping or lowering the dose even if stopping was previously attempted. In treating intolerable symptoms in the presence of some elevated risk for diseases related to HT, route of administration may affect appropriateness but prior stroke or TIA# is a contraindication.

Conclusions

Standard HT is appropriate for women with intolerable menopause symptoms in the absence of HT-related risk factors (eg, CVD, stroke, VTE, breast cancer). Panelists judged it appropriate to repeatedly present the option of stopping or reducing the dose. In most cases, presence of risk factors makes standard-dose oral HT not appropriate; however, some women may be candidates for a different dose or route of administration.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116zFqH3]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in July 2008 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the July 2008 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel' s recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. Also participating in the review process were other interested organizations who then endorsed the document.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Areas that vary from the 2008 position statement are noted. A suggested reading list of key references published since the last statement is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable for women who initiate HT close to menopause but decreases in older women and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy in clinical perspective [^1121rYHE]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Although many of the risks and benefits of postmenopausal hormone therapy are known, only recently has the magnitude of these effects and their perspective to other therapies become more fully understood. Careful review of randomized controlled trials indicates that the risks of postmenopausal hormone therapy including breast cancer, stroke and venous thromboembolism are similar to other commonly used agents. Overall, these risks are rare (less than 1 event per 1,000 women) and even rarer when initiated in women less than 60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause. In addition, the literature indicates similar benefit of postmenopausal hormone therapy, in women who initiate hormone therapy in close proximity to menopause, to other medications used for the primary prevention of coronory heart disease in women.

### Counseling in menopausal women: how to address the benefits and risks of menopause hormone therapy. A FIGO position paper [^116yTPVn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Menopause marks the end of menstrual cyclicity and, depending on individual vulnerability, has several consequences related to gonadal steroid deprivation, especially if it is premature. Menopause may be more burdensome for some women than for others. Individual factors, such as personal history, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and current health conditions, affect symptomatology and, thereby, the menopausal experience. In addition, some menopausal symptoms, such as severe hot flashes, sleep disorders, and depression, are markers of future health risks. Counseling is a fundamental part of health care in the peri- and postmenopause periods. It must include an assessment of the patient's symptoms, needs, desires, and risk profile to address the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on an individual basis and promote a healthy lifestyle. Indeed, healthcare practitioners can and must protect the health and lives of mid-life women by increasing awareness of menopausal symptoms and ensuring healthcare options, especially MHT. The type and duration of MHT should be tailored based on the patient's history, menopausal age, physical characteristics, and current health status so that the benefits always outweigh the risks. This FIGO position paper focuses on the benefits and risks of MHT on health domains, target organs, and systems, and on systemic and vaginal MHT regimens, to provide indications that can be used in the clinical practice for menopausal counseling. Moreover, it offers insights into what FIGO considers the mainstay for the healthcare management of women in peri- and postmenopause, worldwide.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: current status and unanswered questions [^113vg7ma]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Many women take hormone therapy (HT) for menopausal symptom relief. Studies have tried to clarify whether various factors can modify the risk of HT, such as the age at initiation, dose, duration, or type of HT, or characteristics of the individual, such as family history or body mass index. The relative risks of breast cancer associated with HT across various subgroups of women should be considered similar, but absolute risks can vary significantly among women and this may inform individual decision making. For breast cancer survivors, systemic HT should be discouraged.

### Hormone-replacement therapy: current thinking [^111ZZbUb]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

For several decades, the role of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has been debated. Early observational data on HRT showed many benefits, including a reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality. More recently, randomized trials, including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), studying mostly women many years after the the onset of menopause, showed no such benefit and, indeed, an increased risk of CHD and breast cancer, which led to an abrupt decrease in the use of HRT. Subsequent reanalyzes of data from the WHI with age stratification, newer randomized and observational data and several meta-analyses now consistently show reductions in CHD and mortality when HRT is initiated soon after menopause. HRT also significantly decreases the incidence of various symptoms of menopause and the risk of osteoporotic fractures, and improves quality of life. In younger healthy women (aged 50–60 years), the risk-benefit balance is positive for using HRT, with risks considered rare. As no validated primary prevention strategies are available for younger women (< 60 years of age), other than lifestyle management, some consideration might be given to HRT as a prevention strategy as treatment can reduce CHD and all-cause mortality. Although HRT should be primarily oestrogen-based, no particular HRT regimen can be advocated.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: July 2008 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^112H6TEs]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in March 2007 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Design

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the March 2007 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. The document was provided to other interested organizations to seek their endorsement.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Conclusions that vary from the 2007 position statement are highlighted. Addenda include a discussion of risk concepts, a new component not included in the 2007 paper, and a recommended list of areas for future HT research. A suggested reading list of key references is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable close to menopause but decreases with aging and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^111Bw5aY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent improvements in sex and gender research in cardiovascular disease (CVD), disparities still exist. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) in particular remains a leading cause of death in women. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include biological, social, environmental, and economic factors. While men and women share many traditional risk factors for CVD, these alone do not explain the sex-specific increased risk of CVD in women. Additional female-specific risk factors, most notably menopause, contribute significantly. Menopause has been associated with an increased CVD risk in women aged ⩾55 years. The transition to menopause has shown to be associated with negative alterations in the lipid profile, increased susceptibility to weight gain and metabolic syndrome, and both epicardial and paracardial fat deposition. – It represents a vulnerable time for women and an opportunity for consideration of menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

In prior decades, MHT was thought to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, large trials demonstrating the risks of MHT have changed clinician and public perception of these strategies. As our understanding of MHT has evolved, so has our knowledge regarding the appropriate timing and patient characteristics for safe administration. Given the efficacy of MHT in reducing the unpleasant vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, which can severely alter quality of life, understanding the safety and potential cardiovascular (CV) risks and benefits of MHT is important in optimizing the health of our female patients.

### Hormone therapy: evolving concepts [^116C75ea]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the medical literature published in 2002 regarding menopausal hormone therapy and its impact on clinical practice.

Methods

A literature search was performed using MEDLINE with the keywords of menopause, sex steroids, and hormone replacement therapy. Randomized clinical trials were reviewed. An evidence-based review is presented.

Results

Menopausal hormone therapy has undergone radical change since the publication of the Women's Health Initiative randomized prospective trial of combined estrogen plus progestin therapy for disease prevention. After a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the E + P versus placebo trial of 16,608 women was stopped because the health risks of taking E + P exceeded the benefits. An increase in breast cancer risk, coupled with an adverse trend in overall risk-benefit ratio, reached the preset stopping boundaries. In addition, there was an increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. The decreased risks seen for osteoporotic fracture and colorectal cancer were outweighed by the above risks. The FDA has required mandatory label changes for all hormone products based on these findings. The Women's Health Initiative found that treatment with estrogen plus progestin for up to 5 years is not beneficial overall. There is early harm for coronary heart disease, continuing harm for stroke and venous thromboembolism, and increasing harm for breast cancer. This risk-benefit profile is not consistent with a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases in postmenopausal women. Menopausal hormone therapy should be reserved for women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.

Conclusions

In the past 20 years, menopause has become a household word, with much better understanding of its consequences. The growing numbers of menopausal women and clinical trials have coincided to draw increasing attention to the perimenopausal and menopausal years. Better studies of older therapies and the expanded number of new choices today, with more in development and evaluation, have complicated provider and patient choices but greatly improved the potential for effective intervention.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116L6LEC]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Osteoporosis key points — Hormone therapy prevents bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, with dose-dependent effects on bone density (Level I), and hormone therapy reduces fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal women (Level I). Hormone therapy is FDA approved for prevention of bone loss, but not for treatment of osteoporosis (Level I). In the absence of contraindications, in women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, systemic hormone therapy is an appropriate therapy to protect against bone loss (Level I). Unless contraindicated, women with premature menopause without prior fragility fracture or osteoporosis are best served with hormone therapy or oral contraceptives to prevent bone density loss and reduce fracture risk, rather than other bone-specific treatments, until the average age of menopause, when treatment may be reassessed (Level II). Decisions regarding initiating and discontinuation of hormone therapy should be made primarily on the basis of extraskeletal benefits (ie, reduction of VMS) and risks (Level III).

### What the women's health initiative has taught us about menopausal hormone therapy [^111pvX15]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complex relationship between menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been informed by detailed analyses in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating MHT in postmenopausal women. Although the WHI demonstrated increased risk of CVD events with MHT in the overall cohort, subsequent secondary analyses demonstrated that these risks were influenced by the woman's age and time since menopause, with lower absolute risks and hazard ratios for younger than older women. As MHT is the most effective treatment for the vasomotor symptoms of menopause, it is important to understand its risks and how to conduct risk stratification for symptomatic women. In addition to reviewing the WHI findings, studies pre- and post-WHI are reviewed to describe the relationship between MHT and CVD risk in menopausal women. The absolute risks of adverse cardiovascular events for MHT initiated in women close to menopause are low, and all-cause mortality effects are neutral or even favorable for younger menopausal women. The WHI has advanced and refined our understanding of the relationship between MHT and CVD risk. Although MHT should not be used for CVD prevention, absolute risks of CVD are low when MHT is started close to menopause in healthy women and hazard ratios tend to be lower for younger than older women. For women in early menopause and without contraindications to treatment, the benefits of MHT are likely to outweigh the risks when used for menopausal symptom management.

### The 2012 hormone therapy position statement of: the North American Menopause Society [^114YryjJ]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This position statement aimed to update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2010 regarding recommendations for hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women. This updated position statement further distinguishes the emerging differences in the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio between estrogen therapy (ET) and combined estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) at various ages and time intervals since menopause onset.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of expert clinicians and researchers in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2010 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement.

Results

Current evidence supports the use of HT for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women when the balance of potential benefits and risks is favorable for the individual woman. This position statement reviews the effects of ET and EPT on many aspects of women's health and recognizes the greater safety profile associated with ET.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture. The more favorable benefit-risk ratio for ET allows more flexibility in extending the duration of use compared with EPT, where the earlier appearance of increased breast cancer risk precludes a recommendation for use beyond 3 to 5 years.

Research needs and gaps — more research is needed on whether age or timing of initiation of hormone therapy with respect to menopause affects health outcomes; on whether the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy vary across population groups, including understanding whether therapy might have a different magnitude or balance of harms or benefits across racial and ethnic groups and how an individual patient data meta-analysis might inform this; and on the comparative benefits and harms of different formulations and treatment durations of menopausal hormone therapy.

### Hormone replacement and the prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113VK1rX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Recently, there has been considerable discussion about the benefits and risks of using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for cardiovascular protection in postmenopausal women. Numerous studies have addressed this issue, with conflicting results. Observational studies strongly suggest a benefit of HRT for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), whereas controlled trials that tested a single common regimen of estrogen plus progestin found no effect on CVD events or angiographic progression in older women with established CVD. More recently a primary prevention trial in high risk patients found reduced carotid atheroma with estrogen alone. A variety of combination therapies with various estrogens and progestins are now available. These formulations have significantly different effects on cardiovascular risk markers, which independently affect outcomes. This information should be considered when deciding whether to use HRT in an individual woman, and if so, which formulation to use.

Abstract

"The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" (NAMS) updates "The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2017 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Advisory Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of hormone therapy differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing therapy. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

### Rethinking menopausal hormone therapy: for whom, what, when, and how long? [^116rfD6e]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) was widely used in the past, but with the publication of seminal primary and secondary prevention trials that reported an excess cardiovascular risk with combined estrogen-progestin, HT use declined significantly. However, over the past 20 years, much has been learned about the relationship between the timing of HT use with respect to age and time since menopause, HT route of administration, and cardiovascular disease risk. Four leading medical societies recommend HT for the treatment of menopausal women with bothersome menopausal symptoms. In this context, this review, led by the American College of Cardiology Cardiolovascular Disease in Women Committee, along with leading gynecologists, women's health internists, and endocrinologists, aims to provide guidance on HT use, including the selection of patients and HT formulation with a focus on caring for symptomatic women with cardiovascular disease risk.

### Update on menopause hormone therapy; current indications and unanswered questions [^114pVtrs]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide clinicians involved in managing menopause with a summary of current evidence surrounding menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

Design

The authors evaluate and synthesize existing pooled evidence relating to MHT's clinical indications, efficacy, and safety and explore the limitations of existing data.

Patients

The review focuses on MHT-related outcomes in women with natural-timed menopause captured within observational studies, RCTs, and pooled data from pivotal meta-analyses and reviews.

Measurements

Available published data are scrutinized. Available evidence and notably lacking data from women not adequately represented in published MHT trials, such as those with socioeconomic adversity, significant comorbidities, and minority ethnic backgrounds, are highlighted and deliberated.

Results

The impact of MHT differs significantly between demographics. Current consensus recommendations for MHT emphasize the importance of tailoring type, route, dose, and duration of therapy to individual needs and risk/benefit ratio through shared decision-making. MHT impact can change over time. Current MHT data support its benefits for treating menopause symptoms and a potential window of opportunity in midlife to benefit skeletal health. Limitations of current evidence highlight menopause health inequalities and underscores the need for further research.

Conclusions

This review recommends tailored use of MHT for well-defined indications, recognizing its value for menopause symptom relief and skeletal benefits for many midlife women. MHT may be used as long as benefits outweigh risks, through shared decision-making. There is insufficient clinical evidence to support the long-term use of MHT in some contemporary cohorts of women accessing MHT in clinical practice.

### A comparative review of the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy regimens [^112rh8Ne]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial) investigated the effect of conjugated equine estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate on specific potential long-term benefits and risks. A review of the clinical studies that have investigated different types and regimens of estrogens combined with progestins was conducted to assess how applicable the results of the Women's Health Initiative are to hormone replacement therapy regimens in general. The studies that were reviewed were limited to randomized clinical trials and observational studies that have been published over the last 15 years (1987–2002) and to meta-analyses and reviews that may have included the literature before 1987. The increased risks for venous thromboembolism, stroke, coronary heart disease, and breast cancer that were identified in the Women's Health Initiative trial have also been reported with postmenopausal hormone therapies that contain a variety of estrogen and progestin products. The beneficial effects that were noted in the Women's Health Initiative, with respect to reductions in fractures and colorectal cancer, have not been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials that use different estrogen/progestin combinations; however, observational trials that used a variety of estrogen or hormone replacement therapy products and randomized clinical studies that evaluated bone mineral density (an excellent predictor of fracture risk) with different estrogen/hormone replacement therapy regimens would suggest that results would be similar to those found in the Women's Health Initiative. Although the relief of menopausal symptoms, the primary reason women seek treatment, was not included in the overall benefit/risk analysis of the Women's Health Initiative, numerous trials suggest that all therapies are effective. Overall, these data indicate that the benefit/risk analysis that was reported in the Women's Health Initiative can be generalized to all postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy products.

### Update in hormone therapy use in menopause [^116EhNVU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The original report from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) changed our understanding of the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Since that time, reanalysis of the WHI and additional data from other studies have further refined these concepts. Here we provide an update on recent advances in the field. Menopausal hormone therapy continues to have a clinical role in the management of vasomotor symptoms. However, our understanding of the role of hormones in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer continues to evolve. Further analyses of the effect of age and proximity to menopause at the time of initiation of therapy, duration of treatment, dose, route of administration, and the persistence of risks and benefits after stopping hormone therapy are described. In addition, recent data have emerged suggesting that there may be a link between hormone therapy and cancers of the lung and ovary. Finally, we discuss new advances in hormone therapy that will likely lead to a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, enabling safer effective menopausal symptom relief.

### Hormone replacement therapy and the risk of breast cancer [^115fTnoy]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is given to relieve the climacteric symptoms of menopause. Use of HRT reduced after a report from the Women's Health Initiative linked it to an increased risk of breast cancer. This association has been confirmed in several other studies, including the Million Women Study. The risk of breast cancer is greater for formulations that contain both estrogen and progesterone, compared with estrogen alone. The breast cancer risk associated with HRT is higher for estrogen receptor-positive cancers than for estrogen receptor-negative cancers, and for low-grade cancers compared with high-grade cancers. After cessation of HRT the increased risk of breast cancer dissipates within 2 years. The rapidity of the decline suggests that a proportion of breast cancers that are hormone dependent will regress if the hormonal stimulation is removed. In evaluating a woman who is considering HRT, factors that have been associated with an increased risk include the initiation of hormone use immediately after menopause, a lean body mass and high mammographic breast density.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Position Statement is designed to update the previous menopause clinical practice guidelines published in 2011 but does not replace them. The current document reviews new clinical trials published since then as well as new information regarding possible risks and benefits of therapies available for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. AACE reinforces the recommendations made in its previous guidelines and provides additional recommendations on the basis of new data. A summary regarding this position statement is listed below: New information available from randomized clinical trials and epidemiologic studies reported after 2011 was critically reviewed. No previous recommendations from the 2011 menopause clinical practice guidelines have been reversed or changed. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, SERMs, and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. New recommendations in this position statement include: 1.

Recommendation

the use of menopausal hormone therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women should be based on consideration of all risk factors for cardiovascular disease, age, and time from menopause. 2.

Recommendation

the use of transdermal as compared with oral estrogen preparations may be considered less likely to produce thrombotic risk and perhaps the risk of stroke and coronary artery disease. 3.

Recommendation

when the use of progesterone is necessary, micronized progesterone is considered the safer alternative. 4.

Recommendation

in symptomatic menopausal women who are at significant risk from the use of hormone replacement therapy, the use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and possibly other nonhormonal agents may offer significant symptom relief. 5.

Recommendation

AACE does not recommend use of bioidentical hormone therapy. 6.

Recommendation

AACE fully supports the recommendations of the Comité de l'Évolution des Pratiques en Oncologie regarding the management of menopause in women with breast cancer. 7.

Recommendation

HRT is not recommended for the prevention of diabetes. 8.

Recommendation

In women with previously diagnosed diabetes, the use of HRT should be individualized, taking in to account age, metabolic, and cardiovascular risk factors.

Menopausal hormone therapy — recommendations of other organizations state that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists "recommends against the use of menopausal hormone therapy for primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease", while also noting that women "in early menopause who are in good cardiovascular health and at low risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes should be considered candidates for the use of estrogen therapy or conjugated equine estrogen plus progestin for relief of menopausal symptoms" and that such therapy "is approved for use in women with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture"; the North American Menopause Society "recommends that hormone therapy should not be prescribed for chronic disease prevention", adding that extended duration "might be appropriate in symptomatic women or for the prevention of osteoporosis, if alternative therapies are not tolerated, based on a careful assessment of individual benefits and risks"; and the American Academy of Family Physicians "endorses the previous USPSTF recommendation on hormone therapy in postmenopausal persons".

### The 2017 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111yvUiD]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) updates the 2012 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1157hBxF]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

NAMS position statement — risk mitigation, monitoring, and continuation of hormone therapy in older women emphasizes that mitigation of risk through use of the lowest effective dose and potentially with a nonoral route of administration becomes increasingly important as women age and with longer duration of therapy, and that longer durations or extended use beyond age 65 should include periodic reevaluation of comorbidities with consideration of periodic trials of lowering or discontinuing hormone therapy. In the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional, and it remains an individual decision in select, well-counseled women aged older than 60 or 65 years to continue therapy, with no data to support routine discontinuation in women aged 65 years. For women with GSM, low-dose vaginal ET may be considered for use at any age and for extended duration, if needed.

### The timing hypothesis and hormone replacement therapy: a paradigm shift in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease in women. part 2: comparative risks [^114ruYbZ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Low credibility.

A major misperception concerning postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is that the associated risks are large in magnitude and unique to HRT, but over the past 10 years, sufficient data have accumulated so that the magnitude and perspective of risks associated with the primary coronary heart disease prevention therapies of statins, aspirin, and postmenopausal HRT have become more fully defined. Review of randomized controlled trials indicates that the risks of primary prevention therapies and other medications commonly used in women's health are of similar type and magnitude, with the majority of these risks categorized as rare to infrequent (< 1 event per 100 treated women). Evidence-based data show that the risks of postmenopausal HRT are predominantly rare (< 1 event per 1,000 treated women) and certainly no greater than other commonly used medications in women's health, including statins and aspirin. These risks, including breast cancer, stroke, and venous thromboembolism are common across medications and are rare, and even rarer when HRT is initiated in women younger than 60 or who are less than 10 years since menopause. In Part 1 of this series, the sex-specificity of statins and aspirin and timing of initiation of HRT as modifiers of efficacy in women were reviewed. Herein, the comparative risks of primary prevention therapies in women are discussed.

### Hormone therapy in menopause: concepts, controversies, and approach to treatment [^111VeXUA]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy (HT) is an effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Randomized trials also demonstrate positive effects on bone health, and age-stratified analyses indicate more favorable effects on coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality in younger women (close proximity to menopause) than in women more than a decade past menopause. In the absence of contraindications or other major comorbidities, recently menopausal women with moderate or severe symptoms are appropriate candidates for HT. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials-estrogen and progestin trial and the estrogen-alone trial-clarified the benefits and risks of HT, including how the results differed by age. A key lesson from the WHI trials, which was unfortunately lost in the posttrial cacophony, was that the risk:benefit ratio and safety profile of HT differed markedly by clinical characteristics of the participants, especially age, time since menopause, and comorbidity status. In the present review of the WHI and other recent HT trials, we aim to provide readers with an improved understanding of the importance of the timing of HT initiation, type and route of administration, and of patient-specific considerations that should be weighed when prescribing HT.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in peri-and postmenopausal women: March 2007 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114i3Dza]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2004 regarding recommendations for estrogen and progestogen use in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2004 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. The position statements published by NAMS do not represent "practice standards" that would be codified and held up as standards by regulating bodies and insurance agencies. Rather, they are prevailing opinion pieces in a best effort attempt to incorporate current evidence into practical clinical recommendations.

Results

With the primary goal being to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of peri- and postmenopausal estrogen therapy (ET) and estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) for both disease prevention and treatment of menopause-related symptoms, current evidence allowed for a clear distinction between areas of consensus and areas for which the Panel determined that there was inadequate evidence for any conclusion to be reached. The document lists all of these areas along with clear explanatory comments. A comprehensive list of key references is provided. The absence of evidence is also recognized in the list of needs for further research recommended by the Panel.

Conclusions

Current evidence supports the use of ET or EPT for menopause-related symptoms and disease prevention in appropriate populations of peri- and postmenopausal women.

[Level I] Long-term use of hormone therapy, including for women aged older than 60 years, may be considered in healthy women at low risk of CVD and breast cancer with persistent VMS or at elevated risk of fracture for whom other therapies are not appropriate. (Level III) Factors that should be considered include severity of symptoms, effectiveness of alternative nonhormone interventions, and underlying risk for osteoporosis, CHD, cerebrovascular accident, VTE, and breast cancer. (Level III) Hormone therapy does not need to be routinely discontinued in women aged older than 60 or 65 years. (Level III)

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, NAMS 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- estrogen therapy carries a class effect risk of VTE

- low-dose vaginal estrogen may carry a very low risk but there has been no report of an increased risk in the vaginal estrogen clinical trials

- insufficient evidence in high-risk patients.

Conclusion

CV risk in women increases at the time of menopause, likely related to a combination of aging and the menopausal transition. Proper CVD risk assessment is imperative for improving long term CVD outcomes, guiding risk reduction therapy, and determining safety of MHT if needed. A thorough history of adverse pregnancy outcomes and complications is required in all perimenopausal women. Assessment of family history of CVD in addition to any personal history of autoimmune or rheumatologic disorders and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is essential. All traditional risk factors should be assessed as well as current lipid cholesterol levels, blood glucose levels, and blood pressure. All women should receive education on ideal body weight, a plant-based heart healthy diet, and optimal exercise routines.

MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD or in women with known ASCVD or high risk for CVD events. In select populations of women who may benefit from its vasomotor, genitourinary, and bone health effects, women at low CVD risk may be prescribed MHT safely until age 65. The principles underlying safe use of MHT include using low dose MHT for the shortest possible duration and employing transdermal, SERM, and topical formulations where appropriate, often as an initial strategy. Lastly, it is imperative that both patients and providers are aware of the appropriate indications for MHT and individual risks, especially from a CV standpoint. Several calculators are available to further risk-stratify these patients and enable safe shared-decision making, such as the ASCVD pooled-cohort risk calculator and the NAMS MenoPro app. Quality of life for postmenopausal women is an important consideration, and in addition to early risk assessment and CVD risk reduction, decisions regarding MHT should be made individually and reassessed over time.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114UWJ1K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Duration of menopausal hormone therapy — We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. Technical remarks note that current proposed limits on duration are informed by large intervention trials (5 to 7 y) with extended follow-up for 13 years, that risk rates for breast cancer and CVD increase with age and time since menopause with risks appearing less with ET than with EPT, and that ovarian cancer risk may also increase relative to duration of MHT. The guideline concludes that clinicians and patients should reassess MHT continuation yearly and discuss the risks and individual benefits beyond 5 years.

### Role of hormone therapy in the management of menopause [^114ExMCw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

There are many options available to address the quality of life and health concerns of menopausal women. The principal indication for hormone therapy (HT) is the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, and benefits generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who elect HT at the time of menopause. Although HT increases the risk of coronary heart disease, recent analyses confirm that this increased risk occurs principally in older women and those a number of years beyond menopause. These findings do not support a role for HT in the prevention of heart disease but provide reassurance regarding the safety of use for hot flushes and night sweats in otherwise healthy women at the menopausal transition. An increased risk of breast cancer with extended use is another reason short-term treatment is advised. Hormone therapy prevents and treats osteoporosis but is rarely used solely for this indication. If only vaginal symptoms are present, low-dose local estrogen therapy is preferred. Contraindications to HT use include breast or endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disorders, and active liver disease. Alternatives to HT should be advised for women with or at increased risk for these disorders. The lowest effective estrogen dose should be provided for the shortest duration necessary because risks increase with increasing age, time since menopause, and duration of use. Women must be informed of the potential benefits and risks of all therapeutic options, and care should be individualized, based on a woman's medical history, needs, and preferences.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^1172ubhQ]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Published findings on breast cancer risk associated with different types of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) are inconsistent, with limited information on long-term effects. We bring together the epidemiological evidence, published and unpublished, on these associations, and review the relevant randomised evidence.

Methods

Principal analyses used individual participant data from all eligible prospective studies that had sought information on the type and timing of MHT use; the main analyses are of individuals with complete information on this. Studies were identified by searching many formal and informal sources regularly from Jan 1, 1992, to Jan 1, 2018. Current users were included up to 5 years (mean 1.4 years) after last-reported MHT use. Logistic regression yielded adjusted risk ratios (RRs) comparing particular groups of MHT users versus never users.

Findings

During prospective follow-up, 108 647 postmenopausal women developed breast cancer at mean age 65 years (SD 7); 55 575 (51%) had used MHT. Among women with complete information, mean MHT duration was 10 years (SD 6) in current users and 7 years (SD 6) in past users, and mean age was 50 years (SD 5) at menopause and 50 years (SD 6) at starting MHT. Every MHT type, except vaginal oestrogens, was associated with excess breast cancer risks, which increased steadily with duration of use and were greater for oestrogen-progestagen than oestrogen-only preparations. Among current users, these excess risks were definite even during years 1–4 (oestrogen-progestagen RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.52–1.69; oestrogen-only RR 1.17, 1.10–1.26), and were twice as great during years 5–14 (oestrogen-progestagen RR 2.08, 2.02–2.15; oestrogen-only RR 1.33, 1.28–1.37). The oestrogen-progestagen risks during years 5–14 were greater with daily than with less frequent progestagen use (RR 2.30, 2.21–2.40 vs 1.93, 1.84–2.01; heterogeneity p < 0.0001). For a given preparation, the RRs during years 5–14 of current use were much greater for oestrogen-receptor-positive tumours than for oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours, were similar for women starting MHT at ages 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, and 55–59 years, and were attenuated by starting after age 60 years or by adiposity (with little risk from oestrogen-only MHT in women who were obese). After ceasing MHT, some excess risk persisted for more than 10 years; its magnitude depended on the duration of previous use, with little excess following less than 1 year of MHT use.

Interpretation

If these associations are largely causal, then for women of average weight in developed countries, 5 years of MHT, starting at age 50 years, would increase breast cancer incidence at ages 50–69 years by about one in every 50 users of oestrogen plus daily progestagen preparations; one in every 70 users of oestrogen plus intermittent progestagen preparations; and one in every 200 users of oestrogen-only preparations. The corresponding excesses from 10 years of MHT would be about twice as great.

### Hormone therapy in postmenopausal women and risk of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer [^11414ULv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Reduced circulating estrogen levels around the time of menopause can induce symptoms that affect health and well-being. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment, but may be associated with some adverse health outcomes, including endometrial pathology. This is an update of a review first published in 1999 and last updated in 2012.

Objectives

- To assess the effects of hormone therapy regimens for protecting postmenopausal women against endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.
- To define the lowest effective dose(s) of progestogen used in combination with estrogen therapy for protecting the endometrium.

Search Methods

We searched for trials in the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group specialized register, CENTRAL (containing output from two trial registers and CINAHL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 22 July 2024. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Eligibility Criteria

Interventions of interest were unopposed estrogen, continuous combined estrogen and progestogen, and sequential combined estrogen and progestogen, administered for at least one year. These interventions could be compared head to head or with placebo. Trials had to report rates of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer (histologic diagnosis).

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer at one year and after one year. Our important outcomes were adherence to therapy, requirement for additional interventions, and withdrawal due to adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

We used the original Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1).

Synthesis Methods

Where meta-analysis was possible, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Included Studies

This update included 72 studies (involving 40,652 women) conducted worldwide. There were 42 multicenter trials.

Synthesis Of Results

There were too few studies with events to draw conclusions about endometrial cancer. The results for endometrial hyperplasia are presented below. Unopposed estrogen versus placebo Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with placebo (22–43 events/1000 women versus 5 events/1000 women; OR 5.86, 95% CI 4.09 to 8.40; I² = 0%; 6 RCTs, 2493 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year (40–68 events/1000 women versus 6 events/1000 women; OR 8.97, 95% CI 6.78 to 11.87; I² = 49%; 9 RCTs, 2539 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen versus placebo Continuous combined therapy may have little to no effect on the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with placebo (0–16 events/1000 women versus 5 events/1000 women; OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.38; I² = 48%; 4 RCTs, 3893 women; low-certainty-evidence). We are unsure about the effect of continuous combined therapy after one year (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.40; I² = 47%; 4 RCTs, 789 women; very low-certainty evidence). Sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen versus placebo Sequential combined therapy may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with placebo (6–27 events/1000 women versus 2 events/1000 women; OR 5.53, 95% CI 2.60 to 11.76; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs, 1030 women; low-certainty-evidence). Sequential combined therapy may result in little to no difference in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year (16–97 events/1000 women versus 20 events/1000 women; OR 2.30, 95% CI 0.76 to 6.99; I² = 0%; 3 RCTs, 534 women; low-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen versus continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with continuous combined therapy (46–75 events/1000 women versus 3 events /1000 women; OR 21.90, 95% CI 16.76 to 28.62; I² = 53%; 11 RCTs, 7856 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year compared with continuous combined therapy (33–73 events/1000 women versus 3 events/1000 women; OR 16.78, 95% CI 11.01 to 25.55; I² = 69%; 3 RCTs, 1191 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen versus sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen Unopposed estrogen may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with sequential combined therapy (156–301 events/1000 women versus 16 events/1000 women; OR 17.19, 95% CI 11.27 to 26.22; I² = 70%; 5 RCTs, 2354 women; low-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year compared with sequential combined treatment (379–612 events/1000 women versus 49 events/1000 women; OR 19.21, 95% CI 11.95 to 30.90; I² = 15%; 2 RCTs, 417 women; low-certainty-evidence). Continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen versus sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen All analyses had insufficient events to draw conclusions. Continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen - dose comparisons We are unsure about the effect of moderate-dose estrogen plus low-dose progestogen compared with moderate-dose estrogen plus moderate-dose progestogen on the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.24 to 5.84; I² = 36%; 2 RCTs, 2363 women; very low-certainty-evidence). The remaining dose comparisons had insufficient events to draw conclusions. Sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen - dose comparisons Moderate-dose estrogen plus low-dose progestogen may result in little to no difference in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with moderate-dose estrogen plus moderate-dose progestogen (3–32 events/1000 women versus 6 events/1000 women; OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.65; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs, 1072 women; low-certainty-evidence). The remaining dose comparisons had insufficient events to draw conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia versus placebo and continuous combined therapy at one year and later. Sequential combined therapy may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year versus placebo. The evidence is less certain for continuous versus sequential combined regimens and dose comparisons of continuous and sequential combined regimens. The trials had few events, and long-term follow-up was challenging. For endometrial cancer, events were rare and trials were underpowered to draw meaningful conclusions.

### Hormone therapy in postmenopausal women and risk of endometrial hyperplasia [^114j5jMk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Reduced circulating estrogen levels around the time of the menopause can induce unacceptable symptoms that affect the health and well-being of women. Hormone therapy (both unopposed estrogen and estrogen/progestogen combinations) is an effective treatment for these symptoms, but is associated with risk of harms. Guidelines recommend that hormone therapy be given at the lowest effective dose and treatment should be reviewed regularly. The aim of this review is to identify the minimum dose(s) of progestogen required to be added to estrogen so that the rate of endometrial hyperplasia is not increased compared to placebo.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess which hormone therapy regimens provide effective protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched January 2012), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2012), EMBASE (1980 to January 2012), Current Contents (1993 to May 2008), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2008), Social Sciences Index (1980 to May 2008), PsycINFO (1972 to January 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to May 2008). Attempts were made to identify trials from citation lists of reviews and studies retrieved, and drug companies were contacted for unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of unopposed estrogen therapy, combined continuous estrogen-progestogen therapy, sequential estrogen-progestogen therapy with each other or placebo, administered over a minimum period of 12 months. Incidence of endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma assessed by a biopsy at the end of treatment was a required outcome. Data on adherence to therapy, rates of additional interventions, and withdrawals owing to adverse events were also extracted.

Data Collection and Analysis

In this update, 46 studies were included. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The small numbers of studies in each comparison and the clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis for many outcomes.

Main Results

Unopposed estrogen is associated with increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia at all doses, and durations of therapy between one and three years. For women with a uterus the risk of endometrial hyperplasia with hormone therapy comprising low-dose estrogen continuously combined with a minimum of 1 mg norethisterone acetate (NETA) or 1.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is not significantly different from placebo at two years (1 mg NETA: OR 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0 to 2.8; 1.5 mg MPA: no hyperplasia events).

Authors' Conclusions

Hormone therapy for postmenopausal women with an intact uterus should comprise both estrogen and progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.

Guideline scope and shared decision-making for menopausal symptom therapy: This guideline covers the full spectrum of therapies for relief of the most common and bothersome menopausal symptoms, while the detailed management of early menopause transition, primary ovarian insufficiency, and prevention of osteoporosis and fracture are considered beyond the current scope. Choice of therapy is ideally based on available evidence regarding safety and efficacy and is generally a shared decision including both patient and provider, and the treatment selected should be tailored to the individual patient and will vary according to each woman's symptom severity, age, medical profile, personal preference, and estimated benefit/risk ratio. An accepted philosophy is that a fully informed patient should be empowered to make a decision that best balances individual QOL benefits against potential health risks.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115G8fey]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

NAMS position statement — conclusions on effectiveness and benefit-risk stratification state that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for VMS and GSM and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture, and that risks differ by type, dose, route, timing, and progestogen need; treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation. Absolute attributable risks for hormone therapy in the 50- to 59-year-old age group or within 10 years of menopause onset are low, whereas risks appear greater when initiated at 60 years and older or further than 10 years from menopause onset, particularly for those aged 70 years and older or more than 20 years from menopause onset. For women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset and without contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio appears favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for the prevention of bone loss and reduction of fracture, and based on the WHI RCTs, longer duration may be more favorable for ET than for EPT. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or when aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable than for younger women because of greater absolute risks of CHD, stroke, VTE, and dementia.

### Benefits and harms associated with hormone replacement therapy: clinical decision analysis [^113MLo51]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate harms and benefits associated with use of combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for five years in women with different baseline risks for breast cancer.

Design

Probabilistic clinical decision analysis.

Setting

Hypothetical population of white UK women aged 50 years with different baseline risks for breast cancer.

Main Outcome Measure

Gain or loss in quality adjusted life years (QALYs).

Results

Women free of menopausal symptoms showed a net harm from HRT use, which increased for increasing baseline risk of breast cancer. Those with a baseline risk of 1.2% would expect a loss in QALYs of 0.4 months (- 0.03 QALYs, 95% credibility interval - 0.05 to - 0.01). The main analysis showed HRT to be on average beneficial in women with symptoms, with benefit decreasing with increasing baseline risk of breast cancer. The results were sensitive to the assumed value of quality of life with menopausal symptoms, therefore a contour plot was developed to show the probability of net harm for a range of different values and baseline risks.

Conclusions

HRT for primary prevention of chronic diseases in women without menopausal symptoms is unjustified. Perceived quality of life in women with symptoms should be taken into account when deciding on HRT. Thus, a decision analysis tailored to an individual woman is more appropriate in clinical practice than a population based approach.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^111kTSx7]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Published findings on breast cancer risk associated with different types of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) are inconsistent, with limited information on long-term effects.

If these associations are largely causal, then for women of average weight in developed countries, 5 years of MHT, starting at age 50 years, would increase breast cancer incidence at ages 50–69 years by about one in every 50 users of oestrogen plus daily progestagen preparations; one in every 70 users of oestrogen plus intermittent progestagen preparations; and one in every 200 users of oestrogen-only preparations. The corresponding excesses from 10 years of MHT would be about twice as great.

Menopause hormone therapy

Based on the above, it is probable that decline in endogenous sex hormone levels play a part in the increased CV risk women face with age. However, only a few longitudinal studies have gone so far as to study associations between circulating sex hormone, sex hormone-binding globulin levels, and CVD, with varying results. Moreover, as both menopause and biological aging are interrelated in time, the extent to which one contributes to age-related CV risk over the other is difficult to delineate. However, the question of a possible CV benefit from MHT has been promoted for decades, as noted in several observational studies such as the Nurse's Health Study, which found postmenopausal hormone use to decrease risk for major coronary events in women without previous CVD. Since the 1990s, several placebo-controlled trials studying various MHT have taken place, looking at both primary and secondary prevention outcomes.

The 1998 Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) was the first published secondary prevention trial to evaluate hormone therapy in women with known coronary disease. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a combination of conjugated estrogens (CE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). The primary outcome was nonfatal MI and IHD death with no significant decreases in rates of these events in women assigned to the hormone group compared with those assigned to the placebo group after 4.1 years of follow up. Post hoc analyses showed a statistically significant time trend in which more IHD events actually occurred during the first year of treatment, with fewer in years 3–5. With this knowledge, investigators hypothesized that this early risk may be due to a prothrombotic effect of treatment that may be outweighed by beneficial effects with time. Surveillance was continued for 6.8 years via the HERS II trial, at which time hormone therapy failed to reduce risk of CV events in women with IHD. Treatment for 6.8 years also increased rates of venous thromboembolism and biliary surgery.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy: risks and benefits [^112LUkkN]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal hormone therapy (PMHT) is used for the relief of menopausal symptoms, but the dosage has varied greatly throughout its existence. By the end of the 1990s, PMHT was mainly used to prevent chronic diseases such as osteoporosis, coronary heart disease and dementia, and large prevention trials were undertaken in this context. Following the initial negative reports of these trials, use of PMHT dramatically decreased. These reports noted surprisingly increased risks, notably of coronary heart disease, stroke and breast cancer, in people who used PMHT. Nowadays, considering the currently available data, it seems that an important distinction should be made between the treatment of climacteric symptoms in young, generally healthy, postmenopausal women and the prevention of chronic diseases in elderly women. PMHT seems to be beneficial and safe for postmenopausal symptomatic women aged < 60 years. Treatments with a high safety profile should be the preferred option, including low-dose PMHT, oestrogen-only therapy in women who have had a hysterectomy, and vaginal oestrogen therapy for women with atrophic vaginitis. Nonandrogenic progestin might have a reduced thrombotic and breast cancer risk, and transdermal oestrogen could have a reduced thrombotic risk. Nevertheless, PMHT should not be used for the prevention of chronic diseases in the elderly (> 70 years old) owing to the increased risk of stroke and breast cancer in these patients.

### Menopausal hormone therapy use among postmenopausal women [^116aiXXj]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Annually, more than 1.3 million women in the US transition into menopause. Menopausal transition is associated with profound hormonal changes, which can be symptomatic in 80% of women, and these symptoms, including vasomotor, genitourinary, sleep difficulties, and cognition, can be severe in about 30% of women. Vasomotor symptoms, which are episodes of profuse heat accompanied by sweating and flushing, cause anxiety and sleep disruption and tend to be the most lifestyle-limiting symptom in many women.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the treatment of choice for menopausal symptoms and is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. During peak use in the late 1990s, prescriptions for MHT rose rapidly in the US, fueled by observational studies showing a protective effect on coronary heart diseases and cardiovascular deaths. MHT use, however, declined rapidly in 2002 after the Women's Health Initiative trial showed that the health risks associated with MHT outweighed the benefits. Recent studies highlighting nuances in the risks of MHT with suggestions that the absolute risks of adverse events depend on several factors, including age at initiation and timing in relation to menopause, MHT type, dosage, duration, and route of administration, have led to several national societies putting out guidelines on MHT prescribing.

In 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against the use of MHT for primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women, while the North American Menopause Society recommended tailoring MHT in treating menopausal symptoms to each individual need. The US Preventive Services Task Force also highlighted research gaps, including the need to understand the comparative benefits and harms of different MHT formulations and age at initiation. A gap in the current conversation on MHT use is an understanding of recent trends in, and prevalence of, MHT use. To our knowledge, the most recent study on MHT prevalence using a nationally representative sample was based on self-reported data up to 2010; hence, there are no recent MHT use data captured by prescriptions to understand contemporary patterns in the US.

The goal of this cross-sectional study is to comprehensively describe the most recent trends in, and current prevalence and correlates of, MHT use, taking into consideration MHT formulations, among postmenopausal women in the US. Study findings will provide data that can help guide national discussions and policy on MHT use.

### NAMS 3rd utian translational science symposium, October 2016, Orlando, Florida A conversation about hormone therapy: is there an appropriate dose, route, and duration of use? [^115cYaqB]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) held the 3rd Utian Translational Symposium on October 4, 2016, in Orlando, Florida, to answer questions about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women. This report is a record of the proceedings of that symposium. The maxim about HT for the past 15 years since the publication of the initial results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) has been to prescribe the "lowest dose for the shortest period of time". With new clinical trials, observational data, and further analysis of the WHI and the cumulative 13 years' follow-up, it was time to hold a conversation about the state of the evidence and recommendations for HT dose, route, and duration of use. The symposium brought together experts in the field of HT to speak on these topics, organized by session, after which working groups gathered to synthesize the presentations into areas of what still needs to be known and how to proceed with areas of needed research. After the presentations, there was consensus that postmenopausal women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset without contraindications and who desire to take HT for relief of vasomotor symptoms or prevention of bone loss if at elevated risk can safely do so. The working groups raised the possibility that the use of "Big Data" (pharmacy and cancer databases) would allow answers that cannot be found in clinical trials. This could lead to more appropriate FDA labeling and patient package inserts reflecting the true risks associated with various types and formulations of HT, with differences among estrogen alone, estrogen with a progestogen, and estrogen plus a selective estrogen-receptor modulator for the younger women most likely to initiate these therapies for symptom relief. Differences were found for potential risk among estrogen alone, estrogen with synthetic progestins contrasted to progesterone, lower doses, nonoral doses, and low-dose vaginal estrogen. With all of the available routes and dosages, including vaginal estrogen alone for genitourinary symptoms, there are many options when considering the most appropriate type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, taking into account the age of the woman at initiation of HT and the time from menopause.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^1146ThMd]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menopause hormone therapy — overview and symptom relief benefits emphasize that systemic hormone therapy is an acceptable option for relatively young (up to age 59 or within 10 years of menopause) and healthy women who are bothered by moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, and that individualization is key with consideration of quality-of-life priorities and risk factors including age, time since menopause, and risks of blood clots, heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Systemic hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for most menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy; estrogen therapy as a single agent is sufficient in women who have undergone hysterectomy, whereas progestogen therapy is required to prevent endometrial cancer when estrogen is used systemically in women with a uterus. For symptoms limited to vaginal dryness or discomfort with intercourse, local estrogen therapy is effective and preferred, and low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is recommended in this setting.

### Changing concepts: menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer [^114PeAjA]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2012). Low credibility.

Hormone therapy is still used by millions of women for menopausal symptoms. Concerns regarding hormone therapy and breast cancer were initially based on case reports and retrospective case-control studies. However, recent results from large prospective cohort studies and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized placebo-controlled hormone therapy trials have substantially changed concepts regarding how estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin influence breast cancer. The preponderance of observational studies suggested that estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin both increased the risk of breast cancer, with cancers commonly diagnosed at an early stage. However, substantially different results emerged from the WHI randomized hormone therapy trials. In the WHI trial evaluating estrogen plus progestin in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, combined hormone therapy statistically significantly increased the risk of breast cancer and hindered breast cancer detection, leading to delayed diagnosis and a statistically significant increase in breast cancer mortality. By contrast, estrogen alone use by postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy in the WHI trial did not substantially interfere with breast cancer detection and statistically significantly decreased the risk of breast cancer. Differential mammography usage patterns may explain differences between observational study and randomized trial results. In clinical practice, hormone therapy users have mammograms more frequently than nonusers, leading to more and earlier stage cancer detection. By contrast, in the WHI randomized trials, mammogram frequency was protocol mandated and balanced between comparison groups. Currently, the different effects of estrogen plus progestin vs estrogen alone on breast cancer are not completely understood.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111P6Njs]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society (NAMS) 2022 position statement — key points on breast cancer risk and counseling for hormone therapy: The risk of breast cancer related to hormone therapy is low, with estimates indicating a rare occurrence (less than one additional case per 1,000 women per year of hormone therapy use or three additional cases per 1,000 women when used for 5 years with CEE plus MPA) (Level I). Women should be counseled about the risk of breast cancer with hormone therapy, putting the data into perspective, with risk similar to that of modifiable risk factors such as two daily alcoholic beverages, obesity, and low physical activity (Level III). Different hormone therapy regimens may be associated with increased breast density, which may obscure mammographic interpretation, leading to more mammograms or more breast biopsies and a potential delay in breast cancer diagnosis (Level II), and the effect of hormone therapy on breast cancer risk may depend on the type of hormone therapy, duration of use, regimen, prior exposure, and individual characteristics (Level II).

### Hormone replacement therapy and stroke: clinical trials review [^117L6YcB]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Bench research suggests that postmenopausal hormonal therapy is associated with beneficial effects on the brain and vascular system. Observational data suggest that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy is associated with a 25% to 50% lower rate of cardiovascular disease; however, observational data for hormonal therapy is associated with the potential for significant biases. Clinical trial data are needed. There are 3 major clinical trials that inform us about stroke and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy. Two trials focused on secondary prevention: the Heart and Estrogen/progesterone Replacement Study (HERS) and the Women's Estrogen for Stroke Trial (WEST). One examined primary prevention: the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). All indicate that postmenopausal hormone therapy is not effective for reducing the risk of a recurrent stroke or death among women with established vascular disease or for prevention of a first stroke. Similar results exist for cardiovascular disease. The results of these trials are now reflected in national guidelines. Hormone therapy should not be initiated to prevent vascular disease among postmenopausal women. As a result of these trials, the portion of postmenopausal women using hormone replacement therapy in the United States has fallen by more than half over the past decade.

### Cost-effectiveness of raloxifene and hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women: impact of breast cancer risk [^114aJNVf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the life expectancy and cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and raloxifene therapy in healthy 50-year-old postmenopausal women.

Methods

We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model, discounting the value of future costs and benefits to account for their time of occurrence.

Results

Both HRT and raloxifene therapy increase life expectancy and are cost-effective relative to no therapy for 50-year-old postmenopausal women. For women at average breast cancer and coronary heart disease risk, lifetime HRT increases quality-adjusted life expectancy more (1.75 versus 1.32 quality-adjusted life years) and costs less ($3802 versus $12,968) than lifetime raloxifene therapy. However, raloxifene is more cost-effective than HRT for women at average coronary risk who have a lifetime breast cancer risk of 15% or higher or who receive 10 years or less of postmenopausal therapy. Raloxifene is also the more cost-effective alternative if HRT reduces coronary heart disease risk by less than 20%.

Conclusions

Assuming the benefit of HRT in coronary heart disease prevention from observational studies, long-term HRT is the most cost-effective alternative for women at average breast cancer and coronary heart disease risk seeking to extend their quality-adjusted life expectancy after menopause. However, raloxifene is the more cost-effective alternative for women at average coronary risk with one or more major breast cancer risk factors (first-degree relative, prior breast biopsy, atypical hyperplasia or BRCA1/2 mutation). These results can help inform decisions about postmenopausal therapy until the results of large scale randomized trials of these therapies become available.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^112Fd8Bs]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study identification and data collection

This collaboration began in 1992. Since then, potentially eligible epidemiological studies have been sought regularly by computer-aided literature searches, manual searches of review articles, written communications, and discussions at scientific meetings (appendix p 6). Eligible studies, published and unpublished, had sought individual information for postmenopausal women on the type and timing of MHT use and on body-mass index (BMI); and, after 2001, included at least 1000 cases. By Jan 1, 2018, 59 eligible studies had been identified and 58 are included (one retrospective, but no prospective, study was unable to provide data on individual participants; appendix pp 6–15). Randomised trials involved too few cases to be eligible by these criteria, but trials of the main MHT preparations are reviewed separately, as are some trials of anti-oestrogen drugs (appendix pp 28–30).

Prospective studies were included using a nested case-control design, with up to four randomly selected controls per case of invasive breast cancer matched on age, year of birth, and region (appendix p 7). All analyses included only postmenopausal women, defined as known age at natural menopause (or at bilateral oophorectomy) or unknown age at menopause but age of at least 55 years (since 90% with a natural menopause were postmenopausal by 55 years) and excluded younger women with a hysterectomy but unknown age at menopause.

Individual information was sought on sociodemographic, reproductive, and anthropometric factors, and on last reported MHT use prior to the date of cancer diagnosis for cases and the equivalent date for matched controls (hereafter called the index date). Women were classified, using as similar definitions as possible across studies, by age at first MHT use, duration of use, time since last use, and preparation last used. Results for the two common MHT categories, oestrogen-only and oestrogen-progestagen preparations, are examined separately; few women switched between them (appendix p 7).

Hormone therapy duration — dose and time — emphasizes that the lowest dose of hormone therapy should be used for the shortest amount of time to manage menopausal symptoms; although fewer than 5 years is recommended for estrogen with progestogen therapy, duration should be individualized; for estrogen therapy alone, more flexibility in duration of therapy may be possible, but there are reports of increased risk of breast cancer after 10 to 15 years of use in large observational studies with estrogen alone.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114WrBok]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular disease — key points: For healthy symptomatic women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, the favorable effects of hormone therapy on coronary heart disease (CHD) and all-cause mortality should be considered against potential rare increases in risks of breast cancer, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and stroke (Level I), and hormone therapy is not government approved for primary or secondary cardioprotection (Level I). Personal and familial risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, VTE, and breast cancer should be considered when initiating hormone therapy (Level III). The effects of hormone therapy on CHD may vary depending on when hormone therapy is initiated in relation to a woman's age or time since menopause onset (Level I). Women who initiate hormone therapy aged older than 60 years or more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset are at higher absolute risks of CHD, VTE, and stroke than women initiating hormone therapy in early menopause (Level I).

### Hormone therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women [^116rZnfb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence from systematic reviews of observational studies suggests that hormone therapy may have beneficial effects in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease events in post-menopausal women, however the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have had mixed results. This is an updated version of a Cochrane review published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of hormone therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women, and whether there are differential effects between use in primary or secondary prevention. Secondary aims were to undertake exploratory analyses to (i) assess the impact of time since menopause that treatment was commenced (≥ 10 years versus < 10 years), and where these data were not available, use age of trial participants at baseline as a proxy (≥ 60 years of age versus < 60 years of age); and (ii) assess the effects of length of time on treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 25 February 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS. We also searched research and trials registers, and conducted reference checking of relevant studies and related systematic reviews to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of women comparing orally administered hormone therapy with placebo or a no treatment control, with a minimum of six months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome. We combined results using random effects meta-analyses, and undertook further analyses to assess the effects of treatment as primary or secondary prevention, and whether treatment was commenced more than or less than 10 years after menopause.

Main Results

We identified six new trials through this update. Therefore the review includes 19 trials with a total of 40,410 post-menopausal women. On the whole, study quality was good and generally at low risk of bias; the findings are dominated by the three largest trials. We found high quality evidence that hormone therapy in both primary and secondary prevention conferred no protective effects for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, or revascularisation. However, there was an increased risk of stroke in those in the hormone therapy arm for combined primary and secondary prevention (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.41). Venous thromboembolic events were increased (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.69), as were pulmonary emboli (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.48) on hormone therapy relative to placebo. The absolute risk increase for stroke was 6 per 1000 women (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 165; mean length of follow-up: 4.21 years (range: 2.0 to 7.1)); for venous thromboembolism 8 per 1000 women (NNTH = 118; mean length of follow-up: 5.95 years (range: 1.0 to 7.1)); and for pulmonary embolism 4 per 1000 (NNTH = 242; mean length of follow-up: 3.13 years (range: 1.0 to 7.1)). We performed subgroup analyses according to when treatment was started in relation to the menopause. Those who started hormone therapy less than 10 years after the menopause had lower mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95, moderate quality evidence) and coronary heart disease (composite of death from cardiovascular causes and non-fatal myocardial infarction) (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96; moderate quality evidence), though they were still at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73, high quality evidence) compared to placebo or no treatment. There was no strong evidence of effect on risk of stroke in this group. In those who started treatment more than 10 years after the menopause there was high quality evidence that it had little effect on death or coronary heart disease between groups but there was an increased risk of stroke (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.38, high quality evidence) and venous thromboembolism (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.80, high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Our review findings provide strong evidence that treatment with hormone therapy in post-menopausal women overall, for either primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events has little if any benefit and causes an increase in the risk of stroke and venous thromboembolic events.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114fevBe]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society (NAMS) 2022 hormone therapy position statement — Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture; risks differ by type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used, and treatment should be individualized with periodic reevaluation. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss, whereas for women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia; longer duration of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

### Recent concerns surrounding HRT [^112PKmfE]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Millions of women are treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for relief of menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor flushes and sweats for which oestrogen is uniquely and highly effective. Others may continue longer-term treatment in the hope that HRT will help to prevent chronic disease. The preservation of bone mass with continuing oestrogen therapy and reduction of subsequent risk of fracture is well established. Observational studies of the metabolic and vascular effects of oestrogens have suggested a potential benefit in reducing the risk of vascular disease, but recently published randomized controlled trials demonstrate no evidence of benefit in women with established vascular disease or in apparently healthy women. The increased risks of breast cancer and thromboembolic disease have been confirmed in these trials, with evidence of increased risk of stroke. Observational data suggest there may be a small increased risk of ovarian cancer associated with longer-term use of HRT. The premature termination of one arm of the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial caused concern among patients, doctors and pharmaceutical companies. There are difficulties in extrapolating the results from trials using a specific HRT product to advise women on the wide range of other hormone products, doses, combinations and routes of administration. However, in the absence of evidence that other products are safer, the data suggest that for many women the risks associated with long-term use of HRT outweigh the benefits. There are nonhormonal strategies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. HRT is not, and has never been, licensed in the UK for the prevention or treatment of vascular disease, and the data suggesting potential benefit should now be regarded as biased. The absolute incidence of an adverse event is low, and the risk in an individual woman in a single year is very small, but the risks are cumulative over time with long-term use. The risk-benefit balance of each woman needs regular reappraisal with continued use.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk and formulation — In a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, VTE risk was elevated in women who initiated hormone therapy aged older than 60 years or after 10 years since menopause (summary estimate, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.39–2.29) and showed a null effect in those aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause (summary estimate, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.25–1.93); lower doses of oral estrogen therapy may confer less VTE risk than higher doses, micronized progesterone may be less thrombogenic than other progestins, and transdermal hormone therapy has not been associated with VTE risk in observational studies with limited observational data and a systematic review suggesting less risk than oral, although comparative RCT data are lacking.

### Patients' understanding of risk: a qualitative study of decision-making about the menopause and hormone replacement therapy in general practice [^115wSqTg]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore women's understanding of the risks associated with the menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

Methods

Two general practices in Cambridge participated in this qualitative study using focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Forty women aged between 50 and 55 years, known to be current users, ex-users, or never-users of HRT were included in the study.

Results

Participants viewed risk as a danger: coping with risk required an assessment to facilitate an informed decision. To understand risk and make a personal interpretation, patients used their own knowledge, the presentation and context of that risk, together with their individual belief system particularly relating to representations of womanhood, lay beliefs and fatalism, control and choice. Experience, age and emotions often modified the salience of risk, and participants then used this meaning to weigh up the risks and benefits of a particular threat.

Conclusion

Participants gained understanding of risk by an active risk assessment process involving individual and complex interplay between knowledge and core beliefs, allowing the assessment of risks and benefits to facilitate an informed decision about the menopause and HRT.

PART 1: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and stroke risk

PICO 1.1: In postmenopausal women, does HRT compared to non-prior HRT reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke in primary prevention?

Analysis of current evidence

The analysis included six randomized controlled clinical trials (three trials on HRT and three on receptor modulators). Data from 29,233 patients with HRT and 15,463 control patients were analysed. –

The studies showed that HRT did not reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke [odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.66–1.41, P = 0.86, I² = 65%].

The overall quality of evidence was rated as very low, with a serious risk of inconsistency indicated by I² ≥ 65%. Due to the overall low number of studies available and an overall strongly suspected publication bias, a serious risk of indirectness and imprecision indicated by wide confidence intervals was present (Table 1).

Table 1.
Grade evidence profile table for Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) 1.1.

Additional information

Two RCTs analysed treatment with hormone replacement with conjugated equine oestrogen 0.625 mg/d and medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg/d, and a pooled meta-analysis of 5 RCTs added information about treatment with different dosages of tissue-selective oestrogen complex pairs conjugated oestrogens plus the selective oestrogen receptor modulator bazedoxifene. These studies analysed 17,922 postmenopausal HRT patients versus 10,726 control patients. The summarised analysis of these studies showed an increased risk of HRT treated women for developing an ischaemic stroke [odds ratio (OR) 1.36, 95% CI 1.09–1.69, P = 0.006, I² = 0%]. The quality of evidence was rated as moderate, with no serious risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness or imprecision but with a strongly suspected publication bias due to the overall low number of studies available. In addition, two trials were performed before 2000 and all trials recruited healthy (no previous stroke) women. (Figure 3)

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112gaeGy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for menopause, more specifically with respect to cardiovascular risk assessment, ES 2015 guidelines recommend to consider evaluating the baseline risk of CVD and taking this risk into consideration when advising for or against menopausal hormone therapy in females < 60 years of age or < 10 years past menopause onset considering hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy: an endocrine society scientific statement [^111bZDtk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to provide a scholarly review of the published literature on menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT), make scientifically valid assessments of the available data, and grade the level of evidence available for each clinically important endpoint. PARTICIPANTS IN DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT: The 12-member Scientific Statement Task Force of The Endocrine Society selected the leader of the statement development group (R.J.S.) and suggested experts with expertise in specific areas. In conjunction with the Task Force, lead authors (n = 25) and peer reviewers (n = 14) for each specific topic were selected. All discussions regarding content and grading of evidence occurred via teleconference or electronic and written correspondence. No funding was provided to any expert or peer reviewer, and all participants volunteered their time to prepare this Scientific Statement.

Evidence

Each expert conducted extensive literature searches of case control, cohort, and randomized controlled trials as well as meta-analyses, Cochrane reviews, and Position Statements from other professional societies in order to compile and evaluate available evidence. No unpublished data were used to draw conclusions from the evidence.

Consensus Process

A consensus was reached after several iterations. Each topic was considered separately, and a consensus was achieved as to content to be included and conclusions reached between the primary author and the peer reviewer specific to that topic. In a separate iteration, the quality of evidence was judged using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system in common use by The Endocrine Society for preparing clinical guidelines. The final iteration involved responses to four levels of additional review: 1) general comments offered by each of the 25 authors; 2) comments of the individual Task Force members; 3) critiques by the reviewers of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism; and 4) suggestions offered by the Council and members of The Endocrine Society. The lead author compiled each individual topic into a coherent document and finalized the content for the final Statement. The writing process was analogous to preparation of a multiauthored textbook with input from individual authors and the textbook editors.

Conclusions

The major conclusions related to the overall benefits and risks of MHT expressed as the number of women per 1000 taking MHT for 5 yr who would experience benefit or harm. Primary areas of benefit included relief of hot flashes and symptoms of urogenital atrophy and prevention of fractures and diabetes. Risks included venothrombotic episodes, stroke, and cholecystitis. In the subgroup of women starting MHT between ages 50 and 59 or less than 10 yr after onset of menopause, congruent trends suggested additional benefit including reduction of overall mortality and coronary artery disease. In this subgroup, estrogen plus some progestogens increased the risk of breast cancer, whereas estrogen alone did not. Beneficial effects on colorectal and endometrial cancer and harmful effects on ovarian cancer occurred but affected only a small number of women. Data from the various Women's Health Initiative studies, which involved women of average age 63, cannot be appropriately applied to calculate risks and benefits of MHT in women starting shortly after menopause. At the present time, assessments of benefit and risk in these younger women are based on lower levels of evidence.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^111sjpgh]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer — associations with hormone therapy — reports that an increased risk of breast cancer is seen with 5 years or more of continuous estrogen with progestogen therapy, possibly earlier with continuous use since menopause; the risk is real but not great, and the risk decreases after hormone therapy is discontinued, while use of estrogen alone for a mean of 7 years in the Women's Health Initiative did not increase the risk of breast cancer.

### Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: principal results from the women's health initiative randomized controlled trial [^112bLkXm]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

The study WHI was published by Rossouw JE and colleagues in 2002 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease and Menopause. In the WHI study, the trial question was: what is the role of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women? In the WHI study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the WHI study, the population was: 16608 female patients. The inclusion criteria were healthy postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus at baseline. The key exclusion criteria were any medical condition likely to be associated with a predicted survival of < 3 years, prior breast cancer, other prior cancer within the last 10 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer, low hematocrit or platelet counts, alcoholism, or dementia. In the WHI study, the interventions were: n = 8506 estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet) n = 8102 placebo (matching placebo tablet). In the WHI study, the primary outcome was: borderline significant increase in nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death (0.37% vs. 0.3%; HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.63). In the WHI study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in stroke (0.29% vs. 0.21%; HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07) Borderline significant increase in venous thromboembolic disease (0.34% vs. 0.16%; HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.82) Borderline significant decrease in osteoporotic fractures (1.47% vs. 1.91%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.85). In the WHI study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and cause of death. significant difference in invasive breast cancer (0.38% per year vs. 0.30% per year). In the WHI study, the conclusion was: in healthy postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus at baseline, estrogen plus progestin was inferior to placebo with respect to nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

### Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: principal results from the women's health initiative randomized controlled trial [^111Um91k]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertain.

Objective

To assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States.

Design

Estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16608 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993–1998.

Interventions

Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).

Main Outcomes Measures

The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.

Results

On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02–1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00–1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07–1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39–3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43–0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47–1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45–0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74–1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09–1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90–1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69–0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82–1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03–1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 person-years.

Conclusions

Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.

### Decision analysis of hormone replacement therapy after the women's health initiative [^113Y9yVg]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to estimate the quality-adjusted life expectancy with and without hormone replacement therapy.

Study Design

We compared the quality-adjusted life expectancy with and without combination hormone replacement therapy in three cohorts of women with menopausal symptoms over a 20-year period using a Markov decision-analysis model. Women were either at high or low risk for breast cancer and coronary heart disease or at high risk for osteoporosis.

Results

Hormone replacement therapy decreases life expectancy slightly compared with no hormone replacement therapy if menopausal symptoms are not considered. However, if relief from menopausal symptoms is considered and the usefulness of life with symptoms is worth < 0.996 compared with life without symptoms, then 5 years of hormone replacement therapy provides equivalent quality-adjusted life-years.

Conclusion

Combination hormone replacement therapy decreases life expectancy if quality of life with menopausal symptoms is not considered. However, the benefit of hormone replacement therapy can exceed the risk for women with menopausal symptoms.

### European Stroke Organisation guidelines on stroke in women: management of menopause, pregnancy and postpartum [^113NcohM]. European Stroke Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This guideline document was developed following the GRADE methodology and aimed to assist physicians in decision-making regarding the risk of stroke in postmenopausal women related to HRT and the risk of stroke in pregnant/postpartum women treated by IVT and MT. Whenever possible, we based our recommendations on RCTs rather than observational studies, which are more prone to selection bias and confounding. Where insufficient scientific evidence was available, we provided expert consensus statements based on observational studies and our expertise. We found that there is low-quality evidence for recommendations on HRT in postmenopausal women. Based on the results of six RCTs, – we suggest against HRT in postmenopausal women to reduce the risk of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. Prior HRT has no impact on mortality in postmenopausal women with an acute stroke. However, there are limitations of the available RCT-based evidence. The currently used hormone replacement medication to control perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms has changed since the publication of trials results in the 1990ies. No trial was designed to investigate the risk or outcome of women with HRT, and stroke and stroke subtypes were not separately investigated. Moreover, no information on HRT in women with a previous stroke is available. The trial results on stroke mortality need to be interpreted with caution as acute stroke patient management and treatment have evolved dramatically over the last 2 decades, and today's treatment cannot be compared to acute stroke treatment in the 1990s. The literature search did not identify trials that targeted postmenopausal women with acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke with prior HRT therapy compared with non-prior HRT, impacting functional outcome and mortality.

### USPSTF: No HRT after menopause for chronic conditions… [^114JMJKB]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Nov. 10, 2022, 4: 14 p. m. News Staff — The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force is advising family physicians and other health care professionals to avoid administering hormone replacement therapy to patients for the primary prevention of chronic conditions after menopause. The task force's final recommendation statement, issued Nov. 1 and accompanied by a final evidence review and evidence summary, recommended against the use of combined estrogen and progestin to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal people and against the use of estrogen alone to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal people who have had a hysterectomy. Both recommendations received "D" grades, meaning that the task force concluded with moderate certainty that these treatments had no net benefit. Overall, the recommendation statement is consistent with the task force's 2017 recommendation on the topic.

"For people who have already gone through menopause, using hormone therapy is not an effective way to prevent chronic conditions because the potential harms cancel out any potential benefit, " said Carol Mangione, M. D. M. S. P. H., the task force's chair, in a USPSTF Bulletin. "Fortunately, the task force has many other evidence-based recommendations on ways people can stay healthy as they age". The recommendation statement does not apply to people who are considering HRT to manage perimenopausal symptoms such as vaginal dryness or hot flashes. It also does not apply to people who have had primary ovarian insufficiency or surgical menopause. Story Highlights "Importantly, this recommendation is.

The task force, after reviewing the available evidence, found that while taking HRT to prevent chronic conditions may result in some modest benefits such as reduced risk of fractures and diabetes, it may also lead to increased risk of severe harms such as stroke or thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, especially among women older than 60. For individuals who should not receive HRT, the USPSTF pointed to a number of recommendations it has issued related to preventing cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions in adults. These include the use of aspirin to prevent CVD, screening for hypertension, screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, behavioral counseling to promote a healthy lifestyle to prevent CVD in adults, and screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures.

The task force also recommended that patients and health care professionals work together to determine the best way to maintain good health throughout one's lifespan.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and cancer-NCI… [^1123aAk6]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential harms of systemic MHT include: increased risk of vaginal bleedingwith estrogen plus progestin that may require assessment by endometrial biopsy increased risk of urinary incontinencewith both estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin. increased risk of dementiawith both estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin when taken by those 65 years or older increased risk of stroke, blood clots, and heart attackwith estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin for as long as MHT is taken increased risk of endometrial cancer in people with an intact uteruswith estrogen alone increased risk of breast cancerwith prior use of estrogen plus progestin for at least a decade after use is discontinued increased breast densitywith estrogen plus progestin, making mammography less effective and also increasing breast cancer risk increased risk of death from lung cancerwith estrogen plus progestin. Importantly, MHT is not associated with an increased risk of death from all causes. Who should not take menopausal hormone therapy. Women who have had breast cancer in the past are often advised to avoid MHT because some studies suggest that it may increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence. However, other studies have not shown an increased risk.

For example, a Danish cohort study of postmenopausal women treated for early-stage breast cancer showed no increased risk of recurrence or mortality associated with the use of vaginal or systemic MHT. Many studies have also been done to investigate whether MHT is safe for women who have experienced premature or severe menopausal symptoms as a result of cancer treatments that reduce hormone levels. A 2020 clinical practice statement from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology concluded that the benefits of MHT are likely to outweigh the risks for most people with epithelial ovarian, early-stage endometrial, and cervical cancer as well as for people with. BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations or Lynch syndrome and no history of breast cancer. However, the statement recommended against the use of MHT in women with advanced endometrial cancer, uterine sarcoma, or endometrioid or low-grade serous ovarian cancer.

### Postmenopausal HRT and cardiovascular disease risk… [^116zhzMo]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The apparent cardiovascular benefits of hormone use play a significant role in decisions about the use of hormone replacement therapy in healthy postmenopausal women. Although data seem to confirm a long-term coronary benefit, some results are equivocal. The Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study and the Nurses' Health Study showed an increased risk for coronary events in women with existing heart disease who are given hormone replacement therapy. A report from the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized, clinical trial of hormone therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, has also suggested an elevated risk in healthy women. Episodes of major coronary events, including nonfatal myocardial infarctions and coronary deaths, and strokes were tabulated among more than 70, 000 study participants who were followed for up to 20 years. Current use of hormone therapy was associated with an age-adjusted relative risk of major coronary event of 0.
54.

In this large, observational, prospective study, the risk of major coronary events appeared to substantially decrease among current users of hormone therapy. A modest increase in stroke risk was found among women taking 0. 625 mg or more of conjugated estrogen daily and in those taking estrogen plusprogestin. The authors conclude that hormone therapy may be associated with coronary benefit and that low dosages of estrogen as well as estrogen combined with progestin may be equally effective in providing these benefits. The risk of stroke, however, is increased with hormone use, and hormone therapy appears to be related to increased risk of breast cancer. In an editorial in the same journal, Grady and Hulley comment on observational studies. The lack of dose-response or duration-response effects of estrogen use do not support the premise that hormone replacement therapy prevents coronary heart disease.

Several randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled studies have found no benefit from postmenopausal hormone therapy in secondary prevention of coronary disease. The Women's Health Initiative, currently in about the third year of a planned nine-year treatment period, is looking at hormone therapy in women without coronary disease. The preliminary results are demonstrating an increased risk of coronary events among the hormone-treated women in the first two years of the trial. The increased risk was seen in women taking unopposed estrogen and those taking estrogen and progestin. Grady and Hulley conclude that despite strong observational evidence from the Nurses' Health Study and others, the results of three recent trials are disappointing and imply that more supportive evidence is needed from randomized trials before hormone therapy is recommended for the prevention of coronary disease in postmenopausal women.
