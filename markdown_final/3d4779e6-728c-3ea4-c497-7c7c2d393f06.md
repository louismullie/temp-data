## Question

What can you tell me about postoperative chylous ascites?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about postoperative chylous ascites. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify incidence and risk factors across surgical contexts. Next, I will review diagnostic criteria and pitfalls. After that, I need to appraise management strategies, including conservative, pharmacologic, interventional, and surgical options, and align them with an evidence-based algorithm. Finally, I should consider special populations, prognosis, and what to do when standard approaches fail, making sure I cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Postoperative chylous ascites is the accumulation of triglyceride-rich, milky lymphatic fluid in the peritoneal cavity due to iatrogenic disruption of lymphatic channels, most often the cisterna chyli or its tributaries, leading to loss of chyle that contains fats, fat-soluble vitamins, enzymes, and lymphocytes, with consequent nutritional and immunologic consequences if persistent [^d27e12dd] [^6f099349].

> I need to check incidence across procedures. Incidence varies by operation: 0.9% after laparoscopic gynecologic lymphadenectomy overall, rising to 4.08% with para-aortic dissection; 7.3% after right hemicolectomy with complete mesocolic excision and D3 lymphadenectomy; 5.1% after laparoscopic nephrectomy with higher risk on the left and with lymphadenectomy; 1–2% after hepatopancreatobiliary surgery with particular vulnerability after pancreatic resections; and 5.4% after pediatric liver transplantation, with higher risk in biliary atresia and periportal lymphadenopathy, underscoring that extent of retroperitoneal dissection and nodal sampling are key drivers [^846cc5f2] [^73f30fdf] [^617abc16] [^6f099349] [^4de4bf9e] [^71a24dd3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk factors without verifying them. Independent predictors include para-aortic lymph node sampling, early enteral feeding, female sex, chronic pancreatitis, longer operative time, and higher nodal counts; in liver transplantation, pretransplant ascites and use of energy-based perihepatic dissection increase risk; in pediatrics, lower anthropometrics and pretransplant ascites are associated; and in neuroblastic tumor surgery, higher tumor stage correlates with chyle leak risk, reinforcing that surgical extent and patient factors modulate susceptibility [^d869608d] [^5e7bfa97] [^73f30fdf] [^71a24dd3] [^4de4bf9e] [^5e375dda].

> Next, I should review diagnosis. I initially thought a triglyceride level above 110 mg/dL in the ascitic fluid would suffice, but wait, let me verify sensitivity and specificity. In fact, while many studies use triglyceride thresholds around 110–200 mg/dL, chylomicron detection is the gold standard and a triglyceride cutoff of 187 mg/dL has poor sensitivity in some contexts, so I should confirm with chylomicrons when the diagnosis is uncertain or the fluid is atypical, and I should remember that milky, amylase-free fluid with high triglycerides after enteral feeding supports the diagnosis [^4de4bf9e] [^6f099349] [^5e7bfa97].

> I will now examine conservative management, since most cases resolve this way. Core measures include dietary restriction to a very low-fat or medium-chain triglyceride diet, temporary nil per os with total parenteral nutrition for high-output leaks, and serial paracentesis or continuous drainage for symptomatic relief; in pancreatic surgery cohorts, early elemental diet feeding has been shown to markedly reduce chylous ascites compared with standard low-residue enteral feeding, suggesting a role for formula selection when early enteral nutrition is desired [^dee065db] [^97ed815d].

> Let me consider pharmacologic therapy next. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, is widely used off-label and appears effective in many series, with typical dosing ranges including subcutaneous regimens of 50–100 mcg every 8 hours or 100–200 mcg twice daily, and continuous infusion at 0.5–2.0 mcg/kg/hour; although evidence quality is low, multiple case series and reviews support its use after conservative failure, and it is reasonable to trial for 1–2 weeks before escalating care [^3fb6b50a] [^d27e12dd].

> But wait, what if conservative and pharmacologic measures fail? I should review interventional options. Intranodal lymphangiography with or without embolization achieves high technical success and meaningful clinical success in refractory iatrogenic chylous ascites, with reports around 56–86% resolution depending on cohorts and definitions; techniques include nodal glue embolization, catheter-based embolization, and retrograde abdominal lymphatic embolization, and early referral after 2–4 weeks of failed conservative therapy is reasonable given low complication rates and potential to avoid surgery [^0b3c5a4a] [^55d5735a] [^0fc318b8].

> I should double-check surgical indications and outcomes. Surgery is generally reserved for refractory cases after 4–6 weeks of conservative therapy, with options including direct ligation or clipping of identified leaks, fibrin glue application with or without absorbable mesh, and peritoneovenous shunting; shunts can be effective but carry risks such as occlusion and infection, and earlier shunt placement after 4–6 weeks may reduce complications compared with delayed placement, while laparoscopic or open exploration with targeted repair is favored when a leak site can be localized [^701a1191] [^431490ee] [^dee065db].

> Let me synthesize an evidence-based algorithm and make sure it aligns with the data. Start with confirmation of diagnosis and assessment of output; for low-output leaks under about 1,000 mL/day, use conservative measures for 2–4 weeks; for high-output leaks or failure of conservative therapy, add octreotide and reassess at 1–2 weeks; if still refractory, proceed to lymphangiography with embolization; and if interventional therapy fails or is unavailable, consider surgical exploration or peritoneovenous shunting, with escalation tailored to nutritional status and comorbidities; this stepwise approach yields approximately 70% success with conservative care and up to 97% cumulative success when lymphangiography is added after conservative failure in pooled analyses [^dee065db].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In pediatrics, congenital or postoperative chylous ascites is managed similarly with emphasis on nutrition and growth, and propranolol has emerging case-series evidence as an adjunct in infants when octreotide is contraindicated or ineffective; in cirrhosis, chylous ascites reflects lymphatic hypertension and may respond to TIPS when refractory; and in malignancy-related chylous ascites, lymphatic interventions can facilitate continuation of oncologic therapy by controlling leaks with minimal morbidity [^cce0217c] [^37f18367] [^3e53d6af].

> Next, I should review prognosis and complications. Most postoperative chylous ascites resolves with conservative therapy, though it prolongs hospitalization and can cause hypoalbuminemia, lymphocytopenia, and immunosuppression; persistent leaks increase infection risk, and prophylactic antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole have been advocated in prolonged chyle leaks to mitigate opportunistic infections, while long-term outcomes are generally favorable once controlled [^4de4bf9e] [^cd797165] [^d27e12dd].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do when nothing seems to work. For truly refractory cases after lymphangiography and surgical options, consider peritoneovenous shunting, investigational agents such as sirolimus in lymphatic malformations, or novel surgical bypass techniques like a lymphatic cable flap; these are supported by case series and expert opinion rather than randomized trials, so multidisciplinary review and individualized risk–benefit assessment are essential [^701a1191] [^d2efc7ea] [^49ed645c].

> In summary, postoperative chylous ascites is an iatrogenic lymphatic leak with variable incidence across surgeries, best managed with a stepwise approach that prioritizes conservative measures, escalates to octreotide, then to lymphangiography with embolization, and reserves surgery or shunting for refractory disease; early recognition, accurate diagnosis with chylomicron confirmation when needed, and timely escalation after a defined trial of conservative therapy optimize outcomes and minimize malnutrition and immunologic compromise [^dee065db] [^4de4bf9e] [^d27e12dd].

Postoperative chylous ascites is a **rare but serious complication** characterized by milky, triglyceride-rich ascitic fluid due to lymphatic injury, most often after retroperitoneal or oncologic surgery [^dee065db]. Diagnosis relies on **triglyceride > 110 mg/dL** or chylomicrons in the ascitic fluid, typically presenting 4–8 days postoperatively with abdominal distension, fullness, or drain output [^6f099349] [^5e7bfa97]. First-line management is **conservative**, including dietary restriction (low-fat or MCT-based diet), bowel rest with TPN, and octreotide to reduce lymphatic flow; most cases resolve within 1–2 weeks [^dee065db] [^3fb6b50a]. If conservative therapy fails, escalate to lymphangiography with embolization or surgical exploration, with peritoneovenous shunting reserved for refractory cases [^dee065db] [^0b3c5a4a] [^701a1191]. Prognosis is generally favorable with timely therapy, but delays increase risks of malnutrition, immunosuppression, and infection [^d27e12dd].

---

## Pathophysiology

Postoperative chylous ascites arises from **traumatic disruption of lymphatic channels** — most often the cisterna chyli or its tributaries — during surgery, causing chyle to leak into the peritoneal cavity [^dee065db]. Chyle is lymph enriched with triglycerides, chylomicrons, lymphocytes, and proteins; its chronic loss leads to **malnutrition, immunodeficiency, and electrolyte disturbances** [^2a78faa2].

---

## Incidence and risk factors

Incidence varies by procedure: **0.9% after laparoscopic gynecologic lymphadenectomy** (higher with para-aortic dissection) [^846cc5f2], 7.3% after right hemicolectomy with CME/D3 [^73f30fdf], 5.1% after laparoscopic nephrectomy (more on the left, with lymphadenectomy) [^617abc16], and 5.4% after pediatric liver transplantation [^4de4bf9e]. Risk factors include **extensive retroperitoneal dissection**, para-aortic lymph node sampling, early enteral feeding, low albumin, and prolonged operative time [^d869608d] [^71a24dd3] [^73f30fdf].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Milky or creamy ascitic fluid**: triglyceride-rich, often > 110 mg/dL, with chylomicrons [^6f099349].
- **Abdominal distension or fullness**: from accumulating chyle [^d77feaf8].
- **Drain output**: milky fluid from surgical drains 4–8 days postoperatively, often after feeding [^5e7bfa97].
- **Nutritional and immunologic effects**: hypoalbuminemia, lymphocytopenia, edema, and increased infection risk [^2a78faa2].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Fluid analysis**: triglyceride > 110 mg/dL or presence of chylomicrons confirms chylous ascites [^6f099349].
- **Imaging**: CT or MRI can identify lymphatic leaks or masses; lymphangiography (intranodal or pedal) localizes leaks for intervention [^b50647cb].
- **Differentiation**: exclude infection, malignancy, and other causes of ascites with cell count, culture, and cytology [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

First-line therapy includes:

- **Dietary modification**: low-fat diet or medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) diet to reduce chyle production [^dee065db].
- **Bowel rest and TPN**: for high-output leaks or refractory cases [^dee065db].
- **Octreotide**: somatostatin analog to reduce lymphatic flow; typical dose 50–100 mcg SC q8h or 100–200 mcg SC BID [^3fb6b50a].
- **Supportive care**: diuretics, paracentesis for symptomatic relief, and albumin replacement as needed [^d27e12dd].

---

### Interventional and surgical management

Reserve for refractory cases after 2–4 weeks of conservative therapy:

- **Lymphangiography with embolization**: 85–90% success in expert hands; minimally invasive and preferred before open surgery [^dee065db] [^0b3c5a4a].
- **Surgical exploration**: direct ligation or clipping of identified leaks; use of fibrin glue or mesh overlays for diffuse leaks [^431490ee].
- **Peritoneovenous shunting**: for persistent leaks despite other therapies; effective but with occlusion and infection risks [^701a1191].

---

## Prognosis and complications

With timely, appropriate therapy, **prognosis is excellent** and most cases resolve within 1–2 weeks [^dee065db]. Persistent leaks can cause **malnutrition, immunosuppression, and infection**; early recognition and escalation prevent these sequelae [^2a78faa2].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention focuses on **meticulous surgical technique**, including careful identification and ligation of lymphatic channels during retroperitoneal dissection, avoidance of early high-fat enteral feeding, and selective use of octreotide in high-risk patients [^617abc16] [^d869608d].

---

Postoperative chylous ascites is a **manageable complication** when diagnosed early and treated stepwise: conservative measures first, then lymphatic interventions or surgery if needed. Most patients recover fully, but delays increase morbidity, so a structured, evidence-based algorithm is essential [^dee065db].

### The diagnosis and management of postoperative chylous ascites [^d27e12dd]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Postoperative chylous ascites is a rare complication of retroperitoneal and mediastinal surgery that represents a difficult management problem due to the serious mechanical, nutritional and immunological consequences of the constant loss of protein and lymphocytes. We reviewed the topic of postoperative chylous ascites with special emphasis on the relevant diagnostic and imaging modalities. We propose a novel management algorithm.

Materials and Methods

We performed a MEDLINE search of the literature on chylous ascites using chyloperitoneum as the subject heading and chylous ascites as an additional key word. The search yielded 651 articles. We focused on 102 series, collective reviews and mainly case reports related to the issue of postoperative chylous ascites.

Results

We propose a novel algorithm based on a step-up approach aimed at promoting decreased lymph production and flow as well as maintaining nutritional balance. The management algorithm integrates repeat palliative paracentesis, dietary measures, total parenteral nutrition therapy, peritoneovenous shunting and surgical closure of the lymphoperitoneal fistula. Due to the remarkable effectiveness of somatostatin therapy for the closure of lymphatic fistula somatostatin therapy should be attempted with or without total parenteral nutrition early in the course of treatment of chylous ascites before any invasive steps are taken.

Conclusions

Various management modalities may be used successfully to treat chylous ascites. Therefore, treatment should be individualized and adjusted to the severity of lymphatic leakage and its consequences. The outcome mostly depends on the underlying pathological condition. Thus, in the absence of malignant or congenital underlying pathology the prognosis in cases of postoperative chylous ascites is good with the majority responding to conservative measures.

### Diagnosis, outcome, and management of chylous ascites following pediatric liver transplantation [^4de4bf9e]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Data on postoperative chylous ascites (CA) after pediatric liver transplantation (LT) are scarce. This retrospective study was conducted to identify the incidence, risk factors, management, and outcomes of postoperative CA in a large single-center pediatric LT cohort (2000-2016). The study cohort comprised 317 LTs (153 living donors and 164 deceased donors) in 310 recipients with a median age of 2.7 years. The incidence of CA was 5.4% (n = 17), diagnosed after a median time of 10 days after LT. Compared with chylomicron detection in peritoneal fluid (the gold standard), a triglyceride cutoff value of 187 mg/dL in peritoneal fluid showed insufficient sensitivity (31%) for CA diagnosis. In univariate logistic regression analyses, ascites before LT, younger age, and lower weight, height, and height-for-age z score at LT were associated with CA. Symptomatic management of CA included peritoneal drain (100%) and diuretics (76%). Therapeutic interventions included very low-fat or medium-chain triglyceride-rich diets (94%) and intravenous octreotide (6%), leading to CA resolution in all patients. CA was associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS; 40 days in the CA group versus 24 days in the non-CA group; P = 0.001) but not with reduced patient or graft survival rates after a median follow-up time of 14 years. In conclusion, CA in the pediatric LT recipient is a relatively uncommon complication associated with increased hospital LOS and morbidity. Measurement of chylomicrons is recommended in patients with ascites that is more severe or persistent than expected. Dietary interventions are effective in most patients.

### Low-dose radiation therapy is an effective treatment for refractory postoperative chylous ascites: a case report [^68613bf3]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

When lymphatic pathways are disrupted via obstruction or traumatic injury, a temporary or chronic chyle leak may result, which is defined as the presence of chyle that collects outside of the lymphatic vessels within the thoracic or abdominal cavities. For a chyle leak that is refractory to surgical repair, no good options exist. Radiation therapy (RT) can result in scarring and fibrosis of the lymphatic fistula. We report on the first clinical case in the United States with the successful use of low-dose (LD) RT in the management of refractory chylous ascites.

Methods and Materials

A 74-year-old man developed significant chylous ascites after a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. After failure of numerous conservative and surgical interventions, he was referred for radiation medicine. We delivered a dose of 10 Gy in daily 1 Gy fractions to the para-aortic region, including the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct from T12 to L2.

Results

The patient tolerated LD-RT well with no toxicity. By the time of the 8-month post-RT follow-up visit, he had decreased chylous ascite levels and required no paracentesis or peritoneovenous shunting. There was no evidence of chylous ascites or recurrent chyle leak at the time of the 18-month follow-up visit.

Conclusions

LD-RT for refractory postoperative chylous ascites is a safe and reasonable option that can provide temporary relief in addition to other conservative methods. This is the first reported case of refractory chylous ascites in the United States that was successfully treated with LD-RT.

### Chylous ascites management after pancreatic surgery [^d869608d]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative chylous ascites (CA) following pancreatic surgery is uncommon. If left untreated, it leads to malnutrition, immunodeficiency and increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to seek out risk factors associated with CA onset and conservative treatment (CT) failure in order to determine better management of CA following pancreatic resection.

Materials and Methods

All consecutive patients who underwent pancreatic surgery between 2004 and 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Main demographic, clinical and pathological data were searched for CA risk factors. Patients with CA successfully treated with CT alone were compared to those requiring additional bipedal lymphangiography (BPLAG) in order to seek out risk factors associated with CT failure.

Results

Fifteen patients (2.4 %) developed CA after pancreatic surgery. Para-aortic lymph node sampling and early enteral feeding were found to be independent risk factors for postoperative CA (OR 6.36, p = 0.024 and OR 12.18, p = 0.02, respectively). CT was successful in ten patients, and five patients required additional BPLAG to achieve CA resolution. Statistical analysis revealed no significant risk factors for CT failure, including total lymph node count (p = 0.196), para-aortic lymph node sampling (p = 0.661) or maximum chyle loss per day (p = 0.758).

Conclusions

Owing to postoperative CA rarity, there is no consensus in treatment. Early on, CT should be attempted in all patients with CA. BPLAG is a safe and efficient procedure that should be discussed earlier in the step-up therapeutic management.

### The incidence of chylous ascites after liver transplantation and the proposal of a diagnostic and management protocol [^ed39ff20]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

No protocol has been established for the diagnosis and management of chylous ascites after liver transplantation (LT). In this study, we retrospectively reviewed our cases of posttransplant chylous ascites (PTCA) and aimed to propose a diagnostic and management protocol.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 96 LT recipients who underwent LT at our department. The incidence of PTCA and the associated risk factors were analyzed and our protocol for chylous ascites was evaluated.

Results

PTCA occurred in 6 (6.3%) patients (mean age: 10.7±11.0years) at a mean of 10.8±3.6days after LT. The primary disease in all of PTCA cases was biliary atresia (BA). The periportal lymphadnopathy was an independent risk factor for PTCA. In all cases PTCA successfully resolved according to our protocol. Octreotide was administered in 4 of our 6 PTCA cases. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 40.2±8.4days, which was similar to that of cases without PTCA.

Conclusions

The incidence of PTCA in LT patients, especially in those with BA, is relatively high. Our diagnostic criteria and our management protocol were helpful for patients with refractory ascites after LT.

Type Of Study

Diagnostic test: Level II. Treatment study: Level III.

### Contemporary management of chylous ascites after retroperitoneal surgery: development of an evidence-based treatment algorithm [^dee065db]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chylous ascites (CA) is an uncommon complication that occurs from traumatic disruption of lymphatic channels after retroperitoneal surgery. The purpose of this study was to generate an evidence-based management strategy for CA by reviewing the current literature and available treatment modalities.

Materials and Methods

A MEDLINE® literature review was performed for "chylous ascites." Individual patient data were extracted from case series and reports to create an efficacy analysis. Treatment modality, drain output, time to escalation of care and time to resolution were recorded. The efficacy analysis was utilized to generate a data-driven treatment algorithm.

Results

The literature review yielded 1,953 articles, from which 146 studies contributed data for 523 patients. The efficacy analysis included 245 patients, 168 (69%) of whom were managed successfully with conservative management (CM), at a median time to resolution of 11 days. Forty-eight patients underwent lymphangiography±embolization after CM, with a success rate of 85%. Thirty-one (12%) patients underwent surgical exploration. When treating CA, the patients who underwent stepwise management with CM followed by lymphangiography if CM failed experienced a resolution rate of 96.7%. An evidence-based treatment algorithm was created to guide treatment selection and duration of therapy before escalating to additional forms of therapy.

Conclusions

In this report, we describe the largest conglomeration of iatrogenic CA cases from a literature review (523 cases) and efficacy analysis (245 cases), and created the first evidence-based treatment algorithm for this condition. Treatment success is substantial when using a stepwise combination of CM followed by lymphangiography±embolization.

### Idiopathic chylous ascites treated with total parenteral nutrition and octreotide. A case report and review of the literature [^20d4367d]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Chylous ascites is the accumulation of lipid-rich lymph in the peritoneal cavity. The usual cause in adults is lymphatic obstruction or leakage caused by malignancy. Non-malignant causes include postoperative trauma, cirrhosis, tuberculosis, pancreatitis and filariasis. A variety of treatment options have been proposed for the management of chylous ascites; however, their effectiveness in idiopathic or primary form is unknown. Here we report a case of chylous acid rapidly resolved with the treatment of fasting, total parenteral nutrition and somatostatin analogue.

### Chylous ascites after hepatopancreatobiliary surgery [^6f099349]. The British Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative chylous ascites following abdominal surgery is uncommon. It potentially induces malnutrition and immunodeficiency, contributing to increased mortality. In the field of hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgery, no large studies have been conducted that focused on postoperative chylous ascites. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, risk factors and management of chylous ascites following HPB surgery, with particular emphasis on pancreatic resection.

Methods

Consecutive patients who had HPB surgery between 2000 and 2011 at a single institution were reviewed retrospectively. Chyle leak was defined as 100 ml/day or more of milky, amylase-free peritoneal fluid with a triglyceride concentration of 110 mg/dl or above. Risk factors for chylous ascites associated with pancreatic resection and the clinical efficacy of octreotide in treating chylous ascites were evaluated.

Results

Of 2002 consecutive patients who underwent HPB surgery during the study period, 21 (1·0 per cent) developed chylous ascites. Chylous ascites occurred relatively frequently in patients who had a pancreatic resection, such as pancreaticoduodenectomy (3·3 per cent) or distal pancreatectomy (3·8 per cent). Multivariable analysis revealed that manipulation of the para-aortic area (P < 0·001), retroperitoneal invasion (P = 0·031) and early enteral feeding after operation (P < 0·001) were independent risk factors for chylous ascites following pancreatic resection. Octreotide treatment decreased drainage output of chylous ascites on day 1 after initiation of treatment (P = 0·002).

Conclusion

Chylous ascites is a rare complication following HPB surgery. It is more common after pancreatic resection. Treatment with octreotide combined with total parenteral nutrition is recommended.

### Chylous ascites following treatment for gynecologic malignancies [^ebbb195e]. Gynecologic Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Chylous ascites is a rare complication following abdominal radiation or para-aortic lymph node dissection in the management of gynecologic malignancies. Treatment options include dietary restriction with addition of medium-chain triglycerides, serial paracenteses, total parenteral nutrition, and somatostatin. Current opinion advocates that surgical exploration and peritoneo-venous shunts be reserved for refractory cases.

Cases

Two patients developed chylous ascites, one after completion of surgical staging and chemoradiation for stage IIB squamous carcinoma of the cervix and one following para-aortic lymph node dissection for recurrent malignant mixed mullerian tumor of the endometrium. In both cases resolution of the chylous ascites followed placement of a peritoneo-venous shunt.

Conclusions

Chylous ascites should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ascites in patients with gynecologic malignancy treated with radiation or para-aortic lymph node dissection.

### Traumatic chylous ascites (...) [^9446429b]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

SPONTANEOUS extravasation of chyle into the free peritoneal cavity is uncommon, but even more uncommon is the finding of chylous ascites following trauma. The rarity of this entity is emphasized by the discovery of only seven reported cases of traumatic chylous ascites in the world literature. There is little doubt in the minds of the authors that more cases than these must occur, but they go either unrecognized or undiagnosed. It thus appeared worthwhile to draw attention to this unusual clinical entity by setting forth the facts concerning this eighth case of traumatic chylous ascites which occurred in a 26-month-old child. Further, this case serves to illustrate that the diagnosis can be made preoperatively and that early surgical intervention is appropriate and desirable. Report of Case A 26-month-old white boy was transferred to the US Naval Hospital, St. Albans, NY about 24 hours following injury.

### Postoperative chylothorax [^121f7b27]. Chest Surgery Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is an unusual complication of surgical procedures within the chest. Early recognition is important so that appropriate conservative measures can be applied. Operative intervention after a short course of supportive therapy will control most chyle fistulas. Methods of diagnosis in the postoperative setting and literature supporting various treatment options are the focus of this article.

### Chylous ascites after excision of a choledochal cyst in a child [^d657f27d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

We report a case of chylous ascites developing 2 weeks after excision of a choledochal cyst with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Despite the failure of the initial attempts to resolve the chylous ascites by fasting, subsequently, we successfully treated the patient's chylous ascites with intravenous somatostatin. No obvious adverse side effects occurred during the use of somatostatin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of chylous ascites after choledochal cyst excision in children, which was successfully treated with somatostatin. Somatostatin may be considered as a therapeutic option of managing pediatric postoperative chylous ascites.

### Laparoscopic approach for correction of chylous fistula after pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy [^86d4d72f]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Chylous fistula is an uncommon but challenging complication after lymphadenectomy for treatment of gynecologic cancers. Its presence contributes substantially to increased morbidity and may retard the onset of adjuvant therapies. Treatment options include dietary modifications or surgical intervention. A 68-year-old woman with renal insufficiency developed chylous ascites after pelvic und para-aortic laparoscopic lymph node dissection followed by chemoradiation for treatment of class IIb cervical cancer. Conservative treatment failed, and the patient underwent laparoscopic exploration. The leakage was identified near the cisterna chyle, and was closed with sutures. There was no evidence of recurrence after 2-month follow-up. This case demonstrates successful laparoscopic management of chylous ascites after para-aortic lymphadenectomy and chemoradiation, using suturing.

### Management protocol for chylous ascites after laparoscopic nephrectomy [^0c8e9f92]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To devise a management protocol for chylous ascites after laparoscopic nephrectomy.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the data of the patients that underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy between January 2010 and January 2014 in our institution for different indications and were diagnosed with chylous ascites. We also analyzed a different management protocol that was used.

Results

The overall incident rate of chylous ascites was 0.77%. It was more commonly seen on left side and with simple nephrectomy rather than radical. Three out of 9 patients were managed by surgical intervention, rest were successfully managed on conservative treatment in the form of dietary modification, total parenteral nutrition, or octreotide.

Conclusion

Chylous ascites is a rare but morbid condition following laparoscopic nephrectomy. To manage this complication, we propose preventive and treatment strategies based on symptoms and amount of chylous ascites using our experience and review of the literature.

### Chylous ascites following para-aortic lymphadenectomy: a case report [^d2c79adc]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Chylous ascites is an uncommon complication following para-aortic lymph node dissection in the management of gynecologic malignancies. Treatment options are serial paracentesis, medium-chain triglyceride diet, total parenteral nutrition and somatostatin as conservative management and peritoneovenous shunting, and surgical exploration for refractory cases.

Case

A 31-year-old female patient developed chylous ascites following para-aortic lymph node dissection for borderline mucinous tumor of the ovary. Conservative management options failed with recurrence of chylous ascites. Chylous ascites resolved after surgical closure of the lymphatic fistula on the cisterna chyli. There was no evidence of ascites at 10 months follow-up.

Conclusion

If the patient is a good surgical candidate, surgical exploration should be considered earlier in the treatment of refractory chylous ascites.

### Incidence and risk factors for chyle leaks after neuroblastic tumor resection: a systematic review of published studies [^5e375dda]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chyle leakage/ascites after surgical resection of neuroblastic tumors may delay the start of chemotherapy and worsen prognosis. Previous studies have reported a highly variable incidence and risk factors remain largely unknown. This study aims to analyze the true incidence of chyle leaks and ascites and seeks to identify risk factors and optimal treatment strategies.

Methods

Medline/Embase databases were searched according to PRISMA guidelines. Literature reviews, case reports, and non-English papers were excluded. Data were extracted independently following paper selection by 2 authors.

Results

The final analysis yielded 15 studies with N = 1468 patients. Chylous ascites was recorded postoperatively in 171 patients (12%). Most patients experiencing chyle leaks were successfully treated conservatively with drainage, bowel rest, parenteral nutrition and octreotide with variable combinations of these treatment options. 7/171 (4%) patients required operative exploration to control troublesome persistent chyle leaks. In risk factor analysis, higher tumor stage was significantly associated with the risk of chyle leak (P < 0.0001) whereas no correlation was observed with adrenal vs non-adrenal tumor location, INRG risk groups and tumor laterality.

Conclusion

Chyle leakage after surgery for neuroblastic tumors is a common morbid complication occurring in some 12% of patients. Higher INSS tumor stage portends greater risk(s). Conservative therapy strategies appear successful in the majority of cases. To avert this complication meticulous mesenteric lymphatic ligation is recommended especially for those patients with higher tumor stage(s) requiring extensive radical surgery including retroperitoneal lymph node resection.

### Chylous ascites after pancreaticoduodenectomy: introduction of a grading system [^5e7bfa97]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Chylous ascites (CA) is a complication that follows thoracic and abdominal surgery, recognized after provocation by enteral feeding and characterized by its milky appearance from an elevated triglyceride level. The aim of this study was to evaluate incidence, management, and predisposing factors of CA and its impact on outcomes after pancreaticoduodenectomy.

Study Design

Between 1996 and 2007, 609 consecutive patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. Patients having a drain output with a milky appearance, and with a triglyceride level greater than 1.2 mmol/L, were compared with patients without significant drain production or with a low triglyceride level. Management of CA was reviewed.

Results

Sixty-six patients had isolated CA (11%) of any measurable volume, 440 patients (72%) had no CA, and 109 patients (16%) were excluded from analysis. CA was diagnosed on postoperative day 6 (median; interquartile range 5 to 8), generally after introduction of a normal (polymeric low-chain-triglyceride) diet. Female gender (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.03) and chronic pancreatitis at pathology (odds ratio, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.19 to 5.32) were independently associated with development of isolated CA. A low-chain-triglyceride-restricted diet was initiated in 47 patients, 3 were started on total parenteral nutrition, and an expectative approach was followed in 16 patients. CA resolved after 3.5 days (median; interquartile range, 2 to 5). Isolated CA was significantly associated with prolonged hospital stay (p=0.002).

Conclusions

We propose a novel definition and grading system for CA after pancreaticoduodenectomy, according to which the incidence is 9%, with clinically significant CA occurring in 4% (grades B and C). Although female gender and (focal) chronic pancreatitis were associated with development of isolated CA, no predisposing factors that could readily anticipate CA were identified. Isolated CA was associated with prolonged hospital stay.

### Chylous ascites after laparoscopic lymph node dissection in gynecologic malignancies [^846cc5f2]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the clinical presentation, epidemiology, risk factors, and treatment of chylous ascites after laparoscopic lymphadenectomy to treat gynecologic malignancies.

Design

Retrospective study with review of outcomes (Canadian Task Force classification II-3).

Setting

University research hospital.

Patients

From November 2009 to December 2012, 997 patients underwent laparoscopic lymphadenectomy to treat gynecologic malignancies at our hospital.

Interventions

Postoperative chylous ascites resolved with continuous drainage and dietary restriction or fasting.

Measurements and Main Results

Nine of 997 patients (0.9%) developed chylous ascites postoperatively. Mean age of these 9 patients was 47.5 years. Median time from operation to development of chylous ascites was 4 days (range, 2-9 days). Chylous ascites developed on either day 1 in 6 patients, day 2 in 2 patients, and day 8 in 1 patient, after food intake. We found that postoperative chylous ascites was associated more with para-aortic lymphadenectomy than with pelvic lymphadenectomy (overall incidence, 0.9%; 4.08% in the para-aortic lymphadenectomy group vs 0.35% in the pelvic lymphadenectomy group). In all patients, chylous ascites resolved with conservative treatment. Median time to resolution was 7 days (range, 3-9 days). Drainage tubes were removed within 9 days after treatment.

Conclusions

The incidence of chylous ascites after laparoscopic lymphadenectomy was 0.9%. Para-aortic lymphadenectomy was associated with postoperative chylous ascites. Chylous ascites was successfully treated with conservative management. An abdominal drainage tube can be a simple and effective approach and should be considered in the treatment of chylous ascites.

### Conservative management of chylous ascites after removal of a symptomatic growing retroperitoneal teratoma [^745bcac0]. Gynecologic Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chylous ascites as a postoperative complication of gynecologic surgery is uncommon. Cases usually occur from trauma to the lymphatic system during retroperitoneal dissection. Initial management includes paracentesis with institution of a low-fat, medium-chain triglyceride diet and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Surgical intervention may be required.

Case

A 19-year-old female patient with a history of an immature teratoma treated with chemotherapy presented with a retroperitoneal mass. Removal of the mass revealed mature teratoma and resulted in chylous ascites formation. Multiple paracenteses were performed in conjunction with dietary modification and TPN. Three months after the patient's surgery, the ascites spontaneously resolved.

Conclusion

Although surgical intervention is recommended after failure of conservative management, this case demonstrates that damage to the cisterna chyli may spontaneously resolve.

### Diagnosis and management of primary chylous ascites [^bd5127de]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chylous ascites is the accumulation of triglyceride-rich, free, milk-like peritoneal fluid caused by the presence of intestinal lymph in the abdominal cavity. Primary chylous ascites is uncommon. We present our experience in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

Methods

Twelve patients (7 adults, 5 children) affected by primary chylous ascites were studied. Diagnostic investigations included abdominal sonography scans, lymphoscintigraphy, and lymphography combined with computed tomography (CT) with intravenous and intralymphatic lipid-soluble contrast, and laparoscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging was used when lymphography and lymphatic CT were not able to define the dysplasia well, or in the presence of lymphatic dilatation. Surgical treatment included laparoscopy (12/12), drainage of ascites (12/12), the search for and treatment of abdominal and retroperitoneal chylous leaks (12/12), exeresis of lymphodysplastic tissues (12/12), ligation of incompetent lymph vessels (9/12), carbon dioxide laser treatment (cut and welding effects) of the dilated lymph vessels using an operating microscope for magnification (9/12), and chylovenous and lymphovenous microsurgical shunts (7/12).

Results

Eight patients did not have a relapse of the ascites, and three patients had a persistence of a small quantity of ascites with no protein imbalance. Postoperative lymphoscintigraphy in seven patients confirmed better lymph flow and less lymph reflux. Median follow-up was 5 years (range, 3 to 7 years). We observed early relapse of chylous ascites in only one case that required a peritoneal-jugular shunt and led to good outcome.

Conclusion

Primary chylous ascites is closely correlated to lymphatic-lymphonodal dysplasia that does not involve a single visceral district alone. Medical preoperative treatment played an essential role in the global management of this complex pathology. We demonstrated that the use of laparoscopy is remarkably advantageous for confirming diagnosis, for draining the ascites, and for evaluating the extension of the dysplasia. Our diagnostic work-up provided us with an exact diagnostic assessment and allowed us to plan a precise surgical approach.

### Laparoscopic management of chylous ascites following laparoscopic donor nephrectomy [^eb55346f]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) is an established operation for organ procurement in living donor transplantation. Living donor renal transplantation is being performed more frequently and is associated with better graft function and survival. The minimal access approach for organ procurement from healthy individuals ensures early convalescence and improved patient participation. Here we describe a rare complication of LDN. Postoperative chylous ascites frequently occurs secondary to aortic surgery. Though previously described after LDN, its treatment remains contentious. Conventional strategies have adopted an expectant approach with medical management. These include parenteral feeding, bowel rest and somatostatin analogue usage. We report laparoscopic suture ligation as the principal management of postoperative chyle leak. We advocate surgical exploration in acute onset, high output chylous ascites. Pre-existing port site incisions were used for undertaking successful laparoscopic repair. This surgical approach enabled faster convalescence and reduced hospital stay-important considerations for our healthy living donor.

### Chylous ascites after radical nephrectomy and inferior vena cava thrombectomy. successful conservative management with somatostatin analogue [^a1c1c161]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Postoperative chylous ascites is a rare complication of retroperitoneal surgery. The treatment of postoperative chylous ascites is primarily conservative, consisting of repeated paraceteses, medium chain triglyceride (MCT) diet, salt restriction, diuretics and bowel rest with total parenteral nutrition. Occasionally, chylous ascites may take a protracted course which may necessitate insertion of peritoneo-venous shunts or direct surgical lymphostasis. Recently, Somatostatin was shown to be highly effective in closure of refractory lymphatic fistulas. We present a case of refractory chylous ascites following radical nephrectomy with inferior vena caval thrombectomy that failed to respond to conventional conservative measures and resolved rapidly following the administration of Somatostatin.

### Chylous ascites: analysis of 24 patients [^65b036d7]. Gynecologic Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Chylous ascites is the pathologic accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Patients who underwent surgery for gynecologic malignancy and had postoperative chylous ascites were evaluated retrospectively.

Methods

We reviewed 1514 patients who had staging surgery for gynecologic malignancy at our institution from January 2003 to February 2012. We analyze the patients who develop chylous ascites and who didn't.

Results

Twenty-four (2%) patients had postoperative chylous ascites. In the patients with chylous ascites, the median number of removed para-aortic lymph nodes was 26 (range 8-54), while this number was 17 (range 1-76) for the patients who didn't develop chylous ascites (p=0.001). Among the patients with chylous ascites, nine patients took chylous diet and 15 patients took TPN as the initial treatment. Totally seven (29%) patients required surgical correction, since 17 (71%) responded to conservative treatment. In the TPN group, the time from staging surgery to the diagnosis of chylous ascites was significantly longer in the group who required surgery compared with the group who did not (20 days vs 8 days, p:0.037). In addition this time wasn't statistically different from the patients' time in the diet group who didn't require surgery.

Conclusion

The aggressiveness of para-aortic lymphadenectomy should be individualized and the lymphatics should be controlled with suture ligation or hemoclips, since the extent and method of para-aortic lymphadenectomy has a determinative role in the development of chylous ascites. It may be logical to treat chylous ascites with diet rather than TPN initially in case the symptoms occur later.

### How we approach pediatric congenital chylous effusions and ascites [^ee447d5b]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital lymphatic leak may develop in patients with maldeveloped lymphatics and result in life-threatening fluid and electrolyte imbalance, protein deficiency, and immunodeficiency. Rapid diagnosis and therapy are necessary to prevent these complications; however, the field lacks clinical trials to support standardized diagnostic treatment guidelines. We present our current multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of congenital lymphatic leak including chylous pleural effusions and ascites. Depending on the rate of lymphatic leak, therapy can range from observation with nutritional modifications to surgical and interventional procedures aimed to reduce lymphatic drainage. Modalities to image central and peripheral lymphatics have advanced considerably. Genetic variants and subsequent targets that drive lymphatic maldevelopment have expanded the repertoire of possible pharmacotherapeutic options.

### Lymphatic chyle duct injury and identification during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy preventing postoperative chylous ascites [^6f381ced]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Knowledge of the anatomical variation possibility and intraoperative identification of ductal anomalies during bariatric surgeries can further decrease the rate of CDI, improving the patient outcome and avoiding unnecessary complications. Iatrogenic intraoperatively identified CDI can be treated by simple ligature or clipping of the duct. However, if the injury went unnoticed, CA would develop and might need further follow-up and management. Managing CA may entail drainage, conservative follow-up, pharmacological therapy such as octreotide, and surgical management.

CDI after LSG might confuse surgeons as to the color of the drain output, which may indicate either leakage or pancreatic injury. This would put the patients to more postoperative interventions such as computed tomography, lymphangiography, multiple ultrasound-guided aspirations, and re-operation resulting in increased morbidity.

### Retroperitoneal exploration with vicryl mesh and fibrin tissue sealant for refractory chylous ascites [^431490ee]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital chylous ascites poses a significant challenge in neonatal care, and often results in prolonged, complex hospital stays and increased mortality. Few effective options exist in refractory cases.

Methods

Patients aged 0 to 12 months with refractory chylous ascites underwent retroperitoneal exploration after medical treatment and minimally invasive therapies were unsuccessful. The retroperitoneum was completely exposed via left and right medial visceral rotation and opening the lesser sac. Visible leaks were ligated, and alternating layers of fibrin glue and Vicryl mesh were used to cover the entire retroperitoneum.

Results

All 4 patients had resolution of their chylous ascites. None required reoperation or reintervention for chyle leaks. All achieved goal enteral feeds at a median of 29 days postoperatively and were discharged from hospital at a median of 42 days postoperatively.

Conclusions

Management of chylous ascites is extremely challenging in refractory cases. Complete retroperitoneal exposure with fibrin glue and Vicryl mesh application offers a definitive, reliable therapy for achieving cessation of lymphatic leakage and ultimate recovery for patients who fail all nonoperative approaches.

### Chylous ascites after post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection: review of the M. D. anderson experience [^d77feaf8]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined the clinical presentation, risk factors and optimal treatment of chylous ascites that develop after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with testicular cancer.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 329 patients who underwent post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection at our institution, of whom 23 (7%) had chylous ascites postoperatively. Clinical and pathological parameters were entered into a database.

Results

Mean patient age at chylous ascites presentation was 32.1 years. On univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses increasing amounts of preoperative chemotherapy (OR 1.24) and intraoperative blood loss (OR 1.33) were predictive of chylous ascites. The clinical presentation of chylous ascites consisted of abdominal fullness and distention in all patients. Initial treatment was paracentesis alone or combined with total parenteral nutrition in 77% of patients. An abdominal drain was used for persistent ascites in 10 patients. In patients treated conservatively the rate of resolution of chylous ascites was 77%. Only 23% of patients required peritoneovenous shunt placement. However, shunt use was associated with an 80% surgical revision rate.

Conclusions

Conservative treatment resolves most cases of postoperative chylous ascites. An abdominal catheter drain should be considered for significant or recurring chylous ascites. When a peritoneovenous shunt is required, it may be needed for an extensive period for resolution and there are significant complications associated with its use. Increasing amounts of preoperative chemotherapy and operative blood loss raise the likelihood of chylous ascites.

### Use of propranolol in the treatment of chylous effusions in infants [^cce0217c]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Chylothorax and chyloperitoneum are rare in infants and challenging to definitively diagnose by using current criteria extrapolated from the adult population. They can be of primary or secondary etiologies, including congenital lymphatic malformations and postoperatively, after cardiothoracic or abdominal surgery. Current first-line management consists of bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and a modified diet of medium-chain triglycerides but can often take weeks to be effective. Off-label use of octreotide has been reported in numerous case studies for the management of chylous effusions. However, there are no definitive neonatal data available regarding dosing, safety, and efficacy; moreover, octreotide has a side effect profile that been linked to serious morbidities, such as pulmonary hypertension and necrotizing enterocolitis. Propranolol, commonly used for the treatment of infantile hemangiomas, is currently gaining interest as a novel therapy for chylous effusions. In this case series review, we describe the use of propranolol in 4 infants with presumed chylous effusions: 1 with congenital pleural effusions and 3 infants who developed postoperative chylothorax and/or chylous ascites. Clinical improvement was noted within a few days of initiating oral propranolol, and the maximum dose used in our cases was 6 mg/kg per day. In previous case reports, researchers describe the use of oral propranolol in infants with chylous effusions, with the dose used ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/kg per day. However, this is the first case series in which researchers report its use exclusively in infants with chylothorax and chyloperitoneum. Although further research is needed to establish safety and efficacy, our experiences suggest that propranolol could be an acceptable treatment option for chylous effusions in infants.

### Chylous ascites (...) [^2bbbe501]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

When a condition appears rarely and sporadically, few clinicians have the opportunity to collect adequate information and to develop interest and expertise. Such is the case with chylous ascites and, as a result, many aspects of this phenomenon remain poorly understood. The pathophysiology has not been clearly defined, the underlying disease often proves elusive with present diagnostic procedures, and effective therapy is frequently not possible. The incidence has not been satisfactorily established; at Charity Hospital of Louisiana, New Orleans, there was approximately one patient per 100, 000 admissions from 1936 to 1956. 1 The actual occurrence of chylous ascites is probably higher, as the condition is usually unsuspected; the patient may die or the process resolve without the presence of the condition being revealed by paracentesis.

In addition, the incidence is probably not constant, and is likely to vary as etiological factors vary with geographical area or with the. Lesser GT, Bruno MS, Enselberg K. Chylous Ascites: Newer Insights and Many Remaining Enigmas. Arch Intern Med. 1970; 125: 1073–1077. doi:

### Lymphatic chyle duct injury and identification during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy preventing postoperative chylous ascites [^443e394a]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CDI and CA are rare complications of LSG; however, knowledge of such complications should be a prerequisite for all bariatric surgeons. Lymphatic duct injury can be avoided during LSG, through proper dissection, and identification of the hiatus, with a background knowledge of the possible anatomical variants of CD that could be anticipated. Undermining the use of advanced camera sets during bariatric surgeries might increase the risk of CDI. Management of intraoperative CDI can be treated by ligation of the duct. Therefore, we recommend that further studies should focus on CDI, its prevention, and evaluating its postoperative outcome.

### Interventional solutions for post-surgical problems: a lymphatic leaks review [^0fc318b8]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Chylous ascites

Similar to chylothorax, the aetiology of chylous ascites can be traumatic or non-traumatic. Non-traumatic causes include inflammatory and infectious diseases like tuberculosis, filariasis, radiation, pancreatitis neoplasms as lymphoma traumatic or postoperative causes encompass blunt abdominal trauma, aortic surgery and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy, among others. Typically, management commences with a conservative approach. In recurrent or severe cases, surgical alternatives may be considered.

Despite interventional procedures have been documented in the management of chylous ascites, the effectiveness is lower than thoracic duct embolization for chylothorax. Approximately 55% of patients with chylous ascites have lipiodol extravasation detected with LA which makes more difficult to define the best treatment strategy. The success of LA and embolization is closely tied to the accurate representation of the leak. Several percutaneous procedures have been described in this clinical setting including TD embolization, BORALE technique, mesenteric lymphangiography and interstitial embolization. When lymphatic leak is not demonstrated following groin lymph node injection direct puncture of a mesenteric lymph node can be beneficial (Fig 5 a, b). Direct access to the leak, along with catheterization and embolization, or retrograde access with balloon occlusion and embolization, may also yield effective occlusion of the leak (Fig. 6 a-c). Furthermore, in certain clinical scenarios, such as chylous ascites post-pancreatic or liver surgery, transhepatic lymphatic embolization has demonstrated efficacy in treating the leak (Fig 7 a-c).

### Chyle leak following radical En bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^cd797165]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

The principles of conservative management of chyle leak include reduction of chyle flow, drainage of the pleural cavity for chylothorax, nutritional support, and the prevention of septic complications.Immunosuppression is problematic, particularly in those who have a prolonged chyle leak. The opportunistic infection with Pneumocystis carinii on a background of massive chylous ascites has been previously reported and prompted the introduction of routine prophylactic antimicrobials in cases of chyle leak.The two other series detailing rates of infective complications have reported increased rates, particularly rates of respiratory infections in patients with chyle leaks.In the present series, the rates of wound and respiratory complications were not significantly raised in patients with chyle leak compared with the other group, however prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole is employed as standard in patients with a chyle leak and low lymphocyte count.

In recent years, there has been a move towards earlier surgical intervention for postoperative chyle leak. Cerfolio suggested reoperation when drainage volumes exceeded 1000 mL/day for 5 days,while Alexiou et al. suggested reoperation for those with high output chylothorax not settling after a week of conservative management.For very high-volume leaks (> 2000 mL/day), early surgery after only 2 days of conservative treatment has been proposed,while Merrigan et al.advocate reoperation immediately after the diagnosis has been made. An advantage of early reoperation is the opportunity to repair the leak before the patient becomes significantly weakened and immunocompromised by the ongoing loss of chyle. In this study, there were only two deaths among patients undergoing surgical management, compared with eight in the non-surgical group, suggesting that this could be considered a safe and effective treatment. In the majority of our cases (82%), the site of leak was clearly identified and treated at reoperation. Preoperative administration of a cream bolus, lymphoscintigrapy, lymphangiography, and computed tomography (CT) scanning have all been suggested as aids to identify the leak site, but the authors have not found routine use of these techniques to be necessary. Multiple alternative approaches to the management of chyle leak have been described, such as a thoracoscopic or abdominal/transhiatal approach if the chyle leak was originating from the abdomen.–These have arisen both out of a desire to avoid the morbidity perceived to be associated with re-thoracotomy and to provide alternatives where surgical treatment has failed.

### Chylous ascites complicating modified radical hysterectomy for placenta percreta [^53254935]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chylous ascites is defined as the pathologic accumulation of lymphatic fluid within the peritoneal cavity and has been reported to complicate gynecologic surgeries, with an incidence of 0.17-2%. We report a case of chylous ascites after complex surgery for placenta percreta.

Case

A 26-year-old woman underwent cesarean delivery followed by bilateral uterine artery embolization and modified radical hysterectomy at 26 5/7 weeks of gestation for placenta percreta invading the urinary bladder. No surgical dissection was performed above the pelvic brim or deep into the pelvic sidewalls. On postoperative day 4, milky fluid consistent with chylous ascites was noted coming from a percutaneous drain. This completely resolved after 12 days of conservative management with intravenous nutritional support.

Conclusion

Chylous ascites is a potential complication of modified radical hysterectomy for placenta percreta that responds to conservative management.

### Lymphatic chyle duct injury and identification during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy preventing postoperative chylous ascites [^5bb35f65]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chylous ascites (CA) or chyloperitoneum (ChP) is defined as the presence of intra-peritoneal triglyceride-rich chyle, due to chyle duct injuries (CDI). Chylous ascites is an uncommon clinical presentation first described in 1912, as an accumulation of chyle from intestinal or thoracic lymph. There is no recent data regarding the incidence of chylous ascites, and the last dated study in 1984 indicated an incidence as low as 1 per 20,000 hospital admissions. The most common causes of CDI are atraumatic causes and lymphatic anomalies.

CDI following LSG typically occurs due to extensive dissection or thermal injuries to one of the lymphatic duct tributaries of the cisterna chyli near the hiatus. While CDI during bariatric surgery has been documented, not all surgeons are proficient in recognizing this rare complication. In this video article, we are presenting a case of CDI during LSG that was identified and managed intraoperatively, to both raise the knowledge of this rare complication and highlight the possibility of its intraoperative management, avoiding a more complicated postoperative course.

### Extracorporeal peritoneovenous shunt for the management of postaneurysmectomy chylous ascites in a Marfan patient [^4bdd8413]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Chylous ascites is an uncommon complication after aortic and other retroperitoneal surgeries. The management is very specific to the etiology and clinical status of the patient. The mortality from chylous ascites is not negligible, and aggressive measures are often needed. A voluminous chylous ascites developed in a 38-year-old woman after an open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair that was refractive to initial therapeutic interventions. We used an extracorporeal peritoneovenous shunt to control the abdominal ascites and improve the patient's immunologic and nutritional status.

### Chylous ascites after liver transplantation: incidence and risk factors [^71a24dd3]. Liver Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

In this study, we evaluated the diagnosis, epidemiology, risk factors, and treatment of chylous ascites developing after liver transplantation (LT). Between 2002 and 2011, LT was performed 693 times in 631 patients at our clinic. One-hundred fifteen of these patients were excluded for reasons such as retransplantation, early postoperative mortality, and insufficient data. Chylous ascites developed after LT (mean ± SD = 8.0 ± 3.2 days, range = 5-17 days) in 24 of the 516 patients included in this study. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we examined whether the following were risk factors for developing chylous ascites: age, sex, body mass index, graft-to-recipient weight ratio, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, vena cava cross-clamping time, total operation time, Child-Pugh classification, sodium level, portal vein thrombosis or ascites before transplantation, donor type, albumin level, and perihepatic dissection technique [LigaSure vessel sealing system (LVSS) versus conventional suture ligation]. According to a univariate analysis, a low albumin level (P = 0.04), the presence of ascites before transplantation (P = 0.03), and the use of LVSS for perihepatic dissection (P < 0.01) were risk factors for developing chylous ascites. According to a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, the presence of pretransplant ascites [P = 0.04, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-13.5] and the use of LVSS for perihepatic dissection (P = 0.01, HR = 5.4, 95% CI = 1.5-34.4) were independent risk factors. In conclusion, the presence of preoperative ascites and the use of LVSS for perihepatic dissection are independent risk factors for the formation of chylous ascites. To our knowledge, this study is the most extensive examination of the development of chylous ascites. Nevertheless, our results should be supported by new prospective trials.

### Japanese clinical practice guidelines for vascular anomalies 2017 [^04f6738e]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

The necessity of treatment of a patient with intra‐abdominal LM with few symptoms should be determined after evaluating the balance between the risk of treatment and non‐treatment considering its site and size as well as patient age. However, because research on indications for treatments has been insufficient so far and serious complications after treatment have been reported, deliberate evaluation for each patient is mandatory. When observation is selected, periodic imaging studies are recommended to optimize therapeutic intervention by detecting enlargement of the lesion. Also, if any symptom has developed during follow up, intervention should be considered. For these reasons, the recommendation, “Because there is risk of treatment‐related complications, it is proposed to consider therapeutic intervention when the lesion tends to enlarge or has become symptomatic” was adopted.



CQ27: What treatments are effective for refractory chylous ascites?

Recommendation : Conservative treatments, such as fasting, high‐calorie infusion and medium chain triglyceride (MCT), should be performed first, but, if they are ineffective, drug treatment, sclerotherapy and surgery may also be considered.

Strength of recommendation : 2 (weak).

Evidence : D (very weak).

Comments :

Process of preparation of recommendation

Refractory chylous ascites causes loss of large amounts of protein and lymphocytes, decreases in the blood lipid levels, and abdominal pain, unpleasantness and dyspnea due to abdominal distention and markedly reduces quality of life. The cause of ascites often remains unknown. Treatment of chylous ascites may require drainage to avoid abdominal distention. It is a very important point for clinicians to make proper judgments by understanding treatments and their effects and demerits. Therefore, it is considered beneficial to collect information about chylous ascites over a long period and compile guidelines. For this purpose, the presently available knowledge was collected by formulating the CQ, “What treatments are effective for refractory chylous ascites?”.

### CT-guided intranodal lymphangiography for postoperative chylous ascites [^5ba52cb6]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The utility and minimal invasiveness of ultrasound-guided intranodal lymphangiography have already been reported by several researchers. Although ultrasound-guided intranodal lymphangiography is known to be not technically difficult in general, a patient's edematous groin due to hypoalbuminemia resulting from chylous ascites made it too challenging to detect and prick the lymph nodes precisely. This report describes a 71-year-old female with refractory chylous ascites due to an operation for an extrahepatic bile duct cancer, who was successfully treated by computed tomography (CT)-guided intranodal lymphangiography. After switching from ultrasound- to CT-guided lymphangiography, the procedure was successfully performed, and the refractory chylous ascites was treated.

### Case report: laparoscopic management of massive chylous ascites after salvage laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph-node dissection [^974a4006]. Journal of Endourology (2006). Low credibility.

Chylous ascites is an infrequent complication of retroperitoneal surgery. We describe a patient who suffered massive chylous ascites after simultaneous pneumonectomy and laparoscopic excision of a post-chemotherapy tumor mass. After conservative management failed, exploratory laparoscopy identified the site of the leak, which was clipped and closed with fibrin glue. There has been no recurrence in the ensuing 5 years.

### Octreotide in malignant chylothorax: a case report [^7124b16c]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2016). Medium credibility.

The treatment of malignancy-associated chylous pleural effusion and ascites, especially in the palliative setting, represents a major therapeutic challenge. Our patient, a case of metastatic lung cancer, was suffering from high-output, non-resolving, malignancy-related chylothorax. We found that subcutaneous octreotide in combination with fasting and total parenteral nutrition, followed later by institution of low-fat diet, resulted in its resolution. We suggest that it is a reasonable approach associated with minimal morbidity in what is otherwise a challenging clinical condition.

### Therapeutic effectiveness of diagnostic lymphangiography for refractory postoperative chylothorax and chylous ascites: correlation with radiologic findings and preceding medical treatment [^c28d26c4]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the therapeutic effect of lymphangiography for refractory postoperative chylothorax and chylous ascites and analyze the relation between the clinical outcomes and radiologic findings or response to the preceding medical treatment.

Materials and Methods

Between January 2004 and June 2012, 14 patients underwent lymphangiography. All patients had been unresponsive to at least two medical treatments for 3-62 days (median, 13.5 days) before lymphangiography. Leaks were classified as major, minor, and undetectable on the basis of radiologic findings including CT and conventional radiography after lymphangiography. The clinical outcomes were correlated with the radiologic findings or the changes of the daily chylous output after the preceding medical treatments.

Results

The leaks were healed in nine of 14 patients (64.3%) by 3-29 days (median, 8 days) after lymphangiography. Healing was achieved for two of seven major leaks, and all of the minor leaks (n=4) and undetectable leaks (n=3) after lymphangiography. The remaining five major leaks were not healed after a median follow-up of 15 days. The daily output decreased more than half after medical treatment in seven of the 14 patients, and the leak was healed in six of these patients (85.7%) by 5-18 days (median, 10 days).

Conclusion

Lymphangiography might be useful for the treatment of refractory postoperative chylothorax and chylous ascites.

### Chyle leak following radical En bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^2a78faa2]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chyle leak after transthoracic esophagectomy has a reported incidence of 1–9%.This complication has been associated with a higher rate of morbidity and mortality among patients who underwent surgery, ranging between 0 and 50%.The reasons for this are explained by the continuous loss of chylous fluid, which is naturally rich in fats, fat-soluble vitamins, enzymes and lymphocytes, leading to a decrease in serum levels of albumin and a significant reduction in peripheral lymphocytes that can result in malnutrition and immunosuppression. Moreover, this fluid loss may lead to hypovolemia and subsequent respiratory failure.

Postoperative chyle leaks result mainly from damage to, or a failure to ligate, the main thoracic duct or its tributaries during both the abdominal and thoracic phase of esophagectomy. The duct is closely related to the esophagus, but because the anatomy is highly variable, its susceptibility to be damaged is easily explained, especially when extensive nodal dissection is undertaken. In addition, chyle leak could result from damage to the cisterna chyli, during nodal dissection around the celiac trunk. In this case, the presentation may be either as chylous ascites or as chylothorax, as chyle spreads into the chest through a widened hiatus promoted by the negative pressure in the thorax.

The most common presentation of chylothorax is excessive drainage via the chest tubes in the early postoperative period, with the classic cream-colored effluent seen only when the patient starts to be fed enterally or orally. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a triglyceride level of > 110 mg/dL or the presence of chylomicrons in the effluent. The optimal treatment for the chylothorax is still controversial, however both surgical and conservative management has been advocated.–The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, management, and outcomes of chyle leaks within a dedicated esophagogastric cancer center.

### Clinical characteristics, evaluation and outcomes of chylopericardium: a systematic review [^04f77137]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

A comprehensive search was performed on 2 December 2020 for published articles on chylous pericardial effusion in the following databases: Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, CINAHL from EBSCOhost, Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science’s BIOSIS Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science. The search was updated on 27 May 2021.

Indexing terms and keywords for both chyle and pericardial effusion or chylopericardium were combined without any language filters. All publication types were considered, and all databases were searched for the concepts. We reviewed identified articles for our selection strategy. Although our inclusion criteria included case reports, we also searched for potential observational studies, clinical trials and registry reports seeking information on CPE. Letters to the editors, animal/paediatric studies and publications in languages other than English were excluded.

We designed our systematic review based on the PICO (patient, intervention, control and outcome) framework. Adult patients (≥18 years) with CPE constituted our study population, medical±surgical therapy composed our intervention, and mortality during index hospitalisation, recurrence of CPE, reinterventions (pericardiocentesis, pericardial window or pericardiectomy), rehospitalisation and mortality after discharge were considered as outcomes. Due to paucity of observational studies, we did not include any comparison group for our analysis. Patient and public involvement is not applicable in this study.

Two independent researchers (AK and AA) screened articles according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.Another reviewer (BV) assisted in the resolution of any conflict during the selection process. Our study used the online tool Covidence to collect, screen and store the selected articles. Indepth information was manually collected from online text manuscripts, tables and figures of the selected articles. Abstracts, review articles, letter to the editors, publications in language other than English, animal studies and studies exclusive to paediatric populations were excluded.

Qualitative data analysis approach involved content analysis to report patterns and frequencies. Extracted data were compiled/pooled for statistical analysis and reporting of the results. Results were presented as clinical characteristics, diagnostic approach, management strategy and outcomes. Categorical variables were represented as proportions (%) and continuous variables as mean (SD). Due to lack of study-level data on this topic, the techniques of meta-analysis for meta-proportion or meta-binary calculations of effect sizes and test of heterogeneity were not feasible.

### Association between preoperative anemia and postoperative short-term outcomes in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery-a propensity score matched retrospective cohort study [^074a31f9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study outcomes and variables definition

The primary outcome was the incidence of major morbidity, which was defined as the presence of at least one of the following conditions: surgical site infection (superficial/deep incisional, organ, or space), anastomotic bleeding, anastomotic leakage, chylous ascites, bloodstream infection (sepsis/bacteremia), myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke/transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of surgical site infection, anastomotic bleeding, anastomotic leakage, chylous ascites, pneumonia, and postoperative length of stay). Observational measures were not included in the statistical analysis, including postoperative death, unplanned secondary surgery, and components with a lower incidence of major morbidity. All postoperative complications were observed during hospitalization.

We investigated the patients’ baseline characteristics and perioperative management. The CRC surgeries included left colectomy, right colectomy, subtotal colectomy, total colectomy, transverse colectomy, low anterior resection, and abdominoperineal resection. ≤ ≤ Hemoglobin (Hb) levels below 120 g L − 1 in women and 130 g L − 1 in men were identified as indicators of anemia. Anemia was further categorized into three levels for both genders: mild (Hb ≥ 90 g L − 1), moderate (60 g L − 1 ≤ Hb < 90 g L − 1), and severe (Hb < 60 g L − 1). We ascertained patients’ hemoglobin levels within a 7-day timeframe, specifically in close proximity to the commencement of surgery, as part of our preoperative assessment. Cardiovascular comorbidities included hypertension, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, defibrillator implantation, prior valve repair, pacemaker implantation, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, and prior coronary artery bypass grafting. Pulmonary comorbidities included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, and emphysema. Perioperative blood transfusions include preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative blood transfusions. In perioperative blood management, surgeons and anesthesiologists follow a restrictive transfusion strategy at our institution.

Sample size calculation

The incidence of major morbidity in the matched non-anemia group was 24.0%. A total of 1218 cases with an incidence of 24% in the composite outcome provided 85% power to detect an odds ratio [OR] of 1.5 or higher in anemic patients and non-anemic patients. During the establishment of a logistic regression model, we followed the at least “ten events per variable” rule to ensure sufficient accuracy of regression.

### Japanese clinical practice guidelines for vascular anomalies 2017 [^cbd8abe2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

There was no large clinical study in the past published work. Therefore, although the level of evidence is low, we consider that surgical treatment is recommendable for chylous ascites that does not respond to conservative or drug treatments, because it has been performed in case series and case reports for chylous ascites that did not respond to conservative or drug treatments for over approximately 1 month. Although techniques to enhance the response rate of surgical treatment, such as identifying the leakage site by using a lipophilic dye and applying fibrin glue or a patch of oxidized cellulose/resorbable local hemostatic agent, have been attempted, there are only case series and case reports, and none of the papers retrieved by the present published work search evaluated their usefulness.

Limitations : There was no published work that defined refractory chylous ascites based on the duration of illness or treatment responses. Therefore, we extracted and summarized factors that were considered to contribute to clinical refractoriness, such as the duration of illness and treatment responses, in each paper related to the treatment for chylous ascites. Also, as the cause of chylous ascites varies widely, the therapeutic effect is expected to differ depending on the cause, but no paper that was reviewed evaluated treatments according to the cause. Therefore, in the present evaluation, the statements are limited to treatments and their effects regardless of the cause.

### Successful management of congenital chyloperitoneum with fibrin glue [^5bcb2946]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Chylous ascites in children has been treated in a variety of ways, including a low-fat diet, medium chain triglycerides, diuretics, total parental nutrition, surgical exploration, and internal peritoneo-venous shunting. The authors describe a child with persistent congenital chyloperitoneum treated successfully with the application of fibrin glue and recommend this as an effective alternative to traditional approaches.

### Fibrin glue application in the management of refractory chylous ascites in children [^4f9fb7a1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this retrospective review of the charts of 6 children who underwent surgical treatment of chylous ascites refractory to conservative measures between 1993 and 2006 was to evaluate the efficiency of fibrin glue application for control of lymph leakage. Five children had postoperative chylous ascites (neuroblastoma, 4; cystic lymphangioma, 1) and 1 had a congenital malformation. Surgical exploration revealed large areas of diffuse lymphatic leakage in all of the patients. Lymphatic fistula was not identified intraoperatively in any patient. Ingestion of lipophilic dye in a concentrated fatty meal was not helpful in locating a lymph fistula. Absorbable mesh was used in association with glue application in the last 3 patients treated. Control of ascites was achieved immediately in 2 patients and within 3 weeks in 2 patients. Repeat surgery was required in the remaining 2 patients. The mean follow-up time was 4.3 years. One patient died of tumor recurrence 12 months after surgical treatment without relapse of the ascites. Two mild late recurrences were observed at 6 and 11 months after surgery and were managed conservatively. The findings of this study show that fibrin glue application on absorbable mesh after dissection of the leakage zones is easy, safe, and effective. We recommend that surgery with glue application be repeated until control of ascites is achieved. We suggest fibrin glue application as a preventive measure against postoperative chylous ascites.

### Chylous ascites in the setting of internal hernia: a reassuring sign [^9eee9580]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chylous ascites is often reported in cases with lymphatic obstruction or after lymphatic injuries such as intraabdominal malignancies or lymphadenectomies. However, chylous ascites is also frequently encountered in operations for internal hernias. We sought to characterize the frequency and conditions when chylous ascites is encountered in general surgery patients.

Methods

Data from patients who underwent operations for CPT codes related to open and laparoscopic abdominal and gastrointestinal surgery in our tertiary hospital from 2010 to 2019 were reviewed. Patients with the postoperative diagnosis of internal hernia were identified and categorized into three groups: Internal Hernia with chylous ascites, non-chylous ascites, and no ascites. Demographics, prior surgical history, CT findings, source of internal hernia, open or laparoscopic surgery, and preoperative labs were recorded and compared.

Results

Fifty-six patients were found to have internal hernias and were included in our study. 80.3% were female and 86% had a previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure (RYGBP). Laparoscopy was the main approach for all groups. Ascites was present in 46% of the cases. Specifically, chylous ascites was observed in 27% of the total operations and was exclusively (100%) found in patients with gastric-bypass history. Furthermore, it was more commonly associated with Petersen's defect (p<0.001), while the non-chylous fluid group was associated with herniation through the mesenteric defect (p<0.001).

Conclusions

Chylous ascites is a common finding during internal hernia operations. Unlike other more morbid conditions, identification of chylous ascites during an internal hernia operation appears innocuous. However, in the context of a patient with a history of RYGBP, the presence of chylous fluid signifies the associated small bowel obstruction is likely related to an internal hernia through a patent Petersen's defect.

### Japanese clinical practice guidelines for vascular anomalies 2017 [^2219105c]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

It was difficult to comprehensively discuss treatments, because its cause varied widely, and treatments for various causes were performed. Therefore, treatments were classified into conservative treatments (fasting, high‐calorie infusion, MCT), drug treatments (octreotide), sclerotherapy, abdominal drainage, abdominal puncture and surgical treatment, and the effects of each treatment were evaluated.

Treatments effective for refractory chylous ascites can be summarized as follows with the understanding that they may depend on the cause and that the level of evidence of the available reports concerning treatments and their effects is low. Conservative treatments, such as fasting, high‐calorie infusion and MCT, should be performed first because of the rareness of adverse effects. In patients who respond insufficiently to conservative treatments, drug treatments using octreotide can be considered as there have been case series and many case reports. Concerning sclerotherapy, the number of reported cases is small, and further large clinical studies will be needed to confirm its usefulness. Abdominal paracentesis and surgical treatments may be considered for chylous ascites that does not response to conservative or drug treatments for approximately 1 month.

Thus, the draft recommendation is “Conservative treatments, such as fasting, high‐calorie infusion and MCT, should be performed first, and, if they are ineffective, drug treatments, sclerotherapy and surgical treatments may be considered”. However, evaluation of this CQ by a design with a higher level of evidence, such as RCT, is considered necessary for the future.

### Clinical approach and review of causes of a chylothorax [^2cdb692e]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

A chylothorax, also known as chylous pleural effusion, is an uncommon cause of pleural effusion with a wide differential diagnosis characterized by the accumulation of bacteriostatic chyle in the pleural space. The pleural fluid will have either or both triglycerides >110 mg/dL and the presence of chylomicrons. It may be encountered following a surgical intervention, usually in the chest, or underlying disease process. Management of a chylothorax requires a multidisciplinary approach employing medical therapy and possibly surgical intervention for post-operative patients and patients who have failed medical therapy. In this review, we aim to discuss the anatomy, fluid characteristics, etiology, and approach to the diagnosis of a chylothorax.

### Treatment of chylous ascites with peritoneovenous shunt (Denver shunt) following retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with urological malignancies: update of efficacy and predictors of complications [^701a1191]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We investigated the efficacy and analyzed the complication risk factors of peritoneovenous shunt in treating refractory chylous ascites following retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with urological malignancies.

Materials and Methods

From April 2001 to March 2019 all patients with refractory chylous ascites after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection treated with peritoneovenous shunt were reviewed. Demographic characteristics, technical success, efficacy, patency period and complications were studied. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of complications.

Results

Twenty patients were included in this study. Testicular cancer was the most common malignancy (85%). The mean number of days from surgery to detection of chylous ascites was 21 days (SD 15, range 4 to 65). Ascites permanently resolved after peritoneovenous shunt in 18 patients (90%), leading to shunt removal in 17 patients (85%) between 46 and 481 days (mean 162, SD 141). The mean serum albumin level increased 24% after shunt placement (mean 3.0±0.6 gm/dl before, 3.9±0.8 gm/dl after, p <0.05). The most common complication was occlusion (30%). Relative risk of complications increased significantly when shunt placement was more than 70 days after surgery and in patients with more than 5 paracenteses before peritoneovenous shunt placement (AR 0.71% vs 0.25%, RR 2.9, p <0.048 and AR 0.6% vs 0.125%, RR 4.8, p <0.04, respectively).

Conclusions

Peritoneovenous shunt permanently treated chylous ascites in 90% of patients after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Peritoneovenous shunt was removed in 85% of patients. Shunt placement is an effective and safe treatment option for refractory chylous ascites. These patients might benefit from earlier intervention, after 4 to 6 weeks of conservative management as opposed to 2 to 3 months.

### Minimally invasive percutaneous lymphangiography and embolisation for spontaneous chyle leaks in patients with lymphoma [^ae3bfa84]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the present, this targeted approach not only supported the continuation of appropriate anti‐lymphoma therapy but also reduced the need for repeated invasive interventions, such as thoracentesis or paracentesis, thereby improving patients' quality of life, as previously shown.

We acknowledge several limitations of our study, including its retrospective nature with a small sample size and absence of a control group receiving conservative management only. As a tertiary cancer centre, our data reflect only patients referred for interventional management after failure of conservative therapy. We therefore cannot capture the broader denominator of all patients with chylous effusions, including those successfully managed without intervention.

In conclusion, the combination of these novel minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic techniques may revolutionise the management of chylous ascites, chylothorax and lymphatic anomalies, offering new possibilities for treating lymphatic disorders.Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.

### Multidisciplinary management of chylothorax [^96f38013]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Chylothorax, the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, is usually caused by the disruption of the thoracic duct or its tributaries. Etiologies are broadly divided into traumatic, including postsurgical, and nontraumatic, most commonly in the setting of malignancy. The management of chylothorax largely depends on the cause and includes dietary modification and drainage of the pleural space. A definitive intervention, whether surgical or a percutaneous lymphatic intervention, should be considered in patients with a persistently high volume of chylous output and in those with a prolonged leak, before complications such as malnutrition ensue. No methodologically robust clinical trials guiding management are currently available. In this article, we review the current literature and propose a stepwise, evidence-based multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with both traumatic and nontraumatic chylothorax.

### Successful surgical treatment of intractable chylous ascites using the lymphatic cable flap: a retrospective review study [^d2efc7ea]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

For evaluation of a novel surgical procedure for the treatment of chylous ascites. Chylous ascites is a debilitating condition associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. At least one-third of patients are refractory to medical therapy and may warrant further treatment. Traditional methods involving ligation of lymphatic fistulas or small bowel resection do not address the basic pathophysiologic mechanism of the underlying obstruction, and identification of chyloperitoneal fistulas may be challenging.

Methods

A novel flap based on deep inferior epigastric vessels with its surrounding lymphatic fatty tissue was designed in this study and transferred into abdominal cavity, with anastomosis to the fourth jejunal vessels. Three consecutive cases with chylous ascites treated by this vascularized lymphatic cable transfer were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

All three patients recovered from chylous ascites after the lymphatic cable transfer and tolerated regular diet well, with follow-up of 3 years at least.

Conclusions

Lymphatic cable flap based on the deep inferior epigastric vessels could be a potential option for treatment of intractable chylous ascites, with safe and successful long-term outcomes in three consecutive patients. The proposed functional mechanism of the flap is bypass of the obstructed intra-abdominal lymphatics to an extraperitoneal route as well as local lymphangiogenesis.

### An elemental diet reduces chylous ascites of patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy in the setting of early enteral feeding [^97ed815d]. Pancreas (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The elemental diet (ED) is a formula to support nutritional status without increasing chylous burden. This study evaluates the efficacy of early ED feeding after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD).

Materials and Methods

A prospective phase II study of consecutive patients who underwent PD with early ED feeding was conducted. Patient backgrounds, surgical outcomes, and ED feeding tolerability were compared with a historical cohort of 74 PD patients with early enteral feeding of a low residue diet (LRD).

Results

The ED group comprised 104 patients. No patient in the ED group discontinued enteral feeding because of chylous ascites (CAs), whereas 17.6% of the LRD group experienced refractory CAs that disrupted further enteral feeding. The CAs rate was significantly decreased in the ED group compared with the LRD group (3.9% and 48.7%, respectively; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of major complications (ED: 17.3%, LRD: 18.9%; P = 0.844). Postoperative prognostic nutritional index was similar between the 2 groups ( P = 0.764). In multivariate analysis, enteral feeding formula, and sex were independent risk factors for CAs (LRD: P < 0.001, odds ratio, 22.87; female: P = 0.019, odds ratio, 2.78).

Conclusions

An ED reduces postoperative CAs of patients undergoing PD in the setting of early enteral feeding.

### Chylous ascites as a complication of laparoscopic nephrectomy [^617abc16]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chylous ascites is a rare complication after major retroperitoneal surgery. Recently chylous ascites has developed more often after laparoscopic nephrectomy since that is increasingly done for various indications at many centers. We reviewed our cases of chylous ascites after laparoscopic nephrectomy.

Materials and Methods

Between January 2002 and December 2008 we performed 622 transperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomies. We retrospectively analyzed factors related to chylous ascites as a complication of laparoscopic nephrectomy.

Results

The overall incidence of chylous ascites was 5.1% (32 of 622 cases), including 4 severe refractory cases (0.6%). The difference in incidence by operation type was not statistically different (p = 0.251). Chylous ascites developed more often after left than right nephrectomy (7.3% or 25 of 343 cases vs 2.5% or 7 of 279, p = 0.010). In patients with radical nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy the incidence was higher in those who did vs did not undergo lymphadenectomy (13.9% or 10 of 72 vs 4.0% or 11 of 275, p = 0.027). Only 1 patient underwent explorative laparotomy due to persistent severe chylous ascites despite 8-week conservative management. The other cases were successfully managed conservatively by total parenteral nutrition and a low fat diet.

Conclusions

Chylous ascites is not a rare complication after laparoscopic nephrectomy and most cases can be managed conservatively. To prospectively prevent this complication we recommend meticulous clipping of all perihilar and retroperitoneal fibrous fatty tissue during major vessel dissection, especially for left nephrectomy or extensive lymphadenectomy.

### Lymphatic interventions for isolated, iatrogenic chylous ascites: a multi-institution experience [^55d5735a]. European Journal of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Lymphangiography and thoracic duct embolization are established treatments for post-surgical chylothorax. There is only limited experience in their application to treat post-surgical chylous ascites. A multi-center analysis of the technical and clinical success of lymphangiography and lymphatic interventions in the treatment of isolated, iatrogenic chylous ascites is reported.

Methods

21 patients (14 males; 7 females) aged 3-84 years (mean 56.9 years; median 63 years) were treated for isolated, iatrogenic chylous ascites between August 2012 and January 2018. Initial referrals occurred between 5-330 days (mean 72.7 days; median 40 days) after failing conservative therapy. Daily leak volumes ranged from 100 to 3000mL. Lymphangiographic findings, techniques, clinical outcomes, and complications were recorded.

Results

21 patients underwent 29 procedures. Seven patients underwent multiple procedures after chylous ascites persisted. Bilateral nodal lymphangiography (NL) was technically successful in all (100%) patients. Lymphangiography identified a leak in 14/21 (67%) patients and in 16/29 procedures (55%). Ten procedures (34%) consisted of NL alone and one (3.4%) consisted of NL combined with lymphatic disruption (LD). Six procedures (21%) consisted of nodal glue embolization (NGE) while nine procedures (31%) were catheter-based lymphatic embolization. Three separate patients underwent three procedures (10%) consisting of balloon-occluded retrograde abdominal lymphatic embolization. Clinical success, defined as no additional drainage of chylous ascites at 15 days, was ultimately achieved in 18/21 patients (86%). There were no major or minor complications.

Conclusion

Lymphatic interventions can successfully treat post-surgical chylous ascites. Given the low risk of procedural complication, early intervention is encouraged.

### Lymphatic chyle duct injury and identification during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy preventing postoperative chylous ascites [^c50e1f6d]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 25-year-old female patient, presented to our clinic complaining of class III obesity with a BMI of 45 kg/m 2, with no past medical or surgical history. The patient’s pre-operative workup laboratory and ultrasonography were unremarkable. The patient was planned and prepared for LSG.

Unfortunately, due to a technical issue on the day of the operation, we were forced to use an older video system. Intraoperatively, there were no surgical difficulties during dissection encountered up until the dissection of the hiatus. A white structure was noted during the anterior dissection near the hiatus, which was misinterpreted as the white line of the left crus. Dissection over the peritoneal covering of this structure inadvertently showed a chyle leak (Fig. 1). The duct was identified and clipped at the site of leakage (Fig. 2) and stapling of the greater curvature and fundus was completed. After stapling, the duct was dissected caudally (Fig. 3) and ligated using a vascular clip (Fig. 4). An intraoperatively placed drain was left at the surgical bed, for follow-up postoperatively, and the excised stomach was extracted via the left mid-clavicular port, and the wounds were closed.

Postoperatively, the patient showed a good postoperative course, with no signs of fever, tachycardia, tenderness, or fluid spillage from the inserted drain. However, the patient was discharged on the first postoperative day on oral fluids, with the drain left until the first clinic visit 5 days later. The patient did not need any octreotide or any specific medications. The drain was removed on the 5th postoperative day at the clinic, and the patient was well with no mentioned complications. On follow-up after 6 months, the patient showed an uneventful recovery with a remarkable estimated weight loss (EWL%) of 40% of their body weight.

### Percutaneous treatment of chylous ascites [^b50647cb]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Chylous ascites occurs as a result of lymphatic leakage, which contains high concentration of triglycerides. The leakage is caused by various benign or malignant etiologies ranging from congenital lymphatic abnormality to trauma. Lymphangiography has been shown to be effective in the diagnosis of lymphatic leakage and has also been reported to have therapeutic outcome. The development of intranodal technique for lymphangiography has recently made the procedure more widespread. As an adjunctive procedure, percutaneous embolization may be performed which involves use of embolic agents such as N-butyl cyanoacrylate and coil to occlude the leak. Embolization in the lymphatic system was first made popular by the introduction of thoracic duct embolization by Cope et al and has recently led to the development of various techniques for percutaneous embolization. This article reviews the options and techniques for percutaneous treatment of lymphatic leaks in patients presenting with chylous ascites.

### Chylous leakage after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer: a systematic review [^9a2ebe76]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Postesophagectomy chylous leakage is a rare but fatal complication with an incidence rate of 0.4–9% following transthoracic esophagectomy. Daily chylous leakage after surgery can result in dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, malnutrition, and lymphocytopenia, which increase the risk of mortality.

Chylous leakage is defined as the postoperative drainage of a milky fluid rich in triglycerides; however, the threshold volume to define chylous leakage is unclear: some authors accepted 110 mg/dL triglycerides as a threshold, while others preferred 200 mg/dL. The optimal management strategy for chylous leakage remains unclear. In 70% of patients, chylous leakage can be cured through conservative methods such as negative pressure drainage, pressure dressing, somatostatin, and a low-fat diet. For patients with persistently high output or those who are unresponsive to conservative treatment, further treatment options include surgical exploration of the wound, thoracoscopic thoracic catheter ligation, and percutaneous embolization.

Thoracic catheter ligation has been indicated as an effective measure to reduce the incidence of postoperative chylothorax, and can be administered prophylactically. Two other studies reported a lower incidence of chylorrhagia after esophagectomy in patients with high body mass index. According to the 2022 international consensus statement, there is still a lack of standard management and treatment options for these cases. This study used a systematic review to search the literature databases for original studies investigating the occurrence of chylous leakage after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Based on an analysis of these studies, we summarized the various management methods applied before, during, and after surgery, and comprehensively explored the prevention and treatment measures for chylorrhea other a single surgical method or postoperative treatment. To provide a comprehensive and rapid reference for the prevention and treatment of chylous leakage, this study systematically summarized and analyzed existing studies of the occurrence of chylous leakage after esophagectomy.

### Intranodal lymphangiography and embolization for management of iatrogenic chylous ascites after oncological surgery [^0b3c5a4a]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the safety and effectiveness of intranodal lymphangiography (INL) and lymphatic embolization (LE) in management of chylous ascites after oncologic surgery.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective review of records of patients who underwent INL with or without LE from January 2017 to June 2022 was performed. Adult patients with chylous ascites after oncologic surgery referred to interventional radiology after failure of conservative treatment were included. Thirty-nine patients who underwent 55 procedures were included (34 males and 5 females). Data on patient demographics, procedural technique, outcomes, and follow-up were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate technical success, clinical success, and adverse events. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate factors predicting clinical success.

Results

INL was technically successful in 54 of 55 procedures (98%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 90%-100%). A lymphatic leak was identified in 40 procedures, and LE was attempted in 36. LE was technically successful in 33 of the 36 procedures (92%; 95% CI, 78%-98%). Clinical success, defined as resolution of ascites with no need for peritoneovenous shunt placement or additional surgery, was achieved in 22 of 39 patients (56%; 95% CI, 40%-72%). Clinical success was achieved in 18 patients after 1 procedure, and patients who required repeat procedures were less likely to achieve clinical success (odds ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04-0.66; P = .012). Four grade 1 procedural adverse events were recorded.

Conclusions

INL with or without LE is a safe minimally invasive tool that can help patients with chylous ascites after oncologic surgery who failed conservative treatment avoid more invasive interventions.

### Complications of laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy and their management: the UCLA experience [^a355f8ba]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Because of the shortage of cadaveric kidneys, laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy (LLDN) has become a more common option for transplant recipients. The complication rate has been reported at 6.4% to 16.5%. We present the initial University of California, Los Angeles experience with the complications and their management during LLDN.

Methods

From January 2000 to December 2005, a single surgeon performed 300 consecutive LLDNs at our institution. A committee of urologists, nephrologists, and support staff approved each donor before surgery. After LLDN was completed, the patients received 30 mg of ketorolac intravenously every 6 hours until discharge. We reviewed the intraoperative and postoperative complications and their management at our institution.

Results

Three patients required open conversion, for an overall conversion rate of 1%. Two of the three conversions were a result of a major vascular complication (0.6%). The first major vascular complication resulted from an endovascular stapler malfunction during transection of an accessory left renal artery. The second vascular complication was a Veress needle injury to the left common iliac artery. Three postoperative major complications (1%) occurred, including 1 case of rhabdomyolysis and 2 cases of chylous ascites. Also, 7 minor postoperative complications (2.3%) occurred. Our overall complication rate was 4%. No patients died, and the mean hospital stay was 1.1 days.

Conclusions

Our results have shown that LLDN is a safe procedure associated with low morbidity and a quick recovery. Appropriate patient selection is essential to ensure the safety of this procedure.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation as treatment for refractory chylous ascites and chylothorax in a patient with cirrhosis [^984fc10a]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The etiology of chylothorax is usually considered to consist of four major categories: tumors, trauma, idiopathic conditions, and miscellaneous conditions. It appears that chylothorax is a rare and underreported manifestation of cirrhosis resulting from transdiaphragmatic passage of chylous ascites. This condition can be debilitating as a result of respiratory compromise from a large volume of pleural fluid, as well as metabolic derangements, malnutrition, and immunologic impairment from loss of vital lymphatic constituents. Herein the authors present a case of a 46-year-old male patient with cirrhosis and complications of high-volume chylous ascites and chylothorax who was successfully treated with creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.

### Clinical characteristics and risk factors for acute abdomen in patients with abdominal lymphatic malformations [^49ed645c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

The management options for ALMs are diverse, among which surgical resection historically remains the standard of management. Surgical resection will inevitably involve the necessity of resection of intestinal segments, especially MLMs. We suggest that complete lesion resection and segmental intestinal resection are necessary to avoid recurrence of MLMs with chylous fluid, because the presence of chylous fluid likely implies the involvement of the bowel wall. In addition, Maruani et alsuggested that common LMs seem to be the best indication for sirolimus therapy, which can decrease the volume of lesions, bleeding, and oozing effectively, even increase patient quality of life. Similarly, we found that patients withs common LMs and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, have an objective response to sirolimus, with a ≥20% decrease in lesion volume before and after treatment in >80% of patients.However, patients may potentially suffer from the side effects of oral sirolimus. For patients with extensive lesions that cannot be removed completely, mammalian target or rapamycin inhibitors, such as sirolimus or everolimus, could be important options on decreasing lesion size and controlling lesion progression.,

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^fe731bc3]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

### Japanese clinical practice guidelines for vascular anomalies 2017 [^3fb6b50a]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

In drug therapy for chylous ascites, primarily octreotide (a long‐acting somatostatin analog) was used, and no report that discussed the effectiveness of other drug therapies was found by the present published work search.

In the multicenter case series by Bellini et al. 327 octreotide was administrated to six of the 16 patients with chylous ascites for 8–38 days, and a decrease in chylous ascites was reported in all of them. In the single‐center case series by Huang et al. 344 two of the four patients with chylous ascites treated by high‐calorie infusion and octreotide administration were reported to have shown a decrease in ascites within 10 days. However, there has been a report 330 that no effect was observed despite the administration of octreotide for 3 weeks. Concerning the dose of octreotide, it was administrated at 1 μg/kg per h, 327 at 3 μg/kg per h, 332 began to be administrated at 0.5 μg/kg per h and increased to 10 μg/kg per h by 1 μg/kg per h, 329 administrated by continuous i.v. infusion at 0.5–2.0 μg/kg per h, 333 and began to be administrated by s.c. injection at 2.5 μg/kg two times a day and increased every 2 days to 8 μg/kg two times a day. 330 Regarding the time of the beginning of administration, the administration was started as no improvement was observed in chylous ascites after conservative treatments for 2 weeks, 330, 334 and as chylous ascites was alleviated by conservative treatments but was exacerbated again. 333 No adverse effects of octreotide administration were noted in the present review of the published work. Thus, no control study that evaluated the effect of octreotide on chylous ascites was found by the present published work search, and the level of evidence concerning the efficacy is low, but as there are case series and many case reports that chylous ascites was reduced by octreotide administration, it appears reasonable to consider drug treatment using octreotide for chylous ascites that does not respond to conservative treatments.

### Cirrhosis related chylous ascites successfully treated with TIPS [^9aee6815]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

We describe a patient with chylous ascites, who was extensively investigated for the cause. No malignant or lymphatic disease could be found, but a liver biopsy revealed liver cirrhosis. The chylous ascites was unsuccessfully treated with a sodium restriction diet, diuretics and a medium chain triglyceride diet. After the placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt the ascites disappeared.

### Incidental chylous fluid during hernia repair may be a harbinger of malrotation [^128991af]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

A previously asymptomatic 12-week-old male infant was found to have chylous ascites within his peritoneal hernia sacs during elective open bilateral inguinal hernia repair. Both repairs were completed, and an immediate postoperative upper gastrointestinal contrast study confirmed the presence of malrotation with associated volvulus. The patient underwent a Ladd's procedure and appendectomy. The postoperative course was uneventful. The finding of chylous ascites during hernia repair mandates investigation for possible malrotation.

### Chyle leak following radical En bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^2b9c0694]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

A further option to treat chylothorax is the use of pleuro-peritoneal shunts, which have been demonstrated to be able to provide internal drainage of chylothorax. Chyle can be reabsorbed by the peritoneum preventing the nutritional, fluid, and immunological losses associated with external drainage.In this series, this has been employed in a small number of patients. Shunts can be a successful option, either as a first-line treatment or in cases resistant to surgical management. However, outcomes with shunts were inferior to those for surgery and the authors advocate surgical intervention as the first-line treatment of choice for high-volume leaks.

In recent years, percutaneous thoracic duct embolization has become the standard of care for high-output chylothoraces.In cases of chylous output < 1 L/day, conservative management with dietary restriction is a reasonable initial approach, which could be followed by embolization; however, surgery remains an indication in case of failure or success.Unfortunately, this technique is not available at our institution.

There are a number of limitations to this study. While the data for patients within this study, and whether or not there was a chyle leak, was collected at the time of their inpatient stay, not all patients presumed to have a chyle leak had biochemical testing. This could potentially lead to an overestimation of the incidence.

Furthermore, precise data were not available on the length of time that conservative management was employed before progressing to a surgical intervention. In general, most patients who show no response to conservative management and continue to have a high-output chyle leak will have surgery within 24–48 h. While all patients in the cohort had a feeding jejunostomy placed at the time of the original operation, the use of enteral feeding may have had some degree of variability that contributed towards delayed observation of a chylous output and hence the spread of time seen for surgical intervention. In addition, early employment of an MCT feed may lead to some delay in surgery, as time is needed to see if this strategy has a significant impact. The more challenging decision is in those who have some reduction in chyle output with conservative treatment but still have a relatively high output.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^8eb1f4a1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical interventions for pancreatic ascites involve major procedures that may lead to complications, including infection, anastomotic leaks, fistulae and delayed gastric emptying. These surgeries also carry the risk of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency, particularly in the case of pancreatic resection, which can result in long-term digestive and glycemic control issues. Additionally, the invasiveness of these procedures means that their use is limited to patients who can tolerate major surgery, and they may not be suitable for those with advanced disease or poor general health. Finally, a laparoscopic approach requires a higher level of manual dexterity and technical expertise, limiting its use to high-volume academic centers. The choice of surgical procedure depends on the specific anatomical and pathological findings of each patient. The American Pancreatic Association and the International Association of Pancreatology recommend considering surgical intervention when conservative management fails, emphasizing the importance of individualized treatment plans.

### Chylous ascites following resection of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm (...) [^143bfa31]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The development of chylous ascites after an abdominal surgical procedure is potentially grave. It frequently leads to malnutrition and significant mortality. Chylous ascites developed after emergency repair of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. In spite of treatments with low-fat diet, hyperalimentation, and abdominal paracentesis, hypoproteinemia and peripheral edema developed and symptomatic ascites continued. Though some success has been reported following ligation of leaking lymphatics, we avoided laparotomy because the patient was recovering from formidable complications. A peritoneovenous shunt was placed. No complications occurred and permanent recovery promptly resulted. We believe this is a reasonable alternative to laparotomy. . Sarazin WG, Sauter KE.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for treatment of cirrhosis-related chylothorax and chylous ascites: single-institution retrospective experience [^581e5c38]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the efficacy and safety of the use of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation to treat cirrhosis-related chylous collections (chylothorax and chylous ascites).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed data from four patients treated for refractory cirrhosis-related chylous collections with TIPS at our institution over an 8 year period.

Results

One patient had chylothorax, and three patients had concomitant chylothorax and chylous ascites. There were no major complications, and the only procedure-related complications occurred in two patients who had mild, treatable hepatic encephalopathy. All patients had improvement as defined by decreased need for thoracentesis or paracentesis, with postprocedure follow-up ranging from 19 to 491 days.

Conclusion

TIPS is a safe procedure that is effective in the treatment of cirrhosis-related chylous collections.

Sclerotherapy was performed in six patients in five case reports. 339, 347, 349, 351, 352 The sclerosing agent was OK‐432 in five of the six patients and was Beta‐isodona® (Mundipharma GmbH, Cambridge, UK) solution in one. 349 OK‐432 was locally injected into the lesion in four, 347, 351, 352 administrated i.p. in one 352 and administrated through the drain in two. 347, 352 Concerning sclerotherapy, the number of reported cases that were reviewed was limited, and further accumulation of cases is considered necessary to establish its usefulness.
Abdominal drainage, abdominal puncture and surgical treatment

Abdominal drainage and abdominal puncture are performed when organ compression symptoms (compartment syndrome and respiratory insufficiency) due to abdominal distention are present or possible, or when the drain is inserted postoperatively. However, drainage itself cannot improve chylous ascites, and treatments, such as infusion, blood preparations and blood transfusion, are necessary to supplement the ascites lost due to drainage. 327, 330, 331, 332, 333, 337, 338, 339, 340, 343, 345, 346, 347, 349, 351, 352

Surgical treatment is reported to be frequently performed after conservative or drug treatments. According to the single‐center case series by Zeidan et al. 343 surgical treatment was performed in patients who responded poorly to conservative treatments for over a mean of 25.3 days. In other reports, surgical treatment was performed after conservative treatments for 1–3 months 328, 329 and in patients with congenital chylous ascites 1–4 months after birth. 330, 334, 350 Because it is often impossible to identify the leakage site of chylous ascites, 330 there have been attempts to identify the leakage site by p.o. administration of a lipophilic dye (Sudan black, Sudan III) before operation. 328, 329, 336, 343 When the leakage site can be identified, ligation, suturing, clipping and cauterization have been performed. 328, 334, 336, 343, 350 In addition to reports of the usefulness of techniques to stop leakage, such as applying or sprinkling fibrin glue at the leakage site of chylous ascites or over the surrounding retroperitoneum, 329, 331, 343, 350 and applying a patch of oxidized cellulose/resorbable local hemostatic agent, 331, 343 there have also been reports of peritoneovenous shunting 349, 353 and peritoneoamniotic shunting for fetal cases. 338

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for the treatment of chylothorax and chylous ascites in cirrhosis: a case report and systematic review of the literature [^37f18367]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis-related chylothorax and chylous ascites are rare conditions. The pathophysiologic mechanism of cirrhosis-related chylous fluid collections is believed to be excessive lymph flow resulting from portal hypertension. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation is a well-established method for reducing portal hypertension. The case of a 61-year-old man with cirrhosis-related chylothorax treated successfully with a TIPS is described. A systematic review of the literature revealed nine additional cases of chylothorax or chylous ascites treated successfully with a TIPS. These cases showed that TIPS creation may be effective and safe for the treatment of chylous fluid collections in patients with cirrhosis.

### Thoracic duct embolization for the management of chylothoraces [^1872f63d]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to inform the reader on the recent advancements in the minimally invasive treatment of chylothorax.

Recent Findings

Intranodal lymphangiography has been demonstrated to be a superior alternative to traditional pedal lymphangiography for thoracic duct embolization (TDE). TDE is associated with less morbidity and better clinical success than conservative management or surgical intervention in both traumatic and nontraumatic causes of chylothorax. TDE embolization in the pediatric population was found to be feasible.

Summary

Recent advances in the lymphangiography techniques and the accumulation of experience in treating chylous effusions have significantly broadened the adoption of TDE to treat chylothorax. TDE for traumatic chylothorax has been demonstrated to be less morbid and more effective than surgical and conservative treatment. In cases of nontraumatic chylothorax, the patient has to be evaluated by MRI and lymphangiography to exclude causes of chylothorax which cannot be managed by interruption of the thoracic duct (e.g. lymphatic malformations or chylous ascites). Future advancements in noninvasive imaging of the thoracic duct and imaging guidance during TDE will continue to refine the percutaneous management of chylous effusions.

### Chyloperitoneum after laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) [^d4551bff]. Obesity Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

A true chylous effusion is defined as the presence of ascitic fluid with high fat (triglyceride) content, usually higher than 110 mg/dl. We report a case of chyloperitoneum following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in a 40-year-old patient who was admitted for surgery on May 31, 2007. On August 2008 an abdominal CT with contrast was ordered for chronic abdominal pain showing diffuse ascites as well as mesenteric adenitis. On September 2008, the patient was admitted to the hospital. An elective diagnostic laparoscopy was scheduled. A large amount of chylous fluid was found. Microscopic analysis came back negative. The patient made an uneventful recovery after surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of chylous ascites following LRYGB. Chyloperitoneum should be considered as a possible cause of ascites in patients with chronic small bowel obstruction following a LRYGB.

### Use of orlistat (xenical) to treat chylous ascites [^eee7e9a3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Chylous ascites is uncommon and occurs in about 1 in 20,000 hospital admissions. Causes include disruption of the lymphatic system due to malignancy, cirrhosis, surgery, or radiation therapy. The mainstay of therapy has been low-fat diet supplemented with medium-chain triglyceride oil. However, dietary compliance can be difficult to achieve for adequate response. We report a 47-year-old man with hepatitis C and alcohol-related cirrhosis with new-onset chylous ascites and chylothorax. His ascites triglyceride was 585 mg/dL, and the pleural fluid triglyceride was 691 mg/dL. Ascitic and pleural fluid cytology and acid-fast bacilli stain were negative. The patient was treated with low-fat diet and medium-chain triglyceride oil. However, his ascites remained chylous after 1 week of treatment because of poor compliance with the dietary restrictions. Orlistat was then added to his treatment regimen. A half week later, the chylous component of his ascites resolved. Remaining high-volume clear ascites was treated with placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. To our knowledge, orlistat has never been used in the treatment of chylous ascites. This case suggests the potential value of adding orlistat to low-fat diet and medium-chain triglyceride oil in the treatment of chylous ascites, especially in patients who are unable to comply with the dietary restrictions.

Consecutive patients receiving CME and D3 lymphadenectomy for right-sided colon cancer were included. Risk factors of the occurrence and severity of chylous ascites by using logistic analysis were assessed. A nomogram predicting chylous ascites was constructed.

Results

Among 661 patients included in the study, postoperative chylous ascites occurred in 48 (7.3%) patients. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that prognostic nutritional index (PNI ≤ 47, OR = 2.172, p = 0.016), laparoscopic surgery (OR = 2.798, p = 0.034), operating time (>225 min, OR = 2.645, p = 0.002), and apical lymph node (APN) metastasis (OR = 3.698, p = 0.034) were correlated with the occurrence of postoperative chylous ascites. A nomogram predicting postoperative chylous ascites was constructed (C-index 0.701). 31.2% (15/48) of patients with chylous ascites were resolved in more than 7 days. The number of retrieved lymph nodes (OR = 1.074, 95% CI: 1.002-1.152, p = 0.044) and PNI ≤ 47 (OR = 7.890, 95% CI: 1.224-50.869, p = 0.030) were independently predictive of prolonged chylous ascites resolution (≥7 days).

Conclusions

In our series, 7.3% of patients developed chylous ascites after right hemicolectomy with CME and D3 lymphadenectomy. Laparoscopic surgery, PNI, operation time, and APN metastasis were independently predictive of postoperative chylous ascites. Lower PNI and more retrieved lymph nodes were correlated with prolonged resolution of chylous ascites.

### Minimally invasive percutaneous lymphangiography and embolisation for spontaneous chyle leaks in patients with lymphoma [^3e53d6af]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chylous effusions are a rare but severe complication in lymphoma patients, with morbidity and treatment interruption. Traditional treatment options, including dietary modification, total parenteral nutrition and surgery, have limited utility and do not adequately address the underlying lymphatic pathology. Minimally invasive lymphangiography (IL) and embolisation have offered alternatives with precise visualisation and effective treatment of lymphatic leaks. Our experience indicates that percutaneous lymphatic interventions can treat chylous effusions successfully, prevent alterations in cancer therapy and improve outcomes and thus have the potential to contribute to the multimodal treatment of lymphoma‐related lymphatic disorders.

Haematological malignancies, including lymphoma, have long been recognised as a primary cause of non‐traumatic chylous leaks.Chylous effusions, while uncommon, present a significant challenge in the management of lymphoma due to their effect on patients' nutritional and immunological status and quality of life. In addition, new onset chylous effusions may raise false concern for inadequate response to therapy or disease recurrence/progression, leading to treatment interruptions or unnecessary modifications.

The typical management of chylous effusions includes conservative measures, such as non‐fat or chylous diet, total parenteral nutrition, octreotide and in some cases, invasive surgical interventions.Notably, lymphatic imaging with intranodal IL, using ultrasound‐ and fluoroscopic‐guided injections of oil‐based iodinated contrast, offers a minimally invasive technique that allows the detailed visualisation of the central lymphatic system for diagnosis and treatment planning.In this regard, targeted lymphatic embolisation and thoracic duct embolisation (TDE) have also emerged as a potential novel treatments for chylous leaks, replacing more invasive surgical ligation.Reports remain limited, emphasising the need for integration of these minimally invasive interventions into haematology practice.

Here, we present four cases of lymphoma patients with chylous ascites or chylothorax successfully diagnosed and managed with minimally invasive IL and/or embolisation. These four cases are part of a larger institutional cohort of patients who underwent IL for chylous ascites between May 2017 and July 2024; all referred for intervention after failure of conservative or systemic management.

### ASO author reflections: chyle leak: No long-term impact on survival [^13cf40ef]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Present

The present study indicates that surgical outcomes of patients developing chyle leak were similar to those who had an uneventful surgery, except for the length of critical care stay which was longer for those developing a chyle leak.More importantly, a chyle leak was not associated with any detrimental long-term effect. In particular, there was no significant difference in overall survival regardless of tumour histology between patients who developed a leak and those who did not. Conservative treatment, with the implementation of MCT feed, may address many leaks that are encountered. However, high-volume leaks are likely to require surgical intervention, which should not be feared, because it is safe and effective.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^0d496d83]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

Treatment protocols for the management of pancreatic ascites are still being investigated, in view of its rarity. However, prompt diagnosis and early intervention are crucial in order to achieve better patient outcomes. Based on this extensive literature review, we deduced that pancreatic endotherapy is the safest and most effective intervention for pancreatic ascites. This was demonstrated through a series of cohort studies and a targeted review of published cases. Therefore, we propose that this modality should be considered as initial therapy for pancreatic ascites. Conservative approaches entailing nutritional therapy, the use of octreotide, diuretics and therapeutic paracentesis, have high failure and mortality rates. Surgical interventions, on the other hand, carry significant perioperative morbidity and mortality and should be reserved for refractory cases only.

### Interventional solutions for post-surgical problems: a lymphatic leaks review [^a48d1ee9]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

The lymphatic circulation plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid balance and supporting immune responses by returning serum proteins and lipids to the systemic circulation. Lymphatic leaks, though rare, pose significant challenges post-radical neck surgery, oesophagectomy, and thoracic or retroperitoneal oncological resections, leading to heightened morbidity and mortality. Managing lymphatic leaks necessitates consideration of aetiology, severity, and volume of leakage.

Traditionally, treatment involved conservative measures such as dietary restrictions, drainage, and medical management, with surgical intervention reserved for severe cases, albeit with variable outcomes and extended recovery periods. Lymphography, introduced in the 1950s, initially served as a diagnostic tool for lymphoedema, lymphoma, tumour staging, and monitoring chemotherapy response. However, its widespread adoption was impeded by alternative techniques like Computed Tomography, learning curves, and its associated complications. Contemporary lymphatic interventions have evolved, favouring nodal lymphangiography over pedal lymphangiography for its technical simplicity and reduced complexity.

Effective management of chylous leaks mandates a multimodal approach encompassing clinical evaluation and imaging techniques. In cases where conservative management proves ineffective, embolization through conventional lymphangiography by bipedal dissection or intranodal injection emerges as a viable option. This review underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and treating lymphatic leaks, highlighting advancements in imaging and therapeutic interventions that enhance patient outcomes.

### Brief report: chylothorax and chylous ascites during RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy [^152b831d]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous chylous effusions are rare; however, they have been observed by independent investigators in patients treated with RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

Methods

This multicenter, retrospective study evaluated the frequency of chylous effusions in patients treated with RET TKIs. Clinicopathologic features and management of patients with chylous effusions were evaluated.

Results

A pan-cancer cohort of 7517 patients treated with one or more multikinase inhibitor or selective RET TKI and a selective TKI cohort of 96 patients treated with selpercatinib or pralsetinib were analyzed. Chylous effusions were most common with selpercatinib (7%), followed by agerafenib (4%), cabozantinib (0.3%), and lenvatinib (0.02%); none were observed with pralsetinib. Overall, 12 patients had chylothorax, five had chylous ascites, and five had both. Time from TKI initiation to diagnosis ranged from 0.5 to 50 months. Median fluid triglyceride level was lower in chylothoraces than in chylous ascites (397 mg/dL [interquartile range: 304-4000] versus 3786 mg/dL [interquartile range: 842-6596], p = 0.035). Malignant cells were present in 13% (3 of 22) of effusions. Chyle leak was not identified by lymphangiography. After initial drainage, 76% of patients with chylothorax and 80% with chylous ascites required additional interventions. Selpercatinib dose reduction and discontinuation rates in those with chylous effusions were 47% and 0%, respectively. Median time from diagnosis to disease progression was not reached (95% confidence interval: 14.5-undefined); median time from diagnosis to TKI discontinuation was 11.4 months (95% confidence interval: 8.2-14.9).

Conclusions

Chylous effusions can emerge during treatment with selected RET TKIs. Recognition of this side effect is key to prevent potential misattribution of worsening effusions to progressive malignancy.

### Outcomes of conservative management for chylothorax following minimally invasive lung cancer surgery [^2030d0f7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Chylothorax, a rare but serious complication of lung cancer surgery, results from lymphatic injury during mediastinal lymph node dissection. If untreated, it can cause nutritional and immunologic deficits, impairing recovery and increasing infection risk. The incidence of chylothorax is relatively low (approximately 0.5–3%). Although our study focused on patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery, we retrospectively reviewed the incidence of chylothorax among patients who underwent thoracotomy during the same period. Among 337 thoracotomy cases, 3 patients developed chylothorax, corresponding to an incidence of 0.9%. While this analysis was not part of the original study design and no statistical comparison was performed, this rate is consistent with previously reported ranges and provides context for the incidence observed in our MIS cohort. The standard treatment paradigm involves initiating conservative management, including dietary modifications, TPN, and pleurodesis, and progressing to surgical re-intervention only when conservative measures fail. Many studies have used a pleural drainage threshold of 500 mL/day to assess the likelihood of conservative treatment success and recommend surgery if significant reductions in output are not observed over a defined period; however, the role of surgical intervention, particularly thoracic duct ligation, as an alternative to failed conservative treatment remains controversial. Owing to the anatomical variability and complexity of the thoracic duct pathways, ligation alone often fails to produce dramatic improvements in chylous effusion. Although surgery remains a last-resort option, it may not always be optimal.

### Chyloperitoneum (...) [^9a7e2f3f]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Few clinicians have the opportunity in a lifetime of practice to observe a case of massive chyloperitoneal effusion. This is evidenced by the multiplicity of single case reports, with few exceptions. 2, 12, 41-43 Chylous ascites is a manifestation and not a disease entity; it represents an "obstructive phenomenon. ". Although the etiology is unknown, there is usually some distinct pathologic condition appearing simultaneously in the patient to account for the effusion. An abnormal accumulation of chyle occurs in the pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal cavities and is seldom diagnosed preoperatively in the last two sites. The purpose of this paper is to review some of the data pertaining to the lymphatic system and to report three cases of chylous ascites recently encountered. Since Aselli discovered the lymphatic system in 1622, considerable information has been brought forth relative to the properties and function of lymph. Bartholin, in 1651, described the first case of chylothorax.

### Successful surgical treatment of two cases of congenital chylous ascites [^5b81cb4c]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The authors report on 2 patients with congenital chylous ascites who underwent successful lymphatic duct ligation after a laparoscopic lymphoid dye test. Fetal ascites had been detected in both cases, and both babies were born with marked abdominal swelling. Given that conservative treatment by medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) milk and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was ineffective, the authors elected to perform lymphatic duct ligation on the 95th postnatal day in the former case and on the 27th postnatal day in the latter case. Lipophilic dye was administered preoperatively both through oral and subcutaneous routes, and the peritoneal cavity was explored using laparoscopy. This laparoscopic lymphoid dye test precisely identified the area of chylous leakage, and the authors were able to repair the malformed lymphatic duct directly at laparotomy. Both postoperative courses have been favorable with no recurrence of symptoms. The lymphatic duct ligation should be considered in cases resistant to conservative treatment for over a month. The present laparoscopic lymphoid dye test is a novel and useful procedure that allows surgeons to identify the exact location of chylous leakage, and thus successfully ligate the lymphatic duct.
