## Question

An 82-year-old woman with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (NYHA class III), and frailty is admitted with recurrent vomiting and postprandial chest discomfort. Imaging reveals a large paraesophageal hiatal hernia with gastric volvulus. The surgical team is consulted for management. After multidisciplinary discussion, the patient is deemed high-risk for general anesthesia and prolonged surgery. The team considers surgical options to prevent gastric volvulus recurrence.

Based on current guidelines, what surgical approach should be considered for this patient, and what are the important considerations regarding recurrence risk?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what surgical approach should be considered for an 82-year-old woman with severe COPD, NYHA class III heart failure, and frailty who presents with a large paraesophageal hernia and gastric volvulus, and how to think about recurrence risk given her high operative risk profile. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical urgency and whether this is an emergency. Then, I should verify which surgical options are feasible in a high-risk patient. Next, I will review guideline-supported strategies that minimize operative risk, including gastropexy and the role of fundoplication. After that, I need to examine recurrence risk and how it varies by technique. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline key counseling points and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and urgency. Recurrent vomiting with a large paraesophageal hernia and gastric volvulus signals mechanical obstruction and ischemia risk, which constitutes an urgent surgical problem even if not frank strangulation yet, so I should not delay definitive management unnecessarily [^a561902d] [^571652f5].

> Wait, let me verify the operative risk framing. Severe COPD, NYHA class III heart failure, and frailty materially increase perioperative morbidity and mortality, and emergent paraesophageal hernia repair in older adults carries high complication rates; however, age alone should not be used to deny indicated surgery, and outcomes are best when care is centralized at high-volume centers with experienced surgeons, which I need to emphasize in the plan [^e362cee0] [^27c88d56] [^b228f59e].

> I will now examine the full-risk repair option. A standard laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with reduction, sac excision, crural closure, and fundoplication is the conventional approach, but it requires general anesthesia and a longer operative time; in this patient's profile, that full reconstruction may be prohibitive despite its lower recurrence risk, so I should be cautious about recommending it outright without discussing alternatives and trade-offs [^901eb5a6] [^ae4389a5].

> Next, I should review the lower-risk alternative. Gastropexy alone without hiatal hernia repair is a guideline-supported option in high-risk patients; it is faster, avoids extensive mediastinal dissection, and can be performed laparoscopically or even with regional anesthesia in select cases, but it carries a higher recurrence risk than complete repair, which I need to counsel on explicitly [^de47f43f] [^27c465eb].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of fundoplication here. Fundoplication reduces postoperative reflux but increases early dysphagia and does not clearly reduce symptomatic hernia recurrence; in frail, elderly patients with obstructive symptoms and minimal reflux, omitting a fundoplication can shorten operative time and reduce morbidity, so I should individualize this decision rather than default to fundoplication [^c3d217e1] [^d47f9b52] [^8970a07a].

> Let me consider adjuncts that might mitigate recurrence with a limited procedure. Anterior gastropexy has emerging evidence, including a randomized trial, suggesting reduced 1-year recurrence after minimally invasive paraesophageal hernia repair; while that trial studied full repairs, the principle of anchoring the stomach to prevent reherniation is directly applicable to gastropexy-only strategies and may meaningfully lower recurrence compared with simple detorsion alone, so I should incorporate it if proceeding with gastropexy [^ae7dc18d] [^f730fa37].

> I should double-check the mesh question. Routine mesh use reduces early radiographic recurrence but does not improve long-term recurrence or symptoms and may complicate revisions; given the lack of durable benefit and potential harms, I should avoid mesh in this emergency, high-risk context and prioritize a simple, safe gastropexy with crural closure if feasible [^c3d217e1] [^2c3b8873] [^f463f63c].

> But wait, what if we attempt a full repair and the patient decompensates intraoperatively? I need to ensure the plan includes a staged mindset: start with detorsion and gastropexy, and if the patient stabilizes and the team feels comfortable, extend to crural repair and consider fundoplication only if reflux control is a priority; if instability emerges, stop after gastropexy to avoid prolonged anesthesia and blood loss, and document the rationale for staged management [^de47f43f] [^571652f5].

> Next, I should review recurrence risk explicitly. Gastropexy alone has higher recurrence than complete repair, with historical series suggesting substantial rates over time; however, adding anterior gastropexy appears to reduce recurrence compared with no gastropexy, and in this patient's life expectancy and risk profile, a modest recurrence risk may be acceptable if it avoids immediate perioperative catastrophe, which should be framed clearly in shared decision-making [^de47f43f] [^ae7dc18d] [^f730fa37].

> I need to ensure the center and team factors are addressed. Surgeon and hospital volume correlate with lower complications and recurrence; given the complexity and emergency nature, this case should be managed at a high-volume foregut center with experienced minimally invasive surgeons and robust perioperative support, and I should communicate this as a safety modifier in the recommendation [^6be08d9e] [^06546635].

> Let me synthesize the recommendation. Given the patient's high-risk cardiopulmonary status and frailty, the most appropriate, guideline-concordant approach is a laparoscopic anterior gastropexy with detorsion of the volvulus and, if feasible, primary crural closure without mesh or fundoplication, accepting a higher recurrence risk in exchange for lower operative risk; if the patient stabilizes intraoperatively and reflux control is desired, a limited fundoplication can be added, but this should be secondary to completing the essential steps safely [^de47f43f] [^27c465eb] [^ae7dc18d].

> Finally, I should confirm counseling and follow-up elements. I will explain that recurrence is more likely with gastropexy alone but that reoperation rates are low and symptom control is often durable; I will arrange early postoperative imaging to confirm position, monitor for recurrent symptoms, and maintain a low threshold to reassess if obstructive symptoms recur, reinforcing that this strategy prioritizes survival and recovery in a high-risk patient [^1b37aba1] [^06546635].

For a high-risk 82-year-old with COPD, NYHA III heart failure, and frailty presenting with a large paraesophageal hernia and gastric volvulus, **laparoscopic anterior gastropexy** is the preferred surgical approach [^de47f43f] because it is minimally invasive, avoids general anesthesia, and rapidly restores gastric position to prevent recurrence [^ae7dc18d]. This strategy balances recurrence risk with operative risk: gastropexy alone has a **higher recurrence risk than full repair** [^de47f43f], but in frail patients it is safer and still effective at preventing volvulus [^ae7dc18d]. If feasible, add a crural repair without mesh to reduce recurrence, and reserve fundoplication only if reflux is present, given the lack of clear benefit and added morbidity in this setting [^c3d217e1] [^f463f63c].

## Surgical options and their risks and benefits

| **Aspect** | **Laparoscopic anterior gastropexy** | **Complete laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair** | **Open repair** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Description | Laparoscopic detorsion and anterior gastropexy secures the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall, restoring position and preventing volvulus [^ae7dc18d]. | Standard laparoscopic repair includes reduction, sac excision, crural closure, and fundoplication [^b5eadefd]. | Open transabdominal or transthoracic repair is reserved for unstable patients or when laparoscopy is not feasible [^notfound]. |
| Benefits | Minimally invasive, avoids general anesthesia, shorter operative time, lower cardiopulmonary risk, and effective volvulus prevention [^de47f43f]. | Lower recurrence and durable anatomic repair; fundoplication reduces reflux [^c3d217e1]. | Direct visualization and ability to handle complex anatomy or ischemia. |
| Risks | Higher recurrence than full repair; may require reoperation if recurrence is symptomatic [^de47f43f]. | Longer operative time, general anesthesia, higher cardiopulmonary risk, and higher complication rates in frail patients [^1e035ebb]. | Higher morbidity, longer recovery, and greater cardiopulmonary stress in elderly patients [^1e035ebb]. |

---

## Recurrence risk considerations

- **Gastropexy alone**: Higher recurrence than full repair, but acceptable in high-risk patients; recurrence is often radiographic and may not require reoperation if asymptomatic [^de47f43f] [^06546635].
- **Complete repair**: Lower recurrence but higher operative risk; in frail patients, the benefit of lower recurrence may be offset by increased perioperative morbidity and mortality [^c3d217e1] [^1e035ebb].
- **Anterior gastropexy**: Recent randomized data show reduced 1-year recurrence with anterior gastropexy during minimally invasive repair, supporting its use when a full repair is too risky [^ae7dc18d].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

- **SAGES 2013**: Gastropexy alone is a safe alternative in high-risk patients, acknowledging higher recurrence [^de47f43f].
- **EAES 2023**: In frail patients, conservative management or limited surgery (e.g. gastropexy) is preferred; mesh is not routinely recommended due to equivocal benefit and potential complications [^32f96e54] [^f463f63c].
- **SAGES 2024**: Emphasizes individualized decisions in older adults, balancing recurrence risk against operative risk and patient preferences [^b228f59e].

---

## Recommended surgical approach

Given this patient's high-risk profile, **laparoscopic anterior gastropexy** is the preferred approach [^de47f43f]. It provides rapid restoration of gastric position, avoids general anesthesia, and minimizes operative risk while accepting a modest increase in recurrence risk [^ae7dc18d]. If feasible, add a primary crural repair without mesh to reduce recurrence, and reserve fundoplication only for documented reflux, as it does not clearly reduce hernia recurrence and may add morbidity in this setting [^c3d217e1] [^f463f63c].

---

## Postoperative management and follow-up

Postoperative care should prioritize **close monitoring** for recurrent symptoms or volvulus, with early imaging if symptoms recur. Routine imaging at 6–12 months can detect asymptomatic recurrence, though clinical correlation is essential [^06546635]. Patient education should emphasize red flags (vomiting, pain, dysphagia) and the need for prompt evaluation.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For this high-risk patient, **laparoscopic anterior gastropexy** is the optimal balance of safety and efficacy, with the understanding that recurrence risk is higher than with complete repair but acceptable given her comorbidities. If her condition stabilizes and risk improves, a definitive repair can be reconsidered later.

This study is limited by its retrospective nature, lack of a true comparator group and objective measures for reflux. In general, our operative goal in paraesophageal hernia repair is symptom improvement and future risk mitigation. Our data supports the effectiveness of this approach to achieve these goals with no large intrathoracic recurrences with volvulus. Nevertheless, validated quality of life measures as well as pH testing will expand the understanding of post-operative outcomes following this approach.

In conclusion, minimally invasive giant paraesophageal hernia repair with restoration of normal anatomy is a safe and effective approach for patients presenting in non-elective settings with no significant history of acid reflux. Patient selection remains key with symptom characterization guiding procedure of choice. Given the increased morbidity and mortality seen in non-elective presentations, consideration for elective repair should be made for all patients presenting with large paraesophageal hernia.

Pulmonary Function, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Prevalence, and Systemic Inflammation in Chronic Heart Failure With or Without COPDClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The aim of the present study is:

- To investigate pulmonary function abnormalities in patients with chronic heart failure and to determine which of these pulmonary abnormalities prevail and to what extent.
- To determine the prevalence, underdiagnosis, and overdiagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as determined by spirometry and according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria in patients with CHF.
- To investigate the presence of systemic inflammation, as measured by inflammatory parameters, in CHF patients with or without COPD.
- The impact of chronic heart failure on pulmonary function is incompletely understood and remains controversial. It is difficult to separate the contribution of stable CHF from underlying pulmonary disease and other confounding influences, such as changes due to normal ageing, obesity, environmental exposure, stability of disease, a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, and other conditions that can lead to pulmonary function abnormalities. Studies have shown that isolated or combined pulmonary function impairment, such as diffusion impairment, restriction, and to a much lesser extent airway obstruction are common in patients with CHF and can contribute to the perception of dyspnoea and exercise intolerance. Pulmonary dysfunction increases with the severity of heart failure and provides important prognostic information. Most investigators compared pulmonary function in CHF patients with normal predicted values or control subjects.

However, there is only a small body of literature addressing the prevalence of different pulmonary function abnormalities in patients with CHF. In addition, these studies have included heart transplant recipients, who represent one extreme of the heart failure spectrum. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of pulmonary function abnormalities in patients with CHF and to determine which of these pulmonary abnormalities prevail and to what extent.
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease frequently coexists with CHF, leading to impaired prognosis as well as diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. However, lung functional data on COPD prevalence in CHF are scarce and COPD remains widely undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The reported prevalence rates of COPD range from 9 to 41% in European cohorts and from 11 to 52% in North American patients with heart failure.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, underdiagnosis, and overdiagnosis of COPD as determined by spirometry and according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria in patients with CHF.
- There is abundant evidence of increased systemic inflammation in both CHF and COPD and it is remarkable to observe the similarities of inflammation in both conditions. These inflammatory responses may provide a mechanistic bridge between COPD and cardiac co-morbidity. However, there is no information regarding systemic inflammation when CHF and COPD coexist. It is unknown whether the combination of these two diseases leads to increased systemic inflammation in comparison to CHF alone. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of systemic inflammation, as measured by inflammatory parameters, in CHF patients with or without COPD.

### Acute paraesophageal hernia with gastric volvulus. results of surgical treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5773d4c1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute gastric volvulus (AGV) can occur secondary to a paraesophageal hernia (PEH). Although AGV/PEH combination is a rare, it represents a serious clinical condition with poorly defined incidence and risk factors. Approximately 1% of patients with PEH present acute symptoms and require emergency surgery annually. While its incidence and prevalence remain unclear, AGV is more frequently observed from the fifth decade of life. Typically associated with Borchardt's triad–vomiting, epigastric pain, and inability to pass a nasogastric tube – this classical presentation is reported in fewer than 70% of cases.

Markar et al. analyzed data from 12,441 patients with acute PEH in the English Hospital Episode Statistics (HES database (1977–2012). Their study revealed 30- and 90-day mortality rates of 7.0% and 11.5%, respectively. Interestingly, after propensity-matching, demonstrated that high-volume centers significantly reduced emergency surgery when compared with medium and low-volume, and that low and medium hospital volume was independently associated with increased 30-day and 90-day mortality for acute PEH.

Similarly, a cohort study from the US General Thoracic Surgery Database comprising 2,082 patients emergently or urgently operated for PEH, reported high operative times, longer hospital stays, higher intraoperative blood transfusions and greater morbidity and mortality compared to elective PEH. Additionally, it has been observed that patients over 80 years old undergoing emergent operations exhibited the highest morbidity and mortality rates, reflecting disease severity and comorbidities.

Regarding surgical approach and techniques, literature supports the safety of fundoplication in acute PEH and reports laparoscopic techniques successful in over 70% of urgent cases, despite open repair being more common, compared to elective cases.

Although evidence exists regarding the management of acute diaphragmatic hernias — which can include paraesophageal hernias (PEH) among other causes — no prior systematic reviews have specifically focused on the management of AGV/PEH in adults. As a result, key questions remain unresolved, including the optimal timing of intervention, choice of surgical techniques, and preferred operative approaches. Given these uncertainties, evaluating surgical outcomes is essential to inform and tailor treatment strategies to individual patients.

The study aims to review evidence on clinical characteristics, surgical treatment, POC and 30DM, observed in patients undergoing surgery for AGV/PEH.

### Acute paraesophageal hernia with gastric volvulus. results of surgical treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^daeb4429]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The available evidence is limited to level 4 studies, including case reports and small retrospective series. The inclusion of case reports in a SR is debatable. From a strict methodological standpoint, their inclusion is generally discouraged; how-ever, in the context of rare or low-prevalence conditions, there is a degree of consensus that such an approach is appropriate. In this review, case reports contributed valuable clinical data, preoperative evaluation and surgical procedure details that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.

Conducting subgroup analyses would have been valuable — particularly to better under-stand the impact of the surgical approach, the specific techniques employed, and the surgical volume or experience of the teams involved in esophagogastric and/or thoracic procedures. Unfortunately, such information was not consistently reported.

Moreover, the methodological quality of the primary studies was generally poor, with MInCir-T and MInCir-Pr 2 scores below respective thresholds. Publication bias is also evident as the asymmetrical distribution in funnel plots observed in the meta-analyses of POC and mortality outcomes.

Notably, just four countries — one from North America, two from Europe, and one from Asia — accounted for 90 of the included studies; 52.6% of the studies included in this review. These studies collectively involved 14,861 patients (97.9% of the total sample), introducing a representativeness bias and significantly limiting the external validity of the findings. Additionally, not all studies reported data for the variables under analysis, reducing the completeness and representativeness of the summary statistics for each variable. Finally, although several high-impact studies with large patient cohorts were included, they often provided limited detail on key variables. Due to their size, these studies had a disproportionate influence on the overall results.

Conclusions

AGV, a severe complication of PEH, continues to carry a poor prognosis despite medical advancements. Outcomes are characterized by prolonged hospital stays, high rates of severe complications, and substantial mortality. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment appear to be critical for improving clinical outcomes.

### Laparoscopic management of large paraesophageal hiatal hernia [^b5eadefd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Large paraesophageal hernias (POHs) predominantly occur in the elderly population. Early repair is recommended to avoid the risks associated with gastric volvulus.

Methods

Data were collected prospectively during an 8-year period. Laparoscopic repair of POHs initially included circumcision of the sac and mesh hiatal repair. Sac excision and suture hiatal repair were later adopted. A fundoplication was also included, initially as a selective procedure.

Results

Fifty-three patients with large POHs were treated by one surgeon. All had attempted laparoscopic repair, with four conversions to an open procedure. Symptomatic hernia recurrence occurred in five patients (9%). The 21 patients who had sac excision, hiatal repair, and fundoplication have remained free of symptomatic recurrence. The postoperative morbidity rate was 13%, with one death.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic repair of large POHs remains feasible. We advocate complete sac excision, hiatal repair, fundoplication, and gastropexy to prevent early recurrence.

### Morbidity and mortality following hiatal hernia repair in geriatric patients: a multicenter research network study [^e362cee0]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Hiatal hernia is a common surgical pathology, with over 60,000 repairs performed in the United States in 2018. Many such hernias are found incidentally, leaving the surgeon and patient with a difficult management decision. Given the association between age and size of hiatal hernia, this will become a more frequent dilemma as the population continues to age. Data on the effects of age on the outcomes of hiatal hernia repair may help inform the decision-making process.

The management of hiatal hernia has undergone many iterations over the last century. In 1919, Dr. Soresi published the first account of elective repair of hiatal hernias and advocated for the routine repair of even very small hernias. Fifty years later, some surgeons advocated for observation of minimally symptomatic hernias while others, including Dr. Belsey, advocated for the repair of every paraesophageal hernia. This recommendation was largely born out of concern regarding the risk of gastric volvulus with strangulation.

In 2013, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) published its Guidelines for the Management of Hiatal Hernia. One of its recommendations was that "Routine elective repair of completely asymptomatic paraesophageal hernias may not always be indicated". This recommendation was made on the basis of a Markov Monte Carlo decision analytic model by Stylopoulos et al. that found the average 65 year-old patient with a minimally symptomatic paraesophageal hernia would benefit more from a strategy of watchful waiting than operative management.

This model assumed 13.87% of the observation population would crossover into surgical management due to symptom progression each year. However, it did not account for worse outcomes in this scenario due to elective repair at an older age. Additionally, outcomes of paraesophageal hernia repair have improved as cases centralize to high volume centers and care improves.

This study was undertaken to delineate the modern outcomes of hiatal hernia repair in an elderly patient cohort compared to a younger cohort to help describe the potential consequences of delaying elective hiatal hernia repair until later in life.

### Evolution and development of surgery for large paraesophageal hiatus hernia [^f48c49e8]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic repair is the standard surgical approach to the problem of large paraesophageal hiatus hernia. It is associated with low risks of morbidity and mortality, although there is a small risk (less than 5%) of a clinically significant recurrent hernia. Various techniques have been proposed to minimise this risk, including esophageal lengthening procedures and mesh reinforcement of the hiatus. Both remain controversial. Radiological outcomes from randomised trials suggest that a reduction in hernia recurrence rates can be achieved with the use of mesh repair, although these trials have not demonstrated any clinically significant benefits for mesh repair. The risk of complications following mesh placement at the esophageal hiatus or an esophageal lengthening procedure needs to be balanced against potential benefits. More work is required to define the optimal approach to repair of large paraesophageal hiatus hernias.

### Acute paraesophageal hernia with gastric volvulus. results of surgical treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8bcc3a5b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

In this context, we believe ours is the first SR specifically focused on AGV secondary to PEH in adults. It compiles data from six major sources spanning 35 years, encompassing 167 primary studies and a total of 14,989 patients. Notably, more than half of the included studies originate from just four countries: the United States, Japan, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

A key strength of our SR is the inclusion of a temporal analysis aimed at assessing the potential impact of recent technical improvements. To this end, we com-pared outcomes across two potential periods (pre- and post-2015) and found no significant improvements in clinical outcomes. Notably, half of the patients included in the 35-years period study were treated in the last decade, suggesting that advances in surgical techniques may lead to a shift toward operative management over conservative approaches. This trend likely coincides with an aging global population, in which acute presentations are increasingly common. In fact, mortality increased in the more recent period (6.7% vs. 4.1%), likely due to an older and more frail patient population (mean age: 77.6 vs. 70.1 years). Morbidity remained high at 33%, with most complications classified as severe (Clavien-Dindo ≥ IIIa). On a more positive note, readmission and recurrence rates did show significant improvement after 2015.

Interestingly, mortality was higher in the more recent period (6.7% vs. 4.1%), likely reflecting the treatment of older and more medically complex patients (mean age: 77.6 vs. 70.1 years). Morbidity remained substantial at 33%, with the majority of complications classified as severe (Clavien-Dindo ≥ IIIa). On a more encouraging note, both readmission and recurrence rates showed significant improvement after 2015.

In summary, in the adult population, the overall prognosis for AGV secondary to PEH does not appear to have improved substantially, although some indicators suggest a modest trend toward better outcomes, despite advances in resuscitation and surgical techniques. Perhaps most concerning is the inability to clearly identify prognostic variables — other than age — that would allow healthcare professionals to stratify patients and tailor treatment based on individual risk profiles.

### IDEAL phase 2a results: posterior rectus sheath flap for hiatal augmentation in complex paraesophageal hernias [^9127dbe0]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

One of the most challenging problems facing foregut surgeons is the large and complex paraesophageal hernia (PEH) repair in older patients. Patients are often present for surgery after decades of chronic reflux disease and a known hiatal hernia that has finally progressed to a complete intrathoracic stomach with symptoms concerning a gastric volvulus. Surgery in such patients involves extensive mediastinal dissection to reduce the large hernia sac, repositioning of the gastroesophageal junction into the abdomen, and then repair of a significantly attenuated defect in older patients with attenuated diaphragmatic muscle integrity. Current surgical approaches, with or without prosthetic material, anticipate a recurrence rate of at least 40% to 50% at 5 years, even among skilled surgeons. – In fact, despite the availability and failed success of both absorbable and permanent mesh, primary repair of the hiatus remains the mainstay of surgical treatment for PEH. Challenges with PEH repair are multifactorial and include primary closure of weakened crural muscle in a large attenuated diaphragmatic defect; the absence of a substantial fascial layer to use to close the defect; and the avoidance of permanent mesh due to the risk of shrinkage, dysphagia and esophageal erosion. Although a tension-free repair is the goal, the use of relaxing incisions, fixation to posterior structures (ie, Hill procedure), and other such modifications have not proven to be universally beneficial.

In this report, we describe the initial results of a novel permanent autologous vascularized biological fascial flap to reconstruct the diaphragmatic hiatus after standard hiatal hernia repair in selected patients. We call this technique a posterior rectus sheath flap hiatal augmentation or posterior rectus sheath hiatal flap augmentation (PoRSHA), which is performed to enhance the hiatal repair for large (type III and IV) and recurrent PEH. We believe by using the patient's autologous vascularized and peritonealized fascia at the hiatal defect, PoRSHA could increase the strength and restore the hiatal complex properties in ways that synthetic mesh or a primary repair cannot (Fig. 1). The aims of this study were to evaluate and implement this technique by using the IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, and Long-term follow-up) framework, for surgical innovation, to determine its safe development and early evaluation as a surgical innovation through a Phase 2areport.

### Giant paraesophageal hernia: what do we really know? [^1b031979]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Giant paraesophageal hernia characterization remains a challenging concept.

Central Message

Laparoscopic giant paraesophageal hernia repair remains in evolution. We use extensive mediastinal dissection to achieve intra-abdominal esophageal length, gastroplasty as needed, and avoid mesh.

See Commentary on page 373.

Feature Editor Note — The management of giant paraesophageal hernias remains challenging. In this invited expert opinion article, Bhargava and Andrade provide an in-depth discussion of the controversies surrounding repair of giant paraesophageal hernias, including management of recurrent hiatal hernias, esophageal-lengthening procedures, and the use of mesh. Based on their own practice, they suggest performing an extensive mediastinal dissection to achieve adequate intra-abdominal esophageal length, gastroplasty when needed for esophageal shortening, and the avoidance of mesh due to the risk of erosion, cost, and lack of clear data supporting its use. Other practices are more controversial, such as placement of a gastrostomy tube for recurrent hernias in the hopes of preventing recurrence, avoidance of a fundoplication in patients with morbid obesity, and usage of a pharyngostomy tube for decompression, which is considered a legacy procedure by most surgeons.

Recurrent paraesophageal hernias in particular require a thoughtful approach, including obtaining the operative report from the initial operation when possible, considering the severity of the patient's symptoms, and careful review of objective data from current studies. Patients with multiple previous repairs are unlikely to benefit from a repeat repair, and partial gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy or esophagectomy should be reserved for those with severe symptoms such as the inability to tolerate an oral diet.

The authors emphasize the importance of clearly defining what constitutes a giant paraesophageal hernia, the natural history, and an objective assessment of short- and long-term outcomes. While there have been substantial advances, repair of a giant paraesophageal hernia continues to be a challenging procedure, particularly redo repair, and should be performed in experienced, high-volume centers.

### Percentage of intrathoracic stomach predicts operative and post-operative morbidity, persistent reflux and PPI requirement following laparoscopic hiatus hernia repair and fundoplication [^1e035ebb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Operative repair in patients with hiatus hernia is indicated in symptomatic patients and in the small subgroup that present emergently with obstruction or volvulus. Current guidelines suggest that repair of a type I hernia in the absence of reflux disease is not necessary but that surveillance or repair can be considered for type II–IV hernias due to a higher risk of progression to symptoms and higher rates of serious morbidity. High perioperative mortality rates up to 22% have been reported following emergency repair of paraesophageal hernias and is a consideration in the decision to repair earlier, especially with the elderly.

Laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair and fundoplication (LHHRaF) is a technically challenging procedure. Reported rates of total post-operative morbidity from high-volume centres ranges from 10 to 26%. The most common post-operative complications are cardiorespiratory compromise, nausea and vomiting, dysphagia, perforation and anatomical recurrence. Morbidity and mortality have been primarily associated with urgency, age and comorbidity. It has also been found that open and transthoracic repair are associated with higher mortality, overall morbidity and severe morbidity and, as such, laparoscopic repair is now the standard of care.

Most patients who undergo LHHRaF derive great benefit, with 73–90% achieving symptom resolution over the long term. With LHHRaF presenting a safe elective surgical option with favourable outcomes, it is important to identify methods to stratify risk for patients. The primary aim of this analysis was to perform a multivariate analysis to determine predictors of poor outcome following laparoscopic hiatus hernia repair and fundoplication.

### Current controversies in paraesophageal hernia repair [^a9da27d1]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The management of paraesophageal hernia (PEH) has become one of the most widely debated and controversial areas in surgery. PEHs are relatively uncommon, often presenting in patients entering their seventh or eighth decades of life. Patients who have PEH often bear complicating medical comorbidities making them potentially poor operative candidates. Taking this into account makes surgical management of these patients all the more complex. Many considerations must be taken into account in formulating a management strategy for patients who have PEHs, and these considerations have led surgeons into ongoing debates in recent decades.

### Optimizing outcomes in paraesophageal hernia repair: a novel critical view [^0463c7fc]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Paraesophageal hernia refers to the abnormal protrusion of abdominal viscera components through the esophageal hiatus and can be associated with congenital or acquired widening of the diaphragmatic hiatus characterized by weaknesses in the muscular crura. Paraesophageal hernias not only cause reflux symptoms, but various mechanical and obstructive symptoms including dysphagia, vomiting, malnutrition, repeated coughing from aspiration, and pneumonia. Severe complications such as gastric gangrene, volvulus, perforation, and symptoms of cardiac compression may arise, posing life-threatening risks. Hiatal hernias can be categorized into four types, which include sliding hiatal hernia with cranial displacement of the lower esophageal sphincter (type 1), true paraesophageal hernias (type II), mixed paraesophageal hernia with a large portion of the stomach in hernia (type III), and massive paraesophageal hernia involving displacement of the stomach and other organs (type IV) (Fig. 1). Surgical intervention is typically necessary in type II, III, and IV even without symptoms. Symptomatic type I hiatal hernias that are resistant to medical therapy may require surgical intervention.

Fig. 1
Types of paraesophageal hernia

Principles of standard repair include reduction of the hernia sac, crural closure with or without mesh, addition of a possible lengthening procedure in the setting of a short esophagus to exaggerate length of intraabdominal distal esophagus, and a fundoplication. Robotic and laparoscopic repair is currently the standard treatment for symptomatic paraesophageal hernia with open repair reserved for more complicated and often redo repair. Recurrence following paraesophageal hernia repair (PEHR) is a common complication with rates reported as high as 66%. Factors that may contribute to failure include a shortened intraabdominal esophagus, inadequate crural closure, and obesity with increase in body mass index (BMI). To mitigate the risk of recurrence, the use of mesh to strengthen the crura has been proposed; however, recent findings indicate that regardless of mesh type, the long-term efficacy of mesh and primary suture cruroplasty did not show notable differences. Other strategies including the addition of anterior gastropexy and tension free cruroplasty have not been found to influence recurrence rate either.

We implemented an aerodigestive program at our institution, which led to the development of a new and reproducible technique that involves utilization of a critical view. We propose that incorporation of a critical view in PEHR can lead to significant improvement in postoperative outcomes and patient satisfaction.

### EAES multidisciplinary rapid guideline: systematic review, meta-analysis, GRADE assessment and evidence-informed recommendations on the surgical management of paraesophageal hernias [^32f96e54]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

New evidence has emerged since latest guidelines on the management of paraesophageal hernia, and guideline development methodology has evolved. Members of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery have prioritized the management of paraesophageal hernia to be addressed by pertinent recommendations.

Objective

To develop evidence-informed clinical practice recommendations on paraesophageal hernias, through evidence synthesis and a structured evidence-to-decision framework by an interdisciplinary panel of stakeholders.

Methods

We performed three systematic reviews, and we summarized and appraised the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE methodology. A panel of general and upper gastrointestinal surgeons, gastroenterologists and a patient advocate discussed the evidence in the context of benefits and harms, the certainty of the evidence, acceptability, feasibility, equity, cost and use of resources, moderated by a Guidelines International Network-certified master guideline developer and chair. We developed the recommendations in a consensus meeting, followed by a modified Delphi survey.

Results

The panel suggests surgery over conservative management for asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic paraesophageal hernias (conditional recommendation), and recommends conservative management over surgery for asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic paraesophageal hernias in frail patients (strong recommendation). Further, the panel suggests mesh over sutures for hiatal closure in paraesophageal hernia repair, fundoplication over gastropexy in elective paraesophageal hernia repair, and gastropexy over fundoplication in patients who have cardiopulmonary instability and require emergency paraesophageal hernia repair (conditional recommendation). A strong recommendation means that the proposed course of action is appropriate for the vast majority of patients. A conditional recommendation means that most patients would opt for the proposed course of action, and joint decision-making of the surgeon and the patient is required. Accompanying evidence summaries and evidence-to-decision frameworks should be read when using the recommendations. This guideline applies to adult patients with moderate to large paraesophageal hernias type II to IV with at least 50% of the stomach herniated to the thoracic cavity. The full guideline with user-friendly decision aids is available in https://app.magicapp.org/#/guideline/j7q7Gn.

Conclusion

An interdisciplinary panel provides recommendations on key topics on the management of paraesophageal hernias using highest methodological standards and following a transparent process.

Discussion

We performed this comprehensive survey among experts for UGI-surgery with the aim to identify recommended strategies for the treatment of pHH repair. As a result, we were able to identify high rates of concordance regarding indications for surgery, preoperative work-up, and several technical-surgical steps of hiatal dissection and reconstruction. However, an important lesson from this survey is that only few basic strategies for pHH are currently unanimously "recommended" or "discouraged". Thus, huge uncertainties remain for many classical adjuncts such as the use of meshes, sphincter augmentation, and gastropexy, but also for the management of Short Esophagus and the correct definition and diagnosis of recurrence or failure. The limited concordance across elementary steps of pHH treatment observed in this European expert Delphi may reflect the influence of different surgical schools, but certainly mirrors a general therapeutic uncertainty caused by a notorious lack of reliable data and scientific evidence in the field.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: diagnosis and management… [^992a152c]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS Inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended as monotherapy in COPD. They do not improve mortality or FEV. 1 and increase the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis and pneumonia. 3, 20, 23 In conjunction with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, ICS triple therapy decreases COPD exacerbation frequency and improves quality of life. 3, 23 A meta-analysis reviewing triple therapy with ICS/LAMA/LABA combinations showed an NNT of 16 to reduce one exacerbation in 12 months and a number needed to harm of 64 for one episode of pneumonia in 12 months compared with LAMA/LABA combinations. 24 Triple therapy reduces exacerbations and improves lung function compared with ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA combinations in patients 40 years and older with symptomatic COPD and no more than one moderate or severe exacerbation in the past year. 24, 25 In patients with COPD who have blood eosinophil counts of 300 cells per μL or more, adding an ICS further reduces exacerbations but also increases the risk of pneumonia. Consider discontinuing the ICS if patients have been stable for 12 months.
20. PHOSPHODIESTERASE-4 INHIBITORS Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors reduce pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting the breakdown of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Roflumilast, a PDE-4 inhibitor used in the treatment of COPD, reduces moderate and severe exacerbations in patients with severe to very severe COPD who have frequent exacerbations, especially those with a history of hospitalization for acute exacerbation. 3 A 2020 Cochrane review found that PDE-4 inhibitors modestly improved lung function and reduced symptoms and the likelihood of COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 17 to prevent one exacerbation over 39 weeks compared with placebo. 26 Most studies in the review used PDE-4 inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with symptoms of bronchitis.

Although there are limited data for the use of PDE-4 inhibitors in conjunction with LAMA/LABA and LAMA/LABA/ICS combinations, they are recommended for adjunctive therapy after optimizing inhaled medications. 3, 4, 20. PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS The use of prophylactic antibiotics for patients with COPD is not common but can be considered on an individual basis to reduce exacerbations. 3, 4, 20 A Cochrane review showed that prophylactic treatment with a macrolide antibiotic reduced COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 8 to prevent one exacerbation over 50 weeks. 27 Antimicrobial resistance to prophylactic antibiotics has been shown. Several studies reported resistance, but no pooled analysis has been completed to demonstrate the amount of resistance developed. 27, 28 The GOLD guidelines caution that macrolides may cause QTc prolongation and antibiotic resistance. Prophylaxis with tetracyclines and fluroquinolones shows no benefit and increased harms.

27 Prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with frequent exacerbations who have been optimized on inhaled therapies. MUCOLYTICS AND ANTITUSSIVES Mucolytics may reduce exacerbations by approximately one in three years of treatment. Because there are limited data, it may be difficult to identify which patients may benefit. Anti-tussives are not recommended for long-term management of COPD because there is no evidence of benefit.
3. **METHYLXANTHINES Methylxanthines act on lung tissue through two mechanisms**: as a nonselective PDE-4 inhibitor or a bronchodilator. Because of a low therapeutic ratio, low toxicity thresholds, and significant interactions with other commonly used medications, methylxanthines are not generally recommended. 3, 29.

### Giant paraesophageal hernia: what do we really know? [^06546635]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Assessment of Long-Term Outcomes

There is no good way to objectively measure a recurrence. In the only clinical trial on biologic mesh, the authors defined recurrence as a hernia of ≥ 2 cm as defined by 2 blinded radiologists, which is the generally accepted standard. Most groups, including us, use the definition of 2 cm of fundus above the hiatus or > 10% of the stomach. The usefulness of a strict radiologic definition in the absence of symptoms is questionable, unless it has some prognostic significance. A small radiologic recurrence in an 80-year-old patient is likely of less importance than in a 40-year-old patient, but we still do not know if it means that a patient will eventually develop a symptomatic recurrence. Based on these limitations, the most important parameters in long-term follow-up are symptoms and the need for reoperation. Symptoms can be assessed using validated questionnaires, such as the GERD-Health Related Quality of Life, which are useful in tracking outcomes. All major open transthoracic and laparoscopic series that follow the surgical principles of GPEH repair report good and durable symptom control (albeit without standardization) and a long-term reoperation rate of less than 5%. Representative studies are depicted in Table 2.,

Table 2
Outcomes after laparoscopic giant paraesophageal hernia repair

One thing that is clear is that GPEH operations, and in particular redo operations, are best done at high-volume centers. Schlottman and colleagueslooked at a cohort of 63,812 patients who underwent PEH repair; 84% in high-volume, 11.9% in intermediate-volume (6–20 per year), and 4.1% in low-volume. This did include patients who had undergone open repairs as well, but the study showed a significant increase in complications in low-volume (< 6 operations annually) and intermediate-volume (6–20 annually) hospitals as compared with the high-volume (> 20 operations annually) hospitals. They noted a "spontaneous centralization" of PEH repairs, which we believe should be encouraged. A second study reviewed 595 patients who underwent laparoscopic PEH repair and found that surgeon volume (high > 10 operations annually) was predictive of recurrence.

### Management of paraesophageal hiatus hernia: recommendations following a European expert Delphi consensus [^c4ec2022]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimal treatment of paraesophageal hiatus hernia (pHH) remains a highly debated topic in upper-gastrointestinal (UGI) surgery. Numerous aspects regarding both the diagnostic work-up and the surgical management of this clinical entity are not broadly accepted, and even experts disagree on critical components including the application of surgical meshes for hiatal reinforcement, the indication for complementary sphincter augmentation and the diagnosis and treatment of short esophagus.

Based on our own clinical experience, we hypothesized that the current surgical practice may reflect those uncertainties. Since there are no uniform recommendations from national or international societies on this topic, we found it pertinent to perform a Delphi survey among recognized experts in UGI-surgery to identify recommended strategies.

### Management of paraesophageal hernia 2025 [^9550109e]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A paraesophageal hernia (PEH) is the condition in which the fundus of the stomach protrudes through the diaphragmatic hiatus into the chest adjacent to the esophagus. Such hernias can result in serious complications such as bleeding, obstruction, ischemia, and perforation. There is considerable controversy regarding the optimal management of PEH and, in this report, we review recent publications that address this issue.

Recent Findings

After surgical repair of PEH, the rate of recurrence remains high, and recent data do not document a clear advantage for the use of a mesh for crural buttressing in preventing recurrence. There also appears to be no significant difference among different types of mesh for preventing recurrence in the long term. The optimal shape, positioning, and material for mesh remain controversial topics. Recent reports suggest benefit for performing gastropexy routinely during PEH repair, and the addition of a fundoplication does not seem to reduce rates of recurrence or gastroesophageal reflux. Promising early results have been described for new techniques of PEH repair such as the use of posterior rectus sheath fascia for hiatal augmentation, and anterior crural reconstruction.

Summary

This report summarizes the most recent data on key issues in the management of PEH such as the use of mesh, gastropexy, fundoplication, the role of age, and novel techniques for PEH repair.

Indications for Surgical Treatment of GPEH

While a sliding hiatal hernia can be managed nonoperatively in the absence of symptoms, it is less clear that GPEH can be left alone once discovered. In addition, very few patients are truly asymptomatic if they have a GPEH; they are more likely to be accustomed to symptoms than to be asymptomatic. The natural history of GPEH is ill-defined; one Finnish study showed an in-hospital mortality of 16.4% in patients with paraesophageal hernia treated with conservative therapy. Other studies endeavored to compare watchful waiting versus elective laparoscopic repair and concluded that patients would benefit more from watchful waiting. At this point, we can make some recommendations based on what we understand about GPEH. First, symptomatic GPEH warrants consideration of surgical treatment since symptoms will only worsen with time; second, a patient with a GPEH and crescendo symptoms requires surgical repair in the short term because it may portend an incarceration; third, a patient with an incarcerated or strangulated GPEH needs urgent intervention; fourth, patients with type II hiatal hernia, regardless of size, should be treated surgically whenever possible; and, fifth, patients with minimal or no symptoms should be considered for surgical repair, but with limited understanding of the natural history of untreated GPEH, we allow room for individualization and conservative management with regular follow-up. As a reflection of these heterogeneous indications for surgery, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) guideline suggests careful evaluation on an individual-case basis.

### IDEAL phase 2a results: posterior rectus sheath flap for hiatal augmentation in complex paraesophageal hernias [^641e73d7]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Design

This is a prospective single-center prospective case series of the first 27 patients who underwent posterior rectus sheath flap hiatal augmentation, PoRSHA (Table 1). Iterative modifications to the technique during this development phase (IDEAL Phase 2a) were recorded and are reported here.

TABLE 1
Patient Characteristics

Participants

From February 2021 to October 2023, patients referred to our single institution for repair of a large or recurrent PEH were considered for this novel repair approach. During this developmental period, the eligibility for this technique was considered by consensus of all co-authors. Initially, PoRSHA was only offered to patients with long-standing type IV defects or difficult revisional cases. As our experience grew, we broadened the eligibility criteria to include patients with PEH measuring > 5 cm as determined by preoperative radiologic imaging. Intraoperatively, the defect was re-evaluated along with the quality of the tissue. Ultimately, it was left to the surgeon's discretion to proceed with PoRSHA. We excluded patients who had previous alterations to their abdominal wall (prior laparotomy, current/previous abdominal wall hernias) or required emergent repair for gastric volvulus. We also excluded patients requiring therapeutic anticoagulation perioperatively or those with bleeding disorders, considering the added risk of bleeding at the donor site with exposed rectus muscle (Fig. 1 A).

All patients provided written informed consent and were informed of the novelty and early experience of this technique, and the unknown results of this procedure in addition to that of traditional reduction of the hernia and fundoplication. Patients were informed of the unknown risks of harvesting the posterior rectus sheath, which included but was not limited to the risk of abdominal wall hernia/eventration and adhesions formation or bleeding at the donor site.

### Study details | NCT05716022 | Hiatal hernia and pulmonary involvement… [^35fc6f36]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Hiatal Hernia and Pulmonary InvolvementClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Fibrosing interstitial lung diseases have significant morbidity and poor overall survival as the investigation of earlier stages of fibrosing ILDs may identify modifiable risk factors and elucidate its pathogenesis. Interstitial lung disease constitutes a group of chronic respiratory illnesses that are characterized by repetitive injury to the lung parenchyma that may progress to fibrosis. Fibrosing ILDs, which include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other ILD types, can lead to chronic respiratory failure, and poor survival, is the most common indication for lung transplantation. While antifibrotics slow disease progression and may reduce mortality, they carry side effects and are frequently poorly tolerated by patients. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify novel therapeutic targets.

Patients often present with a significant burden of fibrosis upon diagnosis as there is interest in identifying these individuals earlier in their disease course where targeted treatments and modification of risk factors may curb their progression to fulminant fibrosing ILD. Hiatal hernia and its promotion of gastroesophageal reflux have been implicated as a causal risk factor in pulmonary fibrosis. One potential modifiable risk factor is hiatal hernia and its promotion of gastroesophageal reflux. Gastric materials in the lung induce parenchymal injury and fibrosis in pre-clinical models as GER may be a vehicle of repetitive lung injury that is then followed by aberrant wound healing and eventual fibrosis. Hiatal hernia, which is the protrusion of stomach contents in the thoracic cavity, can promote GER and is more prevalent in adults with pulmonary fibrosis compared with healthy controls and other chronic lung diseases.

Further evidence comes from studies in which patients with IPF and other fibrosing ILDs demonstrated elevated levels of pepsin in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a significant component of reflux and measurable biomarker, compared with healthy controls and is associated with a higher risk of exacerbation. Much of these studies have been case-control and performed in adults with clinically-diagnosed fibrosing ILD which limits causal inferences. It has been hypothesized that fibrosis itself may promote GER due to impaired esophageal sphincter function due to reduced elasticity and more negative intrathoracic pressures. Whether hiatal hernia contributes to subclinical repetitive injury to the lung among adults without clinically-diagnosed ILD is a significant knowledge gap. Overactivation of the mononuclear phagocyte immune system may contribute to developing fibrosing ILDs and their progression.

Single-cell RNA sequencing has accelerated our understanding of fibrosing ILD by identifying biological pathways related to certain cellular populations. Using scRNA-seq, our group and others have demonstrated that overactivation of the mononuclear phagocyte system, a key component of the innate immune system, may be critical in the pathogenesis of IPF with higher populations of monocytes found in the lungs and blood of patients with fibrosis. Higher levels of the absolute monocyte count in the blood are associated with disease progression and worse survival among adults with IPF. The investigators have extended these findings to earlier stages of ILD as higher monocyte counts are associated with more ILA and its progression on CT and a lower forced vital capacity.

Fig. 3
Meta-analyses of prevalences of 30-day mortality. A) Forrest plot. 30DM rate was 3% (95% CI: 2–5%). B) Funnel plot. There was great heterogeneity (I²: 93%)

MQ of primary studies assessed using MInCir-Therapy scale, had a WA score of 8.9 ± 2.3, with only 4 articles scoring exceeding the cutoff. Using the MInCir-Pr 2 scale, the MQ was 13.4 ± 5.4, with 6 studies exceeding the cutoff. This indicates a high likelihood of inaccuracy in causal effect estimates. No statistical differences in MQ were observed between the pre-2015 and post-2015 periods (Table 5).

Finally, statistically significant improvements were observed post-2015 in patient age and reinterventions, while readmission and recurrence rates worsened. Non-significant trends suggested slight improvements in surgical time and POC, but a worsening of 30DM (Table 5).

Possible biases in the review process

Additional information was requested from the authors to expand or verify certain study data; however, no response was received. As a result, missing data may introduce bias into this review. To mitigate the risk of missing studies, cross-references were thoroughly examined.

Risk of bias between studies

There may be publication bias due to the concentration of studies originating from a few countries and limited global representation (Table 5). Finally, is important to highlight that only 4 studies for therapy and 6 on prognosis scores above the cut-off point defining acceptable MQ.

Surgical decision factors in hiatal hernia repair — Management is complex and based on multiple factors including size and type of hiatal hernia, degree of symptoms, and associated failure of symptom control by non-surgical means. Deciding whether to proceed with surgical repair of an asymptomatic hiatal hernia can be difficult, and technical decisions that may affect the outcome of hiatal hernia repair need to be considered as well. These include whether or not to use mesh or perform a fundoplication in primary hiatal hernia repair and whether a conversion to RYGB or reattempting fundoplication in patients without obesity and with recurrent hiatal hernia is most appropriate. These guidelines aim to provide recommendations on the aforementioned dilemmas.

We present a novel critical view technique that results in favorable postoperative outcomes including a reduction in recurrence and reoperation in paraesophageal hernia repairs. This technique is teachable to trainees and reproducible across multiple surgical specialties and approaches. It does not add time to the operative case and is associated with improvement in length of stay and reoperation. Standardizing a sometimes difficult paraesophageal hernia repair embattled by significant recurrence rate is always a challenge, but broad implementation of the critical view may help improve outcomes for these oftentimes complicated patients.

Hiatal hernia surgery — introduction and management controversies note that surgical management options include repair with or without mesh and with or without a fundoplication; literature on routine mesh placement is conflicting, with some studies suggesting decreased postoperative recurrence while others report similar recurrence and symptom resolution with or without mesh but increased postoperative complications and more challenging revisional surgery; most prior studies were retrospective with selection bias and existing randomized controlled trials are limited by small sample sizes and short follow up; proposed strategies for recurrence include redo repair or conversion to a Roux-en-Y reconstruction, which proponents recommend for patients with obesity and bariatric indications, though it is unclear whether conversion should be chosen for patients without obesity; for incidentally detected asymptomatic hiatal hernia, some now advocate observation until symptoms occur, and previous Society of the American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) guidelines could make only a weak recommendation to repair a completely asymptomatic hiatal hernia.

SAGES Guidelines for the Surgical Treatment of Hiatal Hernias — an expert panel convened to develop evidence-based recommendations for adults with hiatal hernia (HH) after systematic reviews addressing four key questions: surgical treatment of asymptomatic HH versus surveillance; use of mesh versus no mesh; performing a fundoplication versus no fundoplication; and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus redo fundoplication for recurrent HH. Recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology and expert opinion was utilized when evidence was insufficient. The panel provided one conditional recommendation and two expert opinions for adults with HH, and the panel suggested routinely performing a fundoplication in the repair of HH, though this was based on low certainty evidence.

Guideline methods and scope — The statements included in this guideline are the product of a systematic review of published literature on the topic, and the recommendations are explicitly linked to the supporting evidence. The strengths and weaknesses of the available evidence are highlighted, and expert opinion was sought where the evidence is lacking. This is a complement to the previous guidelines on this topic, last revised in 2013, and the guideline panel utilized the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach to determine the certainty of the underlying evidence and the strength and direction of recommendations. Given that a patient-surgeon perspective was taken, and not a population perspective, considerations such as resources required, certainty of evidence of required resources, cost effectiveness, and equity were not evaluated.

Obesity and Paraesophageal Hernias

For patients with a body mass index (BMI) in the 30 to 35 range, we recommend weight loss as an initial step to prevent greater recurrence rates. In patients with BMI > 35, we refer the patients for evaluation for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operations. Sleeve resections can lead to lower lower-esophageal sphincter pressures and greater intragastric pressures, leading to new reflux after surgery. The 5-year incidence of symptomatic GERD after sleeve resection ranges from 18% to 31%. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass seems to be a better operation in this context, with significant improvements in GERD-related symptoms in multiple studies. For patients with a BMI ≥ 35 who do not undergo gastric bypass, we perform a repair preferably without Nissen fundoplication.

Table 3
Comparison of demographic parameters, risk factors, and surgery-related parameters between axial and paraesophageal hiatal hernia types

On overall assessment of the intraoperative complication rates no difference was detected between the axial (type I) and paraesophageal hiatal hernias (types II–IV) (Table 4). However, organ injuries were seen significantly more often with paraesophageal hiatal hernias (types II–IV) (3.7 vs 2.3%; p = 0.033).

Table 4
Comparison of intraoperative, postoperative, and general complications and 1-year follow-up outcome between axial and paraesophageal hiatal hernia types

As regards the postoperative surgical complications, no significant difference was detected between the axial (type I) and paraesophageal hiatal hernias (types II–IV). However, more complication-related reoperations (Clavien–Dindo classification grade III) were noted for paraesophageal compared with axial hernias (2.1 vs 1.1%; p = 0.032) (Table 4). The main reasons for this were esophageal and gastric injuries, secondary bleeding, and abscesses.

For the general postoperative complications, a highly significant difference to the disadvantage of the paraesophageal hernias (types II–IV) was detected at 6.0 vs 3.0% (p < 0.001) (Table 4). Since one-year follow-up was a precondition for patient selection, analysis did not take account of deaths. In the hiatal hernia operation group up to 1 September, 2015, including among patients without one-year follow-up (n = 1.086) (Fig. 1), one death occurred in the axial (type I) hiatal hernia group (one out of 2792; 0.04%) and three deaths in the paraesophageal (types II–IV) group (three out of 1.333; 0.22%).

On one-year follow-up, no significant difference was identified in the recurrence rate or in the rates of pain at rest, on exertion or requiring treatment (Table 4). An additional analysis of patient outcome in relation to the individual hospital's case load showed no significant differences for a case load of 1–49, 50–99, and ≥ 100 (Table 5).

### Minimally invasive laparoscopic and robot-assisted emergency treatment of strangulated giant hiatal hernias: report of five cases and literature review [^00090f0a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The robotic-assisted approach in acute paraesophageal hernia repair may give advantages compared to conventional laparoscopy, for what concerns the surgeon's comfort and precision, and this is probably unique in emergency surgery. However, its use mainly depends on device availability and the surgical team's experience.

We can conclude, on the basis of current literature, that it is challenging to stigmatise recommendations for the management of GHH in an emergency setting. In many cases, a minimally invasive approach is possible and safe, with good peri- and postoperative outcomes. Robotic surgery may represent an appealing option to ease some surgical steps as dissection, abdominal reduction and suturing.

### Management of complicated diaphragmatic hernia in the acute setting: a WSES position paper [^8e6658a5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The treatment of non-traumatic diaphragmatic hernia is similar to traumatic diaphragmatic hernia.

Surgery is the treatment of choice for this condition.

Primary repair for the diaphragmatic defects with non-absorbable sutures should always be attempted when possible.

However, the treatment of TDH surgeons is reluctant in the use of mesh in the emergency setting due to the risk of infectious complications. In clean-contaminated and contaminated diaphragmatic hernia repair, biologic or most recent biosynthetic meshes can be safely used.

Several papers advice that the mesh overlaps the defect edge by 1.5–2.5 cm. When tension-free primary closures are difficult, for defects larger than 8 cm or an area of more than 20 cm², the interposition of a graft can be used successfully. Mesh can be fixed using tackers or transfascial sutures. Tackers should be avoided in proximity of the pericardium because of the risk or cardiac complications

Minimally invasive abdominal approach can be performed with an excellent safety profile and a reported overall in-hospital mortality rate of 0.14%. Several studies showed similar outcomes in terms of perioperative morbidity and mortality in both laparotomy and minimally invasive approach. In right diaphragmatic hernia, due to the presence of the liver, the diaphragmatic repair can be difficult and a combined or a thoracic approach may be necessary.

The incidence of gastroesophageal reflux after repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is high reaching up to 62%. Accordingly, fundoplication should be performed during congenital hernia. Several studies have reported the role of fundoplication during repair of a sliding hiatal hernia but not for diaphragmatic hernias to manage the associated gastroesophageal reflux. Factors affecting the surgical procedure selection include the history of gastroesophageal reflux, the need to repair a large defect repair, a paraesophageal hernia, or a congenital hernia. In case of gastric volvulus with diaphragmatic hernia gastropexy after detorsion of the volvulus, reduction of herniated structures and repair of the diaphragmatic defect has been successful.

A Collis procedure or gastric resection is required in selected cases, determined by the gastric condition and should be tailored case by case. Nissen fundoplication is the most common technique performed. Nissen fundoplication and Toupet fundoplication have similar effects on restoration of the mechanical gastroesophageal barrier against gastric reflux. Few papers reported that recurrence rate in Toupet fundoplication is lower compared with Nissen fundoplication.

### What are the differences in the outcome of laparoscopic axial (I) versus paraesophageal (II-IV) hiatal hernia repair? [^472f5254]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Multivariable analysis did not find any evidence that the use of a mesh or other factors had a significant influence on the recurrence rate on one-year follow-up. That concords with the meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials with 406 patients by Memom et al. It can only be speculated whether the significantly more frequent use of meshes for types II–IV hiatal hernias with highly significantly larger hiatal defects had led to a non-significant difference in the recurrence rate. In less than 1% of cases, only a mesh and no suture was used for hiatal closure, as reported in the literature. That practice is not recommended in the guidelines.

There was no significant difference in the rates of pain at rest, pain on exertion, or pain requiring treatment on one-year follow-up between the patients after laparoscopic repair of axial (type I) vs paraesophageal (types II–IV) hiatal hernia.

Multivariable analysis demonstrates that the risk of pain at rest and pain requiring treatment was higher in the presence of risk factors, and was lower among men and in patients with higher BMI.

In summary, patients with elective laparoscopic repair of primary paraesophageal (types II–IV) vs axial (type I) hiatal hernia were found to have a significantly higher risk of general postoperative complications because of higher age and higher ASA score as well as the higher proportion of patients with at least one risk factor. Reflecting the greater complexity of laparoscopic paraesophageal (types II–IV) hiatal hernia repair procedures, there is greater likelihood of significantly more intraoperative organ injuries and postoperative complication-related reoperations. Accordingly, laparoscopic procedures for repair of paraesophageal (types II–IV) hiatal hernias should only be undertaken by experienced surgeons. Because of the higher risk of general postoperative complications, corresponding intensive medicine resources are needed.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) treatment recommendation — adult patients: The panel suggests that adult patients with GERD may be treated with either MSA or Nissen fundoplication based on surgeon and patient shared decision making. The recommendation is described as a Conditional recommendation based on very low certainty of evidence. From 74 studies included in the systematic review, nine short term observational studies were included for the panel discussion to form the final recommendation, and there was no informative data for hiatal hernia recurrence, objective reflux recurrence, and peri-operative mortality. The Expert Panel noted that the evidence was based on short term, observational studies.

### Management of symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recurrent hiatal hernia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c3d217e1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Hiatal hernia management — systematic review conclusions state that mesh placement during primary repair results in fewer early recurrences but does not impact late recurrences, complications, or post operative symptoms, and that fundoplication during hiatal hernia repair increases early dysphagia but decreases post operative reflux without reducing symptomatic recurrence risk. For asymptomatic disease, caution should be exercised when deciding between surgery and observation, evidence for the superiority of one over another is severely lacking, and clinicians should continue to engage patients in shared decision making. For recurrent hiatal hernia in patients without obesity, it remains unclear which surgical option is the best, and because all outcomes were comparable across both groups except late reintervention, clinicians should rely on their own expertise and comfort levels when deciding on the procedure. More research is required to determine the best strategy for managing asymptomatic and recurrent hiatal hernias.

### Management of paraesophageal hiatus hernia: recommendations following a European expert Delphi consensus [^4e6f409a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Delphi survey

To minimize bias, the focus was strictly on elective (planned) repair of non-revisional pHH; other hernia types, emergencies and recurrences were considered outside the scope of this work. PHH was defined as Skinner type II (true paraesophageal), type III (mixed sliding/axial and paraesophageal), and type IV (paraesophageal and herniation of other abdominal organs). The lead authors designed a 33-question survey to elicit respondent feedback on the following parameters: personal and institutional experience, diagnostic work-up, indications, technical details of hiatal repair (access routes, surgical dissection and reconstruction), and postoperative follow-up (Online Appendix 1). An online survey tool (SurveyMonkey, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was employed to disseminate the survey and to collect answers. In May 2021, experts were invited to participate via an email containing the study protocol, the expected number of Delphi rounds, and the anticipated time commitment. After agreeing to participate, experts were provided with access to each Delphi round via secure, institute-to-institute email. The attendees were also invited to leave comments on each question and to suggest changes to the wording. Throughout the Delphi survey, voting and commenting was conducted anonymously.

In both Delphi rounds, participants were asked to rank their agreement on each question using a 5-point Likert scale. Two scale variations were employed, the first indicated level of recommendation (1 = strongly recommended, 2 = recommended, 3 = neither recommended nor discouraged, 4 = discouraged, 5 = strongly discouraged) whilst the second informed the consent with which technical steps are performed by the participant (1 = a great deal, 2 = considerably, 3 = moderately, 4 = slightly, 5 = not at all).

After completion of Delphi round 1, the lead authors adapted the results according to the expert's suggestions to create the next questionnaire. In Delphi round 2, the percentage of concordance ("strongly recommended" or "recommended" and "a great deal" or "considerably") from the preceding round were visible, enabling experts to re-vote in consideration of previous results (Online Appendix 2).

Experts were given two weeks to complete each round. Two reminders were sent, the first one week after opening and the second two days before closing of each round. Data collection took place from May 2021 to September 2021.

Central Message

Careful, evidence-based selection of adjunct techniques, particularly fundoplication, gastropexy, and Collis gastroplasty, is key to reducing recurrence rates in laparoscopic repair of GPEH.

See Article page.

Herein, Alicuben and colleaguesdescribe their experience with repair of giant paraesophageal hernia (GPEH) and provide 10 key steps of their surgical technique. The authors continue to refine their approach since their first report in 2000, summarizing the overarching principles of the procedure to optimize outcomes for operative repair of GPEH. Specifically, the authors advocate 3 key principles: (1) aggressive mediastinal mobilization, (2) assessment of esophageal length, and (3) preservation of the crural lining. Low recurrence rate and optimal outcomes are also attributed to "careful selection" of adjunct techniques, such as fundoplication, gastropexy, and gastroplasty.

Alicuben and colleaguesperform fundoplication to prevent reflux. However, the decision to routinely provide a fundoplication remains debatable. Recent work evaluating the physiologic impact of hernia repair suggests that the vast majority of the antireflux mechanism is accomplished by the crural closure, rather than by the fundoplication. This indicates that fundoplication may not be routinely needed if gastroesophageal reflux disease is not a presenting symptom or if fundoplication does not decrease recurrence rate compared with primary repair alone. When fundoplication is selected, many surgeons prefer a total fundoplication. However, evidence does not suggest an advantage among fundoplication types in reflux and dysphagia prevention, and preoperative manometry in the setting of a large hernia is notoriously inaccurate. Therefore, it may be prudent to select fundoplication as an adjunctive technique less frequently, particularly in those with obstructive symptoms, as Alicuben and colleaguesrecommend.

### Paraesophageal hernia [^edabe0f7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The treatment of PEHs is challenging. They tend to occur in patients in their 60s and 70s with multiple medical problems and a variety of associated symptoms. Detailed preoperative evaluation is crucial to determining a safe and effective strategy for repair in the operating room. Laparoscopic PEH repair has shown to be advantageous compared with conventional open repair with regard to hospital stay, recovery time, and decreased complications. Although some results indicate there are higher recurrence rates in laparoscopic PEH repair, the clinical significance of these recurrences has not yet been determined. In order to maximize the efficacy of this procedure, modifications have emerged, such as performing a fundoplication and using an absorbable mesh onlay to reinforce the cruroplasty. Althoughmoreprospective, randomized studies are needed to support the superior results of these surgical adjuncts, laparoscopic PEH repair with an antireflux procedure and absorbable mesh should be the current standard of care.

### Anterior gastropexy may reduce the recurrence rate after laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair [^56f60b26]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although laparoscopic repair of type 3 paraesophageal hernias is safe and results in symptomatic relief, recent data have questioned the anatomic integrity of the laparoscopic approach. The reports document an asymptomatic recurrence rate as high as 42% with radiologic follow-up evaluation for type 3 paraesophageal hernias repaired laparoscopically. This disturbingly high recurrence rate has prompted the addition of an anterior gastropexy to our standard laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair.

Methods

A prospective series of 28 patients underwent laparoscopic repair of large type 3 hiatal hernias between July 2000 and January 2002 at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation by one surgeon. All the patients underwent reduction of the hernia, sac excision, crural repair, antireflux procedure, and anterior gastropexy. They all had a video esophagram 24 h after surgery, then at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits and annually thereafter. Symptomatic outcomes were assessed with a standard questionnaire at each follow-up visit.

Results

In this study, 21 women and 7 men with a mean age of 67 years (range, 35–82 years) underwent successful laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair. The mean operative time was 146 min (range, 101–186 min), and the average blood loss was 71 mL (range, 10–200 ml). One intraoperative complication occurred: A small esophageal mucosal tear occurred during esophageal dissection and was repaired laparoscopically. At 24 h, upper gastrointestinal examination identified no leaks. At this writing, all the patients have undergone video esophagram at a 3-month follow-up visit. All were asymptomatic and all examinations were normal. Of the 28 patients, 27 have undergone follow-up assessment at 6 months. At this writing, all the patients have undergone video esophagram at 3, 6, and 12 months follow up visits. All were asymptomatic and all examinations were normal. Ten patients have completed 2 year follow up barium swallows with no recurrences.

Conclusions

With up to 2 years of follow-up evaluation, the addition of an anterior gastropexy to the laparoscopic repair of type 3 hiatal hernias resulted in no recurrences. These encouraging results necessitate further follow-up evaluation to document the long-term effects of anterior gastropexy in reducing postoperative recurrence after laparoscopic repair of paraesophageal hernias.

### Anterior gastropexy for paraesophageal hernia repair: a randomized clinical trial [^ae7dc18d]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Paraesophageal hernias can cause severe limitations in quality of life and life-threatening complications. Even though minimally invasive paraesophageal hernia repair (MIS-PEHR) is safe and effective, anatomic recurrence rates remain notoriously high. Retrospective data suggest that suturing the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall after repair-an anterior gastropexy-may reduce recurrence, but this adjunct is currently not the standard of care.

Objective

To determine whether anterior gastropexy reduces 1-year recurrence after MIS-PEHR.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This registry-based randomized clinical trial was conducted by 10 surgeons at 3 academic hospitals within the Cleveland Clinic Enterprise. Between June 26, 2019, and July 24, 2023, 348 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 240 patients were enrolled and randomized. Statistical analysis was performed from January to March 2024.

Intervention

Enrolled patients were randomized to and received either an anterior gastropexy (n = 119) or no anterior gastropexy (n = 121).

Main Outcome

The primary outcome was recurrence as determined by reherniation of the stomach greater than 2 cm above the diaphragm on routine imaging at 1 year or reoperation. Secondary outcomes included quality of life as measured by the Gastroesophageal Reflux Health-Related Quality of Life survey, additional foregut symptom questionnaire, and patient satisfaction at 30 days and 1 year.

Results

A total of 240 patients were randomized to either anterior gastropexy (n = 119; 104 [97%] women; median [IQR] age, 70 [64–75] years) or no anterior gastropexy (n = 121; 97 [80%] women; median [IQR] age, 68 [62–73] years) at the end of their MIS-PEHR. At 1 year, 188 patients (78%) had completed follow-up. By intention-to-treat analysis, 1-year recurrence was significantly lower in patients who received an anterior gastropexy (15% vs 36%; risk difference, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.09–0.33]), which remained significant after risk-adjusted regression analysis (hazard ratio, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.23–0.60]). Of 13 reoperations (5.4%) for recurrence in the first year, 3 (2.5%) were in the anterior gastropexy group and 10 (8.2%) were in the no-gastropexy group (P = 0.052). Two patients (1.7%) had their anterior gastropexy sutures removed for pain. There were no significant differences in quality-of-life outcomes at 30 days and 1 year between treatment groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found that the addition of an anterior gastropexy to MIS-PEHR is superior to no gastropexy in regard to reducing 1-year paraesophageal hernia recurrence. These results suggest that an anterior gastropexy should be routinely used in the context of minimally invasive paraesophageal hernia repair.

### Giant paraesophageal hernia: what do we really know? [^8970a07a]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

The Role of Fundoplication in Repair of a GPEH

The role of fundoplication in patients with GPEH is not entirely clear. We know there is a link between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hiatal hernia, but not whether a fundoplication should be performed on every patient with a GPEH. A randomized controlled trial evaluated the addition of a Nissen fundoplication to a PEH repair. While there was some benefit to a fundoplication with respect to postoperative reflux symptoms, it is not clear how many patients had GPEH. Further, all 40 patients had a mesh repair, with a circular polypropylene mesh and were randomized to a cardiophrenicopexy or fundoplication, fashioned over a 56-Fr bougie with no routine division of the short gastric arteries. This was a small study, and the generalizability is unclear. There are several nuances when considering the need for a fundoplication. We generally perform a fundoplication in younger patients (< 70 years) and patients with heartburn and regurgitation. A fundoplication in elderly patients and in patients who complain mainly of dysphagia is possibly not necessary, but we do not have data to guide us with that decision. We tend to avoid fundoplication in patients with morbid obesity, because hernia recurrence appears to be greater in this population. In addition, a herniated Nissen fundoplication generally causes severe dysphagia and pain and often requires reoperation.

### Intrathoracic drainage of a perforated prepyloric gastric ulcer with a type II paraoesophageal hernia [^a06bc8f7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

Type II paraesophageal hernias are an uncommon diagnosis and occur in less than 5% of all hiatal hernias. The etiology is still unclear but previous surgical interventions, such as antireflux procedures or partial gastrectomies, have been recognized as a known risk factor. Due to progressive enlargement of the phrenoesophageal membrane, the greater curvature of the stomach tends to roll up into the thorax. Eventually, the whole stomach herniates, forming an upside-down intrathoracic stomach.

Most patients with a type II hernia are asymptomatic or have mild gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and are diagnosed during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The most important complications are gastric volvulus or bleeding from gastric ulcerations or erosions (Cameron lesions). The gold standard for gastric voluvus is open laparotomy with detorsion and anterior gastropexy, with or without a Nissen fundoplication.

Cameron lesions are linear gastric ulcers or erosions on the mucosal folds at the diaphragmatic impression in patients with a large hiatal herniam. Unlike the pre-pyloric ulcer in this case, Cameron ulcers are located on the lesser curvature of the stomach. Treatment is primarily medical with acid suppressants and prokinetic agents.

To our knowledge only 5 case reports have been published reporting perforated gastric ulcers in combination with a paraesophageal hernia and just 2 cases reporting a perforated duodenal ulcer. Normally, once a paraesophageal hernia is identified, it should be treated surgically with reduction of the herniated stomach with gastropexy to prevent reherniation and herniorraphy (or prosthetic mesh) of the diaphragma. Debate exists whether or not an antireflux procedure is necessary. In this case no herniorraphy or mesh repair was carried out due to the anticipated high risk of infection and abscess formation. In the author's opinion risk of complications due to additional procedures should be avoided in view of the known high mortality of a perforated gastric ulcer in combination with a type II hiatus hernia.

Hiatal hernia repair — fundoplication counseling: Use of fundoplication during hiatal hernia repair should be tailored to individual patient needs, desires, and presenting symptoms, and those who undergo a fundoplication should be warned that even though risk of reflux is lower, the risk of early dysphagia is higher, with no real difference in symptomatic recurrence of the hernia itself; patients would benefit from a thorough discussion about the trade-off between one symptom and another.

### Restoration of normal anatomy without fundoplication in non-elective incarcerated giant paraesophageal hernia repair [^9dfe8a01]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

In comparison to other operative strategies for patients presenting urgently with giant incarcerated paraesophageal hernia, our technique is not a simple gastropexy. In some series, stomach reduction and securing to the anterior abdominal wall are described with sutures or feeding tubes. While this may prevent catastrophic gastric ischemic events, this approach does not address the large hernia and will most likely recur in the long term. As part of our technique, the hernia is completely addressed with complete sac reduction and mediastinal mobilization. The crura are repaired primarily similar to our approach in anti-reflux surgery. The major deviation from historical norms comes in the gastric portion of the procedure. Following the guiding principle of restoring normal anatomy to the greatest extent possible, the short gastric line is sutured to the hemidiaphragm as posterior as possible to simulate the lie of stomach, as if the gastrosplenic ligament was intact, while preventing stomach migration into the chest. Additionally, recreation of the Angle of His and phrenoesophageal ligament restore the normal configuration of stomach and gastroesophageal junction.

Consistent with society guidelines, an anti-reflux procedure is still considered a standard component of hiatal hernia repair. Despite this, multiple studies have examined the effect of not performing fundoplication at time of hiatal hernia repair. In general, these groups have concluded that patients without fundoplication have an increased risk for developing post-operative reflux. However, an important difference between those patient groups and those included in this study is the predominant symptomatology being addressed with surgery. While most patients in previous studies presented with reflux and therefore the operative goal was controlling reflux symptoms, patients in our study did not have significant reflux pre-operatively and it was their obstructive symptoms that were being treated. Each patient underwent careful and detailed evaluation to determine the predominant presenting symptoms and if these were obstructive and not reflux, restoration of normal anatomy was performed. This concept was tested by Hoffman et al. who reported on performing fundopexy instead of fundoplication during hiatal hernia repair in patients presenting with dysphagia as a primary complaint. At a median follow-up of 19.7 months, more than 90% of patients denied any heartburn or regurgitation. Importantly, if a patient presents to our institution with a large paraesophageal hernia with predominantly reflux symptoms, we still perform repair with fundoplication.

### Long-term outcome and quality of life after laparoscopic treatment of large paraesophageal hernia [^1b37aba1]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopy has been widely used for surgical repair of large paraesophageal hernias (PEHs). The technique, however, entails substantial technical difficulties, such as repositioning the stomach in the abdominal cavity, sac excision, closure of the hiatal gap, and fundoplication. Knowledge of the long-term outcome (> 10 years) is scarce. The aim of this article was to evaluate the long-term results of this approach, primarily the anatomic hernia recurrence rate and the impact of the repair on quality of life.

Methods

We identified all patients who underwent laparoscopic repair for PEH between November 1997 and March 2007 and who had a minimum follow-up of 48 months. In March 2011, all available patients were scheduled for an interview, and a radiologic examination with barium swallow was performed. During the interview the patients were asked about the existence/persistence of symptoms. An objective score test, the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI), was also administered.

Results

A total of 77 patients were identified: 17 men (22%) and 60 women (78%). The mean age at the time of fundoplication was 64 years (range 24–87 years) and at the review time 73 years (range 34–96 years). The amount of stomach contained within the PEH sac was < 50% in 39 patients (50%), > 50% in 31 (40%), and 100% (intrathoracic stomach) in 7 (9.5%). A 360º PTFe mesh was used to reinforce the repair in six cases and a polyethylene mesh in three. In May 2011, 55 of the 77 patients were available for interview (71%), and the mean follow-up was 107 months (range 48–160 months). Altogether, 43 patients (66%) were asymptomatic, and 12 (21%) reported symptoms that included dysphagia in 7 patients, heartburn in 3, belching in 1, and chest pain in 1. Esophagography in 43 patients (78%) revealed recurrence in 20 (46%). All recurrences were small sliding hernias (< 3 cm long). In all, 37 patients (67%) answered the GIQLI questionnaire. The mean GIQLI score was 111 (range 59–137; normal 147). Patients with objective anatomic recurrence had a quality of life index of 110 (range 89–132) versus 122 in the nonrecurrent hernia group (range 77–138, p < 0.01). Mesh was used to buttress the esophageal hiatus in nine patients. One patient died during the follow-up period. Five of the remaining eight patients (62%) developed dysphagia, a mesh-related symptom. Three patients required reoperation because of mesh-related complications. Esophagography revealed recurrence in four (50%) of the eight patients. GIQLI scores were similar in patients with recurrence (126, range 134–119) and without it (111, range 133–186) (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Long-term follow-up (up to 160 months) in our study showed that laparoscopic PEH repair is clinically efficacious but is associated with small anatomic recurrences in ≤ 50% of patients. Further studies are needed to identify the anatomic, pathologic, and physiological factors that may impair outcome, allowing the procedure to be tailored to each patient.

### Urgent laparoscopic repair of acutely symptomatic PEH is safe and effective [^da45439d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute incarceration of paraesophageal hernias (PEHs) requiring urgent or emergent surgery is rare. Patients are often elderly with significant comorbidities and have historically been treated with open abdominal or thoracic incisions. Our study was designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair (LPEHR) in patients with PEH and acute gastric volvulus.

Methods

We reviewed our prospectively maintained database and identified 269 patients who underwent an initial LPEHR between January 2003 and January 2012. Patients were divided into group A (acute), group B (age- and comorbidity-matched 1:3), and group C (all elective repairs). Group A included those admitted with acute symptoms related to PEH and underwent urgent repair. Patient age, Charlson score, operative time, length of stay (LOS), morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rates were compared.

Results

Patients who underwent urgent LPEHR had a higher perioperative morbidity rate than the elective and matched groups. The overall mortality rate was low and no statistical difference was found between groups A, B, and C. LOS in group A was longer than groups B and C. The need for ICU admission was also higher in group A. There was no statistical difference in recurrence rates.

Conclusions

Historically, patients presenting with acute symptoms related to PEH have required open repair, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The acute group was older and sicker than our elective LPEHR patients and had more adverse events resulting in a longer LOS, even when compared with comorbidity-matched elective patients. However, the LOS remained shorter than that reported for open repair and there was no mortality. The recurrence rates in all groups were low and comparable to elective repairs.

### Simultaneous paraesophageal hernia repair and gastric banding [^2b06b86b]. Obesity Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The presence of a hiatal hernia is generally considered a contraindication to gastric banding in the morbidly obese, despite recent reports indicating favorable outcomes following simultaneous repair of sliding hernias and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). A 66-year-old woman weighing 120 kg (BMI 45) with arterial hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease underwent repair of a large paraesophageal hernia and LAGB. At 40 months followup, the patient had lost 44% excess body weight (BMI 36) and had no complaints of heartburn, regurgitation or dysphagia. She was no longer hypertensive and her pulmonary condition had improved significantly. Barium swallow at 30 months showed normal anatomy and positioning of the band. Because other minimally traumatic surgical options are lacking, the author believes morbidly obese patients with hiatal hernia should not be denied the advantages of LAGB. Adequate weight reduction, resolution of gastroesophageal reflux and other co-morbidities can be expected if an appropriate surgical technique is used.

### Treatment of morbid obesity and hiatal paraesophageal hernia by laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^acab6d99]. Obesity Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Obesity has been proven to be a significant independent risk factor for hiatal hernia. In morbidly obese patients, the usual techniques to improve gastroesophageal reflux after hiatal hernia repair could have poorer outcomes than in the general population. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) has been demonstrated to be an effective procedure in controlling symptoms and complications of gastroesophageal reflux in these patients. Therefore, LRYGBP is one of the most frequent procedures performed in bariatric surgery. The authors report a case of a 41-year-old man with a body mass index (BMI) of 44.6 kg/m² who was diagnosed with giant type III hiatal hernia. A laparoscopic approach for both hiatal hernia repair and LRYGBP was performed. At 6 months follow-up, the patient has lost 30% of excess body weight (BMI 34.4), and there is no evidence of recurrence of the esophageal hernia.

### Laparoscopic repair of giant paraesophageal hernia: are there factors associated with anatomic recurrence? [^6be08d9e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Repair of giant paraesophageal hernia (PEH) is associated with a favorably high rate of symptom improvement; however, rates of recurrence by objective measures remain high. Herein we analyze our experience with laparoscopic giant PEH repair to determine what factors if any can predict anatomic recurrence.

Methods

We prospectively collected data on PEH characteristics, variations in operative techniques, and surgeon factors for 595 patients undergoing laparoscopic PEH repair from 2008 to 2015. Upper GI study was performed at 6 months postoperatively and selectively thereafter-any supra-diaphragmatic stomach was considered hiatal hernia recurrence. Exclusion criteria included revisional operation (22.4%), size < 5 cm (17.6%), inadequate follow-up (17.8%), and confounding concurrent operations (6.9%). Inclusion criteria were met by 202 patients (31% male, median age 71 years, and median BMI 28.7).

Results

At a median follow-up of 6 months (IQR 6–12), overall anatomic recurrence rate was 34.2%. Symptom recurrence rate was 9.9% and revisional operation was required in ten patients (4.9%). Neither patient demographics nor PEH characteristics (size, presence of Cameron erosions, esophagitis, or Barrett's) correlated with anatomic recurrence. Technical factors at operation (mobilized intra-abdominal length of esophagus, Collis gastroplasty, number of anterior/posterior stitches, use of crural buttress, use of pledgeted or mattress sutures, or gastrostomy) were also not correlated with recurrence. Regarding surgeon factors, annual volume of fewer than ten cases per year was associated with increased risk of anatomic failure (54 vs 33%, P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis identified surgeon experience (< 10 cases per year) as an independent factor associated with early hiatal hernia recurrence (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.34–10.9).

Conclusions

Laparoscopic repair of giant PEH is associated with high anatomic recurrence rate but excellent symptom control. PEH characteristics and technical operative variables do not appear to significantly affect rates of recurrence. In contrast, surgeon volume does appear to contribute significantly to durability of repair.

Four patients (80%) underwent Nissen and Toupet fundoplication: each in two cases, respectively. The choice between the two techniques depended on the obtainment of a floppy gastric valve. In case 2, because of the known ischemia of the gastric mucosa and the evidence of ischemic gastric serosa during the abdominal exploration, an intra-operative endoscopy was requested after the hernia reduction to check for the antrum and pylorus mucosa. After the careful evaluation of the whole stomach blood supply, we avoided gastric resection and fundoplication. In most of the cases (60%), a gastrostomy (cases 2, 3 and 4) secured the stomach to the abdominal wall. Case 5 underwent a gastropexy. The mean operative time was 192 ± 22.8 min.

The postoperative course was uneventful for most of the cases (80%). In case 2, the gastric mucosa ischemia and the difficult intubation led to a 5-day course in the intensive care unit, where the patient was monitored for the gastric perforation risk. The same patient developed antrum stenosis that healed after endoscopic treatment. The mean hospital stay was 9.2 ± 6.9 days (range 4–21).

Follow-up was carried out for a minimum of 6 months, with contrast X-ray of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Patients reported no complications or recurrences, and, when present, gastrostomy tubes were removed after 1 month from the operation.

### SAGES guidelines for the surgical treatment of hiatal hernias [^e804a56e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hiatal hernia (HH) is a common condition. A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations to support clinicians, patients, and others in decisions regarding the treatment of HH.

Methods

Systematic reviews were conducted for four key questions regarding the treatment of HH in adults: surgical treatment of asymptomatic HH versus surveillance; use of mesh versus no mesh; performing a fundoplication versus no fundoplication; and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) versus redo fundoplication for recurrent HH. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology by subject experts. When the evidence was insufficient to base recommendations on, expert opinion was utilized instead. Recommendations for future research were also proposed.

Results

The panel provided one conditional recommendation and two expert opinions for adults with HH. The panel suggested routinely performing a fundoplication in the repair of HH, though this was based on low certainty evidence. There was insufficient evidence to make evidence-based recommendations regarding surgical repair of asymptomatic HH or conversion to RYGB in recurrent HH, and therefore, only expert opinions were offered. The panel suggested that select asymptomatic patients may be offered surgical repair, with criteria outlined. Similarly, it suggested that conversion to RYGB for management of recurrent HH may be appropriate in certain patients and again described criteria. The evidence for the routine use of mesh in HH repair was equivocal and the panel deferred making a recommendation.

Conclusions

These recommendations should provide guidance regarding surgical decision-making in the treatment of HH and highlight the importance of shared decision-making and consideration of patient values to optimize outcomes. Pursuing the identified research needs will improve the evidence base and may allow for stronger recommendations in future evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of HH.

### The importance of age on short-term outcomes associated with repair of giant paraesophageal hernias [^27c88d56]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Older patients have an increased incidence of paraesophageal hernia (PEH) and can be denied surgical assessment due to the perception of increased complications and mortality. This study examines the influence of age and comorbidities on early complications and other short-term outcomes of PEH repair.

Methods

From 2000 to 2016, data of surgically treated patients with PEH were prospectively recorded in an Institutional Review Board-approved database. Only patients whose hernia involved over 50% of the stomach were included. Patients were stratified by age (< 70, 70 to 79, ≥ 80 years of age) and compared in univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

Overall, 524 patients underwent surgical PEH repair (< 70: 261 [50%]; 70 to 79: 163 [31%]; ≥ 80: 100 [19%]). Patients greater than or equal to 80 years of age had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists class, more comorbidities, larger hernias, and higher incidences of type IV PEH and acute presentation. Patients greater than or equal to 80 years of age had more postoperative complications, but not higher grade complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ IIIa). Median length of stay was 1 day longer for patients greater than or equal to 80 years of age (5 days versus 4 days for patients < 70 and 70 to 79 years of age, respectively). Objective, radiologic hernia recurrence at 4.3 months postoperation was 17.3% and was not increased in the greater than or equal to 80 years of age group. After adjustment for comorbidities and other factors, age greater than or equal to 80 years was not a significant factor in predicting severe complications, readmission within 30 days, or early recurrence.

Conclusions

PEH repair is safe in physiologically stable patients, irrespective of age. Incidence of complications is higher in older patients, but complication severity and mortality are similar to those of younger patients. Patients with giant PEH should be given the opportunity to review treatments options with an experienced surgeon.

### Commentary: are we wrapping up the debate on repair of giant paraesophageal hernia? [^f730fa37]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Regardless of symptomatology, anterior gastropexy may reduce recurrence rate, and thus may be an important consideration for all patients. In addition, for patients at high operative risk due to severe medical comorbidities, gastropexy alone may be a reasonable alternative to formal GPEH repair. Thus, we should consider how gastropexy is used to reduce recurrence rate of GPEH repair for all patients, remembering that not all gastropexy techniques are equal.

The authors suggest wedge-type Collis gastroplasty for patients with a foreshortened esophagus. This choice aligns with earlier reports of gastroplasty in GPEH repair. However, esophageal shortening has been attributed to the stomach pushing the esophagus into the chest, rather than to chronic reflux esophagitis, scarring, or pulling of the stomach into the chest. Regardless, gastroplasty should be uncommonly required if repair focuses on correcting the anatomy of the gastroesophageal junction and mediastinal mobilization allows appropriate abdominal esophageal length.

Alicuben and colleaguesdescribe their standard practice to complete fundoplication before cruraplasty, although many surgeons tend to perform cruraplasty first to estimate esophageal length. The authors also describe their method of creating a floppy diaphragm in reapproximation of the crura by inducing a carbon dioxide pneumothorax. Evidence does not yet exist for the implication of this technique on recurrence, but it does provide significant tension release during crural closure. An alternative method, the diaphragm-relaxing incision, has been associated with low recurrence rate, but can also be associated with an alternative site of diaphragmatic weakness. In summary, Alicuben and colleaguescarefully detail the steps of their operative technique as well as their considerations in choosing adjunct procedures to optimize outcomes for patients suffering with GPEH.
