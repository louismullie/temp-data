## Question

Rotator cuff surgery when to admit overnight

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to admit a patient overnight after rotator cuff repair surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline default, which is outpatient care for most patients. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence on risk factors that predict unplanned admission or complications. Next, I will synthesize a practical, hierarchical decision framework for overnight admission. After that, I should consider anesthesia and analgesia strategies that mitigate admission risk. Finally, I will double-check special populations and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary anchored to the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: most rotator cuff repairs are performed as outpatient procedures, and contemporary data show low rates of serious adverse events and readmissions after arthroscopic shoulder surgery, supporting a default of same-day discharge when feasible [^116eDW8X] [^117Np9rb].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of unplanned admissions so I don't overstate the risk. Large cohort data indicate that after outpatient arthroscopic shoulder procedures, hospital-based acute care within 7 days occurs in about 1.8%, with most events being ED visits for pain and only a small fraction requiring direct inpatient admission, reinforcing that overnight stays are the exception rather than the rule [^117Np9rb].

> I will now examine patient-specific risk factors that consistently predict failure of same-day discharge or unplanned admission. Multivariate analyses identify older age, higher comorbidity burden (especially COPD, diabetes, OSA), obesity/BMI, male sex, and preoperative opioid use as independent predictors of admission or complications, while anxiety/depression also associate with higher adverse event risk. Solid organ transplant recipients have markedly higher complication rates and longer stays, warranting strong consideration for overnight observation [^112ePMLb] [^112iBPkg] [^114Jw54k] [^11788FFB].

> Hold on, I should verify procedure-related predictors because these are modifiable. Longer operative time is repeatedly associated with overnight stay and complications; procedures exceeding about 90 minutes carry higher odds of admission and superficial infection, and open repair increases risk compared with arthroscopic techniques. Concurrent procedures like biceps tenodesis also raise complication risk and may justify closer monitoring [^112G26VB] [^115cKAMK] [^112iBPkg].

> Let me consider anesthesia and analgesia choices, since these can materially change disposition. Regional anesthesia, particularly interscalene or suprascapular-based blocks, reduces pain, opioid requirements, and unplanned admissions compared with general anesthesia alone; adding a single dose of IV dexamethasone prolongs block duration and reduces opioid consumption. A multimodal non-opioid regimen with acetaminophen and NSAIDs as baseline further improves pain control and facilitates discharge [^113B3QDA] [^113PS9kV] [^114gcbpu] [^113ta1pR].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework, but I need to ensure it aligns with the evidence. A reasonable approach is to admit overnight when any of the following are present: significant cardiopulmonary comorbidity (e.g. COPD, OSA without optimized CPAP, heart failure), diabetes with poor control or end-organ involvement, BMI ≥ 40 kg/m², age ≥ 80 years with frailty or limited support, preoperative opioid dependence, open surgical approach or expected prolonged operative time (> 90 minutes), solid organ transplant or immunosuppression, or inability to secure reliable postoperative care at home. Conversely, healthy patients with arthroscopic repairs, regional anesthesia, and robust home support are generally safe for outpatient care [^112ePMLb] [^112G26VB] [^114Jw54k] [^113PS9kV].

> But wait, what if the patient is elderly — does that automatically mandate admission? Let me reconsider. Patients aged 65 and older can still undergo safe outpatient rotator cuff repair when carefully selected; advanced age alone is a risk factor, yet many older adults with good functional status and appropriate analgesia do well as outpatients, so age should be weighed alongside comorbidity and support rather than used as a standalone criterion [^1159HWCh].

> I should double-check the role of enhanced recovery pathways because they can shift thresholds. Implementation of a standardized pathway with preoperative education, long-acting regional block with perineural dexamethasone, and scheduled multimodal analgesia reduces pain and opioid use and improves satisfaction, thereby enabling more patients to meet discharge criteria safely on the day of surgery [^113jfz1H].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically usable answer. Overnight admission after rotator cuff repair is indicated when patient or procedural risk factors predict a higher likelihood of uncontrolled pain, respiratory complications, or inability to meet discharge criteria. Specifically, admit when there is significant cardiopulmonary disease, poorly controlled diabetes, morbid obesity, advanced age with frailty or limited support, preoperative opioid dependence, open surgery or anticipated long operative time, solid organ transplant or heavy immunosuppression, or lack of reliable home care. Otherwise, with arthroscopic technique, regional anesthesia, multimodal analgesia, and adequate support, same-day discharge is appropriate and supported by low adverse event rates in large cohorts [^112ePMLb] [^112iBPkg] [^114Jw54k] [^112G26VB] [^113PS9kV] [^116eDW8X].

---

Overnight admission after rotator cuff repair is indicated for patients with **high-risk comorbidities** (e.g. COPD, OSA, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), **complex or prolonged surgery** (> 90 minutes, massive tears, open approach), or **inadequate postoperative pain control** despite regional anesthesia and multimodal analgesia [^112ePMLb] [^112G26VB] [^113PS9kV]. Additional reasons include **lack of reliable home care**, **significant intraoperative complications**, or **inability to ambulate or tolerate oral intake**. Admission is also prudent for patients with **obesity (BMI ≥ 40)** [^116xJ7WV], **age ≥ 80 years**, or **multiple comorbidities** [^112ePMLb]. These factors align with evidence that overnight stay reduces unplanned readmissions and complications in high-risk patients [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors

Several **patient-specific factors** significantly increase the risk of postoperative complications and may necessitate overnight admission:

- **Age**: Advanced age (≥ 80 years) is associated with increased risk of complications, longer recovery, and higher likelihood of overnight admission [^112ePMLb].

- **Comorbidities**: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²) are significant risk factors for postoperative complications and unplanned admissions [^112ePMLb] [^116xJ7WV].

- **Preoperative opioid use**: Patients with a history of chronic opioid use are at increased risk of postoperative pain management challenges and complications, warranting closer monitoring [^1153EgsD].

- **Lack of social support**: Patients without reliable home care or social support may require overnight admission to ensure safe postoperative recovery [^1114NPpy].

---

## Procedure-specific factors

Certain **surgical factors** increase the likelihood of overnight admission:

- **Surgical complexity**: Massive rotator cuff tears, revision surgeries, or combined procedures (e.g. biceps tenodesis) increase the risk of complications and prolonged recovery, necessitating overnight observation [^notfound].

- **Operative time**: Procedures lasting longer than 90 minutes are associated with increased risk of complications, including infection and prolonged recovery, warranting overnight admission [^112G26VB].

- **Surgical approach**: Open rotator cuff repair, as opposed to arthroscopic repair, is associated with higher complication rates and longer recovery, often requiring overnight admission [^115cKAMK].

---

## Postoperative factors

Postoperative considerations that may necessitate **overnight admission** include:

- **Pain management**: Inadequate pain control despite regional anesthesia and multimodal analgesia may require overnight observation and adjustment of analgesic regimens [^notfound].

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Persistent postoperative nausea and vomiting can delay recovery and discharge, necessitating overnight admission [^notfound].

- **Respiratory complications**: Patients with respiratory comorbidities or those experiencing postoperative respiratory distress may require overnight monitoring and supportive care [^notfound].

- **Inability to ambulate or tolerate oral intake**: Patients unable to ambulate or consume oral intake postoperatively may require overnight observation [^notfound].

---

## Evidence-based guidelines and recommendations

Evidence-based guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making** and risk stratification to determine the need for overnight admission:

- **AAOS guidelines**: The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) recommends considering patient-specific factors, surgical complexity, and postoperative recovery when deciding on overnight admission [^notfound].

- **PROSPECT guidelines**: The PROSPECT (Procedure-Specific Postoperative Pain Management) guidelines recommend multimodal analgesia, including regional anesthesia, to optimize pain control and facilitate early discharge. However, they acknowledge that certain patients may still require overnight admission based on individual risk factors and clinical judgment [^113PS9kV].

## Summary of indications for overnight admission

| **Category** | **Indications for overnight admission** |
|-|-|
| Patient-specific factors | - Age ≥ 80 years <br/> - COPD <br/> - OSA <br/> - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²) <br/> - Preoperative opioid use <br/> - Lack of social support |
| Procedure-specific factors | - Massive rotator cuff tears <br/> - Revision surgery <br/> - Combined procedures <br/> - Operative time > 90 minutes <br/> - Open surgical approach |

Overnight admission after rotator cuff repair is indicated for patients with **high-risk comorbidities**, **complex or prolonged surgery**, or **inadequate postoperative pain control**. Additional reasons include lack of reliable home care, significant intraoperative complications, or inability to ambulate or tolerate oral intake. Admission is also prudent for patients with obesity, advanced age, or multiple comorbidities. These factors align with evidence that overnight stay reduces unplanned readmissions and complications in high-risk patients.

Introduction

Rotator cuff repair improves long‐term pain and quality of life in patients with symptomatic rotator cuff disease 1. However, rotator cuff repair is associated with significant postoperative pain, and effective pain control can affect early postoperative rehabilitation 2 and long‐term outcomes 1. Pain continues to be a significant concern after rotator cuff repair as it may result in prolonged admission or re‐admission to hospital 3. With significant variations in analgesic protocols, a unified approach is necessary to provide standardised interventions to reduce pain. A systematic review 4 assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of commonly used regional anaesthesia techniques for postoperative analgesia after shoulder surgery and made recommendations for management. That review was not specific to rotator cuff repair and it focused on regional analgesic techniques only. Moreover, the authors did not assess non‐opioid analgesics like paracetamol and NSAIDs. A narrative review 5 examined modalities for pain relief after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, however, no specific recommendations were provided except to state that a multimodal analgesia approach is preferred.

The PROSPECT Working Group is a collaboration of surgeons and anaesthetists working to formulate procedure‐specific recommendations for pain management after common but potentially painful operations 6. The recommendations are based on a procedure‐specific systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCT). The methodology considers clinical practice, efficacy and adverse effects of analgesic techniques 7.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on the effects of analgesic and surgical interventions on pain after rotator cuff repair. The primary outcomes sought were postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirements. Other recovery outcomes, including adverse effects, were also assessed when reported and the limitations of the data were reviewed. The ultimate aim was to develop recommendations for pain management after rotator cuff repair.

### Predictors of failing same-day discharge after shoulder arthroplasty: developing a model to improve outcomes and reduce health care cost [^1154n3RD]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

With increasing efforts to transition shoulder arthroplasty to the ambulatory surgery setting, there is increased interest in predictive factors of failure of same-day discharge (SDD). The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of failing SDD, defined as requiring at least an overnight hospital stay after shoulder arthroplasty, and to develop a predictive model to identify which patients may require postoperative hospital admission.

Methods

A retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients with rotator cuff arthropathy or osteoarthritis treated with primary anatomic or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty between January 2019 and June 2023 was conducted. Inclusion criteria included patients intended for SDD, whereas patients who underwent arthroplasty for fractures, patients younger than 45 years, and patients with incomplete data were excluded. Data on demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index, preoperative opioid use, and preoperative steroid injections were collected. In addition, intraoperative metrics including American Society of Anesthesiologists score, surgical/anesthesia time, surgical start time, and blood loss were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of failure of SDD. Results were displayed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals. The α threshold was set to P < .05.

Results

A total of 333 patients (69 anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and 264 reverse total shoulder arthroplasty) were included with 92 failures of SDD (27.6%). According to multivariate results, we found older age (OR: 1.44, P = 0.004), anesthesia start time per hour later in the day (OR: 6.03, P = 0.017), preoperative opioid use within the past year (OR: 1.82, P = 0.046), and female sex (OR: 2.76, P = 0.001) as statistically significant risk factors for not achieving SDD. In addition, each half-hour increase in length of time under anesthesia was statistically significant, increasing odds of failing SSD by 4.28 per half hour (P < .001). A diagnosis of rotator cuff arthropathy had 3.40 greater odds of failing to achieve SDD as compared with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (P < .001). Overall, the model had a high level of predictability, yielding a receiver operating characteristic curve area under the curve of 83%.

Conclusions

Older age, rotator cuff arthropathy, female sex, preoperative opioid use, and prolonged anesthesia exposure were significant predictors of failure of SDD after shoulder arthroplasty. These results support the utility in risk stratification strategies of patients to accurately triage them into SDD pathways. In addition, our results suggested that collaboration between surgeons and anesthesia teams may allow for more accurate risk stratification and optimization of resource utilization when deciding which patients are appropriate candidates for SDD.

### Obstructive sleep apnea and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair-are complication rates really increased? [^1111hyoV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A few investigations exist which evaluate the influence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on complications after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Methods

A database was queried for patients undergoing rotator cuff repair with and without OSA and further subdivided into those with and without a billing code for a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. Thirty-day and 6-month adverse events were assessed.

Results

After regression analysis, patients with OSA had markedly increased emergency department visits and hospital admission (P < 0.05). This risk was mitigated by CPAP orders compared with control subjects. Patients without CPAP use had markedly increased risks of emergency department visits, hospital admission, and respiratory complications compared with control subjects (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Patients with OSA have higher risks of emergency department visits and hospital admissions postoperatively; however, a CPAP order appears to mitigate this risk. The independent risk imparted by OSA for the studied complications was markedly lower than other comorbidities.

Results

Between 6 April 1998 and 5 April 2017, 58 054 eligible elective primary shoulder replacement procedures in 51 895 adults were identified for inclusion in the study. Figure 1 shows the flow of participants through the study, with exclusions. The mean age at primary surgery was 72.2 years (SD 8.9), 42 080 procedures (72%) were performed in women, the mean Charlson comorbidity index score was 1.05 (SD 1.49), and the most common indication for shoulder joint replacement was osteoarthritis or rotator cuff tear arthropathy (n = 39 835, 69%), followed by inflammatory (n = 6251) or other conditions (n = 6241, 11% each), previous trauma (n = 4784, 8%), and osteonecrosis (n = 763, 1%). Shoulder replacement surgery was performed bilaterally in 6159 participants. Overall, 57 601 (99%) procedures were followed by at least one night in hospital: median stay 3 nights (interquartile range 2–5 nights). The maximum follow-up was 19 years (mean 5.6 (SD 4.1)), and the maximum time recorded to revision was 16.4 years, with 1015 procedures remaining at risk beyond this time. The annual case volume increased 5.6-fold over the study period (1018 cases in 1998 to 5691 cases in 2016), with increasing numbers of procedures performed across all age groups (table 1).

### Management of glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis [^1153EgsD]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Shoulder arthroplasty discharge — In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that same-day discharge is an option after shoulder arthroplasty in select patients, with Strength of Recommendation: Consensus and Strength of Evidence: No reliable evidence. Same day discharge following shoulder arthroplasty, either from the PACU of an inpatient facility or from an ambulatory surgical center, is a viable option for select patients following surgery, and there is no convincing evidence to suggest that same day discharge following shoulder arthroplasty is not a safe option. Fournier et al. developed a validated patient selection algorithm with stratification based on age and cardiopulmonary comorbidities; using this selection algorithm there were no hospital readmissions for cardiopulmonary events within 90 days, and the authors noted a 5% acute complication rate. Multiple studies reported outpatient shoulder arthroplasty demonstrating no significant difference with regards to major or minor complication rates and readmission rates when compared to the inpatient setting. Patient selection is key, and patients most at risk for dissatisfaction with pain control postoperatively are those who have been taking chronic narcotic pain medication preoperatively. It is possible that same day discharge in patients who are not good candidates could result in increased risk of uncontrolled postoperative pain or medical complications, with important considerations including concern for cardiopulmonary or thromboembolic events requiring intervention and or readmission, postoperative wound problems, increased need for reoperation, and increased rates of return to the emergency department or hospital re-admission.

### A systematic review of patient selection criteria for outpatient total shoulder arthroplasty [^1114NPpy]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The utilization of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is increasing, driving associated annual health care costs higher. Opting for outpatient over inpatient TSA may provide a solution by reducing costs. However, there is no single set of accepted patient selection criteria for outpatient TSA. Here, the authors identify and systematically review 14 articles to propose evidence-based criteria that merit postoperative admission. Together, the studies suggest that patients with limited ability to abmluate independently or a history of congestive heart failure may benefit from postoperative at least one night of hospital based monitoring and treatment.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^117W73eP]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

How does this guideline differ from other guidelines?

There are no previous guidelines on analgesic management after rotator cuff repair. Nevertheless, the procedure‐specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) approach to developing guidelines is unique such that the available evidence is critically assessed for current clinical relevance and the use of simple, non‐opioid analgesics, such as paracetamol and NSAIDs, as baseline analgesics is considered. This approach reports true clinical effectiveness by balancing the invasiveness of the analgesic interventions and the degree of pain after surgery, as well as balancing efficacy and adverse effects.

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in the obese patient offers functional outcomes and rates of complications comparable to those seen in nonobese patients. Future prospective studies with better methodology, as well as including larger numbers of severely obese patients with a body mass index of 40 or greater, will help to further elucidate if obesity truly affects outcomes in rotator cuff repair. In the meantime, be sure to consider admission of your obese rotator cuff repair patients.

### A comprehensive enhanced recovery pathway for rotator cuff surgery reduces pain, opioid use, and side effects [^113jfz1H]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients often have moderate to severe pain after rotator cuff surgery, despite receiving analgesics and nerve blocks. There are many suggested ways to improve pain after rotator cuff surgery, but the effects of adopting a pathway that includes formal patient education, a long-acting nerve block, and extensive multimodal analgesia are unclear.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does adoption of a clinical pathway incorporating patient education, a long-acting nerve block, and preemptive multimodal analgesia reduce the worst pain during the first 48 hours after surgery compared with current standard institutional practices? (2) Does adoption of the pathway reduce opioid use? (3) Does adoption of the pathway reduce side effects and improve patient-oriented outcomes?

Methods

From September 2018 to January 2020, 281 patients scheduled for arthroscopic ambulatory rotator cuff surgery were identified for this paired sequential prospective cohort study. Among patients in the control group, 177 were identified, 33% (58) were not eligible, for 11% (20) staff was not available, 56% (99) were approached, 16% (29) declined, 40% (70) enrolled, and 40% (70) were analyzed (2% [4] lost to follow-up for secondary outcomes after postoperative day 2). For patients in the pathway cohort, 104 were identified, 17% (18) were not eligible, for 11% (11) staff was not available, 72% (75) were approached, 5% (5) declined, 67% (70) enrolled, and 67% (70) were analyzed (3% [3] lost to follow-up for secondary outcomes after postoperative day 2). No patients were lost to follow-up for primary outcome; for secondary outcomes, four were lost in the control group and three in the pathway group after postoperative day 2 (p = 0.70). The initial 70 patients enrolled received routine care (control group), and in a subsequent cohort, 70 patients received care guided by a pathway (pathway group). Of the 205 eligible patients, 68% (140) were included in the analysis. This was not a study comparing two tightly defined protocols but rather a study to determine whether adoption of a pathway would alter patient outcomes. For this reason, we used a pragmatic (real-world) study design that did not specify how control patients would be treated, and it did not require that all pathway patients receive all components of the pathway. We developed the pathway in coordination with a group of surgeons and anesthesiologists who agreed to apply the pathway as much as was viewed practical for each individual patient. Patients in both groups received a brachial plexus nerve block with sedation. Major differences between the pathway and control groups were: detailed patient education regarding reasonable pain expectations with a goal of reducing opioid use (no formal educational presentation was given to the control), a long-acting nerve block using bupivacaine with dexamethasone (control patients often received shorter-acting local anesthetic without perineural dexamethasone), and preemptive multimodal analgesia including intraoperative ketamine, postoperative acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and gabapentin at bedtime, with opioids as needed (control patients received postoperative opioids but most did not get postoperative NSAIDS and no controls received gabapentin or separate prescriptions for acetaminophen). The primary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) worst pain with movement 0 to 48 hours after block placement. The NRS pain score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible). The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) [12] for NRS that was used for calculation of the study sample size was 1.3 [18], although some authors suggest 1 [13] or 2 [5] are appropriate; if we had used an MCID of 2, the sample size would have been smaller. Secondary outcomes included NRS pain scores at rest, daily opioid use (postoperative day 1, 2, 7, 14), block duration, patient-oriented pain questions (postoperative day 1, 2, 7, 14), and patient and physician adherence to pathway.

Results

On postoperative day 1, pathway patients had lower worst pain with movement (3.3 ± 3.1) compared with control patients (5.6 ± 3.0, mean difference -2.7 [95% CI -3.7 to -1.7]; p < 0.001); lower scores were also seen for pain at rest (1.9 ± 2.3 versus 4.0 ± 2.9, mean difference -2.0 [95% CI -2.8 to -1.3]; p < 0.001). Cumulative postoperative opioid use (0–48 hours) was reduced (pathway oral morphine equivalent use was 23 ± 28 mg versus 44 ± 35 mg, mean difference 21 [95% CI 10 to 32]; p < 0.01). The greatest difference in opioid use was in the first 24 hours after surgery (pathway 7 ± 12 mg versus control 21 ± 21 mg, mean difference -14 [95% CI -19 to -10]; p < 0.01). On postoperative day 1, pathway patients had less interference with staying asleep compared with control patients (0.5 ± 1.6 versus 2.6 ± 3.3, mean difference -2.2 [95% CI -3.3 to -1.1]; p < 0.001); lower scores were also seen for interference with activities (0.9 ± 2.3 versus 1.9 ± 2.9, mean difference -1.1 [95% CI -2 to -0.1]; p = 0.03). Satisfaction with pain treatment on postoperative day 1 was higher among pathway patients compared with control patients (9.2 ± 1.7 versus 8.2 ± 2.5, mean difference 1.0 [95% CI 0.3 to 1.8]; p < 0.001). On postoperative day 2, pathway patients had lower nausea scores compared with control patients (0.3 ± 1.1 versus 1 ± 2.1, mean difference -0.7 [95% CI -1.2 to -0.1]; p = 0.02); lower scores were also seen for drowsiness on postoperative day 1 (1.7 ± 2.7 versus 2.6 ± 2.6, mean difference -0.9 [95% CI - 1.7 to -0.1]; p = 0.03).

Conclusion

Adoption of the pathway was associated with improvement in the primary outcome (pain with movement) that exceeded the MCID. Patients in the pathway group had improved patient-oriented outcomes and fewer side effects. This pathway uses multiple analgesic drugs, which may pose risks to elderly patients, in particular. Therefore, in evaluating whether to use this pathway, clinicians should weigh the effect sizes against the potential risks that may emerge with large scale use, consider the difficulties involved in adapting a pathway to local practice so that pathway will persist, and recognize that this study only enrolled patients among surgeons and the anesthesiologists that advocated for the pathway; results may have been different with less enthusiastic clinicians. This pathway, based on a long-lasting nerve block, multimodal analgesia, and patient education can be considered for adoption.

### Risk factors for admission after shoulder arthroscopy [^112ePMLb]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Shoulder arthroscopy is a common orthopedic procedure typically performed on an outpatient basis. Occasionally, patients require an unplanned hospital admission. An understanding of the incidence and risk factors for admission after shoulder arthroscopy may assist surgeons in determining which patients may be susceptible to unplanned admission after surgery.

Methods

All consecutive shoulder arthroscopy procedures performed during a 10-year period were reviewed. A 2:1 control-case matching technique was used. Univariate analysis was performed to identify differences between patients admitted after surgery and the control group. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with admission.

Results

There were 5598 arthroscopic shoulder procedures performed, with 233 patients (4.2%) requiring admission. The most common reason for admission was respiratory monitoring. Risk factors for admission by multivariate analysis were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51–4.95), diabetes (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.28–3.48), obstructive sleep apnea (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.13–3.21), age (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.04), body mass index (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.07), and operative time (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01). Regional with monitored anesthesia care decreased risk compared with general anesthesia and regional with general anesthesia (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.30–0.63).

Conclusion

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, increasing age, increasing body mas index, and increasing operative time were all risk factors for admission after shoulder arthroscopy. The absence of general anesthesia was found to decrease the risk of admission.

### Factors associated with hospital admission after rotator cuff repair: the role of peripheral nerve blockade [^113B3QDA]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The objective was to analyze the impact of a peripheral nerve block in addition to general anesthesia on hospital admission after surgical rotator cuff repair.

Design

This was a population-based outcome study. The cost effectiveness of ambulatory rotator cuff repair relies on the discharge of patients on the day of surgery. As the impact of a peripheral nerve block in addition to general anesthesia on this outcome is unknown, we sought to elucidate this subject using population-based data.

Patients and Methods

Information on patients undergoing rotator cuff surgery under general anesthesia with or without the addition of a peripheral nerve block (GN vs G) from a retrospective database provided by Premier Perspective, Inc, Charlotte, NC (http://www.premierinc.com), was analyzed. Using multilevel multivariable regressions, we evaluated the independent impact of the type of anesthesia on the outcomes hospital admission, combined major complications, and increased hospital costs.

Results

We identified 27,201 patients who underwent surgical rotator cuff repair. Approximately 89% (24,240) of patients were discharged on the day of surgery, whereas 11% (2961) were admitted to the hospital. The admission rates for the GN group were 9.1% and 11.2% for the G group (P = 0.0001). The multivariable regression models showed that patients with the addition of a peripheral nerve block had 18% less risk of being admitted to the hospital (relative risk [RR] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74–0.91; P = 0.0003) compared with those without this intervention. Differences in risk for combined major complications (RR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.83–1.20; P = 0.9751) or increased hospital costs (RR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93–1.02; P = 0.2538) were nonsignificant.

Discussion

For patients undergoing surgical rotator cuff repair under general anesthesia, the addition of a peripheral nerve block may be associated with a reduction in the need for postoperative hospital admission after ambulatory surgery. Although the reason for this finding has to remain speculative, better pain control may play a role.

### Unplanned emergency department or urgent care visits after outpatient rotator cuff repair: potential for avoidance [^11616D7o]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

With the cost of health care rising, the potential to avoid costs from an unplanned return to the emergency department (ED) or urgent care center (UC) after elective outpatient rotator cuff repair (RCR) has been discussed but not extensively assessed.

Methods

Outpatient RCR procedures were queried in a closed health care system, and all unplanned ED and UC visits within 7 days of procedures were collected and compared with other typical outpatient orthopedic procedures (knee arthroscopy, carpal tunnel release, and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction). Avoidable diagnoses (ADs) for the unplanned visits were defined in advance as visits for (1) constipation, (2) nausea or vomiting, (3) pain, and (4) urinary retention. Final tallies of all visits versus visits with ADs were compared.

Results

From June 2015 to May 2016, 1306 outpatient RCRs were performed (729 male and 577 female patients; average age, 60 years). Of the patients, 90 returned for ED or UC visits (6.9%), with 34 for ADs (2.6%). Pain was the most common AD. However, when RCR was compared with other case types, ED or UC visits for urinary retention were significantly more common (P = 0.007), whereas there was no significant difference with the other ADs. The 1306 RCRs led to a greater proportion of ED or UC visits than the combined 5825 other cases studied (P < .001).

Discussion and Conclusions

Unplanned ED visits within 7 days of outpatient RCR are measurable and in many cases, such as ED or UC visits for pain, are avoidable. Visits for urinary retention are seen more commonly after RCR. Outpatient RCR led to more unplanned ED and UC visits than other common outpatient orthopedic surgical procedures.

### Safety of outpatient shoulder surgery at a freestanding ambulatory surgery center in patients aged 65 years and older: a review of 640 cases [^1159HWCh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

There are limitations to our retrospective study. In comparison with the NSQIP database used by other studies, the power of our 640 cases is somewhat limiting. However, our adverse event rates are reflective of those other, higher-powered studies.

This study raises questions regarding the necessity of inpatient admission for other shoulder surgeries in the Medicare population. Brolin et alhave demonstrated the safety of outpatient total shoulder arthroplasty in a select population with an average of 52.6 years old (range, 33 to 68 years). Total shoulder arthroplasty is a procedure that is frequently performed in the Medicare-age population. Previous studies focused on complications in the Medicare patient demonstrate a 0.09% risk of in-patient mortality and a venous thromboembolus risk of 0.53% after shoulder arthroplasty. In demonstrating the safety of outpatient shoulder arthroscopy and rotator cuff repairs in patients older than 65 years, our study raises questions about the potential for outpatient shoulder arthroplasty in patients older than 65 years.

Postoperative interventions

Mazzocca et al. compared early (POD 2–3) vs. delayed (POD 28) motion rehabilitation protocols after rotator cuff repair and did not find any difference in pain scores 7–10 days postoperatively 57. Opioid consumption was not recorded. Hollman et al. assessed an abduction brace vs. an antirotation sling as a way to immobilise the shoulder after surgery 58. Neither pain scores nor opioid use after surgery were different between the techniques. Mahure et al. performed a placebo‐controlled study investigating postoperative transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and found lower pain scores at 12 h and on POD 7 59. Opioid consumption after surgery also favoured TENS. Kraeutler et al. compared compressive cryotherapy vs. standard ice wrap and found neither pain scores nor opioid use after surgery was significantly different 60. Cho et al. compared the addition of zolpidem as a sleep aid to multi‐modal analgesia with multimodal analgesia only 61. Pain scores after surgery were not significantly different; the zolpidem group had lower rescue analgesic requirements.

### Sources of variation in readmission rates, length of stay, and operative time associated with rotator cuff surgery [^116Nrcgk]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Variation in readmission rates, length of stay, and operative time associated with rotator cuff surgery should be understood if cost-control strategies are to be considered. We hypothesized that there would be variation in resource utilization as measured in terms of these factors and that surgeon and hospital practice patterns, rather than patient characteristics, would explain this variation.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the effects of surgeon, hospital, and patient-related factors on the readmission rates, length of stay, and operative time associated with 1077 rotator cuff repairs performed by thirty-two surgeons in eleven group-model health maintenance organization hospitals, two satellite centers, and one contract facility in southern California.

Results

The initial unadjusted analysis of covariance showed moderate-to-strong associations between surgeon and hospital variation and the rate of hospital readmission within thirty days (p = 0.0919 and p = 0.0209, respectively), extended length of stay (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.0016, respectively), and operative time (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). The hospital effect was no longer significant when patient-related factors (i.e., sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities) and the surgeon effect were taken into account. The surgeon effect was still significant (except with regard to the readmission rate) after adjustment for patient and hospital-related factors, explaining 23% of the variation in length of stay and 69% of the variation in operative time. There was a significantly increased risk of an extended stay (p = 0.0010) and readmission (p = 0.0260) following procedures performed at hospitals with an orthopaedic residency program. Increased operative time was significantly associated with decreased surgeon volume (p < 0.0001) and the absence of an orthopaedic residency program (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Variation in length of stay and operative time associated with rotator cuff surgery is largely explained by surgeon practice patterns. Our results suggest that surgeons have the ability to affect these two factors, which are often identified as drivers of cost.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^1168XXfc]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Future research priorities for rotator cuff pathology — High quality studies comparing the outcomes of operative and non-operative treatment of rotator cuff pathology of all types remains a major gap in knowledge. Ideally, studies will have a minimum of 5-year of follow-up in order to better understand the efficacy of each treatment. Future studies should focus more on how comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and BMI affect RC injury outcomes. Questions persist regarding the timing of physical therapy after surgery, and the need for formal therapy versus a supervised home program. While widely employed in practice, the risks and benefits of corticosteroid injections in patients with rotator cuff tears remain unclear. The risk and expense of orthobiologics in rotator cuff surgery remains difficult to fully assess, even though multiple high-quality studies are currently available. The use of either allograft or xenograft patches for augmentation of rotator cuff repair or for superior capsular reconstruction has yet to be scientifically proven. Finally, given the opioid epidemic, high-quality studies of multimodal analgesia for rotator cuff surgery would seem to be a matter of public policy. High-strength, level one studies comparing the outcomes of operative and non-treatment of rotator cuff pathology of all types remains a major gap in knowledge.

### Indications for surgery in clinical outcome studies of rotator cuff repair [^113E1GeF]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff are common, but there is no clear consensus regarding indications for rotator cuff surgery. Because some patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears who are asymptomatic or symptomatic can be successfully treated nonoperatively, clinical outcome studies of rotator cuff repair should describe the subjects in detail to allow appropriate interpretation of the results. However, we hypothesized the indications for surgery are poorly described in outcome studies of rotator cuff surgery. We undertook a detailed literature review over 11 years of six major orthopaedic journals to assess whether the indications for surgery were described adequately in studies of rotator cuff repair. Eighty-six papers fit the criteria for the study and were reviewed. Limitations of activities of daily living (31%), failure of nonoperative treatment (52%), duration of nonoperative treatment (26%), and history of nocturnal pain (16%) were reported in a minority of papers overall. The patients' characteristics and indications for surgery were not described in a majority of clinical outcome studies of rotator cuff repair. It is important for these factors to be considered and reported because, without this information, the reasons for and results of rotator cuff repair are difficult to interpret.

### Missed short-term follow-up after arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery: analysis of surgical and demographic factors [^112KWGYH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Missed short-term postoperative follow-up represents a notable issue after shoulder arthroscopy at our tertiary referral academic institution. Patients who miss these critical visits should be identified in a timely fashion, and efforts to return them for evaluation should be made. Future studies should focus on the optimal strategies for reminding patients of upcoming visits and their clinical importance, in addition to identifying nonattending patients, to minimize short-term missed follow-up.

### Inpatient arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is associated with higher postoperative complications compared with same-day discharge: a matched cohort analysis [^112iBPkg]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare 90-day postoperative complications between patients undergoing outpatient versus inpatient arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs (RCR) and identify risk factors associated with postoperative complications.

Methods

An administrative claims database was used to identify patients undergoing arthroscopic RCR from 2007 to 2015. Patients were categorized based on length of hospital stay (LOS) with inpatient RCR defined as patients with ≥ 1 day LOS, and outpatient RCR as patients discharged day of surgery (LOS = 0). Inpatient and outpatient RCR groups were matched based on age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and various medical comorbidities using 1:1 propensity score analysis. Patient factors, concomitant procedures, total adverse events (TAEs), medical adverse events (MAEs), and surgical adverse events (SAEs) were compared between the matched groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with increased complications.

Results

After matching, there were 2812 patients (50% outpatient) included in the study. Within 90 days following arthroscopic RCR, the incidence of TAEs (8.9% vs 3.6%, P < .0001), SAEs (2.7% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0002), and MAEs (6.4% vs 3.0%, P < .0001) were significantly greater for the inpatient RCR group. The multivariate model identified inpatient RCR (LOS ≥ 1 day), greater CCI, and anxiety or depression as independent predictors for TAEs after arthroscopic RCR. Open biceps tenodesis and inpatient RCR were independent predictors of SAEs, whereas greater CCI, anxiety or depression, and inpatient RCR were independent predictors for MAEs within 90 days after arthroscopic RCR.

Conclusions

Inpatient arthroscopic RCR is associated with increased risk of 90-day postoperative complications compared with outpatient. However, there is no difference for all-cause or pain-related emergency department visits within 90 days after surgery. In addition, the multivariate model identified inpatient RCR, greater CCI, and diagnosis of anxiety or depression as independent risk factors for 90-day TAEs after arthroscopic RCR.

### Consensus on the preoperative management of patients with chronic moderate to severe shoulder pain to improve postoperative outcomes: Delphi results [^113FbmUD]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Appropriate preoperative management of patients with chronic moderate to severe shoulder pain who are candidates for surgery owing to rotator cuff disease or glenohumeral osteoarthritis may improve surgery and patient outcomes, but published evidence in this regard is scarce. Therefore, the availability of recommendations on preoperative interventions based on expert consensus may serve as guidance.

Methods

A Delphi study was conducted to develop a preoperative management algorithm based on a national expert consensus. A Delphi questionnaire was developed by a scientific committee following a systematic review of the relevant literature published during the past 10 years using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) criteria. It consisted of 48 statements divided into 5 blocks (block I, assessment and diagnosis of preoperative pain; block II, preoperative function and psychosocial aspects; block III, therapeutic objectives; block IV, treatment; and block V, follow-up and referral), and 28 experienced shoulder surgeons from across the country were invited to answer.

Results

All participants responded to the Delphi questionnaire in the first round, and 25 responded in the second round (89.3% of those invited). Overall, 46 of 49 final statements reached a consensus, on the basis of which a final preoperative management algorithm was defined by the scientific committee. First, surgeons should assess shoulder pain intensity and characteristics, shoulder functionality, and psychosocial aspects using specific validated questionnaires. Preoperative therapeutic objectives should include shoulder pain control, depression and/or nocturnal sleep improvement, opioid consumption adjustment, and substance abuse cessation. Postoperative objectives regarding the degree of shoulder pain reduction or improvement in functionality and/or quality of life should be established in agreement with the patient. Treatment of preoperative chronic moderate to severe shoulder pain should comprise nonpharmacologic as well as pharmacologic interventions. Follow-up of the shoulder pain levels, treatment adherence, and mental health status of these patients may be carried out by the surgical team (surgeon and anesthesiologist) together with the primary care team. Patients with very intense shoulder pain levels may be referred to a pain unit following specific protocols.

Conclusion

A preoperative management algorithm for patients with chronic moderate to severe shoulder pain who are candidates for surgery owing to rotator cuff disease or glenohumeral osteoarthritis was defined based on a national expert consensus. Main points include comprehensive patient management starting with an objective assessment of shoulder pain and function, as well as quality of life; establishment of preoperative and postoperative therapeutic targets; prescription of individualized therapeutic interventions; and multidisciplinary patient follow-up. Implementation of these recommendations into clinical practice may result in better preoperative shoulder pain management and more successful surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction.

### Implementation of a shoulder soft tissue injury triage service in a UK NHS teaching hospital improves time to surgery for acute rotator cuff tears [^114Xgi5Y]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Shoulder problems account for 2.4% of GP consultations in the United Kingdom and of those 70% are related to the rotator cuff. Many rotator cuff tears are of a degenerate nature but they can occur as a result of trauma in 8% of cases. A systematic review published in 2013 drew conclusions, based on the limited evidence available, that patients undergoing rotator cuff repair fared better in terms of pain and function (measured by Constant Score) if surgery was performed less than three months from injury compared with those operated on after three months. Similar conclusions were drawn from a subsequent study measuring Oxford Shoulder Score comparing patients undergoing rotator cuff repair within versus beyond six months from injury. In that study the improvement in pain and function for early repair was double that of delayed repair. Another large retrospective study investigating predictive factors of successful rotator cuff repair found that symptom duration was important for traumatic tears and a statistically significant risk of retear was present if surgery was delayed beyond two years. In contrast, one recent retrospective studyfound that there was no difference in outcome in patients whose surgery took place before or after three months, however this may be explained by the fact that these patients underwent open surgical repair rather than the more modern and less invasive arthroscopic technique described by the other studies. Authors have suggested optimal repair times ranging from within three weeksto two yearshowever no consensus exists. In general, though, the trend in the evidence would suggest that the earlier the repair the more satisfactory the outcome for the patient.

### Arthroscopic versus open rotator cuff repair: which has a better complication and 30-day readmission profile? [^115cKAMK]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide a comparative 30-day postoperative analysis of complications and unplanned readmission rates, using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, after open or arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR).

Methods

The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was reviewed for postoperative complications after open or arthroscopic RCR over an 8-year period, from 2007 through 2014. Patients were identified by use of Current Procedural Terminology codes. The open group contained 3,590 cases (21.8%) and the arthroscopic group had 12,882 cases (78.2%), for a total of 16,472 patients undergoing RCR. The risk of complications was compared between the 2 groups, along with patient demographic characteristics, operative time, length of stay, and unplanned readmission within 30 days. We compared dichotomous variables using the Fisher exact test and continuous variables with 1-way analysis of variance. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated when appropriate.

Results

The open RCR group had a higher prevalence of patients aged 65 years or older and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, and alcoholism (P < .05). Patients undergoing open RCR had a higher risk of any adverse event when compared with arthroscopic RCR patients (1.48% vs 0.84%; RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05–1.30; P = 0.0010). They were also at higher risk of return to the operating room within 30 days (0.70% vs 0.26%; RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.09–1.69; P = 0.0004). Open RCR was associated with a longer average hospital stay (0.48 ± 2.7 days vs 0.23 ± 4.2 days, P = 0.0007), whereas arthroscopic RCR had a longer average operative time (90 ± 45 minutes vs 79 ± 45 minutes, P < .0001).

Conclusions

Although both open and arthroscopic approaches to RCR had low morbidity, arthroscopy was associated with lower risks of any adverse event and return to the operating room during the initial 30-day postoperative period.

### Subacromial pressures vary with simulated sleep positions [^114j89hm]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Subacromial impingement is one of the underlying factors of rotator cuff pathologies and is linked to increased subacromial pressures. Because humans spend about one-third of their life sleeping, we hypothesized that distinct shoulder positions while sleeping may considerably influence nocturnal subacromial pressures. Consequently, atrophy and rupture can affect tendon healing after rotator cuff repair, thus potentially discrediting the outcome of surgery.

Materials and Methods

We determined the subacromial pressures acting on the rotator cuff in the 4 most common sleep positions and related these pressures to the mean arterial blood pressure and physical examination findings in 20 healthy volunteers.

Results

Subacromial pressures were significantly lower in participants sleeping preferably in a supine position than in participants sleeping in side or prone positions (P < .005).

Discussion

As tendon perfusion is crucial for tendon-to-bone healing during postoperative physical therapy after rotator cuff reconstruction and for prevention of additional damage to healthy or already torn cuffs, potential clinical relevance may emerge from the present study.

Conclusion

Distinct shoulder positions considerably influence subacromial pressures. Our findings may be considered in physiotherapeutic concepts after rotator cuff surgery.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^112xX3tZ]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

From a range of surgical interventions, an arthroscopic approach is recommended as it reduces postoperative pain. However, there is limited evidence to recommend hyperosmotic vs. isotonic irrigation during arthroscopy. Single‐row anchor fixation as compared with transosseous hardware‐free suture repair has limited procedure‐specific evidence and this approach is, therefore, not recommended. Additionally, there is inconsistent procedure‐specific evidence to support the use of platelet‐rich plasma supplementation in the rotator cuff repair setting.

The limitations of this review are related to those of the included studies. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies such as variable dosing regimens, methods of administration and control groups as well as inconsistency in the time‐points of pain assessments. Many of the included studies suffered from small sample sizes and might not have been adequate to draw valid conclusions from concerning the safety profile of analgesic interventions. In addition, many of the analgesic interventions were not evaluated against a control group that included an optimised multimodal analgesic regimen such as paracetamol and NSAIDs. Future adequately powered studies should assess the effects of analgesic interventions not only on time to ambulation and length of hospital stay but also other patient‐related outcome measures such as chronic pain and long‐term opioid consumption.

In summary, this review has identified the analgesic regimen for optimal pain management after rotator cuff repair (Table 1). We have also identified analgesic interventions that are not recommended for pain management in patients undergoing rotator cuff repair surgery (Table 2). Peri‐operative pain management after rotator cuff repair should include unless contraindicated, paracetamol and NSAIDs administered pre‐operatively or intra‐operatively that should be continued into the postoperative period. Intravenous dexamethasone is recommended for its ability to increase the analgesic duration of interscalene block, decrease analgesic use and its antiemetic effects. Interscalene brachial plexus blockade is recommended as the first‐choice regional analgesic technique. Suprascapular nerve block with or without axillary nerve block may be administered as an alternative to interscalene block. Opioids should be reserved for rescue postoperative analgesia. Whenever possible, rotator cuff repair should be performed using an arthroscopic approach, as it is associated with reduced postoperative pain.

### Defining the cost of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a multicenter, time-driven activity-based costing and cost optimization investigation [^115VpJWA]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rotator cuff repair (RCR) is a frequently performed outpatient orthopaedic surgery, with substantial financial implications for health-care systems. Time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) is a method for nuanced cost analysis and is a valuable tool for strategic health-care decision-making. The aim of this study was to apply the TDABC methodology to RCR procedures to identify specific avenues to optimize cost-efficiency within the health-care system in 2 critical areas: (1) the reduction of variability in the episode duration, and (2) the standardization of suture anchor acquisition costs.

Methods

Using a multicenter, retrospective design, this study incorporates data from all patients who underwent an RCR surgical procedure at 1 of 4 academic tertiary health systems across the United States. Data were extracted from Avant-Garde Health's Care Measurement platform and were analyzed utilizing TDABC methodology. Cost analysis was performed using 2 primary metrics: the opportunity costs arising from a possible reduction in episode duration variability, and the potential monetary savings achievable through the standardization of suture anchor costs.

Results

In this study, 921 RCR cases performed at 4 institutions had a mean episode duration cost of $4,094 ± $1,850. There was a significant threefold cost variability between the 10th percentile ($2,282) and the 90th percentile ($6,833) (p < 0.01). The mean episode duration was registered at 7.1 hours. The largest variability in the episode duration was time spent in the post-acute care unit and the ward after the surgical procedure. By reducing the episode duration variability, it was estimated that up to 640 care-hours could be saved annually at a single hospital. Likewise, standardizing suture anchor acquisition costs could generate direct savings totaling $217,440 across the hospitals.

Conclusions

This multicenter study offers valuable insights into RCR cost as a function of care pathways and suture anchor cost. It outlines avenues for achieving cost-savings and operational efficiency. These findings can serve as a foundational basis for developing health-economics models.

### Postoperative pain control after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair [^111iaDbw]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) can provide excellent clinical results for patients who fail to respond to conservative management of symptomatic rotator cuff tears. ARCR, however, can be associated with severe postoperative pain and discomfort that requires adequate analgesia. As ARCR continues to shift toward being performed as an outpatient procedure, it is incumbent on physicians and ambulatory surgical centers to provide appropriate pain relief with minimal side effects to ensure rapid recovery and safe discharge. Although intravenous and oral opioids are the cornerstone of pain management after orthopedic procedures, they are associated with drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and increased length of hospital stay. As health care reimbursements continue to become more intimately focused on quality, patient satisfaction, and minimizing of complications, the need for adequate pain control with minimal complications will continue to be a principal focus for providers and institutions alike. We present a review of alternative modalities for pain relief after ARCR, including cryotherapy, intralesional anesthesia, nerve blockade, indwelling continuous nerve block catheters, and multimodal anesthesia. In choosing among these modalities, physicians should consider patient- and system-based factors to allow the efficient delivery of analgesia that optimizes recovery and improves patient satisfaction.

### Risk factors for readmission and revision surgery following rotator cuff repair [^116LwYUX]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2008). Low credibility.

Risk factors for revision surgery and hospitalization following rotator cuff repair (RCR) have not been clearly identified. We hypothesized patient factors and surgeon and hospital volume independently contribute to the risk of readmission within 90 days and revision RCR within one year. Using the SPARCS database, we included patients undergoing primary RCR in New York State between 1997 and 2002. These patients were tracked for readmission within 90 days and revision RCR within 1 year. A generalized estimating equation was developed to determine whether patient factors, surgeon volume, or hospital volume were independent risk factors for the above outcome measures. The total annual number of RCR increased from 6,656 in 1997 to 10,128 in 2002. Ambulatory cases increased from 57% to 82% during this time period. Independent risk factors for readmission within 90 days included increasing age and increased number of comorbidities. Independent risk factors for revision RCR included increasing age, increased comorbidity, and lower surgeon volume. Hospital volume had a minimal effect on either outcome measure. The shift toward out-patient surgery mirrors the shift from open to arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. The finding that surgeon volume is a predictor of revision RCR reflects the findings in other orthopaedic procedures.

### Serious adverse event rates and reoperation after arthroscopic shoulder surgery: population based cohort study [^116k5jnr]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data source

We used data from the admitted patient care database of Hospital Episode Statistics for NHS England. Reporting of all inpatient and day case activity to Hospital Episode Statistics is mandatory for NHS funded care and is based on clinical coding by each hospital. Data are stored according to the UK financial year, from 1 April to 31 March. Each hospital stay can comprise one or several finished consultant episodes of treatment. For each episode, procedures are recorded along with dates using the Office for Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures (OPCS-4) codes. Diagnoses for each episode are recorded using the World Health Organization ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes. Before release for research, datasets are first pseudonymised by NHS Digital and details are restricted for key demographical and geographical fields. History and follow-up admissions are linkable to index events through pseudonymised identifiers. The causes and dates of deaths were available from civil registration mortality data provided by the Office for National Statistics.

Participants

We identified patients aged 16 years or older who underwent an arthroscopic shoulder procedure between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2017. The start date was chosen to coincide with the introduction of a specific code for subacromial decompression in OPCS-4 (version 4.5). The supplementary file provides full details of the OPCS-4 and ICD-10 codes used to include and exclude patients, to group procedures, and to record comorbidities and complications. We excluded patients with a current diagnosis of primary or secondary malignancy of the shoulder girdle, a history of a shoulder girdle fracture or shoulder operation in the preceding six months, or a history of ipsilateral shoulder replacement surgery at any time. Patients with a glenohumeral dislocation in the preceding six months were excluded, except if the index procedure was stabilisation surgery.

### Hospital-based acute care within 7 days of discharge after outpatient arthroscopic shoulder surgery [^117Np9rb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The rate of hospital-based acute care (defined as hospital transfer at discharge, emergency department [ED] visit, or subsequent inpatient hospital [IP] admission) after outpatient procedure is gaining momentum as a quality metric for ambulatory surgery. However, the incidence and reasons for hospital-based acute care after arthroscopic shoulder surgery are poorly understood.

Methods

We studied adult patients who underwent outpatient arthroscopic shoulder procedures in New York State between 2011 and 2013 using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database. ER visits and IP admissions within 7 days of surgery were identified by cross-matching 2 independent Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project databases.

Results

The final cohort included 103,476 subjects. We identified 1867 (1.80%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72%-1.89%) events, and the majority of these encounters were ER visits (1643, or 1.59%, 95% CI, 1.51%-1.66%). Direct IP admission after discharged was uncommon (224, or 0.22%, 95% CI, 0.19%-0.24%). The most common reasons for seeking acute care were musculoskeletal pain (23.78% of all events). Nearly half of all events (43.49%) occurred on the day of surgery or on postoperative day 1. Operative time exceeding 2 hours was associated with higher odds of requiring acute care (odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 99% CI, 1.08–1.51). High-volume surgical centers (OR, 0.67; 99% CI, 0.58–0.78) and regional anesthesia (OR, 0.72; 99% CI, 0.56–0.92) were associated with lower odds of requiring acute care.

Conclusions

The rate of hospital-based acute care after outpatient shoulder arthroscopy was low (1.80%). Complications driving acute care visits often occurred within 1 day of surgery. Many of the events were likely related to surgery and anesthesia (eg, inadequate analgesia), suggesting that anesthesiologists may play a central role in preventing acute care visits after surgery.

### For outpatient rotator cuff surgery, nerve block anesthesia provides superior same-day recovery over general anesthesia [^113ta1pR]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Both general and nerve block anesthesia are effective for shoulder surgery. For outpatient surgery, it is important to determine which technique provides more efficient recovery. The authors' goal was to compare nerve block with general anesthesia with respect to recovery profile and patient satisfaction after rotator cuff surgery.

Methods

In this clinical trial, 50 consenting outpatients (aged 18–70 yr) were randomly assigned to receive either fast-track general anesthesia followed by bupivacaine (0.25%) wound infiltration or interscalene brachial plexus block (0.75% ropivacaine), each under standardized protocols. Blinded recovery room nurses assessed the need for pain treatment and rated patient eligibility for bypass of the phase 1 postanesthesia care unit and for discharge home. Patients were followed up for 2 weeks postoperatively. The primary outcome measures were postanesthesia care unit bypass and same-day discharge. Other same-day recovery outcomes included severity of and treatment for pain and time to ambulation. Postoperative outcomes at home included satisfaction with the anesthesia technique and absence of complications (at 2 weeks).

Results

Patients who received nerve block (vs. general anesthesia) bypassed the postanesthesia care unit more frequently (76 vs. 16%; P < 0.001), reported less pain, ambulated earlier, were ready for home discharge sooner (123 vs. 286 min; P < 0.001), had no unplanned hospital admissions (vs. 4 of 25 patients who underwent general anesthesia; P = 0.05), and were more satisfied with their care. No complications were reported in either treatment group.

Conclusions

Nerve block anesthesia for outpatient rotator cuff surgery provides several same-day recovery advantages over general anesthesia.

### Optimizing outpatient shoulder surgery: a review of anesthetic options [^113VqNL3]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Optimizing pain management after shoulder surgery is important, particularly considering recent trends and motivations toward outpatient shoulder procedures. All options carry a risk/benefit profile, and each patient must receive individualized decisions in conjunction with anesthesia and primary teams with the goal of providing patients with the best possible outcome.

### Revision rates and progression to shoulder arthroplasty after arthroscopic repair of massive rotator cuff tears [^116iVgJr]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

It is important to remember that arthroscopic treatment does not compromise subsequent reverse shoulder arthroplasty if this is needed and the potential impact of previous rotator cuff repair surgery on reverse shoulder arthroplasty outcomes should be considered in future studies for counselling patients and identifying the highest value surgery for elderly patients with large tears. This has been previously investigated, stating that large dataset outcomes after reverse shoulder arthroplasty for rotator cuff repair such as cost, post‐acute care discharge, physical rehabilitation, and readmission rates appear not to be negatively affected by the presence of a prior rotator cuff repair.

Reverse shoulder arthroplasty has been also recognised as a primary treatment option for massive rotator cuff tears, rather than being treated as a revision surgery like in the previously mentioned studies. Despite reverse total shoulder arthroplasty being used primarily in elderly populations, indications for this therapeutic approach have been expanded to younger patients as well. Studies have shown significant improvement in pain relief, function and patient satisfaction among patients aged under 60 or 65 years. Despite these optimistic outcomes, there are notably high rates of complications, thus suggesting the need for alternative treatments. Given a 10 year survivorship of 58% in patients undergoing reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, studies have limited the recommendation for this approach to patients aged over 70 years with low functional demands. This recommendation aligns with other studies who noted clinical and radiological deterioration over time as well as lower rates of return‐to‐sport in patients who underwent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty and were younger than 65 years, emphasising caution in considering reverse shoulder arthroplasty as a primary approach for massive rotator cuff tears. Considering the apprehensions regarding the complications and long‐term outcomes following reverse total shoulder arthroplasty in young patients, minimally invasive and anatomy preserving techniques are most chosen as the primary approach. However, it remains uncertain whether the outcomes of these arthroscopic procedures are comparable or superior to those of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty and if there is an actual clinical benefit in repairing the tear with an initial less invasive approach, rather than moving straight to an arthroplasty.

### Missed short-term follow-up after arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery: analysis of surgical and demographic factors [^113aDsKS]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Missed postoperative orthopaedic outpatient follow-up has been associated not only with patient dissatisfaction and difficulty in timely identification of potential complications but also with provider dissatisfaction, wasted healthcare resources, and disruption of clinical research efforts. In addition to its effect on assessing clinical outcomes, being lost to follow-up (LTFU) can negatively affect statistical power and represents a possible source of bias in research. In a systematic review by Somerson et al, the authors evaluated 448 clinical orthopaedic studies that reported on LTFU. They reported a mean LTFU rate in orthopaedic randomized controlled trials of 10.4%, with studies having longer follow-up periods and those performed in the United States at higher risk. In a multicenter study evaluating LTFU after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, with LTFU defined as failure to complete 2-year patient reported outcomes, the authors determined an 88% follow-up rate. Independent risk factors of increased LTFU included male sex and non-White race. Another randomized controlled trial of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with or without lateral extra-articular tenodesis reported a similar LTFU rate, although the independent risk factors included current or previous smokers, those employed part-time, and those with body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m². Most of the existing orthopaedic literature regarding LTFU has focused on total hip and knee arthroplasty, trauma, hand fractures, and hand/upper extremity surgerywith fewer studies evaluating the prevalence and risk factors of LTFU after shoulder arthroplastyand arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

### Patient outcomes as a function of shoulder surgeon volume: a systematic review [^116c6WPZ]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine surgical complications, length of stay, surgical time, cost, revision rates, clinical outcomes, current surgical trends. and minimum number of cases in relationship to surgeon volume for shoulder arthroplasty and rotator cuff repair.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of studies using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. All studies that met inclusion criteria from January 1990 to January 2016 were included. Inclusion criteria included Level IV evidence or greater, contained specific surgeon volume, and were written in or translated into English. Exclusion criteria included non-English manuscripts, abstracts, and review papers. A written protocol was used to extract relevant data and evaluate study results. Data extracted included volume-specific data pertaining to length of stay, operating time, complications, and cost.

Results

A total of 10 studies were included. Seven studies evaluated arthroplasty with 88,740 shoulders, and 3 studies evaluated rotator cuff repair with 63,535 shoulders. Variation was seen in how studies defined low- versus high-volume surgeon. For arthroplasty, < 5 cases per year met the criteria for a low-volume surgeon and were associated with increased length of stay, longer operating room time, increased in-hospital complications, and increased cost. Mortality was not significantly increased. In rotator cuff surgery, < 12 surgeries per year met the criteria for low volume and were associated with increased length of stay, increased operating room time, and increase in reoperation rate.

Conclusions

Our systematic review demonstrates increased surgical complications, length of stay, surgical time, and surgical cost in shoulder arthroplasty and rotator cuff repair when performed by a low-volume shoulder surgeon, which is defined by those performing < 5 arthroplasties and/or < 12 rotator cuff repairs per year.

### Association between surgeon volume and patient outcomes after elective shoulder replacement surgery using data from the national joint registry and hospital episode statistics for england: population based cohort study [^111qg9Af]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and data sources

In this population based cohort study we used routinely collected hospital and joint registry data in the UK from 1 April 2012 to 31 December 2020. All shoulder replacements recorded by the National Joint Registry of England, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, and Guernsey were considered for the study. Records for England were linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care database managed by NHS Digital. Data submission to the National Joint Registry is mandatory for all shoulder replacement procedures in the public and private sectors in the areas covered by the registry and include detailed data on patients, surgeons, and operations. The Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care database records all inpatient and day case activity carried out by NHS hospitals and NHS funded care in England and contains demographic data, medical diagnoses, and procedural and administrative information. Hospital Episode Statistics data are used to ensure accurate remuneration to NHS providers for their activities. Data were linked to the Civil Registration Mortality database.

We used unlinked National Joint Registry data to analyse the effect of surgeon volume on revision surgery. Linked National Joint Registry and Hospital Episode Statistics data were used to analyse the effect of surgeon volume on serious adverse events, reoperations, and prolonged hospital stay (> 3 nights).

Selection criteria

All consenting adults aged 18 years or older who had a primary shoulder replacement were eligible for inclusion in the study. We included patients if their surgical history was consistent (ie, their date of revision or death did not pre-date their primary surgery) and did not contain duplicates. Calculations of surgeon volume took into account shoulder replacement surgery for both acute trauma and elective indications, capturing all shoulder replacement activity contributing to surgeon experience. However, patients who require surgery for acute trauma represent a distinct cohort with more variable outcomes arising from their unique presentation and associated injuries, so we only included procedures for elective indications in subsequent analysis. We included patients if the primary surgeon or assistant surgeon for their procedure was a consultant, and we excluded patients when the main surgical indication was malignancy. We also excluded patients scheduled for surgery with a consultant who had fewer than 365 days of National Joint Registry data, as we were unable to calculate the surgeon's annual volume.

### Establishing maximal medical improvement after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair [^1175VFsH]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

As health care transitions from a pay-for-service to a pay-for-performance infrastructure, the value of orthopaedic care must be defined accurately. Significant efforts have been made in defining quality and cost in arthroplasty; however, there remains a lag in ambulatory orthopaedic care.

Purpose

Two-year follow-up has been a general requirement for reporting outcomes after rotator cuff repair. However, this time requirement has not been established scientifically and is of increasing importance in the era of value-based health care. Given that arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is a common ambulatory orthopaedic procedure, the purpose of this study was to establish a time frame for maximal medical improvement (the state when improvement has stabilized) after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was conducted, identifying studies reporting sequential patient-reported outcomes up to a minimum of 2 years after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. The primary clinical outcome was patient-reported outcomes at 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. Secondary clinical outcomes included range of motion, strength, retears, and complications. Clinically significant improvement was determined between various time intervals by use of the minimal clinically important difference.

Results

The review included 19 studies including 1370 patients who underwent rotator cuff repair. Clinically significant improvement in patient-reported outcomes was seen up to 1 year after rotator cuff repair, but no clinical significance was noted from 1 year to 2 years. The majority of improvement in strength and range of motion was seen up to 6 months, but no clinically meaningful improvement was seen thereafter. All reported complications and the majority of retears occurred within 6 months after rotator cuff repair.

Conclusion

After rotator cuff repair, a clinically significant improvement in patient-reported outcomes, range of motion, and strength was seen up to 1 year after surgery, but not beyond this. This information is important not only to establish appropriate patient expectations but also to determine a time frame for outcome collection after surgery to better define value in orthopaedic care.

### Preoperative management of patients with chronic moderate to severe shoulder pain to improve postoperative outcomes: a systematic review [^112XwYAa]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding shoulder function after RCR, preoperative WORC index, which records signs, symptoms and limitations associated with rotator cuff diseases, and preoperative Constant-Murley score in the contralateral shoulder, were the strongest prognostic factors for increased WORC index at 2-year follow-up (OCEBM Level III), as usually rotator cuff tears reflect the degenerative disease affecting both shoulders. Previous surgery in the ipsilateral or contralateral shoulder, smoking, partial RCR, preoperative pain and atrophy in the infraspinatus were all independent factors negatively associated with functional outcomes (OCEBM Level III). Although not all these factors are modifiable, proper selection of patients may lead to successful functional surgery outcomes.

High preoperative pain levels and worse preoperative functional scores have been associated with higher opioid consumption, catastrophism, and humor alterations postoperatively (OCEBM Level III). Conversely, older age is reported as a protective factor for narcotic consumption (OCEBM Level III). Sleep disturbance has been reported in patients with rotator cuff tears, and although it generally improves after surgery, preoperative and prolonged postoperative narcotic use negatively impacts sleep (OCEBM Level III). While both pain intensity and opioid use are associated with sleep disturbances, opioid dependence can affect sleep architecture independently. Sleep disturbance may even be a motivation for opioid consumption. Therefore, when possible, counseling patients to discontinue narcotics before surgery and as soon as possible after surgery may improve sleep problems.

This systematic review only identified one guideline — PROSPECT — focused on postoperative pain management. Nevertheless, it includes some recommendations in line with the evidence reviewed, such as preoperative administration of acetaminophen, cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and intravenous dexamethasone and perioperative interscalene block or suprascapular nerve block, to improve postoperative shoulder pain (OCEBM Level I). It also highlights the limited evidence regarding the perioperative use of gabapentin. PROSPECT guideline recommends an arthroscopic approach over mini-open repair of rotator cuff tears (Grade B). Our review only identified one cohort study in this regard which found no differences between arthroscopic and open surgery in terms of postoperative shoulder pain level.

Psycho-educational interventions, such as preoperative teaching and thorough postoperative follow-up, have demonstrated to improve pain intensity and minimize the impact of pain on shoulder function in several RCTs (OCEBM Level II). Nevertheless, to be effective, preoperative teaching about pain and pain management should be conducted a few minutes or the day before surgery, and ideally involving a family member.

### Determining the validity of the outpatient arthroplasty risk assessment (OARA) tool for identifying patients for safe same-day discharge after primary shoulder arthroplasty [^111JrVWw]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Early discharge has been a target of cost-control efforts given the growing demand for joint replacement surgery. The Outpatient Arthroplasty Risk Assessment (OARA) score, a medically based risk-assessment score, has shown high predictive ability in achieving safe early discharge following outpatient lower-extremity arthroplasty using a score threshold initially set at ≤ 59 points but more recently adapted to ≤ 79 points. However, no study has been performed using the OARA tool for shoulder replacement, which has been shown to have lower associated medical risks than lower-extremity arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine the OARA score threshold for same-day discharge (SDD) following shoulder arthroplasty and evaluate its effectiveness in selecting patients for SDD. We hypothesized that the OARA score threshold for shoulder arthroplasty would be higher than that for lower-extremity arthroplasty.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 422 patients who underwent primary anatomic or reverse shoulder arthroplasty between April 2018 and October 2019 performed by a single surgeon. As standard practice, all patients were counseled preoperatively regarding SDD and given the choice to stay overnight. Medical history, length of stay, and 90-day readmissions were obtained from medical records. Analysis of variance testing and screening test characteristics compared the performance of the OARA score vs. the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) class and a previously published OARA score threshold used to define a low risk of outpatient lower-extremity arthroplasty.

Results

A preoperative OARA score cutoff of ≤ 110 points demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.0% for identifying patients with SDD after shoulder arthroplasty, compared with 66.7% using the hip and knee OARA score threshold of ≤ 59 points (P < .0001) and 80.4% using ASA-PS class ≤ 2 (P = 0.008). OARA scores ≤ 110 points also showed a negative predictive value of 98.9% and a false-negative rate of 2.0% but remained incomprehensive with a specificity of 24.0% (P < .0001). Analysis of variance demonstrated that mean OARA scores increased significantly with length of stay (P = 0.001) compared with ASA-PS classes (P = 0.82). Patients with OARA scores ≤ 110 points were also 2.5 times less likely to have 90-day emergency department visits (P = 0.04) than those with OARA scores > 110 points. There was no difference in 30- and 90-day readmission rates for patients with OARA scores ≤ 59 points, OARA scores ≤ 110 points, and ASA-PS classes ≤ 2.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that a preoperative OARA score threshold of ≤ 110 points is effective and conservative in screening patients for SDD following shoulder arthroplasty, with low rates of 90-day emergency department visits and readmissions. This threshold is a useful screening tool to identify patients who are not good candidates for SDD.

### Trial protocol for the arthroscopic rotator cuff trial… [^114YfueR]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Operative treatment includes rotator cuff surgery followed by postoperative rehabilitation. Nonoperative treatment includes physical therapy only. Blinding to treatment will not be performed given that only 1 group will undergo surgery, and it would be difficult to blind patients and physicians to a surgical intervention. We do not have a placebo or sham surgery group because such a design would make the trial not feasible. Complication risks and postoperative pain experienced after sham arthroscopy are additional concerns. Institutional review board approval was obtained via the single IRB mechanism SMART IRB, with Vanderbilt serving as the IRB of record. 30 Participating institutions in the ARC trial ceded reliance to the Vanderbilt IRB for review and approval of the study as well as any subsequent amendments. Written informed consent is obtained from every participant.

This report follows the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials reporting guideline. The inclusion criteria for the ARC trial are as follows: age 50 years or older to younger than 85 years; shoulder pain and/or loss of active motion, strength, or function; magnetic resonance imaging –confirmed partial- or full-thickness supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus tear of 4 cm or less in longitudinal dimension; medical fitness for surgery 31; and ability and willingness to provide informed consent. The multicenter trial started recruitment in 2018 with a 1-year follow-up duration. Study participants are recruited in sports medicine and shoulder clinics of designated recruiting physicians at each site. Recruiting physicians determine the eligibility of patients to participate in the trial.

The diagnosis of an MRI-confirmed rotator cuff tear is required for a patient to be enrolled and randomized. Nonoperative and operative interventions for ARC are consistent with routine clinical standards of care for rotator cuff tears. Information is collected on the specific surgical techniques used, such as number of anchors and type of repair. Any concomitant procedures that are performed, such as subacromial decompression and acromioclavicular joint resection, are also noted. The operating surgeon determines whether a patient may need concomitant or alternate shoulder surgical procedures. The recruiting surgeon completes a standardized postsurgery report form noting details of the surgery and intraoperative observations of tear size, location, and shape; tendon quality and retraction; and cuff repair performed.

### Risk factors for short-term complications after rotator cuff repair in the United States [^11788FFB]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To use a population-level dataset to evaluate the rate of 30-day complications after rotator cuff repair, and to evaluate the risk factors for complication and unplanned hospital readmission.

Methods

We used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2011 to 2015 to identify patients who underwent rotator cuff repair and concomitant procedures using Current Procedural Terminology codes. Postoperative complications and unplanned hospital readmissions were identified. Patient demographics, medical comorbidities, and perioperative variables were used in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify the risk factors for infection, any complication, and unplanned hospital readmission.

Results

A total of 23,741 patients were identified who underwent rotator cuff repair. Overall, 1.39% of patients experienced at least 1 complication, with 0.66% minor complications and 0.85% major complications. Unplanned readmission occurred in 1.16% of patients. Infection was the most common complication, occurring in 0.3% of patients (n = 72), and was the most common reason for return to the operating room. Open rotator cuff repair and male gender were independent risk factors for all outcomes. Increased age and numerous medical comorbidities were associated with the risk of any complication or unplanned hospital readmission.

Conclusions

Rotator cuff repair has a low incidence of short-term complications. Infection was the most common complication. Open repair, male gender, increased age, and medical comorbidities all significantly increased the risk of complications and hospital readmission.

### Trends and outcomes of outpatient total shoulder arthroplasty after its removal from CMS's inpatient-only list [^117W1jqW]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In January 2021, the US Medicare program approved reimbursement of outpatient total shoulder arthroplasties (TSA), including anatomic and reverse TSAs. It remains unclear whether shifting TSAs from the inpatient to outpatient setting has affected clinical outcomes. Herein, we describe the rate of outpatient TSA growth and compare inpatient and outpatient TSA complications, readmissions, and mortality.

Methods

Medicare fee-for-service claims for 2019-2022Q1 were analyzed to identify the trends in outpatient TSAs and to compare 90-day postoperative complications, all-cause hospital readmissions, and mortality between outpatients and inpatients. Outpatient cases were defined as those discharged on the same day of the surgery. To reduce the COVID-19 pandemic's impact and selection bias, we excluded 2020Q2-Q4 data and used propensity scores to match 2021-2022Q1 outpatients with inpatients from the same period (the primary analysis) and from 2019-2020Q1 (the secondary analysis), respectively. We performed both propensity score-matched and -weighted multivariate analyses to compare outcomes between the two groups. Covariates included sociodemographics, preoperative diagnosis, comorbid conditions, the Hierarchical Condition Category risk score, prior year hospital/skilled nursing home admissions, annual surgeon volume, and hospital characteristics.

Results

Nationally, the proportion of outpatient TSAs increased from 3% (619) in 2019Q1 to 22% (3456) in 2021Q1 and 38% (6778) in 2022Q1. A total of 55,166 cases were identified for the primary analysis (14,540 outpatients and 40,576 inpatients). Overall, glenohumeral osteoarthritis was the most common indication for surgery (70.8%), followed by rotator cuff pathology (14.6%). The unadjusted rates of complications (1.3 vs 2.4%, P < .001), readmissions (3.7 vs 6.1%, P < .001), and mortality (0.2 vs 0.4%, P = 0.024) were significantly lower among outpatient TSAs than inpatient TSAs. Using 1:1 nearest matching, 12,703 patient pairs were identified. Propensity score-matched multivariate analyses showed similar rates of postoperative complications, hospital readmissions, and mortality between outpatients and inpatients. Propensity score-weighted multivariate analyses resulted in similar conclusions. The secondary analysis showed a lower hospital readmission rate in outpatients (odds ratio: 0.8, P < .001).

Conclusions

There has been accelerated growth in outpatient TSAs since 2019. Outpatient and inpatient TSAs have similar rates of postoperative complication, hospital readmission, and mortality.

### Editorial commentary: repair is efficacious for acute rotator cuff tears in patients over 65 despite advanced age, and early repair is better [^112iZYYB]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Although indications for rotator cuff repair are still controversial, common practice is to be more aggressive with surgery as a first-line treatment in patients with acute rotator cuff tears. Both functional outcomes and healing are better with earlier repair, and a healed tendon limits the progression of permanent degenerative changes, including tear progression, fatty infiltration, and progression to cuff tear arthropathy. But what about elderly patients? For those that are physically and medically fit for surgery, there may still be benefit to earlier surgical repair. For those not physically or medically fit for surgery, or those who decline, a short trial of conservative care and repair for those who fail with conservative treatment is still efficacious.

### Ambulatory surgical centers: a review of complications and adverse events [^113UkKMA]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

An increasing number of orthopaedic surgeries are performed at ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), as is exemplified by the 272% population-adjusted increase in outpatient rotator cuff repairs from 1996 to 2006. Outpatient surgery is convenient for patients and cost effective for the healthcare system. The rate of complications and adverse events following orthopaedic surgeries at ASCs ranges from 0.05% to 20%. The most common complications are pain and nausea, followed by infection, impaired healing, and bleeding; these are affected by surgical and patient risk factors. The most important surgeon-controlled factors are surgical time, type of anesthesia, and site of surgery, whereas the key patient comorbidities are advanced age, female sex, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, and high body mass index. As the use of ASCs continues to rise, an understanding of risk factors and outcomes becomes increasingly important to guide indications for and management of orthopaedic surgery in the outpatient setting.

### Reviewing the risk of hospital readmission after total shoulder arthroplasty [^112M4teE]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

This article assesses the shoulder surgery literature relating to unplanned hospital readmissions following primary total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). With increasing demand for TSA and the challenges posed by unplanned hospital readmissions, it is essential to have a concrete understanding of the risk factors and implications of readmissions. Patient Intrinsic and Extrinsic factors such as patient demographics, comorbidities, and surgical variables contribute to readmission risk. Despite low overall readmission rates, the negative patient health, financial, and resource burdens of unplanned readmissions remain significant. This study emphasizes the importance of developing targeted interventions to minimize readmission risks and improve patient outcomes.

### Factors affecting length of stay, readmission, and revision after shoulder arthroplasty: a population-based study [^1126RVUb]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Increased length of hospital stay, hospital readmission, and revision surgery are adverse outcomes that increase the cost of elective orthopaedic procedures, such as shoulder arthroplasty. Awareness of the factors related to these adverse outcomes will help surgeons and medical centers design strategies for minimizing their occurrence and for managing their associated costs.

Methods

We analyzed data from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System on 17,311 primary shoulder arthroplasties performed from 1998 to 2011 to identify factors associated with extended lengths of hospitalization after surgery, readmission within ninety days, and surgical revision.

Results

The factors associated with each of these three adverse outcomes were different. Longer lengths of hospital stay were associated with female sex, advanced patient age, Medicaid insurance, comorbidities, fracture as the diagnosis for arthroplasty, higher hospital case volumes, and lower surgeon case volumes. Readmission was associated with advanced patient age and medical comorbidities. The most common diagnoses for readmission within ninety days were fluid and electrolyte imbalance (28%), acute pulmonary problems (21%), cardiac arrhythmia (20%), heart failure (15%), acute myocardial infarction (10%), and urinary tract infection (10%). Revision was associated with younger patient age and osteoarthritis or traumatic arthritis. The most common diagnoses at the time of revision surgery were unspecified mechanical complications of the implant (60%), shoulder pain (18%), dislocation of the prosthetic joint (12%), component loosening (10%), a broken prosthesis (8%), a cuff tear (7%), and infection (7%).

Conclusions

A small number of easily identified characteristics (sex, age, race, insurance type, comorbidities, diagnosis, and provider case volumes) were significantly associated with longer lengths of stay, readmission, and revision surgery. Consideration of these factors and their effects may guide efforts to improve patient safety and to manage the costs associated with these adverse outcomes.

### Increased perioperative complication rates in patients with solid organ transplants following rotator cuff repair [^114Jw54k]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Rotator cuff repair is the second most common soft tissue procedure performed in orthopedics. Additionally, an increasing percentage of the population has received a solid organ transplant (SOT). The chronic use of immunosuppressants as well as a high prevalence of medical comorbidities in this population are both important risk factors when considering surgical intervention. The purpose of this study is to determine the demographic profile, comorbidity profile, and perioperative complication rate of SOT patients undergoing inpatient rotator cuff repair surgery compared to nontransplanted patients.

Methods

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was queried from years 2002–2017 to identify all patients who underwent inpatient rotator cuff repair (n = 144,528 weighted). This group was further divided into SOT (n = 286 weighted) and nontransplant (n = 144,242 weighted) cohorts. Demographic and comorbidity analyses were performed between these groups. Additionally, a matched cohort of nontransplanted patients controlled for the year of procedure, age, sex, race, income, and hospital region was created in a 1:1 ratio to the SOT group (n = 286 each) for perioperative complication rate analysis.

Results

Compared to nontransplanted patients, SOT patients were more likely to have at least 1 significant medical comorbidity (98% vs. 69%, P < .001), had a higher number of total comorbidities (3.1 vs. 1.4, P < .001), and had a higher Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index (2.6 vs. 0.54, P < .001). Compared to the matched cohort, SOT patients experienced longer hospital stays (2.9 vs. 1.8 days, P < .001), higher surgery costs ($12,031 vs. $8476, P < .001), and were more likely to experience a perioperative complication (24% vs. 3%, P < .001) with an odds ratio of 7.7 (95% confidence interval: 3.9–15.1).

Conclusion

Compared with nontransplanted patients, SOT patients undergoing rotator cuff repair had a significantly higher comorbidity index, longer hospital stays, costlier surgeries, and were > 7 times more likely to experience a perioperative complication. With nearly a quarter of all SOT patients experiencing a perioperative complication following rotator cuff repair, careful consideration for surgery as well as increased postoperative surveillance should be considered in this unique population.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^111ma5E9]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative pain management after rotator cuff repair — Multimodal analgesia programs or non-opioid individual modalities can be considered to provide added benefit for postoperative pain management following rotator cuff repair, with Quality of Evidence: Moderate and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Supporting studies include a high-quality comparison after open shoulder surgery in which patient-controlled interscalene block (PCISB) showed significantly better pain outcomes, fentanyl consumption, and averages for nausea and/or vomiting than patient-controlled IV opioid-based analgesia (PCA); a high-quality arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery study where a multimodal non-opiate IV program (ketorolac, gabapentin, methocarbamol, acetaminophen) during the early post-operative period (post-op days 1–10) produced significantly lower average days of constipation and nausea and lower pain on postoperative days 1 and 4 versus oxycodone; and a moderate-quality arthroscopic rotator cuff repair study in which subacromial patient-controlled analgesia (SA-PCA w/ ropivacaine) yielded significantly better requested bolus dose at 8hrs postop, frequency of bolus dose at 4 hours postop, postop nausea, VAS (visual analog scale) Pain at 1hr postop, and postop patient satisfaction than intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA w/ fentanyl, ketorolac, and ondansetron).

### The clinical efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in perioperative rehabilitation of rotator cuff repair surgery: a protocol for a single-centre, randomized controlled trial [^112J3BLv]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Pain is one of the main complications after rotator cuff repair. If acute postoperative pain is not effectively controlled, it may lead to chronic persistent pain after surgery. Electroacupuncture (EA) is an effective tool for pain control. However, EA specifically for alleviating postoperative pain after rotator cuff repair has not been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This pilot study aims to design a RCT to assess the efficacy and safety of EA as an adjunctive therapy during the perioperative period of rotator cuff repair.

Patients and Methods

This single-center, subject-and-assessor-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial will enroll 112 participants diagnosed with rotator cuff tears and who are scheduled to undergo unilateral arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). Participants will be allocated at a 1:1 ratio to receive either EA or sham electroacupuncture (SEA) (using blunt-tip needles and no electrical current). Treatments will be will be administered 2 hours before surgery, 2 hours after surgery and once daily for the following surgery for 2 days (4 treatment sessions in total), and then be followed up for another 1 week. The primary outcome is the changes in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for resting pain in the affected shoulder. The secondary outcome measures include VAS scores for pain during movement of the affected shoulder, limb swelling scores, dosage of postoperative analgesic drugs, frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting, heart rate and blood pressure after the operation, sleep quality during the hospital stay.

Conclusion

This pilot study will discuss whether EA is a valuable adjunct in postoperative care at relieving pain and improving patients' quality of life. This RCT will inform the design of a further full-scale trial.

### Assessment of the impact of gabapentin on postoperative pain following shoulder open rotator cuff repair: a double-blind clinical trial [^113aCbZo]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant used for managing neuropathic pain. Its effectiveness and dosing strategies for postoperative pain, particularly in open shoulder rotator cuff repair, are still debated. This study assesses gabapentin's impact on postoperative pain intensity in open rotator cuff repair.

Methods

Sixty eligible patients were randomly distributed into 2 groups: placebo and gabapentin. The gabapentin group received a daily dose of 600 mg, administered in 2 divided increments, beginning 3 days before the surgery and continuing for 1 week postoperatively. Pain intensity, assessed via the Visual Analog Scale, was the primary endpoint during the first postoperative week. Secondary aims conducted on both groups included quantifying opioid consumption, evaluation of side effects attributed to gabapentin and opioids, assessment of sleep quality, and patients' satisfaction levels with the employed approach.

Result

Postoperative pain in the gabapentin group significantly decreased from the first 24 hours until the fourth day postsurgery (P < .002), accompanied by reduced opioid consumption (P = 0.02). Following discharge, the prevalence of nocturnal sleep disruptions and oxycodone consumption in the gabapentin group notably decreased compared to the placebo group, alongside a significant improvement in sleep quality and duration until the fifth day, as well as overall satisfaction with the pain management approach seen within the gabapentin group (P = 0.003).

Conclusion

Administering gabapentin perioperatively at 600 mg daily and divided over a minimum duration of 4 days postoperatively may significantly reduce postoperative pain intensity and opioid consumption in open shoulder rotator cuff repair surgery patients.

### Influence of provider volume on length of stay, operating room time, and discharge status for rotator cuff repair [^113WCoor]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Length of hospital stay, operating room time, and disposition of patient on discharge are important determinants of health care resource utilization. We examined the relationship between these determinants and hospital/surgeon volume for rotator cuff repair. A total of 9,973 patients undergoing rotator cuff repair were extracted from the New York State Ambulatory Surgery Databases for the years 1997 through 2000. Surgeon volume and hospital volume were divided into low-, intermediate-, and high-volume categories. Multivariate regression models were used to estimate the risk-adjusted association between provider volume and outcomes. Patients operated on by low-volume surgeons had significantly higher likelihood for an extended length of stay when compared with those operated on by high-volume surgeons (adjusted odds ratio for extended length of stay, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–4.4). There was a linear trend for a higher proportion of routine patient discharge with increasing surgeon volume. The mean operating room times for low- and intermediate-volume surgeons were significantly higher than that for high-volume surgeons (P < .001). We conclude that high-volume providers use health care resources more efficiently.

### Unplanned emergency and urgent care visits after outpatient orthopaedic surgery [^115ueFos]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

After Institutional Review Board approval, all patients treated within a large metropolitan healthcare system between 2012 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed for an outpatient orthopaedic procedure. This healthcare system provides both insurance and care delivery to its patients. Patients included were 18 to 85 years, discharged on the same day as their procedure, and insured by the healthcare system. Unexpected admissions, before discharge from a planned outpatient procedure, were excluded. This was validated against the healthcare systems insurance database. Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) procedures were excluded because these procedures were not consistently being done in the outpatient setting of this healthcare system until 2016. Consequently, there were not an adequate number of procedures done for a meaningful analysis. Furthermore, in this healthcare system, most outpatient spinal procedures are done by neurosurgeons and not orthopaedic specialists and therefore were excluded as well.

Each procedure was processed as a unique episode of care and identified in the database through current procedural terminology (CPT) codes. The study cohort was first divided into procedural classifications as arthrodesis, arthroscopy, distal extremity, infection, and orthopaedic trauma. The arthroscopy grouping included all arthroscopic procedures involving the knee (anterior cruciate ligament [ACL] and meniscus), shoulder, (rotator cuff repair and labral repair), and elbow or hip. All hand and wrist and foot and ankle procedures that required an open surgical approach were classified under the distal extremity grouping. The trauma grouping included upper and lower extremity fracture care treated between day 1 to 3 weeks from injury. The study cohort was also divided into seven anatomical surgical regions: arm, foot and ankle, hand and wrist, hip, knee, leg, and shoulder and elbow. The healthcare system's electronic medical record (EMR) was queried to collect demographic characteristics including age, sex, body mass index, native language, the need for an interpreter, marital or living status, and smoking history (Table 1).

### Serious adverse event rates and reoperation after arthroscopic shoulder surgery: population based cohort study [^112Vr6yW]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To provide clinicians and patients with accurate risk estimates of serious adverse events after common elective shoulder arthroscopic procedures, including reoperation within one year.

Design

Population based cohort study.

Setting

Hospital Episode Statistics for NHS England, including civil registration mortality data from the Office for National Statistics.

Participants

288250 arthroscopic shoulder procedures performed in 261248 patients aged ≥ 16 years between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2017. Elective procedures were grouped into subacromial decompression, rotator cuff repair, acromioclavicular joint excision, glenohumeral stabilisation, and frozen shoulder release.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcomes were rates of serious adverse events (mortality, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, stroke, and urinary tract infection) requiring inpatient care within 90 days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes were specific adverse event rates at 90 days, and reoperations (including for deep infection) within one year.

Results

The overall rate of complications within 90 days after arthroscopic shoulder surgery (including reoperation) was low at 1.2% (95% confidence interval 1.2% to 1.3%), with one in 81 patients at risk, and varied according to type of procedure, from 0.6% (0.5% to 0.8%) for glenohumeral stabilisation to 1.7% (1.5% to 1.8%) for frozen shoulder release. After adjustment for age, comorbidities, and sex, no effect of procedure type was observed. Pneumonia was the most common adverse event (0.3%, 0.3% to 0.4%), with one in 303 patients at risk. Pulmonary embolic events were rare, at 0.1% (0.1% to 0.1%), with one in 1428 patients at risk. At one year, the overall rate for reoperation was 3.8% (3.8% to 3.9%), with one in 26 patients at risk, ranging from 2.7% (2.5% to 3.0%) for glenohumeral stabilisation to 5.7% (5.4% to 6.1%) for frozen shoulder release. The overall rate of further surgery for deep infection was low, at 0.1% (0.1% to 0.1%), with one in 1111 patients at risk, but was higher after rotator cuff repair (0.2%, 0.2% to 0.2%), with one in 526 patients at risk. Over the study period the number of arthroscopic shoulder procedures increased, except for subacromial decompression, which decreased.

Conclusions

The findings of this study suggest that risks of serious adverse events associated with common shoulder arthroscopy procedures are low. Nevertheless, serious complications do occur, and include the risk of reoperation in one in 26 patients within one year.

### Editorial commentary: has the pendulum swung yet again? Allowing early active motion after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair [^111L2pz7]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

The optimal duration and extent of immobilization during the immediate postoperative period after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair are unknown. The current noninferiority study has shown that early active motion to tolerance can be just as effective as immobilization without increasing the failure rate, allowing for convenience and comfort in performing activities of daily living in the early postoperative period. However, further study is needed to determine which factors are most important to maintain repair integrity to optimize outcomes.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^115yRG4u]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Methods — rotator cuff injuries clinical practice guideline: This clinical practice guideline evaluates the management of rotator cuff injuries and patient outcomes. It was prepared by the AAOS Rotator Cuff Injuries physician development group with the assistance of the AAOS Clinical Quality and Value (CQV) Department, and the development group held an introductory meeting on August 20, 2023 to establish scope and created PICO Questions (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) that directed the literature search, which the AAOS Medical Librarian created and executed. The systematic review begins with a comprehensive search of the literature; articles considered were published prior to the start date of the search in a minimum of three electronic databases — PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials — and the medical librarian conducts the search using key terms determined from the group's PICO questions. A CQV methodologist will review/include only primary literature, supplement the electronic search with a manual search of the bibliographies of secondary literature sources such as systematic reviews as available, then evaluate all recalled articles for possible inclusion based on the study selection criteria and summarize the evidence for the guideline workgroup who assist with reconciling possible errors and omissions. A study attrition diagram is provided, and the search strategy used to identify abstracts is included in eAppendix 1 of the CPG documents. The quality of evidence for a recommendation is determined by the quality and quantity of included literature for the statement, and statements with evidence from two or more "High" quality studies are considered to have "High".

Regarding surgical interventions for shoulder osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to total shoulder arthroplasty (outcomes and discharge), AAOS 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- older age at the time of surgery is associated with lower revision rates

- gender is not associated with better or worse postoperative outcomes

- obesity is not associated with higher rates of early postoperative complications

- smoking is associated with inferior postoperative outcomes

- depression is associated with inferior postoperative outcomes

- more comorbidities are associated with higher rates of early postoperative complications

- while both higher and lower preoperative functioning patients will likely experience improvement following arthroplasty, patients with higher preoperative function may experience less functional improvement.

### The transition to outpatient shoulder arthroplasty: a systematic review [^115CGX5o]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Hypothesis

Transitioning shoulder arthroplasty (SA) from an inpatient to outpatient procedure is associated with increased patient satisfaction and potentially decreased costs; however, concerns exist about complications following same-day discharge. We hypothesized that outpatient SA would be associated with low rates of failed discharges, readmissions, and complications, rendering it a safe and effective option for SA.

Methods

A systematic review of the outpatient SA literature identified 16 of 447 studies with level III and IV evidence that met the inclusion criteria with at least 90 days of follow-up. Data on patient demographic characteristics, preoperative and postoperative protocols, surgery characteristics, failed discharges, complications, and readmissions were collected and pooled for analysis.

Results

A total of 990 patients were included in our analysis. Many studies identified specific institutional protocols for determining eligibility for outpatient SA, including preoperative clearance from an anesthesiologist; identification of a perioperative caretaker; and exclusion of patients based on cardiac, pulmonary, or hematologic risk factors. Failed same-day discharge occurred in only 0.9% of patients (7 of 788), and 2.1% of patients (9 of 418) and 0.79% of patients (2 of 252) presented to an emergency department or urgent care facility for a perioperative concern. The readmission rate for periprosthetic fracture, arthrofibrosis, infection, subscapularis rupture, and anterior subluxation was 1.3% (7 of 529 patients). Complications occurred in 7.0% of patients (70 of 990), with 5.4% of patients (53 of 990) experiencing a surgical complication and 1.7% (17 of 990) having a medical complication. There were 28 total reoperations (2.9%, 28 of 955 patients).

Discussion and Conclusion

Outpatient SA is associated with low rates of failed discharges, readmissions, and complications. Additionally, the medical and surgical complications that occur after outpatient SA are unlikely to be prevented by the short inpatient stay characteristic of traditional SA. With careful screening measures to identify appropriate candidates for same-day discharge, outpatient SA represents a safe approach to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and to decrease costs associated with SA.

### Editorial commentary: doc, is It all in my head? With rotator cuff tears, It partially is! [^114j5aK2]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Psychosocial factors including anxiety, depression, and poor mental health negatively influence the baseline clinical expression of rotator cuff tearing. The same factors may influence clinical outcomes after rotator cuff repair surgery. Counseling patients preoperatively about postoperative expectations of rotator cuff repair surgery has a substantial positive impact on postoperative functional outcomes. As surgeons, we need to take the time to not just be technicians but counsel our patients and consider the impact of distress, anxiety, and expectations on the success of our treatments for rotator cuff tears.

### NCT03425500 | Massive rotator cuff tear reconstruction… [^111EbQj2]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Massive Rotator Cuff Tear Reconstruction ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview A total of 60 patients will be enrolled in the study. In the pre-operative period, there will be no additional time requirements for the patient, except for the informed consent process for the study. Routine radiographs including an AP and Y view of the shoulder as well as a pre-operative MRI are obtained for all patients undergoing rotator cuff surgery. All patients will undergo a 15-point arthroscopic shoulder examination as per the method outlined by Snyder. An arthroscopic acromioplasty will be performed if needed according to the technique described by Snyder. The bursal side of the tear will be evaluated. If the cuff can be re-approximated to its anatomic position on the greater tuberosity without excessive tension, a standard rotator cuff reconstruction will be attempted.

If this is not possible the surgeon will determine that the cuff is "irreparable" and the randomization envelope will be opened. Postoperative protocol The shoulder will be immobilized in a sling for one week postoperatively, and only passive forward flexion and external rotation will be allowed for eight weeks. The patient then progresses to active shoulder motion. Strengthening will begin at twelve weeks postoperatively. The patient will follow-up with the attending surgeon at 2 weeks post-operatively for a wound check. Then further follow-up appointments will be at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 and 24 months, as per current clinical practice. At the 3, 6, 12, and 24 month visits the patient will again undergo the structured clinical examination conducted by a sports medicine fellowship trained orthopaedic consultant who is blinded to the patients' treatment group. The patient will also complete the questionnaire at these follow-up appointments.

Radiograph will be taken also to obtain the postoperative measurements. MRI will be done to assess healing at 12 months. Procedure: Bridging Rotator Cuff Reconstruction Procedure: Superior Capsular Reconstruction Device: GRAFTJACKET™ allograft

years. Surgical techniques have advanced over time but the rehabilitation after surgery has not. This is problematic because rehabilitation is key to good outcomes. It is not known when rehabilitation after surgery should begin. Currently most patients are advised to rest their arm in a sling for four to six weeks after the operation, but evidence suggests that starting. rehabilitation early might help people return to their usual activities more quickly, which is important to patients. The aim of this small study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger trial which will test whether early rehabilitation is more clinically and cost-effective than the usual practice of delayed rehabilitation. Who can participate. Patients aged 18 or over diagnosed with a non-traumatic symptomatic tear of the RC and listed for surgical repair What does the study involve.

Participants are randomly allocated to receive one of two rehabilitation programmes: either early patient-directed mobilisation using pain as a guide, or immobilisation of the. arm in a sling for four weeks. After four weeks both groups of patients undertake further rehabilitation led by a physiotherapist as per standard practice. The key difference is that those in the early mobilisation group begin moving their shoulder more quickly after the operation. Patients report their levels of pain and disability after surgery through questionnaires and. physiotherapist after surgery where they will be advised to immobilise their arm in a sling for four weeks. This will include advice to maintain sling in situ at all times including at night and only to be removed to perform specific daily exercise, and eating, washing and dressing. No further active movement will be encouraged. This initial discussion will be followed-up.

### Perioperative pain management for shoulder surgery: evolving techniques [^111VoYrg]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Improving management of postoperative pain following shoulder surgery is vital for optimizing patient outcomes, length of stay, and decreasing addiction to narcotic medications. Multimodal analgesia (ie, controlling pain via multiple different analgesic methods with differing mechanisms) is an ever-evolving approach to enhancing pain control perioperatively after shoulder surgery. With a variety of options for the shoulder surgeon to turn to, this article succinctly reviews the pros and cons of each approach and proposes a potential pain management algorithm.

Recommendations

Whenever possible, rotator cuff repair should be performed using an arthroscopic approach, as it is associated with reduced postoperative pain.
Systemic analgesia should include paracetamol and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAID) administered pre‐operatively or intra‐operatively and continued postoperatively.
Interscalene brachial plexus blockade is recommended as the first‐choice regional analgesic technique. Suprascapular nerve block, with or without axillary nerve block, may be used as an alternative to interscalene block.
A single dose of intravenous (i.v.) dexamethasone is recommended for its ability to increase the analgesic duration of interscalene brachial plexus block, decrease analgesic use and anti‐emetic effects.
Opioids should be reserved as rescue analgesia in the postoperative period.

### Missed short-term follow-up after arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery: analysis of surgical and demographic factors [^113uWHeM]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

There were 449 patients included in the study, of which 106 (24%) involved an isolated rotator cuff repair and decompression. The median age for the included patients was 57 years (interquartile range [IQR], 51 to 62), and 248 (55%) were women. The median state ADI decile was 6 (IQR, 4 to 6), and the median national ADI percentile was 24% (IQR, 16% to 29%). Additional patient demographics are given in Table 1. The median follow-up at the time of final database access was 1515 days (IQR, 980 to 2,091). The prevalence for follow-up at 3, 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months was 95%, 69%, 83%, 57%, and 40%, respectively. For the entire cohort, 234 patients (52%) were treated in the outpatient setting by another orthopaedic surgeon within the faculty practice at some time point after the shoulder arthroscopy, of which 8 (1.8%) underwent a subsequent arthroscopy of any joint within 12 months after the initial shoulder arthroscopy. Of the 268 patients who did not return for the 12-month follow-up, 187 (69.8%) had no additional visits with their operating shoulder surgeon postoperatively and were considered LTFU. However, 80 of these LTFU patients were subsequently seen by another member of the department for another orthopaedic issue. Overall, therefore, the prevalence for LTFU from the practice was 24%.

### Outpatient shoulder arthroplasty [^11749aq9]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Health care policy makers have placed increased attention on the cost of health care making outpatient joint arthroplasty an attractive alternative to routine hospital admission. Recent studies have shown outpatient shoulder arthroplasty is a safe and cost-effective alternative to inpatient shoulder arthroplasty. Proper patient selection, patient education, effective pain management strategies, and attention to intraoperative blood loss are keys in the success of outpatient shoulder arthroplasty.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^114gcbpu]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Based on available evidence and the PROSPECT approach to providing recommendations, combinations of paracetamol and an NSAID or a cyclo‐oxygenase‐2 (COX‐2)‐specific inhibitor are recommended pre‐operatively or intra‐operatively, and should be continued into the postoperative period, unless there are contra‐indications. The analgesic benefits and opioid‐sparing effects of these simple analgesics are well described 6, 70, 71. Although there is limited procedure‐specific evidence, i.v. dexamethasone is recommended for its ability to increase the analgesic duration of interscalene block and decrease supplemental analgesia use, as well as for its antiemetic effects. Limited procedure‐specific evidence was found for pre‐operative gabapentin, which was not demonstrated to have opioid‐sparing effects in this setting. Further evidence is, therefore, needed to support peri‐operative use of gabapentin for rotator cuff repair. Intra‐operative controlled hypotension is not recommended as there is insufficient procedure‐specific evidence regarding its analgesic benefits. Moreover, there is a concern that hypotension may increase the risk of a reduction in cerebral perfusion and oxygenation 72, 73.

The use of a regional analgesic technique as a component of multimodal analgesia is recommended. A continuous interscalene block is favoured over a single‐shot interscalene block. A systematic review with meta‐analysis of RCTs assessing analgesic effects of single‐shot interscalene block in patients undergoing shoulder surgery including rotator cuff repair found that interscalene block was more effective compared with placebo or systemic analgesia 74. However, the duration of analgesia was short (6 h and 8 h with motion and at rest, respectively) and there was rebound pain at 24 h. Therefore, it is imperative that patients receive paracetamol and NSAID or a COX‐2‐specific inhibitor regularly to avoid a significant increase in pain after the regional block has resolved. If an interscalene block is not possible, an axillary nerve block with or without suprascapular nerve block is favoured over no block or over a suprascapular nerve block alone. Additionally, a suprascapular nerve block reduces pain scores and/or opioid use after surgery but does not seem to have analgesic advantages over interscalene block.

### Is outpatient shoulder arthroplasty safe in patients aged ≥ 65 years? A comparison of readmissions and complications in inpatient and outpatient settings [^114eetXd]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies indicate that outpatient total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is cost-effective and may have a low complication rate similar to inpatient TSA. However, existing studies have included younger patient cohorts who typically possess fewer medical comorbidities. Patients aged ≥ 65 years are commonly enrolled in Medicare, which has traditionally designated TSA as an inpatient-only procedure. The purpose of this study was to compare surgical complication rates and 90-day readmission rates between inpatient and outpatient TSA performed in adults aged ≥ 65 years.

Methods

Medical records for all patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent primary anatomic or reverse TSA by a single surgeon from July 2015 to May 2020 were reviewed. Patients were preselected for outpatient or inpatient surgery based on lack of significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities and patient preference. Demographics, body mass index (BMI), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores were collected in addition to emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions within 90 days of the index surgery. Relationships among frequency and types of complications and surgical setting (inpatients vs. outpatient) were assessed. Complication rates and demographic variables between inpatient and outpatient procedures were compared. Logistic regressions were performed to account for interacting predictor variables on the odds of having complications.

Results

A total of 145 shoulders (138 patients; 95 male, 43 female) were included in the analysis, of which 98 received inpatient TSA and 47 received outpatient TSA. Average age was 75.5 ± 7.2 for inpatient TSA and 70.5 ± 4.5 for outpatient TSA (P < .001). Patient age (P < .001), ASA score ≥ 3 (P < .001), and reverse TSA (P = 0.002) were significantly positively correlated with receiving inpatient surgery. There were 16 complications (16.3%) in the inpatient group and 9 complications (19.1%) in the outpatient group (P = 0.648). There were no significant differences in the frequency of postoperative complications, return to the ED, or reoperations between inpatient and outpatient procedures (P > .05). Each 1-year increase in age increased the predicted odds of having a surgical complication by 14% (odds ratio = 1.14; P = 0.021), irrespective of surgical setting. Those who underwent inpatient TSA had a significantly higher frequency of 90-day readmission (inpatient = 16, outpatient = 1; P = 0.034).

Conclusions

Postoperative complications and ED returns were not significantly different between inpatient and outpatient TSA. Each 1-year increase in age increased the odds of postoperative surgical complications by 14%, regardless of surgical setting. Outpatient TSA was found to be safe for appropriately selected patients aged ≥ 65 years, and re-evaluation of TSA as an inpatient-only procedure should be considered.

### Orthopaedic shoulder surgery in the ambulatory surgical center: safety and outcomes [^114LLEL1]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether the risk of adverse events and readmission after non-arthroplasty shoulder surgery is influenced by the outpatient setting of surgical care and to identify risk factors associated with these adverse events.

Methods

The Humana Claims Database was queried for all patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery and related open procedures in the hospital-based outpatient department (HOPD) or ambulatory surgical center (ASC) setting, using the PearlDiver supercomputer. Arthroplasty procedures were excluded because they carry a risk profile different from that of other outpatient surgical procedures. Outcome variables included unanticipated admission after surgery, readmission, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and wound infection within 90 days of surgery. The ASC and HOPD cohorts were propensity score matched, and outcomes were compared between them. Finally, logistic regression models were created to identify risk factors associated with unplanned admission after surgery.

Results

A total of 84,658 patients met the inclusion criteria for the study: 28,730 in the ASC cohort and 56,819 in the HOPD cohort. The rates of all queried outcomes were greater in the HOPD cohort and achieved statistical significance. Sex, region, race, insurance status, comorbidity burden, anesthesia type, and procedural type were included in the regression analysis of unplanned admission. Factors associated with unplanned admission included increasing Charlson Comorbidity Index (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–1.17; P < .001); HOPD service location (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 2.18–2.58; P < .001); general anesthesia (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.08–1.59; P = 0.008); male sex (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 2.17–3.15; P = 0.007); and open surgery (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.90–2.61; P < .001).

Conclusions

The lower rates of perioperative morbidity in the ASC cohort suggest that proper patient selection is taking place and lends reassurance to surgeons who are practicing or are considering practicing in an ASC. Patients to whom some or all the risk factors for unplanned admission apply (male sex, higher comorbidity burden, open surgery) may be more suitable for HOPDs because admission from an ASC can be difficult and potentially unsafe.

### Identifying modifiable and nonmodifiable cost drivers of ambulatory rotator cuff repair: a machine learning analysis [^111SDF2Z]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Implementing novel tools that identify contributors to the cost of orthopedic procedures can help hospitals maximize efficiency, minimize waste, improve surgical decision-making, and practice value-based care. The purpose of this study was to develop and internally validate a machine learning algorithm to identify key drivers of total charges after ambulatory arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and compare its performance with a state-of-the-art statistical learning model.

Methods

A retrospective review of the New York State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database was performed to identify patients who underwent elective outpatient rotator cuff repair (RCR) from 2015 to 2016. Initial models were constructed using patient characteristics (age, gender, insurance status, patient income, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index) as well as intraoperative variables (concomitant procedures and services, operative time). These were subsequently entered into 5 separate machine learning algorithms and a generalized additive model using natural splines. Global variable importance and partial dependence curves were constructed to identify the greatest contributors to cost.

Results

A total of 33,976 patients undergoing ambulatory RCR were included. Median total charges after ambulatory RCR were $16,017 (interquartile range: $11,009-$22,510). The ensemble model outperformed the generalized additive model and demonstrated the best performance on internal validation (root mean squared error: $7112, 95% confidence interval: 7036–7188; logarithmic root mean squared error: 0.354, 95% confidence interval: 0.336–0.373, R²: 0.53), and identified major drivers of total charges after RCR as increasing operating room time, patient income level, number of anchors used, use of local infiltration anesthesia/peripheral nerve blocks, non-White race/ethnicity, and concurrent distal clavicle excision. The model was integrated into a web-based open-access application capable of providing individual predictions and explanations on a case-by-case basis.

Conclusion

This study developed an ensemble supervised machine learning algorithm that outperformed a sophisticated statistical learning model in predicting total charges after ambulatory RCR. Important contributors to total charges included operating room time, duration of care, number of anchors used, type of anesthesia, concomitant distal clavicle excision, community characteristics, and patient demographic factors. Generation of a patient-specific payment schedule based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality risk of mortality highlighted the financial risk assumed by physicians in flat episodic reimbursement schedules given variable patient comorbidities and the importance of an accurate prediction algorithm to appropriately reward high-value care at low costs.

### Increased shoulder arthroscopy time is associated with overnight hospital stay and surgical site infection [^112G26VB]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to characterize the rates of short-term postoperative complications, readmissions, and overnight hospital stays as a function of shoulder arthroscopy procedure time. A secondary aim of this current study was to identify baseline patient risk factors for adverse outcomes.

Methods

This study used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program registry from 2012 to 2015. Shoulder arthroscopy cases were categorized based on operative time, either < 45 minutes, between 45 and 90 minutes, or > 90 minutes. The rates of 30-day postoperative complications, readmissions, and overnight hospital stays were compared with bivariate and multivariate analysis.

Results

In total, 33,095 shoulder arthroscopy procedures were identified. Of these, 7,027 (21.2%) were < 45 minutes, 16,610 (50.2%) were between 45 and 90 minutes, and 9,458 (28.6%) were > 90 minutes. Multivariate analysis identified increased the risk of superficial surgical site infections (SSIs) for procedures lasting between 45 and 90 minutes (odds ratio [OR] = 3.63; P = 0.036) and for procedures > 90 minutes (OR = 4.40; P = 0.019), compared with procedures < 45 minutes. Furthermore, there was an increased risk of overnight hospital stay for patients who had a shoulder arthroscopy lasting between 45 and 90 minutes (OR = 1.33) and > 90 minutes (OR = 2.14), compared with procedures < 45 minutes. A body mass index > 30 kg/m² was an independent predictor of both overnight hospital stay and superficial SSI (P = 0.020). Age > 60, female gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists class ≥ 3, and a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were additional predictors of overnight hospital stay (P < .001 for all comparisons, unless otherwise noted).

Conclusions

Increased shoulder arthroscopy procedure time is associated with adverse short-term outcomes, particularly superficial SSI and overnight hospital stay. This information may be useful for patient counseling and postoperative risk stratification, as operative time is an easily measured surrogate for surgical complexity or difficulty.

Level Of Evidence

Retrospective cohort study, Level III.

### Missed short-term follow-up after arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery: analysis of surgical and demographic factors [^112imix6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The effect of LTFU on the clinical outcomes remains difficult to generalize. Within the arthroplasty literature, LTFU has been associated with poor surgical outcomes, missed complications, and increased need for revision surgeries. Murray et alreported a 20% LTFU rate at 15 years after total hip arthroplasty and concluded that patients who missed follow-up had markedly worse hip pain, motion, and assessment of their surgical outcomes. By contrast, Samade et alreported that although 26% of their cohort of upper extremity postoperative patients was LTFU, the median satisfaction score was 10/10 when contacted by telephone. Clohisey et alreported that one-time verbal instructions to return for follow-up resulted in poor follow-up attendance, whereas others have postulated as to the benefits of automated phone call reminders before the scheduled visit. Additional strategies have been suggested to minimize the LTFU rate, including the implementation of telemedicine to improve patient compliance. In a pilot study by Fabrés Martín et al, virtual follow-up visits were associated with reduced visit times, reliably assessed range of motion, and maintained satisfaction perception for patients after total knee and reverse shoulder arthroplasty. O'Donnell et alevaluated the effectiveness and patient satisfaction of virtual visits after shoulder surgery, including rotator cuff repair and both anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. When compared with in-person visits, the virtual visits were associated with decreased cost, shorter visit time, and high patient satisfaction. Understanding which patients are at highest risk of noncompliance with scheduled postoperative visits would be useful to focus additional resources on maximizing their clinical outcome and minimizing the risk of missed adverse events.

The purpose of our study, therefore, was to describe the prevalence and risk factors of missed short-term follow-up (STFU) after elective arthroscopic rotator cuff–related surgery and to identify any patient-specific or surgical-related parameters that were predictive of missed follow-up at the 6 and 12-month postoperative visits. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether the implementation of a standardized electronic patient contact system would decrease the risk of missed follow-up. We hypothesized that patients with more deprived socioeconomic status, notable medical comorbidities, greater distance from the orthopaedic clinic, and a pattern of previously missed outpatient visits would be more likely to miss the 6 and 12-month follow-ups, whereas those who presented with reminders of their upcoming visit would be more consistent with their scheduled follow-ups.

### Management of glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis [^112gAbMB]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Prognostic factors (comorbidities) — glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis: Strong evidence suggests that patients with glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis who have more comorbidities experience higher rates of early post-arthroplasty complications, with Strength of Recommendation: Strong and Strength of Evidence (evidence quality): Strong. Supporting studies reported that patients with medical comorbidities were at increased risk for complications and hospital re-admission, that higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were observed among those with post-operative complications, and that elevated BUN, elevated creatinine, low platelets, and hypertension requiring medications were associated with adverse events in TSA and unplanned readmission; diabetes was associated with less improvement after anatomic TSA and greater likelihood of further surgery or failing to achieve a minimal clinically important difference in ASES scores. Description notes evidence from two or more "High" quality studies with consistent findings. Benefits and resource considerations state that no harm would come to patients by taking into account these risk factors and that this information allows surgeons to stratify which patients will do best with surgery, potentially reducing revision rates and readmissions following shoulder arthroplasty.
