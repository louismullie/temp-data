## Question

best therapy for laryngitis for a school teacher who's been battling colds a lot

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best therapy for laryngitis in a school teacher who has been experiencing frequent colds. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and whether this is acute viral laryngitis versus chronic or alternative etiologies. Then, I should verify what high-quality evidence says about antibiotics and corticosteroids. Next, I will consider occupational risk and voice-hygiene strategies. After that, I need to check when to escalate evaluation for persistent dysphonia. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized plan and confirm safety-netting and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and likely diagnosis. Given recurrent colds and hoarseness in a teacher, acute viral laryngitis is most likely, which is typically self-limited and resolves within 1 to 3 weeks, though occupational voice demands can prolong recovery and increase recurrence risk [^116xbHqq] [^111QXVYA].

> Wait, let me verify the role of antibiotics before anything else. Multiple high-quality sources converge: antibiotics do not improve objective voice outcomes in acute laryngitis and should not be prescribed routinely, with Cochrane reviews and specialty guidelines issuing strong recommendations against empiric antibiotics due to lack of benefit and potential harms, including adverse effects and resistance [^1128f9sk] [^116Coi1i] [^111xtt7Z] [^114BJQK4].

> Hold on, I should verify the stance on corticosteroids as well. Guidelines advise against routine corticosteroids for dysphonia prior to laryngeal visualization because evidence does not show benefit and there are measurable harms; this applies to empiric steroid use for presumed viral laryngitis without a specific indication such as croup, which is a different entity [^114gJ3ut] [^117FFhUe] [^11195uXW].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing a reflux component. Initially, I thought a trial of PPIs might help if reflux is suspected, but wait, let me reconsider. Current guidance cautions against empiric PPIs for isolated dysphonia without typical GERD symptoms or laryngeal visualization, and meta-analyses show no clear benefit of PPIs for suspected GERD-related chronic laryngitis; if extraesophageal GERD is suspected, a time-limited, twice-daily PPI trial is reasonable only when accompanied by typical GERD symptoms, with escalation to objective testing if no response [^1117rjdw] [^113ADDgY] [^113gHnmk].

> Next, I should review occupational risk modifiers and prevention. Teachers are at high risk for dysphonia from voice overuse, and simple measures can mitigate phonotrauma: maintain hydration, avoid irritants like smoke and strong chemicals, use amplification when possible, and implement voice rest during acute symptoms; these strategies are supported by observational and guideline-level signals and align with the patient's high vocal demand environment [^111QXVYA] [^115q8kUf].

> Let me consider supportive care and symptom control. Analgesics such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, humidification of dry environments, and restful sleep can improve comfort; while humidified air has mixed evidence for croup, maintaining ambient moisture can help with laryngeal dryness and irritation in adults, and I should frame this as reasonable supportive care rather than disease-modifying therapy [^111Bvy4k] [^115q8kUf].

> I should double-check the red flags and when to escalate. If dysphonia persists beyond about 4 weeks, worsens, or is accompanied by stridor, dysphagia, hemoptysis, weight loss, or a suspicious mass, then laryngoscopy is indicated to exclude structural or serious disease; persistent symptoms beyond 3 weeks already warrant closer follow-up and consideration of referral [^117J51CR] [^116xbHqq].

> But wait, what if the "frequent colds" reflect an underlying vulnerability or allergic component? I need to ensure we address modifiable contributors: optimize hand hygiene, consider influenza and COVID-19 vaccination to reduce viral burden, evaluate for allergic rhinitis management if symptoms suggest it, and review medications that dry the larynx; these steps can reduce URTI frequency and laryngeal irritation, though evidence for preventing voice disorders in teachers is limited and mixed, so I should set expectations accordingly [^116R6ki5] [^1128o9Yr] [^116nGZwV].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized plan. First, confirm acute viral laryngitis and avoid antibiotics and routine corticosteroids. Second, implement strict voice rest during the acute phase and gradual return with hydration and amplification. Third, optimize URTI prevention and supportive care. Fourth, arrange follow-up in 2 to 4 weeks to ensure resolution and pivot to laryngoscopy if symptoms persist or red flags emerge. Fifth, if dysphonia becomes chronic or reflux is suspected with typical symptoms, consider a time-limited, twice-daily PPI trial with predefined stopping rules and objective testing if unresponsive [^116ATPxh] [^117J51CR] [^113gHnmk].

> I should confirm the bottom line and safety-netting. The best therapy for acute viral laryngitis in a teacher is conservative management with voice rest, hydration, analgesics, and avoidance of irritants, while avoiding antibiotics and routine corticosteroids; most cases resolve spontaneously within 1 to 3 weeks, and persistent or atypical symptoms warrant laryngoscopic evaluation to exclude alternative diagnoses [^116ATPxh] [^116xbHqq].

---

For a school teacher with recurrent laryngitis from frequent colds, the best therapy is **conservative management** with voice rest, hydration, and humidification, and **avoidance of irritants** such as smoke, alcohol, and caffeine [^115q8kUf]. Antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial infection is confirmed, and corticosteroids are not recommended for routine use [^116Coi1i] [^114gJ3ut]. If hoarseness persists beyond 3–4 weeks, refer for laryngoscopy to exclude chronic or structural causes [^117J51CR]. Prevention focuses on hand hygiene, hydration, and vocal hygiene education to reduce recurrence [^117A1pSX].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the cornerstone of treatment for acute laryngitis, particularly in individuals with high vocal demands, such as school teachers [^notfound]. The following measures are recommended:

- **Voice rest**: Temporary reduction or cessation of voice use allows the vocal cords to heal and reduces inflammation [^115q8kUf].

- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake maintains mucosal hydration and facilitates recovery [^115q8kUf].

- **Humidification**: Use of humidifiers, especially in dry environments, helps prevent laryngeal dryness and irritation [^115q8kUf].

- **Avoidance of irritants**: Patients should avoid smoking, secondhand smoke, alcohol, and caffeine, as these substances can exacerbate laryngeal inflammation [^115q8kUf].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacological treatments are generally not recommended for acute viral laryngitis unless specific indications are present:

- **Antibiotics**: Routine antibiotic use is not recommended, as most cases of laryngitis are viral. Antibiotics should only be considered if bacterial infection is confirmed or strongly suspected [^116Coi1i] [^114BJQK4].

- **Corticosteroids**: Systemic corticosteroids are not recommended for routine use in acute laryngitis due to potential adverse effects and lack of proven benefit [^114gJ3ut].

- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used for symptomatic relief of pain or discomfort [^112zVjz2].

---

## Preventive strategies

Given the recurrent nature of laryngitis in school teachers, preventive strategies are essential:

- **Hand hygiene**: Regular handwashing and use of hand sanitizers reduce the risk of upper respiratory infections [^notfound].

- **Vocal hygiene education**: Training in proper voice use, breathing techniques, and vocal warm-up exercises can reduce vocal strain and prevent recurrence [^notfound].

- **Environmental modifications**: Use of amplification devices in classrooms, maintaining optimal humidity levels, and reducing background noise can minimize vocal stress [^115q8kUf].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Persistent or recurrent laryngitis warrants further evaluation to exclude chronic or structural causes. Indications for specialist referral include:

- **Persistent dysphonia**: Hoarseness lasting longer than 3–4 weeks despite conservative management [^117J51CR].

- **Structural abnormalities**: Suspected vocal cord nodules, polyps, or other lesions [^115rXR6m].

- **Chronic laryngitis**: Recurrent or chronic inflammation requiring further diagnostic evaluation [^111wejR9].

---

## Conclusion

The best therapy for laryngitis in a school teacher with frequent colds is **conservative management**, including voice rest, hydration, humidification, and avoidance of irritants. Antibiotics and corticosteroids are not routinely recommended. Preventive strategies, such as hand hygiene and vocal hygiene education, are essential to reduce recurrence. Persistent symptoms beyond 3–4 weeks should prompt specialist referral for further evaluation [^117J51CR].

Laryngeal inflammation includes a broad spectrum of pathologies, from infectious processes that need to be managed as airway emergencies, to indolent diseases that mimic head and neck cancer. The importance of a thorough history cannot be emphasized enough as it is the most important step toward developing a differential diagnosis. Vocal pathologies often have a noticeable impact on a person's quality of life and daily activities; therefore, it is key to counsel patients on the course of the disease process. Treatment of specific pathologies depends on the causative pathogen or etiology, as well as the age, vocal demands, and clinical characteristics of the individual.

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^1138EQug]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections account for millions of visits to family physicians each year in the United States. Although warranted in some cases, antibiotics are greatly overused. This article outlines the guidelines and indications for appropriate antibiotic use for common upper respiratory infections. Early antibiotic treatment may be indicated in patients with acute otitis media, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, epiglottitis, or bronchitis caused by pertussis. Persistent cases of rhinosinusitis may necessitate the use of antibiotics if symptoms persist beyond a period of observation. Antibiotics should not be considered in patients with the common cold or laryngitis. Judicious, evidence-based use of antibiotics will help contain costs and prevent adverse effects and drug resistance.

Background

This is an update of the original review published in 2005. Acute laryngitis is a common illness worldwide. Diagnosis is often made by case history alone and treatment often targets symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic therapies in adults with acute laryngitis. A secondary objective was to report the rates of adverse events associated with these treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to December 2014), LILACS (1982 to December 2014) and BIOSIS (1980 to December 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo for acute laryngitis. The main outcome was objective voice scores.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted and synthesised data.

Main Results

We included three RCTs (351 participants) that had moderate to high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was very low for all outcomes. We downgraded the studies because of limitations in study design or execution (risk of bias), imprecision and inconsistency of results. We included a new trial presented only as a conference abstract in this update. In one study of acute laryngitis in adults, 100 participants were randomised to receive penicillin V (800 mg twice daily for five days) or an identical placebo. A recording of each patient reading a standardised text was made at the first visit, during re-examination after one and two weeks, and at follow-up after two to six months. No significant differences were found between the groups. The trial also measured symptoms reported by participants and found no significant differences. One study investigated erythromycin for acute laryngitis in 106 adults. The mean objective voice scores measured at the first visit, at re-examination after one and two weeks, and at follow-up after two to six months did not significantly differ between the groups. At one week there were significant beneficial differences in the severity of reported vocal symptoms (slight, moderate and severe) as judged by participants (P value = 0.042). However, the rates of participants having improved voice disturbance (subjective symptoms) at one and two weeks were not significantly different among groups. Comparing erythromycin and placebo groups on the rate of persistence of cough at two weeks, the risk ratio (RR) was 0.38 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.97, P value = 0.04) and the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 5.87 (95% CI 3.09 to 65.55). We calculated a RR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, P value = 0.034) and a NNTB of 3.76 (95% CI 2.27 to 13.52; P value = 0.01) for the subjective voice scores at one week. A third trial from Russia included 145 patients with acute laryngitis symptoms. Participants were randomised to three treatment groups: Group 1: seven-day course of fusafungine (six times a day by inhalation); Group 2: seven-day course of fusafungine (six times a day by inhalation) plus clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily for seven days); Group 3: no treatment. Clinical cure rates were measured at days 5 ± 1, 8 ± 1 and 28 ± 2. The authors reported significant differences in the rates of clinical cure at day 5 ± 1 favouring fusafungine (one trial; 93 participants; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.20; P value = 0.04) and fusafungine plus clarithromycin (one trial 97 participants; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.16; P value = 0.05) when compared to no treatment. However, no significant differences were found at days 8 ± 1 and 28 ± 2. Also, no significant differences were found when comparing fusafungine to fusafungine plus clarithromycin at days 5 ± 1, 8 ± 1 and 28 ± 2.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics do not appear to be effective in treating acute laryngitis when assessing objective outcomes. They appear to be beneficial for some subjective outcomes. Erythromycin could reduce voice disturbance at one week and cough at two weeks when measured subjectively. Fusafungine could increase the cure rate at day five. The included RCTs had important methodological problems and these modest benefits from antibiotics may not outweigh their cost, adverse effects or negative consequences for antibiotic resistance patterns.

Background

This is an updated version of the original review published in Issue 2, 2007 of The Cochrane Library. Acute laryngitis is a common illness worldwide. Diagnosis is often made by case history alone and treatment is often directed toward controlling symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic therapies in adults with acute laryngitis. A secondary objective was to report the rates of adverse events associated with these treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 12, MEDLINE (January 1966 to January week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to January 2013), LILACS (1982 to January 2013) and BIOSIS (1980 to January 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo for acute laryngitis. The main outcome was objective voice scores.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted and descriptively synthesised data.

Main Results

Only two trials met the study inclusion criteria after extensive literature searches. One hundred participants were randomised to receive either penicillin V (800 mg twice a day for five days), or an identical placebo, in a study of acute laryngitis in adults. A tape recording of each patient reading a standardised text was obtained during the first visit, subsequently during re-examination after one and two weeks, and at follow-up after two to six months. No significant differences were found between the groups. The trial also measured symptoms reported by participants and found no significant differences. The second trial investigated erythromycin for treating acute laryngitis in 106 adults. The mean objective voice scores measured at the first visit, at re-examination after one and two weeks, and at follow-up after two to six months did not significantly differ between control and intervention groups. At one week there were significant beneficial differences in the severity of reported vocal symptoms as judged by the participants (P = 0.042). Comparing the erythromycin and placebo groups on subjective voice scores, the a priori risk ratio (RR) was 0.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.96, P = 0.034) and the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 4.5.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics appear to have no benefit in treating acute laryngitis. Erythromycin could reduce voice disturbance at one week and cough at two weeks when measured subjectively. We consider that these outcomes are not relevant in clinical practice. The implications for practice are that prescribing antibiotics should not be done in the first instance as they will not objectively improve symptoms.

### A narrative review and expert opinion on immunity-targeted approaches in the management of viral upper respiratory tract infections [^112RtWXY]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), such as rhinitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, and nasopharyngitis, are among the most widespread diseases in primary medical care. The primary causes of URTIs are viruses, including multiple strains of rhinovirus, influenza virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and enterovirus.

Each respiratory virus elicits a distinct immune response, influenced by its unique structural and functional characteristics. Figure 1 presents a comparative analysis of the immune responses elicited by the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2.

Approximately 200 viral strains cause URTI, with viral incubation usually lasting two to four days. Bacterial colonization can follow a viral infection, aggravating the disease and resulting in a lengthened recovery period and evolution with complications.

The most prevalent symptoms of URTIs are cough, sore throat, nasal obstruction, fever and headache. Despite such conditions being mainly self-limiting and nonfatal, the accompanying symptoms can cause significant impairment to one's productivity and quality of life. Recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) are typical clinical conditions in adults and children.

URTIs are more prevalent during winter months, as the causative pathogens are transmitted either via aerosolized droplets or contaminated secretions, which can subsequently invade one's eyes or the respiratory epithelium. Crowded places, such as schools or daycare facilities, are therefore favorable environments for transmitting respiratory pathogens.

Considering the widespread effects of URTIs on the well-being and quality of life of adults and children around the world, a narrative review and expert opinion on approaches to their management is warranted. In the present review, a multinational group of experts in the field of viral infections of the respiratory tract has investigated these diseases and proposed treatments that may reduce the negative clinical and monetary impact of URTIs on children, adults, and society.

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^114BJQK4]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections are responsible for millions of physician visits in the United States annually. Although viruses cause most acute upper respiratory tract infections, studies show that many infections are unnecessarily treated with antibiotics. Because inappropriate antibiotic use results in adverse events, contributes to antibiotic resistance, and adds unnecessary costs, family physicians must take an evidence-based, judicious approach to the use of antibiotics in patients with upper respiratory tract infections. Antibiotics should not be used for the common cold, influenza, COVID-19, or laryngitis. Evidence supports antibiotic use in most cases of acute otitis media, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, and epiglottitis and in a limited percentage of acute rhinosinusitis cases. Several evidence-based strategies have been identified to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing for acute upper respiratory tract infections.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117TxTbJ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

Strengths of this review include explicit eligibility criteria; a comprehensive search developed with a research librarian; duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias, and data abstraction; consideration of all outcomes important to patients; consideration of selective reporting bias; consideration of possible subgroup effects; and rigorous use of the GRADE approach to rate quality of evidence. The limitations of our review have to do with the underlying evidence. Only three trials explicitly reported adverse events, and they did so inconsistently. We observed substantial statistical heterogeneity in some of the outcomes. We explored the source(s) of heterogeneity by subgroup analysis and rated down for inconsistency in GRADE assessments for outcomes with unexplained heterogeneity.

In comparison with previous systematic reviews, we included two additional randomised controlled trials, which almost doubled the number of participants. Results from our meta-analysis are consistent with previous findings that corticosteroids reduce pain at 48 hours and probably reduce other pain outcomes. In addition to enhanced precision with the additional studies, our meta-analysis adds to the existing evidence in that we considered absolute in addition to relative effect measures, providing a clear picture of the magnitude of effect. In part because of input from the guideline panel, we considered additional outcomes that participating patients considered important, including risk of recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms, need for antibiotics, and days missed from school or work. An important additional contribution of the new evidence is that it extends the applicability beyond patients with severe sore throat treated with antibiotics for group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis in the emergency department, to a broader range of patients not treated with antibiotics.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: guide to paediatric voice disorders [^113Eq7Rv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Paediatric voice disorders in the normal paediatric population ranges from 6% to 20%. We outline the important features in the initial evaluation of a persistent altered cry or voice in children and highlight the subsequent management currently used by ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons and speech and language therapists (SLTs). It is important to appreciate that there are stark differences between a child and adult larynx due to anatomical and physiological changes during development. The voice history elicited from both child and parent includes birth and developmental history, hearing, early feeding and respiratory function. Red flag symptoms or signs presenting with dysphonia include stridor, dysphagia, failure to thrive and recurrent chest infections. The most likely cause for dysphonia in children presenting to general paediatric practice and primary care will be secondary to laryngitis, hyperfunction and vocal cord nodules, and laryngopharyngeal reflux. Regarding treatment, in most cases a non-surgical option is preferred with voice therapy preferably delivered by a specialist paediatric voice SLT.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^116Coi1i]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy for dysphonia — Statement 8: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe antibiotics to treat dysphonia, with a strong recommendation against prescribing based on systematic reviews and randomized trials showing ineffectiveness of antibiotic therapy and a preponderance of harm over benefit. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A with systematic reviews showing no benefit for antibiotics for acute laryngitis or upper respiratory tract infection and Grade A evidence showing potential harms, and the level of confidence in evidence is high. The benefit-harm assessment indicates a preponderance of harm over benefit if antibiotics are prescribed, and exclusions include patients with dysphonia caused by bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial infection; the word routine is used to discourage empiric therapy while acknowledging occasional circumstances where antimicrobial use may be appropriate.

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections… [^115nt1S8]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

If there is no response to initial antibiotic therapy within 48 to 72 hours, the patient should be reexamined to confirm the diagnosis, and amoxicillin/clavulanate should be initiated. 7, 8 Ceftriaxone can be used as a second-line agent or in children with vomiting. 7 Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin/sulfisoxazole are not effective for the treatment of AOM. 7, 8 Longer courses of antibiotics have lower failure rates than shorter courses.
41. Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis Approximately 90 percent of adults and 70 percent of children with pharyngitis have viral infections. 44–46 In those with bacterial cases of pharyngitis, the leading pathogen is group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Appropriate antibiotic treatment in these cases has been shown to decrease the risk of rheumatic fever, alleviate symptoms, and decrease communicability.

20, 45, 47 Antibiotic treatment does not prevent glomerulonephritis and has inconsistent results in the prevention of peritonsillar abscess. 20, 44. Laryngitis Acute laryngitis is inflammation of the vocal cords and larynx lasting less than three weeks. 54 Symptoms include loss or muffling of the voice, sore throat, and other classic URI symptoms such as cough, fever, runny nose, and headache. A Cochrane review of antibiotic therapy in patients with laryngitis found two studies showing that antibiotic use does not reduce the duration of symptoms or lead to voice improvement. 54 Although these studies are older, there are no recent studies to indicate that these conclusions have changed. Laryngitis is a self-limited, viral disease that does not respond to antibiotic therapy.
18. 55, 56 The incidence of epiglottitis in children has decreased with the use of H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines in early infancy.

13, 57 A combination of an intravenous antistaphylococcal agent that is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a third-generation cephalosporin may be effective. 12 Intravenous monotherapy with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin/sulbactam is also recommended. 13–15.

### Effectiveness of adenoidectomy in children with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections: open randomised controlled trial [^112jUGqr]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In children selected for adenoidectomy for recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, a strategy of immediate surgery did not reduce the number of upper respiratory tract infections compared with a strategy of initial watchful waiting. The prevalence of upper respiratory tract infections decreased similarly over time in both groups, suggesting that the contribution of surgery to the favourable natural course of upper respiratory tract infections is trivial.

We found no relevant differences between the two strategies for days of upper respiratory tract infections, days and episodes of mild and severe upper respiratory tract infections and middle ear complaints with fever, days of absence from day care or school, and health related quality of life. There was a significant difference for days with fever.

Forty per cent of children in the initial watchful waiting group underwent surgery during the course of the trial. These children, however, were not more severely affected by upper respiratory tract infections than the 60% who did not undergo surgery nor did they do better after surgery.

### Epiglottitis and croup [^111NosQL]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Infections of the upper airways are a frequent cause of morbidity in children. Viral laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) is the most common cause of stridor in children and usually has a self-limited course with occasional relapses in early childhood. Epiglottitis has become rare in developed countries with the advent of universal vaccinations against Haemophilus influenzae. It can be rapidly fatal, however, if not promptly recognized and appropriately managed. This article reviews the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of these pediatric upper airway infections.

### A young child with a history of wheeze [^113BJsyD]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

What treatment will reduce our son's symptoms — and, if possible, prevent long-term asthma?

At present, there is no treatment known to 'cure' asthma. Current treatments, however, can control symptoms and modify the chances of attacks. Bronchodilators should be used when the child is wheezy, though discussion with parents is important to ensure they are interpreting sounds correctly and that the child responds to the broncholdilator. If asthma is probable, inhaled steroids are the most effective treatment for controlling symptoms and should be first-line treatment if attacks are frequent and severe and/or if there are interval symptoms. Perhaps the one clear 'fact' is that complete avoidance of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is important.

Does preventing RSV infection reduce risk of asthma?

Reflecting the observation that the persistence of wheezing beyond childhood is associated with rhinovirus infection (as opposed to RSV), prevention of RSV infection does not have a measurable effect on subsequent episodes of wheeze and asthma. Giving pre-term infants anti-RSV antibodies for the first year of life reduces RSV infections but not recurrent wheeze over the pre-school years.

Does early start of inhaled steroids prevent risk of asthma?

In 2006 three studies were published on the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in young children at high risk of developing asthma with one or more episodes of wheeze. – Although some children had a temporary reduction in symptoms during ICS treatment, this did not prevent development of asthma. So, in our clinical case, it is important to discuss with the parents that the early start of ICS is not needed as a primary prevention strategy but it might have an effect on the severity of the symptoms.

Study selection

Reviewers (BS, RACS, DP, RBP) independently and in duplicate screened the titles and abstracts of all identified studies using a priori selection criteria. Subsequently, the samereviewersindependently assessed eligibility of the full texts of potentially eligible studies. Reviewers resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if needed, by adjudication from a third reviewer.

We included randomised controlled trials that compared corticosteroids with standard of care or placebo and enrolled adults and/or children aged 5 and over in emergency departments and primary care settings with a clinical syndrome of sore throat (painful throat, odynophagia, or pharyngitis).

We excluded studies of participants who were admitted to hospital or immunocompromised and those with infectious mononucleosis, sore throat after any surgery or intubation (postoperative sore throat), gastroesophageal reflux disease, croup, or peritonsillar abscess. We also excluded studies that enrolled children aged under 5 because they would not be able to provide trustworthy outcome measurements, especially for self reported pain.

Our outcomes of interest were complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours; mean time to onset of pain relief; mean time to complete resolution of pain; absolute reduction of pain at 24 hours; duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms (such as problems for eating, drinking, swallowing); recurrence/relapse of symptoms; days missed from school or work; need for antibiotics; and rate of adverse events related to treatment. We included any adverse events reported by the authors.

### Chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux in children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1179sG7o]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Qualitative data from systematic reviews and guidelines report the following. For children aged " ≤ 14-years" with chronic cough, "we recommend basing the management or testing algorithm on cough characteristics and the associated clinical history. No specific recommendation for children with cough and GERD but it is implied that GERD on its own should be treated". One review stated "Anti-GER medications should not be routinely used for treatment of poorly controlled asthma, chronic cough and laryngitis" and added, "If these medications are used, and there is no response, rather than escalating therapy uncritically, a second specialist opinion is recommended". A systematic review that included "23 RCTs" noted, "Ten studies failed to demonstrate significant benefits of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 receptor antagonists" for infant manifestations attributed to reflux and concluded they "may be used to treat children with gastroesophageal reflux disease, but not to treat asthma or unspecific symptoms".

### Recurrent respiratory infections [^112WXvjf]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The child who has recurrent infections poses one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in pediatrics. The clinician faces a two-fold challenge in determining first whether the child is normal or has a serious disease, and then, in the latter case, how to confirm or exclude the diagnosis with the minimum number of the least invasive tests. It is hoped that, in the absence of good-quality evidence for most clinical scenarios, the experience-based approach described in this article may prove a useful guide to the clinician.

### Upper respiratory tract infections (including otitis media) [^114sn5dT]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections (including otitis media) are the most common illnesses affecting children. Most illnesses are mild and resolve completely without specific treatment, but the frequency of infection and association with fever and constitutional symptoms creates significant distress for the child and the family. By understanding the evidence available from high-quality studies, the clinician can advise the families on appropriate action. The goal of this article is to support clinicians in answering the following questions: (1) What happened to children with these conditions when no additional treatment was provided? (2) Which interventions have been assessed in well-designed studies? (3) Which interventions have been shown to improve outcomes? (4) How large is the overall benefit?

### Systematic review of the treatment of functional dysphonia and prevention of voice disorders [^112Hm8zm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for treating functional dysphonia or preventing voice disorders in adults.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (1950 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006), CENTRAL (Issue 2 2006), CINAHL (1983 to 2006), PsychINFO (1967 to 2006), Science Citation Index (1986 to 2006), and the Occupational Health databases OSH-ROM (February 2006).

Review Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Included studies evaluated the effectiveness of interventions for 1) treating functional/nonorganic dysphonia or 2) preventing voice disorders. We identified six randomized controlled trials about treatment and two about prevention. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Results

A combination of direct and indirect voice therapy, compared with no intervention, improves self-reported (standardized mean difference -1.07; 95% CI -1.94 to -0.19), observer-rated (weighted mean difference [WMD] -13.00; 95% CI -17.92 to -8.08), and instrumentally assessed vocal functioning (WMD -1.20; 95% CI -2.37 to -0.03) in adults with functional dysphonia. Effects are reported to remain for at least 14 weeks. Effects are similar in patients and in teachers and student teachers screened for voice problems. We found two studies that did not show voice training, compared with no intervention, to have a preventive effective in improving self-reported vocal functioning. Assessment of publication bias showed that the real effect sizes are probably smaller.

Conclusion

Comprehensive voice therapy is effective in improving vocal performance in adults with functional dysphonia. There is no evidence of effectiveness of voice training in preventing voice disorders.

### An update on inflammatory disorders of the pediatric airway: epiglottitis, croup, and tracheitis [^111sKL4o]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2001). Low credibility.

Acute infections of the respiratory tract are common in pediatric patients. Respiratory disease is the leading cause of hospitalization in children less than 4 years of age and is responsible for many physicians' office and emergency department visits.(1) The severity of upper respiratory tract infection ranges from mild, self-limited disease to potentially life-threatening airway obstruction. The prepared clinician can often make a diagnosis based solely on the history and physical examination, using radiographs and laboratory examinations to aid in diagnosis when the clinical picture is unclear. At times, airway collapse is imminent, and the clinician must proceed directly to endoscopy for definitive diagnosis and airway protection. This article will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of epiglottitis, croup, and bacterial tracheitis in the pediatric population.

Dysphonia — initial evaluation and natural history — physical examination should include a full head and neck examination with particular attention to listening to the voice, inspection and palpation of the neck for masses or lesions, and, if feasible, indirect mirror laryngoscopy, and observations of swallowing and breathing should be performed; history and general physical examination can help differentiate which patients may need laryngeal examination, and most dysphonia is self-limited and related to upper respiratory tract infection, which usually resolves in 7 to 10 days regardless of treatment; if dysphonia occurs with other upper respiratory tract infection symptoms such as rhinitis, fever [> 101.5°F], or fatigue and symptoms are of recent onset, then the voice changes will likely resolve spontaneously.

Although acute laryngitis is common, it is often managed by primary physicians. Therefore, video images documenting its signs are scarce. This series includes 7 professional voice users who previously had undergone baseline strobovideolaryngscopy (SVL) during routine examinations or during evaluations for other complaints and who returned with acute laryngitis. Sequential SVL showed not only the expected erythema, edema, cough, and dysphonia, but also new masses in 5 of the 7 subjects. All the signs returned to baseline. This series is reported to highlight the reversible structural changes that can be expected in patients with acute laryngitis and the value of conservative management.

### Sepsis in a patient with acute epiglottitis and respiratory failure [^1139pgks]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Whenever evidence for swelling of the upper airway exists, clinicians should be aware of possibly rapid clinical deterioration. Intubation should be evaluated early aiming at avoiding complications such as severe hypoxaemia. Neisseria meningitidis is a rare cause of epiglottitis/supraglottitis, usually responsive to most recommended antibiotic regimens. Steroid treatment is controversially discussed in the treatment of epiglottitis, but can be taken into consideration for the clinical presentation of bacterial sepsis in the sense of sepsis bundle treatment.

### A narrative review and expert opinion on immunity-targeted approaches in the management of viral upper respiratory tract infections [^117Kg3rv]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunomodulation needs to be discussed as it holds the potential of preventing the development of severe viral infections alongside their complications, primarily relating to microbial infections, as demonstrated in randomized clinical trials evaluating its preventive efficacy in populations with recurrent respiratory infections. This consensus paper has its strengths and limitations. The main strength of the present paper is that a board of international experts reviewed existing clinical literature and formulated a list of consensus statements that are scientifically and clinically relevant and valid. Additionally, the diverse clinical backgrounds of the expert group was another strength of this review, as the clinicians' expertise provides reliability to the consensus provided. The recommendations by this review are valuable as they have the potential to guide clinicians in their daily clinical practice to optimize treatment and thereby likely improve outcomes. The limitations of this review are that we reviewed and summarized a specific number of studies, no complete Cochrane-type literature search or AI analysis was performed. Furthermore, no animal experiments or in vitro studies were reviewed.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^114oaUZa]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The evidence

The linked systematic review reports the effects of corticosteroids when added to standard care in patients with acute sore throat.

Figure 1gives an overview of the number and types of patients included, the study funding, and patient involvement, as well as a summary of the benefits and harms of corticosteroids for treating acute sore throat.

Fig 1 Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of effects of corticosteroids on acute sore throat

The panel identified eight patient-important outcomes needed to inform the recommendation: complete resolution of pain, time to onset of pain relief, pain severity, need for antibiotics, days missed from school or work, recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms, and adverse effects. The included studies reported on all patient-important outcomes, except for duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms. Regarding pain, the panel appraised the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours and 48 hours, as well as the mean time to complete resolution of pain and the mean time to onset of pain relief.

Although most of the studies (80%) were conducted in emergency departments, they accounted for 54% of all patients enrolled across studies. The remaining 46% were enrolled in the studies conducted in primary care settings, and the panel was therefore confident that the evidence was applicable to them as well. Most of the studies focused in adults only (60%). The studies that focused only on children (three studies, 2% of all the patients enrolled in the studies) did not include children younger than 5 years old, and thus the recommendation does not apply to younger ages.

Since the randomised controlled trials focused on patients who did not have recurrent episodes of sore throat, the panel was less confident of the applicability of the evidence to such patients, and the recommendation therefore does not apply to them. Similarly, the panel did not consider patients with sore throat after surgery or intubation, nor immunocompromised patients.

### UK consensus statement on the diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction in light of the COVID-19 pandemic [^117NRo4h]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Prior to the COVID‐19 pandemic, laryngoscopy was the mandatory gold standard for the accurate assessment and diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction. However, upper airway endoscopy is considered an aerosol‐generating procedure in professional guidelines, meaning routine procedures are highly challenging and the availability of laryngoscopy is reduced. In response, we have convened a multidisciplinary panel with broad experience in managing this disease and agreed a recommended strategy for presumptive diagnosis in patients who cannot have laryngoscopy performed due to pandemic restrictions. To maintain clinical standards whilst ensuring patient safety, we discuss the importance of triage, information gathering, symptom assessment and early review of response to treatment. The consensus recommendations will also be potentially relevant to other future situations where access to laryngoscopy is restricted, although we emphasize that this investigation remains the gold standard.

### Interventions for preventing voice disorders in adults [^116nGZwV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Poor voice quality due to a voice disorder can lead to a reduced quality of life. In occupations where voice use is substantial it can lead to periods of absence from work.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent voice disorders in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (PubMed, 1950 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2006), CINAHL (1983 to 2006), PsychINFO (1967 to 2006), Science Citation Index (1986 to 2006) and the Occupational Health databases OSH-ROM (to 2006). The date of the last search was 05/04/06.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of interventions evaluating the effectiveness of treatments to prevent voice disorders in adults. For work-directed interventions interrupted time series and prospective cohort studies were also eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Meta-analysis was performed where appropriate.

Main Results

We identified two randomised controlled trials including a total of 53 participants in intervention groups and 43 controls. One study was conducted with teachers and the other with student teachers. Both trials were poor quality. Interventions were grouped into 1) direct voice training, 2) indirect voice training and 3) direct and indirect voice training combined.1) Direct voice training: One study did not find a significant decrease of the Voice Handicap Index for direct voice training compared to no intervention.2) Indirect voice training: One study did not find a significant decrease of the Voice Handicap Index for indirect voice training when compared to no intervention.3) Direct and indirect voice training combined: One study did not find a decrease of the Voice Handicap Index for direct and indirect voice training combined when compared to no intervention. The same study did however find an improvement in maximum phonation time (Mean Difference -3.18 sec; 95% CI -4.43 to -1.93) for direct and indirect voice training combined when compared to no intervention. No work-directed studies were found. None of the studies found evaluated the effectiveness of prevention in terms of sick leave or number of diagnosed voice disorders.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence that either direct or indirect voice training or the two combined are effective in improving self-reported vocal functioning when compared to no intervention. The current practice of giving training to at-risk populations for preventing the development of voice disorders is therefore not supported by definitive evidence of effectiveness. Larger and methodologically better trials are needed with outcome measures that better reflect the aims of interventions.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for laryngitis, more specifically with respect to botulinum toxin injections, AAO-HNS 2018 guidelines recommend to offer botulinum toxin injections, or refer to a clinician who can administer botulinum toxin injections, for the treatment of dysphonia caused by spasmodic dysphonia or other types of laryngeal dystonia.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^113cffkK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics in dysphonia — policy and rationale: Policy level is "Strong recommendation against". Dysphonia in most patients is caused by acute viral laryngitis and routine empiric antibiotics are unwarranted; "Acute laryngitis is self-limited, with most patients experiencing symptomatic improvement within 7 to 10 days irrespective of treatment", and a Cochrane review "found that antibiotics do not appear to be effective in treating acute laryngitis in terms of objective outcomes". Cost and harm considerations include that "Medications account for one-fifth to one-third of total direct costs in management of laryngeal disorders, and 30% of that is attributable to antibiotics", and "Antibiotics can have side effects, including rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting", with "Overprescription [that] contributes to bacterial antibiotic resistance". Limited exceptions are noted: "Antibiotics for dysphonia may be appropriate in select circumstances", often in immunosuppressed patients, and "The diagnosis should be established prior to initiation of therapy".

### Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review [^116voR5j]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Selection

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they recruited otherwise healthy children (birth to 18 years) with acute respiratory infections presenting to primary care or emergency department settings; were conducted in high income countries, as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; provided data on time to resolution of symptoms or complete duration of symptoms; involved placebo or no treatment arms of controlled non-surgical treatment trials or prospective observational studies; and reported in English. Although respiratory tract infections can include a cluster of various symptoms, certain symptoms (such as cough) predominate in clinical experience and in published trials, depending on a child's illness, ability to describe his or her symptoms, and/or parental recognition and interpretation of symptoms. Given this, we chose to not only include studies of children presenting with clustered symptoms (such as common cold or undifferentiated respiratory tract infections) but also those of individual symptoms (such as sore throat). We included studies of children presenting with primary complaints of earache (acute otitis media), sore throat (or pharyngitis or tonsillitis), cough (or acute bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or croup), and common cold (or upper respiratory tract infection).

We excluded studies of children with chronic, recurrent, or complicated infections; experimentally induced infection; or medical conditions associated with a high risk of serious infections (such as cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency). We also excluded studies conducted in inpatient settings or in low or middle income countries as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where the risk of complications from infection might be higher. Studies that reported data on both children and adults were included only if data were presented separately by age. We excluded trials comparing two active treatments, those of prophylactic or adjuvant treatments, and retrospective studies; studies with follow-up of 24 hours or less; and studies that presented symptom duration only before consultation, assessed only incidence or prevalence, or presented duration of symptoms by symptom score or individual pathogen.

### Prevention and management of respiratory disease in young people with cerebral palsy: consensus statement [^116QFinR]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Target Conditions

In this consensus statement, respiratory disease in CP may include acute manifestation such as lower respiratory tract infections, with or without hospital admissions, or chronic established disease manifested by the presence of respiratory symptoms such as cough or rattly breathing even when well.

A hospitalization due to respiratory disease is defined as either: (1) a hospitalization to manage the respiratory illness as the primary cause of the hospitalization or (2) a hospitalization episode that is prolonged owing to respiratory illness that develops or is identified during the course of an admission for another reason.

Respiratory disease or hospitalization due to respiratory disease do not include non‐recurrent respiratory episodes (e.g. laryngospasm, peri‐operative management) or other specific unrelated respiratory conditions (e.g. tracheomalacia).

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111mG7Qi]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

Extraesophageal reflux syndromes — continuation, discontinuation, and step-down of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy are tied to concomitant esophageal disease and response. Many patients will have persistent symptoms after 8 weeks of empirical PPI therapy. The need for continued PPI therapy is predicated on the presence and severity of concomitant esophageal syndromes. In the absence of concomitant esophageal GERD syndromes, PPI therapy should be discontinued and other diagnostic and/or therapeutic avenues pursued. There are no trials showing the effectiveness of maintenance therapy for patients in whom empirical therapy with twice-daily PPI therapy results in improvement of asthma, cough, or laryngitis. Step-down therapy should be attempted, but the likelihood of symptom recurrence with step-down therapy in patients with extraesophageal reflux syndrome is currently unknown.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^1167kzad]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination elements for dysphonia: The purpose of this statement is to help clinicians identify the underlying cause of dysphonia, and careful history and physical examination provide important clues to the underlying etiology and can help direct management. The larynx is described as a physiologically complex organ at the intersection of the upper respiratory tract and esophageal inlet, exposed to a variety of pathogens and noxious irritants and at risk for iatrogenic injury, so potential etiologies are very broad and include traumatic, infectious, inflammatory, neurologic, metabolic, neoplastic, congenital, and behavioral factors. The history should include duration, type of onset, potential inciting events, how the condition is affecting the patient, associated symptoms, modifying factors, current medications, habits, concurrent medical conditions, and prior surgery; careful evaluation allows the clinician to categorize dysphonia severity, develop a treatment plan, and prioritize patients who may need escalated care.

A careful and thoughtful history is extremely important in helping to elucidate the cause of a patient's voice complaints. An understanding of the patient's performance and rehearsal environment and demands is also important in guiding the treatment process. A thorough history helps the clinician understand the vocal problem and how to interpret findings on physical examination that may be contributing to the pathophysiology of the vocal complaint.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^114gJ3ut]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Hoarseness (dysphonia) — corticosteroid therapy recommendation: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe corticosteroids for patients with dysphonia prior to visualization of the larynx, with a recommendation against prescribing based on randomized trials showing adverse events and absence of clinical trials demonstrating benefits with a preponderance of harm over benefit for steroid use. Quality improvement opportunity is to discourage the empiric use of steroids for dysphonia prior to laryngeal examination. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with randomized trials showing increased incidence of adverse events associated with orally administered steroids and absence of clinical trials demonstrating any benefit of steroid treatment on outcomes, and the level of confidence in evidence is high. The benefit is to avoid potential adverse events associated with unproven therapy, with risks, harms, costs noted as none, and a benefits-harms assessment indicating a preponderance of harm over benefit for steroid use; value judgments emphasize avoiding adverse events of ineffective or unproven therapy. Patient preferences have a small role with shared decision making in specific circumstances, exclusions include children with croup, the policy level is recommendation against, and there were no differences of opinions.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^117D9DDV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Dysphonia epidemiology and impact — prevalence, populations, and consequences are summarized: Dysphonia (impaired voice production) is a very common complaint affecting nearly one-third of the population at some point in its life. Dysphonia can affect patients of all ages and sex but has an increased prevalence in teachers, older adults, and other persons with significant vocal demands, and in fact, voice problems affect 1 in 13 adults annually; while patients report a significant impairment of the voice, a relative minority seeks medical care for the voice problem. Dysphonia is responsible for frequent health care visits and several billion dollars lost in productivity annually from work absenteeism and, although often caused by benign or self-limited conditions, may also be the presenting symptom of a more serious or progressive condition requiring prompt diagnosis and management.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^116xbHqq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Persistent dysphonia — supporting timing and care patterns — reports that symptoms from viral laryngitis typically last 1 to 3 weeks and then resolve spontaneously, so initial observation for most patients with new-onset dysphonia is reasonable and persistence beyond this period raises concern for other pathologies. Delays are common, with most patients with dysphonia waiting between 88.7 and 119.2 days before seeking treatment and a survey of primary care providers finding that 64% preferred to treat rather than refer a patient with chronic dysphonia (> 6 weeks). The guideline text urges referral based on evidence suggesting that referral for careful laryngeal visualization results in shorter time to disease resolution and is more cost-effective than continued treatment without identification of an underlying etiology. Care patterns further note that a majority of patients (90%) with a complaint of hoarseness initially present to primary care, while otolaryngologists ultimately see between 3% and 10% of initial dysphonia consultations.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^112zVjz2]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The diagnosis of an acute sore throat is based on signs and symptoms. The Centor clinical prediction rules can be used to help predict whether the sore throat is caused by a bacterial pathogen, and thus guide the decision whether to prescribe an antibiotic.

Most guidelines recommend paracetamol or ibuprofen as the first choice treatment. The use of corticosteroids is mentioned in few, and is generally discouraged (table 1). Antibiotics are probably not helpful for pain relief in an episode of acute sore throat caused by viruses, but may help those with a bacterial infection. Recommended management of sore throat varies widely, and table 1summarises current guidelines.

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^111AK9UB]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Vocal demand and voice behaviour

Dysphonia and other irritating throat symptoms are more prevalent among professional voice usersdue to prolonged or exaggerated vocal fold vibration, which cause mechanical epithelial injury and inflammation, termed phonotrauma. Laryngeal muscle tension and fatigue related to excess vocal strain may play a roleand contributions from psychosomatic factors are common themes in the literature.

Diagnostic approach

A history of increased voice demand is sought although chronic phonatory symptoms (cough and throat clearing) are also considered potential precipitants. Nasoendoscopic findings involving laryngeal inflammation, motor tension or disrupted vocal cord movement may be contributory although such features are non-specific.

Treatment approach

Treatments include strategies to improve vocal hygiene and minimise excess voice demands, as well as targeted therapies to normalise aberrant motor patterns or tensionand address sensory components which may drive phonotraumatic symptoms. Patients may also be provided with reflux therapies in a 'cover all' approach.

Aerosolised irritants

Numerous airborne aerosols are irritative or noxious to the respiratory tract, including the laryngopharynx. Irritants are classified by occupational, domestic and environmental source. Impacts on the aerodigestive tract are specific to irritating agents and are associated with several throat symptoms.

Diagnostic and treatment approach

Comprehensive analysis of environmental aerodigestive irritants and proposed aerodigestive symptom implications are available, including diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Respiratory allergy

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma are among the most common allergic manifestations in the general population. Despite a continuous respiratory epithelium extending between the nasal and lower airways, the larynx and pharynx are excluded among defined airway allergy phenotypes. Chronic throat symptoms are more prevalent in allergic populationsand vice versa. Historically, throat symptoms when present are regarded as secondary manifestations, caused by irritative secretions travelling up from the lower airway or falling from the nasal cavity or via unified airway pathophysiology. However, emerging evidence advances IgE-mediated eosinophilic inflammation within the laryngopharynx as a previously under-recognised consequence of allergen sensitisation in some. This concept of an 'allergic laryngitis' (AL) is supported by a developing literature that points to epidemiological evidence and results from direct allergy provocation studies in both animal and human studies. Further research is needed to clarify its biological basis and clinical implications.

Diagnostic and treatment approach

AL is yet to be accepted as a valid diagnosis of airway allergy and has no established diagnostic or treatment directions beyond chronic cough under the 'upper airway cough syndrome' framework.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^1149pYrX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### Voice disorders in Nigerian primary school teachers [^115b2fqh]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The prolonged use or abuse of voice may lead to vocal fatigue and vocal fold tissue damage. School teachers routinely use their voices intensively at work and are therefore at a higher risk of dysphonia.

Aims

To determine the prevalence of voice disorders among primary school teachers in Lagos, Nigeria, and to explore associated risk factors.

Methods

Teaching and non-teaching staff from 19 public and private primary schools completed a self-administered questionnaire to obtain information on personal lifestyles, work experience and environment, and voice disorder symptoms. Dysphonia was defined as the presence of at least one of the following: hoarseness, repetitive throat clearing, tired voice or straining to speak.

Results

A total of 341 teaching and 155 non-teaching staff participated. The prevalence of dysphonia in teachers was 42% compared with 18% in non-teaching staff. A significantly higher proportion of the teachers reported that voice symptoms had affected their ability to communicate effectively. School type (public/private) did not predict the presence of dysphonia. Statistically significant associations were found for regular caffeinated drink intake (odds ratio [OR] = 3.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51–6.62), frequent upper respiratory tract infection (OR = 3.60; 95% CI: 1.39–9.33) and raised voice while teaching (OR = 10.1; 95% CI: 5.07–20.2).

Conclusions

Nigerian primary school teachers were at risk for dysphonia. Important environment and personal factors were upper respiratory infection, the need to frequently raise the voice when teaching and regular intake of caffeinated drinks. Dysphonia was not associated with age or years of teaching.

### Systematic review of the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions used to treat adults with inducible laryngeal obstruction [^116SejbQ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Inappropriate laryngeal closure during respiration can cause symptoms of respiratory distress. When this occurs transiently, in the absence of any structural or neurological abnormalities, management is often challenging. Inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) defines this phenomena and describes reoccurring airflow obstruction at the glottic and/or supraglottic level. Vocal cord dysfunction or paradoxical vocal fold motion disorder are the most commonly recognised terms related to inappropriate glottic closure, although numerous terminology exist which has impeded cohesive research advances within the field. ILO is the recommend nomenclature by an international multiprofessional body task force and is increasingly adopted in research and clinical settings. Due to the transient nature of ILO symptoms, the consensus gold standard for diagnosis is direct visualisation of the larynx during an episodic attack.

Individuals suffering with ILO present across varied healthcare settings with symptoms ranging from mild dyspnoea to acute respiratory distress. Typically, symptom onset is rapid and in response to an aggravating trigger; commonly reported triggers include mechanical, scent, environmental and emotional factors. ILO induced by exercise is referred to as E-ILO (exercise induced laryngeal obstruction). Associated throat tightness, stridor and voice change are common and respiratory distress usually occurs during inspiration. Despite a clearly distinct pathophysiology, the symptoms of ILO are akin to asthma and therefore many individuals are mismanaged as such. The average time for misdiagnosis is lengthy (5.4 years), meaning escalating pharmacological burden with high healthcare utilisation is prominent, which in turn leads to significant levels of patient morbidity.

The mechanistic drivers for ILO are poorly understood. In recent years, the concept of 'laryngeal dysfunction' has been proposed, which suggests a laryngeal sensitisation and a consequential laryngeal hyper-responsiveness. However, such hypothesises are yet to be tested robustly meaning that there is little consensus on ILO treatment approaches and no standardised protocol exist. Despite this, therapy-based management approaches are regularly cited within the literature and are often employed in the clinical context; speech and language therapy (SLT) is commonly referred to as the beneficial gold standard. However, although Patel et al 's systematic review highlights preliminary support for SLT as an effective ILO treatment it concludes the evidence supporting efficacy is in its infancy. Similarly, Mahoney et al 's recent work to determine treatment effectiveness for a range of vocal cord dysfunction interventions (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) concluded limited objective data exists to support the effectiveness of these interventions.

Pediatric voice disorders are increasing being noted as a barrier to success in school and socialization. Significant advances over the past decade in evaluation, diagnosis, and management of pediatric voice disorders have improved both short-term and long-term outcomes. Practitioners should have a thorough understanding of anatomy and physiology, accurately work up a pediatric voice disorder, and efficiently treat voice disorders. Comprehensive voice evaluation in children is essential to properly assessing pediatric dysphonia. Diagnosis and treatment are best managed by a multidisciplinary team. Accurate diagnosis allows for effective treatment, which includes voice therapy, medical therapy, and surgical intervention as needed.

### UK consensus statement on the diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction in light of the COVID-19 pandemic [^112T5hgt]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

1.4 Clinical approach to ILO in context

A multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach improves diagnostic precision and facilitates a meaningful clinical impact in ILO. However, in the absence of routine access to laryngoscopy, a critical component for MDT management of suspected ILO patients is missing, that is the gold‐standard diagnostic tool.

The inability to perform an endoscopic evaluation of the larynx and/or continuous laryngoscopy during provocation limits the MDT's ability to:
accurately confirm or refute ILO diagnosis
directly assess structure and function in the upper airway and rule out mimics that include serious structural issues requiring immediate surgical intervention (eg subglottic stenosis).
assess relevant differential diagnoses (especially nasal and reflux disease)
inform treatment regimens specific to the individual patient
provide biofeedback (to the patient) and teaching
monitor therapeutic response

Clinical symptoms can be used only as a guide, and without usual access to objective testing, it is not possible to confirm an accurate diagnosis. Over‐diagnosis without laryngoscopy is a particular concern in this context. In 303 patients with a high clinical suspicion of ILO (after specialist MDT evaluation), we confirmed laryngoscopic appearances in only 74% (data on file). It may be that symptom‐based questionnaires such as the Pittsburgh Vocal Cord Dysfunction Indexcan be used to help select patients, although further validation is needed. Such an approach has significant implications for ILO management, which should be considered carefully to minimize risk.

As elective activity and procedures are progressively reintroduced, professional guidelinessupport service recovery plans. However, specific guidance on how to diagnose ILO in the context of COVID‐19 currently does not exist. In response, This consensus statement aims to guide clinicians working with ILO patient populations.

### A narrative review and expert opinion on immunity-targeted approaches in the management of viral upper respiratory tract infections [^116R6ki5]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

URTIs continue to be a major reason for doctor's visits and missing school and workdays, which lead to a decrease in quality of life and financial losses. The evolution through repeated occurrences and complications can result in the URTI turning into a condition with a high possibility for aggravation and a highly negative effect on the individual's quality of life. Regardless of the main causative agents of URTI being viruses, such conditions cause most cases of antibiotic use and overuse.

Children, older adults, and those with health conditions characterized by autoimmune diseases, diabetes, obesity, multimorbidity, immunosuppressive treatments, and sedentary lifestyle are at a considerably higher predisposition to URTI development with recurrences and complications. For children, the most common causes include immature immunity levels, low weight at birth, and attending crowded preschool and school institutions. In the case of older adults, immunosenescence, alongside several other factors, form a web of causes predisposing them to recurrent URTIs and their aggravation.

Vaccination as a cornerstone in the prevention and mitigation of viral upper respiratory tract infections

Vaccination remains a keystone in the prevention and mitigation of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). By stimulating the immune system to recognize and combat specific pathogens, vaccines not only reduce the incidence of infections but also lessen the severity of disease outcomes. The primary strength of vaccination lies in its ability to prevent severe illness and death. While vaccines may not entirely prevent infection, they are effective in reducing the severity of symptoms and the risk of complications. Moreover, vaccination contributes to herd immunity, indirectly protecting unvaccinated individuals by reducing the overall circulation of pathogens. This is particularly important in the context of URTIs, which are highly contagious and can lead to significant morbidity, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and individuals with chronic health conditions. In addition to individual protection, widespread vaccination can alleviate the burden on healthcare systems by reducing the number of severe cases requiring medical attention. This is crucial during peak seasons of respiratory infections when healthcare resources are often stretched thin. Furthermore, by decreasing the incidence of severe disease, vaccination can reduce the need for antibiotic prescriptions, thereby contributing to the fight against antibiotic resistance.

### Corticosteroids for the common cold [^115GAjA5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is a frequent illness, which, although benign and self limiting, results in many consultations to primary care and considerable loss of school or work days. Current symptomatic treatments have limited benefit. Corticosteroids are an effective treatment in other upper respiratory tract infections and their anti-inflammatory effects may also be beneficial in the common cold. This updated review has included one additional study.

Objectives

To compare corticosteroids versus usual care for the common cold on measures of symptom resolution and improvement in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 4), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (2015, Issue 2), NHS Health Economics Database (2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 3, 2015) and EMBASE (January 2010 to May 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, controlled trials comparing corticosteroids to placebo or to standard clinical management.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We were unable to perform meta-analysis and instead present a narrative description of the available evidence.

Main Results

We included three trials (353 participants). Two trials compared intranasal corticosteroids to placebo and one trial compared intranasal corticosteroids to usual care; no trials studied oral corticosteroids. In the two placebo-controlled trials, no benefit of intranasal corticosteroids was demonstrated for duration or severity of symptoms. The risk of bias overall was low or unclear in these two trials. In a trial of 54 participants, the mean number of symptomatic days was 10.3 in the placebo group, compared to 10.7 in those using intranasal corticosteroids (P value = 0.72). A second trial of 199 participants reported no significant differences in the duration of symptoms. The single-blind trial in children aged two to 14 years, who were also receiving oral antibiotics, had inadequate reporting of outcome measures regarding symptom resolution. The overall risk of bias was high for this trial. Mean symptom severity scores were significantly lower in the group receiving intranasal steroids in addition to oral amoxicillin. One placebo-controlled trial reported the presence of rhinovirus in nasal aspirates and found no differences. Only one of the three trials reported on adverse events; no differences were found. Two trials reported secondary bacterial infections (one case of sinusitis, one case of acute otitis media; both in the corticosteroid groups). A lack of comparable outcome measures meant that we were unable to combine the data.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support the use of intranasal corticosteroids for symptomatic relief from the common cold. However, there were only three trials, one of which was very poor quality, and there was limited statistical power overall. Further large, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults and children are required to answer this question.

### Early administration of azithromycin and prevention of severe lower respiratory tract illnesses in preschool children with a history of such illnesses: a randomized clinical trial [^116eZnCx]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Many preschool children develop recurrent, severe episodes of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI). Although viral infections are often present, bacteria may also contribute to illness pathogenesis. Strategies that effectively attenuate such episodes are needed.

Objective

To evaluate if early administration of azithromycin, started prior to the onset of severe LRTI symptoms, in preschool children with recurrent severe LRTIs can prevent the progression of these episodes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted across 9 academic US medical centers in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's AsthmaNet network, with enrollment starting in April 2011 and follow-up complete by December 2014. Participants were 607 children aged 12 through 71 months with histories of recurrent, severe LRTIs and minimal day-to-day impairment.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to receive azithromycin (12 mg/kg/d for 5 days; n = 307) or matching placebo (n = 300), started early during each predefined RTI (child's signs or symptoms prior to development of LRTI), based on individualized action plans, over a 12- through 18-month period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was the number of RTIs not progressing to a severe LRTI, measured at the level of the RTI, that would in clinical practice trigger the prescription of oral corticosteroids. Presence of azithromycin-resistant organisms in oropharyngeal samples, along with adverse events, were among the secondary outcome measures.

Results

A total of 937 treated RTIs (azithromycin group, 473; placebo group, 464) were experienced by 443 children (azithromycin group, 223; placebo group, 220), including 92 severe LRTIs (azithromycin group, 35; placebo group, 57). Azithromycin significantly reduced the risk of progressing to severe LRTI relative to placebo (hazard ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.41–0.98], P = 0.04; absolute risk for first RTI: 0.05 for azithromycin, 0.08 for placebo; risk difference, 0.03 [95% CI, 0.00–0.06]). Induction of azithromycin-resistant organisms and adverse events were infrequently observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among young children with histories of recurrent severe LRTIs, the use of azithromycin early during an apparent RTI compared with placebo reduced the likelihood of severe LRTI. More information is needed on the development of antibiotic-resistant pathogens with this strategy.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117EQMdg]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

We explored and were able to dismiss subgroup effects, with one exception: the reduction in mean time to complete resolution of pain was greater with intramuscular than with oral corticosteroids. The subgroup effect and its direction was specified a priori, the difference between subgroups was relatively large (about 21 hours), and chance seems an unlikely explanation (P < 0.001). Credibility of the effect, however, is underminedas the effect modification is suggested by comparison between rather than within studies, and we found no similar difference in any other outcome. In addition, the only randomised controlled trial that compared oral and intramuscular treatment with dexamethasone reported no significant difference in any outcome.

The few serious adverse effects in the included trials occurred with similar frequency in the intervention and control groups, although some minor adverse effects reported by patients might not always have been noted. Potential adverse effects that appear later are more likely to occur after repeated use or are rare would not have been captured in the trials. Recent observational studies have raised the possibility of extremely rare but serious adverse effects after short courses of corticosteroids. The quality of this evidence is, for several reasons, low with respect to the current question. The studies used observational designs from large databases with suboptimal verification of diagnoses; serious confounding by indication raises the possibility that the association is a result of the underlying disease process (such as acute inflammation or exacerbation) rather than the corticosteroids themselves; and indirectness in that the doses used in the trials were lower and the duration of treatment was considerably shorter than the duration in the observational studies. Among children, a recent overview of reviews looked at evidence from 44 randomised controlled trials on conditions that required a short course of steroids (such as asthma, bronchiolitis, croup, wheeze, and pharyngitis/tonsillitis) and reported no major adverse events.

### Principles of judicious antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections in pediatrics [^112tZoQL]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Most upper respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses and require no antibiotics. This clinical report focuses on antibiotic prescribing strategies for bacterial upper respiratory tract infections, including acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis. The principles for judicious antibiotic prescribing that are outlined focus on applying stringent diagnostic criteria, weighing the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy, and understanding situations when antibiotics may not be indicated. The principles can be used to amplify messages from recent clinical guidelines for local guideline development and for patient communication; they are broadly applicable to antibiotic prescribing in general.

### Vocal cord dysfunction and asthma [^111Ra5vt]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vocal cord dysfunction can occur independently or can co-exist with asthma. It often mimics asthma in presentation and can be challenging to diagnose, particularly in those with known asthma. Vocal cord dysfunction remains under-recognized, which may result in unnecessary adjustments to asthma medicines and increased patient morbidity. There is a need to review current literature to explore current theories regarding disease presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.

Recent Findings

The underlying cause of vocal cord dysfunction is likely multifactorial but there has been increased interest in hyper-responsiveness of the larynx. Many intrinsic and extrinsic triggers have been identified which in part may explain asthma-like symptomatology. A variety of techniques have been reported to provoke vocal cord dysfunction during testing which may improve diagnosis. There is a significant gap in the literature regarding specific laryngeal control techniques, duration of therapy, and the effectiveness of laryngeal control as a treatment modality.

Summary

Those with vocal cord dysfunction and asthma report more symptoms on standardized asthma control questionnaires, which can result in increasing amounts of medication if vocal cord dysfunction is not identified and managed appropriately. Clinicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion to identify these patients. Videolaryngostroboscopy remains the diagnostic method of choice. Evidence-based guidelines are needed for the most effective diagnostic techniques. Laryngeal control taught by speech pathologists is the most common treatment. Effectiveness is supported in case reports and clinical experience, but not in larger randomized trials which are needed.

### Occupational and environmental contributions to chronic cough in adults: chest expert panel report [^113jDvJn]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical approach to occupational cough with laryngeal syndromes and cough hypersensitivity syndrome notes overlap among occupational cough, cough hypersensitivity syndrome, unexplained cough, and irritant-induced vocal cord dysfunction, and environmental exposures such as temperature changes, mechanical irritation, or chemical exposures may trigger cough; the high prevalence of laryngeal symptoms in patients with chronic cough suggests that screening for laryngeal disorders should occur as part of the initial assessment, although screening tools have not been developed specifically for patients with occupational cough; screening can involve assessment for inspiratory dyspnea, laryngeal irritation, dysphonia, tightness in the throat, or cough triggered by talking, or could be performed as part of the initial speech-language pathology assessment; suggested indicators for referral include history of dysphonia or episodic voice loss, significant laryngeal irritation, and co-existing symptoms of paradoxical vocal fold movement, and these factors are more likely to be important in vocally demanding professions such as teachers and singers; while noxious triggers like smoke and fumes can be easily modified, innocuous or nontussive triggers such as cold air and talking commonly persist and are difficult to modify without significant lifestyle restrictions.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^115q8kUf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Hydration, amplification, activity, and environmental factors — observational and trial signals: Preventive measures, such as adequate hydration, avoidance of irritants, voice training, and amplification, may reduce the risk of developing dysphonia; in a study of 422 teachers, absence of water intake was associated with a 60% higher risk of dysphonia, and amateur singers demonstrated less vocal fatigue with hydration and periods of voice rest, with phonatory effort decreased by adequate hydration and amplification sustaining voice quality during heavy use. One RCT found benefits of voice hygiene education among healthy student teachers, and individuals who do regular physical exercise, ≥ 3 times a week, had a lower prevalence of dysphonia. Environmental contributors include background noise, poor air quality, and dryness, and exposure to irritants (chemicals, smoke, particulates, pollution); one study of 10 symptomatic rescue workers at the World Trade Center disaster site associated vocal cord dysfunction and hoarseness with such exposure. Dry or arid environments may adversely affect the voice, environmental humidification had some beneficial effects on superficial laryngeal dehydration, and the CPG update panel concurred that avoidance of tobacco smoke (primary or secondhand) was beneficial to decrease the risk of dysphonia despite limited direct evidence.

### Medical therapy of reflux laryngitis [^1118cQMg]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Laryngeal signs and symptoms are frequently associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Establishing the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), however, is enigmatic as there are no tests that specifically define GERD-related laryngitis. Furthermore, in contrast to typical GERD, the treatment data for LPR using acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors has not shown a statistically significant advantage over placebo. This review highlights the current challenges for establishing the diagnosis of GERD-related LPR and focuses on the limitations of medical therapy directed toward gastric acid suppression.
