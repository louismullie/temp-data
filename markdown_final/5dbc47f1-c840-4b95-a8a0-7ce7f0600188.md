## Question

can you take triptans with duloxetine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether triptans can be taken with duloxetine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic overlap and the mechanistic risk for serotonin syndrome. Then, I should verify what regulators and labels say about coadministration. Next, I will review real-world risk estimates from observational data. After that, I need to consider patient-specific risk factors and contraindications. I will then outline a pragmatic monitoring and patient-education plan, address limits to avoid medication overuse headache, consider alternatives if risk is unacceptable, and finally synthesize a recommendation that balances benefit and risk with appropriate documentation and follow-up [^114EEkUD] [^116i1Lnn] [^115uKK6t].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and theoretical risk. Triptans are 5-HT1B/1D agonists used acutely for migraine, while duloxetine is an SNRI that increases synaptic serotonin and norepinephrine; the mechanistic concern is additive serotonergic effects precipitating serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening toxidrome, so I should keep that front-and-center as I weigh risks and benefits [^114EEkUD] [^116i1Lnn].

> Next, I should review authoritative labeling and guidance before making any conclusion. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: FDA triptan labels explicitly warn that serotonin syndrome may occur when triptans are combined with SSRIs or SNRIs, specifically naming duloxetine, but they do not designate the combination as contraindicated; instead, they advise that if concomitant therapy is clinically warranted, observe patients carefully, especially at initiation and dose increases, which means the combination is permissible with caution rather than prohibited outright [^114EEkUD] [^1141eGba].

> I need to check the empirical risk signal from large datasets to calibrate risk magnitude. A population-based EHR study of 19,017 patients co-prescribed triptans with SSRIs/SNRIs over 30,928 person-years found zero cases of serotonin syndrome using conservative diagnostic criteria, with only a very small number of cases under broader criteria, suggesting a very low absolute risk in practice; wait, let me verify my interpretation — yes, the incidence was near-zero under strict definitions, though rare events can be missed in retrospective designs, so I should communicate that the risk is rare but not impossible [^115uKK6t].

> But wait, what about patient-level factors that can shift risk? I will now examine scenarios where I should avoid or use extreme caution. Triptans remain contraindicated in patients with significant cardiovascular disease and uncontrolled hypertension; both triptans and duloxetine can elevate blood pressure, so I should confirm baseline BP control and vascular risk status before combining them. Polypharmacy with other serotonergic agents (for example, linezolid, MAOIs, tramadol, St. John's wort, lithium, and others) amplifies risk substantially; the elderly are also more vulnerable due to reduced clearance and multi-drug regimens. A history of serotonin syndrome is a red flag that should prompt avoidance or a strong preference for non-serotonergic alternatives [^1141eGba] [^1178DXJE] [^116i1Lnn] [^113UsEx9].

> Let me think about how to implement this safely if the combination is clinically warranted. I should double-check that both the indication for duloxetine (for example, depression, anxiety, or chronic pain) and the indication for a triptan (acute migraine) are strong and that alternatives have been considered. If I proceed, I need to ensure enhanced monitoring during initiation and any dose changes. That means checking blood pressure and heart rate, reviewing all serotonergic co-medications at each visit, and educating the patient to recognize serotonin syndrome early — mental status changes such as agitation or confusion, autonomic instability such as diaphoresis, tachycardia, fever, and blood pressure fluctuations, and neuromuscular findings such as tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus, rigidity, or incoordination — with clear instructions to seek urgent care if multiple symptoms emerge within hours of dosing, especially after a triptan dose [^114EEkUD] [^116i1Lnn].

> Hold on, I should verify limits that reduce downstream harm like medication overuse headache. Triptans should generally be limited to 10 days per month to prevent medication overuse headache; I need to counsel patients on tracking use, ideally with a headache diary. In pediatrics, related guidance caps triptan days at nine per month, while adult consensus sources similarly emphasize restricting acute therapies to no more than two days per week on average; this operationalizes a prevention-first strategy if acute use starts to climb [^114EEkUD] [^112YrYQY] [^116AXJAS].

> Next, I should review where triptans fit in evidence-based care and what to do if the risk-benefit is unfavorable. Triptans remain first-line for moderate-to-severe acute migraine in appropriate patients without vascular contraindications; however, if triptans are ineffective, not tolerated, or relatively contraindicated, I should consider non-vasoconstrictive options such as ditans or gepants, with lasmiditan supported as an alternative acute agent across subgroups including prior inadequate triptan responders. Wait, I should confirm that this does not imply zero interaction risk; while ditans and gepants are mechanistically distinct from triptans, I still need to review overall serotonergic load and counsel appropriately, then individualize based on comorbidities and prior responses [^113xNmhU] [^113HxNC6] [^1145YhJg].

> I should also confirm that my plan aligns with contemporary guideline pathways. U.S. DoD/VA guidance and primary care guidelines endorse several triptans, alone or combined with naproxen, for acute treatment in suitable adults; this supports using a triptan when indicated, with the above monitoring layered on when combined with duloxetine. If triptan days exceed limits, I should pivot to preventive strategies to reduce reliance on acute serotonergic combinations [^114WUWtw] [^113xNmhU].

> Let me synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer. Yes, triptans can be taken with duloxetine when the clinical indication is strong and cardiovascular contraindications are absent; the combination is not absolutely contraindicated but warrants informed consent, careful review of all serotonergic co-medications, baseline and follow-up blood pressure monitoring, patient education about serotonin syndrome, and close observation during initiation and dose changes, with strict adherence to triptan-use limits to avoid medication overuse headache. If warning symptoms appear, the patient should seek urgent care and withhold further serotonergic doses pending evaluation. I should document the rationale, counseling, and monitoring plan, and consider preventive or alternative acute options if use frequency or risk factors increase [^114EEkUD] [^1141eGba] [^115uKK6t].

Triptans can be used with duloxetine when clinically necessary, but the combination increases the risk of serotonin syndrome [^114EEkUD] [^1141eGba] [^116i1Lnn]. The absolute risk is low (about 0.02% in large cohorts) [^115uKK6t], so co-prescribing is not contraindicated, but patients should be monitored for serotonin toxicity, especially during initiation or dose changes [^114EEkUD]. Use the lowest effective doses, avoid other serotonergic drugs, and educate patients to seek care if they develop agitation, confusion, fever, sweating, tremor, or muscle stiffness [^116i1Lnn].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and interaction risk

- **Duloxetine**: SNRI that increases serotonin and norepinephrine by reuptake inhibition [^116BthVT], raising synaptic serotonin and risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with other serotonergic drugs [^116i1Lnn].

- **Triptans**: 5-HT1B/1D agonists for acute migraine relief [^114DXU2Z]; they have serotonergic activity and can contribute to serotonin syndrome when combined with SNRIs/SSRIs [^114EEkUD].

- **Interaction risk**: The combination can cause serotonin syndrome [^114EEkUD], a potentially life-threatening condition [^1141eGba] with mental status changes, autonomic instability, neuromuscular abnormalities, and gastrointestinal symptoms [^116i1Lnn].

---

## Clinical evidence and incidence of serotonin syndrome

- **FDA warnings**: Triptan labels (e.g. almotriptan, eletriptan) warn of serotonin syndrome risk with SNRIs/SSRIs, including duloxetine [^114EEkUD], and advise careful observation during initiation and dose changes [^1141eGba].

- **Incidence data**: In a large cohort (19,017 patients; 30,928 person-years) coprescribed triptans and SSRIs/SNRIs, only two cases met formal serotonin syndrome criteria (0.01%–0.02%) [^115uKK6t], both with mild symptoms and full recovery after stopping the serotonergic agent.

- **Clinical implication**: The absolute risk is very low, and the FDA has not contraindicated co-prescribing [^114EEkUD]; instead, it recommends monitoring and patient education [^1141eGba].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

No major guideline prohibits using **triptans with duloxetine** [^114WUWtw]; clinicians should **monitor for serotonin syndrome** and use the lowest effective doses of both agents. Monitoring is especially important during initiation and dose changes [^114EEkUD], with patient education on symptoms and when to seek care [^116i1Lnn].

---

## Practical clinical considerations

- **Patient selection**: Assess individual risk factors (e.g. age, comorbidities, other serotonergic drugs) before co-prescribing [^113UsEx9].

- **Patient education**: Teach patients to recognize serotonin syndrome symptoms (agitation, confusion, fever, sweating, tremor, muscle stiffness) and seek immediate care if they occur [^112WYJkp].

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider non-serotonergic options (e.g. NSAIDs, acetaminophen, gepants, ditans) if risk is high or symptoms develop [^11345J3V] [^1145YhJg].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Clinical necessity | Use triptans with duloxetine only when clearly indicated [^115uKK6t] |
| Monitoring | Watch for serotonin syndrome, especially during initiation and dose changes [^114EEkUD] |
| Patient education | Teach recognition of serotonin syndrome symptoms and when to seek care [^116i1Lnn] |
| Dose management | Use the lowest effective doses of both agents |
| Alternative therapies | Consider non-serotonergic options if risk is high or symptoms occur [^1145YhJg] |

Triptans can be used with duloxetine when necessary, but the combination increases **serotonin syndrome risk** [^114EEkUD] [^1141eGba]. The absolute risk is **low** [^115uKK6t], so co-prescribing is not contraindicated; monitor patients, use the lowest effective doses, and educate on symptoms and when to seek care [^114EEkUD] [^116i1Lnn].

### Almotriptan malate [^114EEkUD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including almotriptan tablets, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). If concomitant treatment with almotriptan tablets and an SSRI (e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, escitalopram) or SNRI (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

- **Medication overuse headache**: Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combinations of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache, referred to as medication overuse headache. Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in the frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including the withdrawal of the overused drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache), may be necessary.

- **Increases in blood pressure**: As with other triptans, significant elevations in systemic blood pressure may occur.

### Association of coprescription of triptan antimigraine drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants with serotonin syndrome [^115uKK6t]. JAMA Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an advisory warning on the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants, but the true risk of serotonin syndrome in these patients remains unknown.

- **Objective**: To assess the risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of triptans and SSRI or SNRI antidepressants.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study used electronic health record data from the Partners Research Data Registry (RPDR) to identify patients who had received an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis compatible with serotonin syndrome. These patients had been coprescribed triptans and SSRI or SNRI antidepressants in the Greater Boston, Massachusetts, area from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2014 (14 years). Clinical information was extracted to determine whether the case met formal diagnostic criteria and had coprescription within a calendar year. Both conservative and broad case definitions were used to better characterize the spectrum of risk. Data analysis was performed from November 23, 2016, to July 15, 2017.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Incidence of serotonin syndrome.

- **Results**: The RPDR search revealed 47,968 unique patients who were prescribed triptans during the 14-year period of the study. A total of 19,017 patients were coprescribed triptans and antidepressants during the study, with a total of 30,928 person-years of exposure. Serotonin syndrome was suspect…

### Axert [^1141eGba]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). High credibility.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including Axert®, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). If concomitant treatment with Axert® and an SSRI (e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, escitalopram) or SNRI (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

- **Increases in blood pressure**: As with other triptans, significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported on rare occasions with Axert® use in patients with and without a history of hypertension. Very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with significant clinical events. Axert® is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4.4)]. In normotensive healthy subjects and patients with hypertension controlled by medication, small but clinically insignificant increases in mean systolic (0.21 and 4.87 mm Hg, respectively) and diastolic (1.35 and 0.26 mm Hg, respectively) blood pressure have been observed.

### Benefits and harms in clinical trials of duloxetine for treatment of major depressive disorder: Comparison of clinical study reports, trial registries, and publications [^115pmUgZ]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

One set of independent observers used a two-step data extraction process to extract data on these outcomes from protocols and clinical study reports and from published articles by a second set of observers. Data from trial registry reports were extracted by one observer and checked by a second. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion and referral to the source documents within each set of observers, and a third opinion was sought when necessary.

For each trial, we compared data for each outcome between the protocol and the clinical study report, within the clinical study report, and between the clinical study report and publicly available data (journal trial report or trial registry report, or both) for consistency and, when applicable, completeness of reporting.

One researcher (EM) assessed completeness of reporting. The primary efficacy analysis was considered to be fully reported if scale, effect size for each group, measure of precision or variability, time point, type of analysis, and analysis population were provided, as described above. For major harms, the reporting of the number of patients and number of events was considered separately. In both instances, the phase (for example, randomized phase, placebo lead-out phase) and the number for each group needed to be reported. For treatment emergent adverse events, and for adverse events that emerged on discontinuation of study drug, the number of patients and number of events were also considered separately. The number of patients experiencing at least one treatment emergent adverse event…

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^116i1Lnn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine, when used alone, but particularly with the concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs. These drugs include triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort, as well as with drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin, particularly MAOIs used to treat psychiatric disorders and others such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue.

	- Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g. tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.

	- The concomitant use of fluoxetine with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Fluoxetine should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs, such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue, which provided information on the route of administration, involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses.

### Lasmiditan for the acute treatment of migraine: Subgroup analyses by prior response to triptans [^113HxNC6]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

In 2016, the World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study listed migraine as the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, after low back pain. Despite the availability of multiple pharmacological options for treating migraine attacks, unmet medical needs remain high, with approximately 40% of people with episodic migraine reporting at least one unmet need with their acute treatment in a population-based study. Of those with unmet needs, 37% were dissatisfied with their migraine acute treatment, citing adverse events, lack of efficacy, or overall dissatisfaction with the medication as reasons. Furthermore, people with at least one unmet need were more likely than those with no unmet needs to have used triptans in the past three months.

The principal safety concern with triptans, the standard acute treatment for migraine, relates to rare reports of serious vascular adverse reactions due to vasoconstriction. Consequently, these drugs are contraindicated in people with certain cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions, such as myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, ischemic heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and uncontrolled hypertension. Additionally, approximately 30–40% of people with migraine have insufficient efficacy or tolerability to triptans or are unwilling to take triptans for reasons that include a fear of adverse events. Hence, there is a significant unmet need for novel migraine therapies with a mechanism of action distinct from that of triptans.

### Pharmacoepidemiology of triptans in a headache centre [^114K8FD5]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

The aims of this survey were to examine the pharmacoepidemiology of triptans in a headache center and to compare the characteristics of patients who continued to take triptans with those of patients who had discontinued them.

We enrolled all migraine patients according to ICHD-II criteria, ensuring they were over 18 years of age, consecutively examined during a follow-up visit at the Headache Centre of the University Hospital of Modena from October 2008 to March 2009. Only patients who had used or were using a triptan were included. A specific questionnaire about the use and tolerability of triptans was created for the study and administered to every patient.

On the whole, 343 patients (migraine without aura: 72%; chronic migraine: 26%; migraine with aura: 2%; mean age 40.4 ± 10 years) had used or were using triptans. Most patients (72%) continued to use triptans, primarily for their efficacy. The minority (28%) who discontinued them were younger and suffered from less severe migraine; 59% of them had discontinued triptans because of adverse effects. Indeed, 92% of these patients versus 57% of patients who were currently using triptans reported adverse effects (p < .0001, Fisher's exact test). The number of patients reporting adverse effects significantly decreased with age (r = -0.230, p < .005, simple linear regression analysis). The triptan discontinued by the highest percentage of patients (84%) was subcutaneous 6 mg sumatriptan. Significantly more patients reported adverse effects with subcutaneous 6 mg (89%) and tablet 100 mg sumatriptan.

### An interventional response phenotyping study in chronic low back pain: Protocol for a mechanistic randomized controlled trial [^116umJ2R]. Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Duloxetine procedures. Participants randomized to the duloxetine arm will review the dosing schedule and safety information for the medication at the pre-intervention visit (T2 for Treatment 1 or T3 for Treatment 2) with the study coordinator. Findings from the physical exam conducted at baseline, as well as potential drug contraindications, will be reviewed as an additional precautionary measure. Participants will then be given 105 pills of 30 mg duloxetine with an 8-week dose escalation schedule and an additional 11 pills for those who would like to taper. Participants will be asked to start taking the medication from home, 7 days after the pre-intervention visit (T2/T3 visit). During the entire 8-week intervention, patients will be asked to keep a daily log of medication dosage, any missed doses, and any side effects they may have experienced.

- **Retention and subject incentives**: The study team's priority is to facilitate and support participation in the study (i.e. lessen participant burden). When possible, research appointments will be scheduled on the same day as standard care appointments. Research appointments are scheduled through the UMH electronic medical record system known as "MiChart", and thus appointment reminders are automatically sent via text and an automated call system prior to the appointment. Most data collection visits will use a hybrid approach where questionnaire data will be collected online, while clinical data such as vitals, biospecimen collection, and functional testing will take place on-site. For study integrity, participants with missed visits…

### Benefits and harms in clinical trials of duloxetine for treatment of major depressive disorder: Comparison of clinical study reports, trial registries, and publications [^114Jr1yd]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Discontinuations because of adverse events

All seven trials with a journal article reported the number of patients who discontinued because of an adverse event; for the two other trials (trials 2 and 3) it was reported in the Lilly trial registry reports. In trial 2, however, the data were not divided per group, as only the total number of patients was reported (see appendix 2).

Treatment emergent adverse events

Treatment emergent adverse events were poorly reported. None of the journal articles reported the number of patients that experienced such events in the randomised phase. The journal article for the largest trial (trial 9) provided a qualitative statement that there was no significant difference in the rates between duloxetine and placebo, and the number of patients affected was given only for a post-randomisation, so-called rescue phase, when they are not particularly relevant. Six journal articles reported events in the randomised phase only if they met a specified threshold — for example, had an incidence of greater than 10% for duloxetine patients.

The Lilly trial registry reports for all nine trials provided the number of patients who had experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event, but they reported only the number and types of adverse events that had a total incidence of at least 2% in each trial. The figure shows the number of treatment emergent adverse events reported in clinical study reports, Lilly trial registry reports, and journal articles for the randomised phase of each trial. Because of the use of reporting thresholds, data on between a me.

### International guidelines for the treatment of Huntington's disease [^111QyosU]. Frontiers in Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Huntington's disease, specifically in relation to the management of depression and anxiety, the 2019 EHDN guidelines recommend offering SSRIs or serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors as first-line therapy for anxiety, especially when it is associated with depression. Consider providing an on-demand prescription of an anxiolytic, but exercise caution because of the associated risk of worsening or causing falls. Offer neuroleptics as therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of anxiety when other treatments fail.

### Benefits and harms in clinical trials of duloxetine for treatment of major depressive disorder: Comparison of clinical study reports, trial registries, and publications [^1154bUMJ]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Primary efficacy analysis included scale, effect size (group means/medians or differences), and measure of precision or variability (confidence intervals, standard deviation, or standard error; interquartile range or other range for medians; precise P value). Time point, type of analysis, and analysis population (such as intention to treat, per protocol) were also considered.

- **Major harms**: For each phase of the trial (randomised phase and placebo lead-out phase), the number of patients and events in each arm was noted. This included deaths (including suicides), attempted suicides, serious adverse events, and discontinuations due to adverse events.

Before data extraction, we identified treatment emergent adverse events (adverse events that emerged or worsened after the study drug was started) and adverse events that emerged upon discontinuation of the study drug, as additional harms of interest.

### Association of prenatal exposure to triptans, alone or combined with other migraine medications, and neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring [^111EBhkV]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The long-term reproductive safety of migraine medications remains uncertain. This study sought to examine the effect of different intensities and durations of prenatal exposure to triptans, alone and combined with other preventive migraine medications, on neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in children.

- **Methods**: This nationwide health registry study in Norway included pregnancies of women with migraine before pregnancy and followed up their children up to 14 years of age. Single and multiple group-based trajectory models and group-based multitrajectory models were applied to cluster triptan exposure alone and combined with preventive antimigraine medications. Child outcomes, based on specialist outpatient and inpatient diagnoses, included autism spectrum and behavioral disorders, learning and intellectual disabilities, speech/language and developmental coordination disorders, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHDs). We fit adjusted and weighted pooled logistic regression models and standardized risk curves using propensity score-based overlap weighting.

- **Results**: We included 26,210 pregnancies of women with migraine; 4,929 and 21,281 were, respectively, nonmedicated and medicated with triptans in the year of prepregnancy. In the latter group, we identified four group-based trajectories of triptans alone and combined with preventive medications: discontinuers before (low use) (41.5%, 47.0%), early discontinuers (short-term low use) (31.3%, 28.8%), late discontinuers (moderate use) (21.3%, 9.1%), and late discontinuers (high use).

### Antidepressants, old and new. A review of their adverse effects and toxicity in overdose [^116r97kh]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

The newer antidepressants are as efficacious as the older agents in the treatment of depression. They have a side effect profile that is different from the older drugs and are generally better tolerated. Drug-drug interactions exist with some of these agents and can usually be predicted from knowledge of their metabolism. When taken in overdose as the sole agent, they are rarely fatal; seizures, nausea, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, and tachycardia are common. In combination with other drugs, toxicity can be more severe. The serotonin syndrome can occur with many of these drugs, and the emergency physician must be vigilant in the evaluation of the overdose patient. CAs and older MAOIs are still in use and remain dangerous when taken in overdose. Patients asymptomatic following a period of observation in the ED usually can be discharged after psychiatric evaluation, when it is required.

### Fluoxetine [^116Z7NU1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Before taking fluoxetine, it is important to discuss certain factors with your healthcare provider to ensure safe and effective treatment.

- **Ask if you are not sure if you need to discuss these with your healthcare provider**: If you are taking certain drugs or treatments, it is critical to inform your healthcare provider. This includes medications such as triptans for migraines, medicines for mood, anxiety, psychotic, or thought disorders, including tricyclics, lithium, SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, or antipsychotics. Also include tramadol, fentanyl, meperidine, methadone, or other opioids, amphetamines, and over-the-counter supplements like tryptophan or St. John's Wort, as well as if you are undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

- **Discuss any existing health conditions**: Inform your healthcare provider if you have liver, kidney, or heart problems, have or had seizures or convulsions, have bipolar disorder or mania, have low sodium levels in your blood, have a history of stroke, high blood pressure, or bleeding problems.

- **Considerations for pregnancy and breastfeeding**: If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, taking Fluoxetine Tablets late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk of certain problems for your newborn. Discuss the benefits and risks of treating depression during pregnancy with your healthcare provider. Similarly, if you are breastfeeding or plan to breast-feed, fluoxetine may pass into your breast milk.

### Atraumatic trismus induced by duloxetine: An uncommon presentation of acute dystonia [^114r9hYK]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Atraumatic trismus can be one of the presentations of medication-induced acute dystonia, particularly by antipsychotics and less commonly antidepressants. A case of an unusual emergency presentation of atraumatic trismus on initiation of duloxetine is reported. The patient was a 40-year-old woman experiencing sudden difficulty in mouth opening and speaking due to a stiffened jaw after taking 5 days of duloxetine prescribed for her fibromyalgia-related chest pain. Assessment of vital signs is prudent to ensure there is no laryngeal involvement. Other physical examinations and her recent investigations were unremarkable. She was treated for acute dystonia, and intravenous procyclidine was given together with oral diazepam. Her symptoms improved immediately, and her duloxetine was suggested to be stopped. To our knowledge, this is the first case of isolated trismus induced by duloxetine. Clinicians should be aware of this risk, especially considering the limitation of important physiological functions (such as swallowing, eating, etc) associated with this condition.

### Coding of adverse events of suicidality in clinical study reports of duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder: Descriptive study [^113VTfQx]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

In a clinical study report, data on adverse events are presented in various summaries and tabulations. These include listings of all adverse events and pre-existing medical conditions in individual patients, narratives of clinically important adverse events (including serious adverse events or discontinuations of the study drug due to adverse events), which also include data on pre-existing medical conditions, and summary tables of treatment emergent adverse events (events that occurred or worsened after the study drug was started) or adverse events that emerged after discontinuation of the study drug. Refer to supplementary appendices 1a-c for examples of each format.

There are important differences between these three data formats related to the coding procedures. The narratives — and in some cases the listings of data on individual patients — contain the investigator's description of the adverse event on the case report form, commonly referred to as the "verbatim" description. In summary tables, the events appear as coded terms. This coding is necessary to analyze rates of occurrence because investigators may use different terms to describe the same events. The grouping of similar events is achieved by coding verbatim terms to the most closely matching lowest level term in a hierarchically structured medical coding dictionary. Similar lowest level terms are aggregated at the next level into a preferred term, which is favoured for use in submissions to regulatory authorities and is presented in summary tables.

### Duloxetine: a review of its pharmacology and use in chronic pain management [^11682viH]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Duloxetine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with antidepressant and pain-relieving properties. Compared with other antidepressants, it has a high affinity for both norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake transporters, which are relatively balanced. Analgesic onset has been observed within the first week of administration in randomized controlled trials and is likely obtained by enhancing the tone of the descending pain inhibition pathways of the central nervous system.

Randomized trials have documented significant analgesic effects for managing chronic pain associated with fibromyalgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Studies have also suggested that pain associated with major depressive disorder can be reduced with this medication. Modest effects for headache, osteoarthritic pain, and pain secondary to Parkinson's disease have been documented; however, these data are obtained from single-blinded or open-label trials that require further corroboration with larger randomized studies.

Duloxetine has not yet been directly compared with other antidepressants or anticonvulsants for the treatment of pain syndromes.

### Are triptans with enhanced lipophilicity used for the acute treatment of migraine associated with an increased consulting rate for depressive illness [^114y211P]. Cephalalgia (2000). Low credibility.

In 1997, sumatriptan-treated migraineurs had significantly higher depression PCRs (22.3%) compared with non-triptan users (19.3%), with a difference of 6.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6–8.4%, P < 0.001). In the year following the launch of the TELs (April 1997 to March 1998), depression PCRs were significantly higher among patients using these compounds compared to sumatriptan-treated patients (5.1%, CI 1.8–12.0%, P < 0.05).

However, after accounting for prior depression (odds ratio (OR) 6.45, 95% CI 3.63–11.43), TELs were not significantly associated with depression (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03–2.13). Furthermore, rates of newly diagnosed depression after treatment were similar in the two triptan groups (sumatriptan 4.2%; TELs 3.9%). Although TELs are being prescribed to patients with higher pre-existing rates of depression, they are not associated with a subsequently increased consulting rate for depressive illness compared to patients taking sumatriptan.

This study highlights the potential to use GPRD to test targeted hypotheses exploring pharmacovigilance issues for patients using new medicines.

### Why the maternal medication list matters: Neonatal toxicity from combined serotonergic exposures [^115FevqZ]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Serotonergic medications are used for the prevention and treatment of depression during pregnancy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can cause poor neonatal adaptation, which has been attributed to withdrawal versus toxicity. Bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is often used as an adjunctive agent to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SNRIs for refractory depression. Quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic, may also be used in more complex cases. When combined with serotonergic drugs, bupropion and quetiapine are associated with increased risk of serotonin syndrome in adults.

We describe a neonate exposed to venlafaxine (an SNRI), bupropion, and quetiapine in utero who presented nearly immediately after birth with encephalopathy and abnormal movements. The severity and rapidity of symptoms may be attributable to the potentiation of venlafaxine's serotonergic effects by bupropion and quetiapine. Neonatal providers should be aware of maternal medications and prepare for possible adverse effects, particularly from common psychotropic exposures.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: A clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^113j4mzn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of migraines, specifically the management of acute attacks, the ACP 2025 guidelines recommend considering the use of a triptan in addition to acetaminophen for moderate-to-severe acute episodic migraine headaches in outpatient settings. This recommendation applies to nonpregnant adult patients who do not respond adequately to acetaminophen alone.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^117B8j9V]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular profile - **Mean changes**: From baseline to last observation, the mean changes for both standing and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures were less than 2 mm Hg and not significantly different from zero. Specifically, the changes were as follows: supine systolic BP -1.5 mm Hg (p = .364), supine diastolic BP -1.8 mm Hg (p = .141), standing systolic BP -1.9 mm Hg (p = .269), and standing diastolic BP -0.1 mm Hg (p = .907). Using repeated measures analysis, the mean changes in blood pressure were .10 for all between-group comparisons.

- **Pulse observations**: Mean baseline-to-endpoint increases were observed for both supine pulse (mean change = 1.6 bpm, p = .105) and standing pulse (mean change = 1.1 bpm, p = .338), although these changes did not differ significantly from zero.

- **PCS values occurrence**: The rates of occurrence for potentially clinically significant (PCS) values of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were generally low. The incidence of PCS low standing systolic blood pressure was 5/96 (5.2%).

### Comparison of healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with migraine with potentially adequate and insufficient triptan response [^114W6AZC]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

Use of triptans and other acute treatments for migraine was identified in the 24-month post-index period. The inclusion of other acute treatments for migraine was based on a modified list of medications from an evidence review from the American Academy of Neurology. This list included oral formulations, grouped into medication classes of acetaminophen, other guideline-listed triptans, butalbital combinations, ergots, NSAIDs, and opioids, including opioid combinations (see Supplemental Table 1). An additional consideration was that opioids, NSAIDs, and butalbital combinations may be used for other indications; hence, a medical claim with a migraine diagnosis in the 15-day window, including the prescription fill date and 14 days prior to that date, was applied as an additional criterion for these agents to be classified as a migraine-related prescription. The 15-day requirement was similar to the definition used in prior research to identify non-migraine-specific medications as being used for migraine.

### Selective publication of antidepressant trials and its influence on apparent efficacy [^112oeSwr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine is valuable to the extent that the evidence base is complete and unbiased. Selective publication of clinical trials — and the outcomes within those trials — can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk-benefit ratio.

- **Methods**: We obtained reviews from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for studies of 12 antidepressant agents involving 12,564 patients. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify matching publications. For trials that were reported in the literature, we compared the published outcomes with the FDA outcomes. We also compared the effect size derived from the published reports with the effect size derived from the entire FDA data set.

- **Results**: Among 74 FDA-registered studies, 31%, accounting for 3,449 study participants, were not published. Whether and how the studies were published were associated with the study outcome. A total of 37 studies viewed by the FDA as having positive results were published; 1 study viewed as positive was not published. Studies viewed by the FDA as having negative or questionable results were, with 3 exceptions, either not published (22 studies) or published in a way that, in our opinion, conveyed a positive outcome (11 studies). According to the published literature, it appeared that 94% of the trials conducted were positive; by contrast, the FDA analysis showed that 51% were positive. Separate meta-analyses of the FDA and journal data sets showed that the increase in effect size ranged from 11% to 69% for individual drugs and was 32% overall.

### Clomipramine hydrochloride [^114NLEWK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including clomipramine, particularly with the concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs. These include triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort. Additionally, drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin, especially MAOIs intended for psychiatric disorders as well as others such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue, are implicated.

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular changes (e.g. tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.

The concomitant use of clomipramine with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Clomipramine should not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses.

### Zenzedi [^11614cBk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of dextroamphetamine sulfate and other serotonergic drugs, including SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John's Wort, and drugs that impair serotonin metabolism, particularly MAOIs such as linezolid. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome.

- **Motor and verbal tics, and worsening of Tourette's syndrome**: Advise patients that motor and verbal tics and worsening of Tourette's syndrome may occur during treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they experience the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette's syndrome.

- **Potentially hazardous activities**: Amphetamines may impair the ability of patients to engage in potentially hazardous activities, such as operating machinery or vehicles, and patients should be cautioned accordingly.

- **MAO inhibitors**: MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism. This slowing potentiates amphetamines and increases their effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings. This can cause headaches and other signs of hypertensive crisis. A variety of neurological toxic effects and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur, sometimes with fatal results.

### Duloxetine, 60 mg once daily, for major depressive disorder: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^111UWVie]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). High credibility.

Despite treatment advances, major depressive disorder (MDD) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with therapies frequently failing to provide full remission. Physical symptoms are commonly seen in MDD patients, increasing overall morbidity and health care utilization. Duloxetine hydrochloride, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, was evaluated for efficacy, tolerability, and safety in the treatment of MDD and its associated physical symptoms.

- **Method**: In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study, adult patients with DSM-IV MDD were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 122) or duloxetine (60 mg/day, N = 123) for 9 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) total score. Painful physical symptoms were assessed using visual analog scales, and global illness and quality of life were evaluated using the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale, the Patient Global Impressions-Improvement scale, and the Quality of Life in Depression Scale. Safety and tolerability were determined by monitoring discontinuation rates, adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory results.

- **Results**: Duloxetine was significantly superior to placebo (p < .001) in reducing HAM-D-17 total scores, starting at week 2. The estimated probability of remission for duloxetine-treated patients (44%) was almost 3 times that of placebo patients (16%). Duloxetine significantly reduced painful physical symptoms in comparison with placebo. Discontinuation due to adverse events for duloxetine was addressed, but the text is incomplete.

### Duloxetine, a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence: A systematic review [^113L1nDt]. European Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Surgery and pelvic floor muscle training are established methods for treating stress urinary incontinence (SUI). A new serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, duloxetine, has been studied in multiple phase 3 trials as a form of medical management of this condition. This systematic review determined the effectiveness and acceptability of duloxetine in managing SUI.

- **Methods**: We reviewed all randomised controlled trials comparing duloxetine with placebo or no treatment. The search included the Cochrane Incontinence Group specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, dissertation abstracts, and the reference lists of relevant articles. The primary outcome was the number of participants whose symptoms were "cured" while on treatment. Secondary outcomes included subjective improvement, incontinent episodes, quality of life, adverse events, and discontinuation rates.

- **Results**: Nine trials were included, totaling 3063 women with predominantly SUI, all randomised to receive duloxetine or placebo. Treatment duration was 3–36 weeks. Subjective cure favoured duloxetine (from three trials, 10.8% vs. 7.7%; RR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.02–1.98, p = 0.04). The limited data available to assess objective cure rates were consistent with this. Individual studies showed a significant reduction in the Incontinence Episode Frequency (IEF) by approximately 50% during treatment. Duloxetine groups had significantly better quality-of-life scores (weighted mean difference for Incontinence Quality of Life Index for participants on 80 mg daily: 4.5; 95% CI, 2.83–6.18, p < 0.00001).

Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for medication overuse headache, particularly in pediatric patients, AAN/AHS 2019 guidelines recommend counseling pediatric patients with migraine and their families. They advise using no more than 14 days of ibuprofen or acetaminophen per month, no more than 9 days of triptans per month, and no more than 9 days per month of any combination of triptans, analgesics, or opioids for more than 3 months to avoid medication overuse headache (MOH).

### Acute migraine headache: Treatment strategies [^11345J3V]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent attacks. Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, triptans, antiemetics, ergot alkaloids, and combination analgesics have evidence supporting their effectiveness in the treatment of migraine. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are first-line treatments for mild to moderate migraines, whereas triptans are first-line treatments for moderate to severe migraines. Although triptans are effective, they may be expensive. Other medications, such as dihydroergotamine and antiemetics, are recommended for use as second- or third-line therapy for select patients or for those with refractory migraine.

The pharmacologic properties, potential adverse effects, cost, and routes of administration vary widely, allowing therapy to be individualized based on the pattern and severity of attacks. Several treatment principles, including taking medication early in an attack and using a stratified treatment approach, can help ensure that migraine treatment is cost-effective.

### Onset of action for duloxetine 60 mg once daily: Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^116vov8G]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

It is widely believed that most antidepressant medications exhibit a delay of 2–4 weeks before clinically relevant improvement can be observed among patients. During this latency period, patients continue to be symptomatic and functionally impaired. Thus, time to onset of effect is an important attribute of a new pharmacotherapy. We assessed the onset of effect for duloxetine, utilizing analytical methods previously recommended in the literature.

- **Method**: Efficacy data were pooled from two identical, but independent, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 9-week clinical trials of duloxetine (60 mg QD). Efficacy measures included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD(17)), HAMD(17) subscales (Maier, core, and anxiety), and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scales. In each individual study, duloxetine demonstrated statistically significant advantages over placebo on multiple outcomes. The present analysis utilized pooled data to more accurately and fully characterize the onset of effect for duloxetine.

- **Results**: Median times to sustained improvements of 10% and 20% in the HAMD(17) total score among duloxetine-treated patients were 14 days and 21 days, respectively, compared with 34 days and 49 days, respectively, for placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001 for both results). The median time to sustained 30% improvement in HAMD(17) total score was 35 days for duloxetine-treated patients, while the median time for placebo-treated patients was not estimable since less than half.

### Relationship between pain alleviation and disease-specific health-related quality of life measures in patients with chronic low back pain receiving duloxetine: Exploratory post hoc analysis of a Japanese Phase 3 randomized study [^116c4HPe]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Use of patient-reported outcome measures to predict response to duloxetine has been shown for patients with DPNP in the combination vs. monotherapy of pregabalin and duloxetine in diabetic neuropathy study, which assessed high-dose duloxetine or pregabalin monotherapy or duloxetine plus pregabalin combination therapy. Exploratory post hoc analyses of neuropathic pain symptoms using the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory in this randomized Phase 3 study identified subgroups of patients with distinct pain characteristics at baseline who had responded differently to duloxetine and pregabalin when given alone or in combination. The authors of this analysis suggested that taking heterogeneity in the patient cohort into account would allow for a more stratified, or even personalized, treatment approach for patients with chronic pain conditions.

We note that the safety profile for duloxetine in the study was similar to that reported in studies of patients receiving duloxetine for other pain indications. As reported previously, patients receiving duloxetine in the study reported a higher incidence of somnolence (19.2% vs. 7.1%), constipation (10.7% vs. 2.2%), nausea (9.0% vs. 2.7%), dizziness (6.4% vs. 0.9%), and dry mouth (6.0% vs. 0%) compared with patients receiving placebo. Most of these adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and were resolved or improved.

### Duloxetine versus other anti-depressive agents for depression [^116BthVT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in primary and secondary care settings. Amongst antidepressants, many different agents are available. Duloxetine hydrochloride is a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine and has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in the US for major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and chronic musculoskeletal pain.

- **Objectives**: To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of duloxetine in comparison with all other antidepressant agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

- **Search methods**: Searching was carried out via MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1974 to 2012), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety, and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2012. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical companies marketing duloxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to receive duloxetine versus any other antidepressive agent were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data, employing a double-entry procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, and intervention details.

### Management of depression relapse: Re-initiation of duloxetine treatment or dose increase [^1148Vubh]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

Continuation of antidepressant therapy after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce but not eliminate relapse. We evaluated the response to reinstating or increasing drug doses in patients who relapsed during a long-term, randomized, double-blind, continuation phase study of duloxetine treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with HAMD17 scores of > 18 and CGI-Severity scores of > 4 received duloxetine 60 mg QD for 12 weeks; responders then received 26 weeks of duloxetine 60 mg QD or placebo. The relapsing patients who started 12 weeks of rescue treatment received duloxetine 60 mg QD (if relapsing on placebo) or duloxetine 60 mg BID (if relapsing on duloxetine).

In the continuation phase, 87 patients received duloxetine 60 mg QD (n = 58) or 60 mg BID (n = 29) as treatment for relapse. The percentage of patients who responded to treatment after relapse was 62% of those whose dose was increased from 60 mg QD to 60 mg BID, and 74% for those who switched from placebo to duloxetine 60 mg daily. By the end of the study, 32 patients taking duloxetine 60 mg QD were in remission (57%), compared with 11 patients taking duloxetine 60 mg BID (38%).

There was significant improvement in HAMD17 and CGI-Severity scores for both groups at endpoint vs. the start of treatment for relapse. Significant improvements were seen for all visual analog scale parameters in the 60 mg QD group, but only Interference with Daily Activities and Back Pain parameters showed significant improvement for patients receiving 60 mg BID.

Inform patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of milnacipran hydrochloride, as well as the increased risk when taken concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs, including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, particularly MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and others, such as linezolid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Advise patients of the signs and symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome and instruct them to seek medical care immediately if they experience these symptoms.

- **Elevated blood pressure and heart rate**: Advise patients that milnacipran hydrochloride may increase their blood pressure and heart rate. They should have their blood pressure and heart rate monitored at regular intervals when receiving treatment with milnacipran hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].

- **Increased risk of bleeding**: Advise patients that the concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake, including milnacipran hydrochloride, and NSAIDs, aspirin, or anticoagulants has been associated with an increased risk of abnormal bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

### Imipramine pamoate [^117VZtSW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including imipramine pamoate, used alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs. These drugs include triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort, as well as drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin, particularly MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders and others like linezolid and intravenous methylene blue.

Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma. Autonomic instability symptoms include tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, and hyperthermia. Neuromuscular changes include tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and incoordination, along with seizures and gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.

The concomitant use of imipramine pamoate with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Imipramine pamoate should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes, such as oral tablets or local tissue injection, or at lower doses.

### Serotonin syndrome associated with polypharmacy in the elderly [^113UsEx9]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The increasing use of serotonergic agents, alone and in combination across multiple disciplines, makes it likely that the prevalence of serotonin syndrome will rise. Caution should be used, especially in the elderly, to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful polypharmacy. We describe a case of serotonin syndrome in a 79-year-old man taking mirtazapine, venlafaxine, and quetiapine. As this case illustrates, serotonin syndrome can be caused by combinations of direct serotonin agonists (e.g. serotonergic antidepressants) and indirect serotonin agonists (e.g. atypical antipsychotics).

### Zoloft [^112WYJkp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of Zoloft with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, specifically monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders as well as others, such as linezolid. Patients should contact their healthcare provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Increased risk of bleeding**: Inform patients about the concomitant use of Zoloft with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the-counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Activation of mania/hypomania**: Advise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### The design and rationale of the biomarkers for evaluating spine treatments trial: A sequential multiple assignment randomized trial [^1141V2r1]. Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Participants were treated with duloxetine for 12 weeks during the active treatment phase. At the time of randomization, participants were dispensed enough medication to maintain up to a 60 mg dosage through the 12-week intervention period and to taper off through Week 14 if needed.

Duloxetine was started at 30 mg, orally once per day in the morning for the first 7 days. Study staff conducted an assessment via phone on day 7 (or the next business day if day 7 falls on a weekend) of the intervention phase with participants newly randomized to duloxetine (i.e. day 7 of either the first or second intervention period). Study staff documented any adverse events and safety concerns the participants may have.

All participants were assessed at the midpoint of the intervention treatment period (i.e. either Week 6 or Week 18) for tolerance, adverse events, and response. At this point in time, participants tolerating the medication with no side effects were instructed to increase to 60 mg/day (if currently taking 30 mg/day) or remain on their dosage (if currently taking 60 mg/day). Participants tolerating the medication with mild side effects (e.g. nausea) were given the option of continuing their dosage (30 mg/day or 60 mg/day), reducing their dosage (from 60 mg/day to 30 mg/day), or tapering off their dosage (if currently taking 30 mg/day). Participants not tolerating the medication were instructed to taper off the medication. During the Week 18 call, participants were reminded that their study treatment period is ending in 6 weeks.

### A double-blind, randomized trial of duloxetine versus placebo in the management of chronic low back pain [^114rGLEr]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Duloxetine has demonstrated an analgesic effect in chronic pain states. This study assesses the efficacy of duloxetine in chronic low back pain (CLBP).

- **Methods**: Adult patients with non-radicular CLBP participated in a 13-week, double-blind, randomized study comparing duloxetine at doses of 20, 60, or 120 mg once daily with placebo. The primary measure was the comparison of duloxetine 60 mg with placebo regarding weekly mean 24-hour average pain. Secondary measures included the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ-24), Patient's Global Impressions of Improvement (PGI-I), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and evaluations of safety and tolerability.

- **Results**: Four hundred four patients were enrolled, and 267 completed the study. There were no significant differences between any dose of duloxetine and placebo in reducing weekly mean 24-hour average pain at the end-point. However, duloxetine 60 mg showed superior pain relief compared to placebo from weeks 3–11, though not at weeks 12–13. Significant improvement with duloxetine 60 mg was noted on PGI-I, RMDQ-24, BPI-average pain, and BPI-average interference. A significantly higher number of patients taking duloxetine 120 mg (24.1%) discontinued due to adverse events compared to placebo (8.5%).

- **Conclusions**: Duloxetine was superior to placebo on the primary objective from weeks 3–11, but this superiority was not maintained at the end-point. Duloxetine showed superiority over placebo on many secondary measures and was well tolerated.

Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family member experiences any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worsening, or cause concern:

- **Suicidal thoughts and actions**: thoughts about suicide or dying, attempts to commit suicide
- **Mood and behavioral changes**: new or worse depression, new or worse anxiety, feeling very agitated or restless, panic attacks
- **Sleep disturbances**: trouble sleeping (insomnia)
- **Irritability and aggression**: new or worse irritability, acting aggressively, being angry or violent
- **Impulsive and manic behavior**: acting on dangerous impulses, an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania)
- **Other changes**: other unusual changes in behavior or mood

Visual problems may occur, such as eye pain, changes in vision, and swelling or redness in or around the eye.

- **Important information about antidepressant medicines**: Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first consulting a healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms. Only some individuals are at risk for visual problems. It is advisable to undergo an eye examination to assess risk and receive preventative treatment if necessary.

Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is essential to discuss all the risks of treating depression, as well as the risks of not treating it. Patients, along with their families or caregivers, should explore all treatment options with a healthcare provider, beyond just the use of antidepressants. Antidepressant medicines have additional side effects. Discuss with your healthcare provider the side effects of the medicine prescribed for you or your family member.

- **Drug interactions**: Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medicines. It is important to be aware of all medicines that you or your family member are taking and to discuss potential interactions with a healthcare provider.

### Almotriptan malate [^1165YiFj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of almotriptan tablets or other triptans, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Medication overuse headache**: Inform patients that using acute migraine drugs for 10 or more days per month may lead to an exacerbation of headaches and encourage them to record headache frequency and drug use, for example, by keeping a headache diary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Pregnancy**: Advise patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant during treatment or intend to become pregnant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Nursing mothers**: Advise patients to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

- **Ability to operate machinery or vehicles**: Counsel patients that almotriptan tablets may cause dizziness, somnolence, visual disturbances, and other CNS symptoms that can interfere with driving or operating machinery. Advise patients not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have gained sufficient experience with almotriptan tablets to gauge whether their mental or visual performance is adversely affected.

### Duloxetine 60 mg once-daily in the treatment of painful physical symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder [^1128ckig]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

While emotional symptoms such as depressed mood and loss of interest have traditionally been considered the core symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), the prevalence and importance of painful physical symptoms such as back pain, abdominal pain, and musculoskeletal pain are becoming increasingly appreciated. Antidepressants that possess dual serotonin/norepinephrine (5-HT/NE) reuptake inhibition may demonstrate greater efficacy in alleviating pain. The efficacy of duloxetine, a balanced and potent dual reuptake inhibitor of 5-HT and NE, was evaluated within a cohort of depressed patients with associated painful physical symptoms.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD were randomized to receive placebo (N = 141) or duloxetine 60 mg once daily (N = 141). Patients were required to have a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17) total score of 15 or higher, a Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) score of 4 or higher, and a Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Average Pain score of 2 or higher at baseline. The primary efficacy measure was the BPI Average Pain score, while secondary measures included other BPI items, the HAMD17 total score, CGI-S, the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scale, Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for pain, and the Symptom Questionnaire, Somatic Subscale (SQSS). Safety was evaluated by recording treatment-emergent adverse events (spontaneously reported), vital signs, and laboratory analytes.

- **Results**: Mean changes in BPI Average Pain for duloxetine and placebo-treated patients were assessed.

### Comparison of healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with migraine with potentially adequate and insufficient triptan response [^116b3DVs]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

A total of 10,509 patients were identified as new triptan users (see Supplemental Figure 1). Of these, 3,036 (29%) did not refill the index triptan or fill any other non-index triptan or other acute treatments for migraine and were excluded from the analysis. Another 4,371 (41%) were identified as triptan-only continuers, and 3,102 (30%) were classified as potential triptan inadequate responders (TIR).

By definition, the triptan-only continuer group was on triptan monotherapy. All patients in the potential TIR groups received a non-triptan acute treatment for migraine in the 24-month post-index period. The most common non-triptan acute medications filled in the post-index period by potential TIR patients were opioids and opioid combination prescriptions (53% and 68% in the 12- and 24-month post-index periods, respectively). Other less commonly filled non-triptan acute medications among the potential TIR patients in the post-index period included NSAIDs (32%) and butalbital combination prescriptions (27%). The use of ergots was very low (2%), and no patients were identified with prescription fills for acetaminophen in the 24-month post-index period.

### Comparison of healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with migraine with potentially adequate and insufficient triptan response [^111X7yrW]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis: Sample demographic and clinical characteristics of potential TIR patients and triptan-only continuers (i.e. potentially adequate triptan responders) were assessed using descriptive statistics. Mean unadjusted healthcare resource use and cost outcomes were estimated in the two study groups.

Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to estimate the differences in healthcare resource use and cost outcomes between both groups. Specifically, multivariate logistic regressions were estimated for the binary outcomes of hospitalization and ED visits. Multivariate generalized linear models (GLM) with links selected by use of the Pearson correlation test, the Pregibon link test, and the modified Hosmer and Lemeshow test, and families selected by the modified Park test were estimated for the remaining healthcare resource use and cost outcomes [see Supplemental Table 2].

The adjusted estimates for the healthcare resource use and cost outcomes were calculated using the method of recycled predictions. Demographic characteristics included in the models were age, gender, geographic region, and type of insurance plan. Clinical covariates included Elixhauser comorbidities; relevant migraine-related comorbidities of anxiety and mood disorders, allergic rhinitis, pain (chronic pain, central pain, psychogenic pain, other pain, neck pain, back pain, fibromyalgia), and sleep disturbances; and cardiovascular comorbidities wherein triptans have warnings or contraindications (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and ischemic disease including ischemic heart disease).

### Early treatment in migraine: How strong is the current evidence [^114DXU2Z]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

Over the last 10 years, triptans (serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists) have proved to be efficacious in treating migraine pain. However, recent evidence suggests that patients are still not receiving optimal pain management, particularly in clinical trials, where triptan treatment is generally not initiated until pain has reached moderate intensity. Pathophysiological evidence indicates that if treatment is initiated at an early stage, while pain is still mild and before the onset of central sensitization, outcomes for patients may be improved. In addition, a small number of clinical trials have been reported in which triptans were taken early (within 1 hour of pain onset) or while pain was still mild; although constraints of trial design and data analysis limit definite conclusions, overall the results suggest that this early/mild approach results in more rapid and sustained pain relief. New studies are therefore needed to clarify the clinical benefits of early treatment, whilst taking into account potential risks, such as medication overuse. Ultimately, migraine treatment strategies require optimization in order to meet patient expectations and to reduce the burden of migraine-associated disability.

### Lasmiditan for the acute treatment of migraine: Subgroup analyses by prior response to triptans [^112RWsqi]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

In this integrated analysis of two similarly designed Phase 3, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (SAMURAI and SPARTAN), the response to lasmiditan for the acute treatment of migraine was found to be effective versus placebo in both good and insufficient responders to prior triptans, and in patients who were triptan naïve.

About 45% of the combined SAMURAI and SPARTAN study populations had previously used a triptan. As expected, prior triptan use was higher in SAMURAI and SPARTAN (both studies were conducted in patients with moderate-to-severe migraine disability [MIDAS score ≥ 11]) than in longitudinal and cross-sectional population-based and real-world studies (18–37%).

Evidence from controlled trials and observational studies suggests that approximately 30–40% of people with migraine have insufficient efficacy or tolerability to triptan therapy, a finding reflected in the results of this combined analysis: 31% of patients in the triptan-experienced subpopulation reported an insufficient response to prior triptans. Patients may consider themselves insufficient responders to triptans for a variety of reasons, including a lack of efficacy and intolerable adverse events.

In this integrated analysis, lasmiditan demonstrated higher efficacy versus placebo for all outcomes in patients who reported an insufficient response to prior triptan therapy. Additionally, the response to lasmiditan versus placebo in patients who self-reported an insufficient response to prior triptan use was similar to that in those who reported a good response.

### No added value of duloxetine in patients with chronic pain due to hip or knee osteoarthritis: A cluster-randomized trial [^114bBDBa]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Duloxetine use

Of the 66 patients in the duloxetine group, 56 patients (85%) initiated treatment with duloxetine. The most frequently mentioned reason for not initiating treatment with duloxetine was fear of side effects (7 patients). After 3 months, 61% of patients were still receiving duloxetine, and at 1 year, 35% of patients were still receiving duloxetine. In total, 33 patients (59%) discontinued treatment with duloxetine. Patient-reported reasons for stopping were a lack of effect (24%), side effects (49%), and a lack of effect in addition to side effects (18%). Data were missing for 10% of patients.

- **Adverse events**: At month 3, 89.3% of patients in the duloxetine group reported having at least one side effect compared to 72.5% of patients in the usual care group. Nausea, weight loss, constipation, yawning, and hyperhidrosis, which are well-known side effects of duloxetine, were significantly more frequently reported by patients in the duloxetine group.

- **Cointerventions**: Patients in the duloxetine group contacted their general practitioner more frequently (51.8% versus 24.2% at month 3) and were more often referred to an orthopedic surgeon (10.7% versus 3.8% at month 3). Over the total follow-up period, 5 patients in the duloxetine group had a total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR), while none of the patients receiving usual care had a THR or TKR.

### Early effects of duloxetine on emotion recognition in healthy volunteers [^1129quDq]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Characteristics of participants**: Two participants (one duloxetine, one placebo) did not complete the course of tablets and were removed from the analysis as both participants reported forgetting to take two tablets. The final sample for analysis therefore consisted of 38 participants (50% female). The duloxetine and placebo groups did not differ in age or baseline levels of anxiety, mood, heart rate, or blood pressure. Additionally, there was no clear evidence for any effects of duloxetine on anxiety, mood, blood pressure, or heart rate compared to placebo, except for systolic blood pressure, which was slightly reduced on day 14 relative to day 0 in the placebo group only. Levels of anxiety (GAD-7) and PANAS remained within the normal range (normative means: PANAS positive = 31.3; PANAS negative = 16.0; GAD-7 (scaled to 0–100 range) = 14.0). A summary of participant characteristics by drug group and time is presented in Table 1.

Table 1. Participant characteristics in duloxetine and placebo groups on day 0 (baseline) and day 14 (post-drug).

- **Drug-group determination**: The researchers responsible for participant testing (SB and VP) were unable to accurately determine drug-group membership (χ²(1, N = 40) = 2.50, p = 0.113; correct allocations: placebo group = 13/20; duloxetine group = 12/20). There was some evidence that participants could identify their drug-group when asked on day 14 (χ²(1, N = 40) = 10.4, p = 0.001); however, this was driven by those taking placebo (17/20 correct) rather than duloxetine (13/20 correct).

### SPL drug information for duloxetine hydrochloride DR [^1178DXJE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of duloxetine hydrochloride DR PO (also known as Cymbalta):

- **1-Naphthol toxicity**: Use caution in patients with delayed gastric emptying, as extremely acidic conditions can facilitate the hydrolysis of duloxetine to form naphthol.

- **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: Use caution in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

- **Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome**: Do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.

- **Bleeding and hypertension**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as duloxetine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Obtain BP monitoring. Recognize that the risk of bleeding is higher with the concomitant use of aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants.

- **Decreased serum sodium**: Use caution in all patients, especially in the elderly and in patients with volume depletion or taking diuretics. Discontinue duloxetine if symptomatic hyponatremia develops.

- **Exacerbation of increased blood glucose**: Use caution in patients with diabetes.

- **Increased serum transaminases, jaundice, acute liver failure (ALF)**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as duloxetine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Discontinue duloxetine if jaundice or other evidence of liver dysfunction occurs.

- **Manic or mixed episodes**: Use caution in patients with major depressive disorder at risk for bipolar disorder. Screen patients for personal and family history of bipolar disorder before initiating duloxetine.

- **Orthostatic hypotension, syncope, falls**: Use caution in elderly patients.

### Efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine, a novel dual reuptake inhibitor, in the treatment of major depressive disorder [^11362Bfv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Although highly selective antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, represent an advance over older drugs with respect to tolerability, they are not more effective than previous agents. Antidepressants that enhance transmission in more than one monoamine system may have greater efficacy than highly selective drugs, while equaling or improving their adverse effect profiles. This article reviews the properties of duloxetine, a potent and balanced inhibitor of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. Controlled studies indicate a high degree of efficacy, tolerability, and safety for duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder. In particular, rapid therapeutic onset and high remission rates have been noted. Duloxetine appears to have significant benefit in the treatment of the painful physical symptoms associated with depression. The continued presence of such symptoms may predict relapse. Accordingly, it is hoped that duloxetine therapy may reduce the likelihood of depressive relapse.

### Is duloxetine's effect on painful physical symptoms in depression an indirect result of improvement of depressive symptoms? Pooled analyses of three randomized controlled trials [^113k86GG]. Pain (2016). High credibility.

A total of 1320 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups, resulting in 641 receiving treatment with duloxetine and 679 receiving placebo. Most of the patients were female (69.7%) and Caucasian (81.8%). The mean age of the patients was 46.5 years with a standard deviation of 12.99. The mean baseline MADRS total score and BPI-SF average pain score were 29.9 (SD = 2.83) and 5.7 (SD = 1.63), respectively. Within this population, 25.5% were undergoing their first major depressive disorder (MDD) episode. Gender and ethnicity distributions, as well as age and baseline illness characteristics, were similar between the duloxetine and placebo groups.

- **Patient disposition**: At the end of the 8-week treatment, there was no significant difference in the number of patients who discontinued early between the duloxetine and placebo groups (duloxetine: 15.9% vs. placebo: 16.2%). A significantly greater number of patients discontinued treatment for lack of efficacy in the placebo group (4.4%) compared to the duloxetine group (1.6%) [P = 0.0033]. There was no significant difference between the duloxetine (5.3%) and placebo (3.8%) groups in discontinuations due to adverse events [P = 0.2261].
