## Question

A 52-year-old man is referred to hepatology clinic after routine blood tests reveal elevated serum ferritin of 1,200 mcg/L and mildly increased ALT and AST. He has a family history of hereditary hemochromatosis, and genetic testing confirms homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Abdominal ultrasound shows a mildly enlarged liver but no nodular contour or signs of portal hypertension. There is no clinical or imaging evidence of cirrhosis. The referring physician asks whether a liver biopsy should be performed at this stage.

Based on current EASL guidelines, should a liver biopsy be performed in this patient, and for what purpose? Justify your answer according to the recommendations.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a liver biopsy should be performed in a 52-year-old man with confirmed C282Y homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis, ferritin 1,200 mcg/L, and mildly elevated ALT/AST, and if so, what the purpose would be according to current EASL guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic certainty and whether the diagnosis is already established. Then, I should verify the risk stratification for advanced fibrosis based on ferritin and liver enzymes. Next, I will review EASL's stance on when to consider liver biopsy versus noninvasive fibrosis assessment. After that, I should consider alternatives like transient elastography and MRI for iron quantification. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and clarify the purpose of biopsy if it is indicated, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. With C282Y homozygosity plus elevated ferritin and transferrin saturation, HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis is established, and liver biopsy is not needed to confirm the diagnosis itself, so I should not conflate diagnostic confirmation with fibrosis staging needs [^eaaf9315] [^a533c276].

> Next, I should review risk stratification for advanced fibrosis. Ferritin greater than 1,000 mcg/L is a key threshold associated with a substantially higher risk of cirrhosis in C282Y homozygotes, and the addition of elevated aminotransferases further increases that risk. In this patient, ferritin is 1,200 mcg/L with mildly increased ALT/AST, which places him in a higher-risk category for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, warranting fibrosis assessment [^a8c14a66] [^f86860e4] [^40d46ef9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about invasive testing. EASL 2022 recommends assessing all patients with hemochromatosis noninvasively for liver fibrosis at diagnosis to guide management, and it advises against routine liver biopsy when the diagnosis is otherwise clear, reserving biopsy for selected scenarios rather than as a default [^b239d39a] [^77810c19].

> I will now examine when EASL suggests considering liver biopsy. EASL advises considering liver biopsy to assess liver fibrosis if serum ferritin is greater than 1,000 mcg/L or if liver enzymes are increased, which fits this patient, but it also emphasizes that noninvasive fibrosis assessment should be performed first and that biopsy is reserved for indeterminate or discordant cases or when additional histologic information is needed [^a8c14a66] [^b239d39a].

> Wait, let me verify the role of noninvasive tools. Transient elastography (FibroScan) is endorsed to stage fibrosis noninvasively in hemochromatosis, and MRI-based methods are preferred for quantifying hepatic iron concentration, which has largely supplanted biopsy for iron quantification in current practice. Given this, the modern approach is to use elastography and MRI first and reserve biopsy for unresolved questions or when histology would change management [^a533c276] [^361c0486].

> Let me synthesize the recommendation. Yes, liver biopsy should be considered in this patient because ferritin exceeds 1,000 mcg/L and ALT/AST are elevated, but it is not mandatory upfront. The appropriate next step is noninvasive fibrosis assessment with transient elastography and MRI for hepatic iron quantification, proceeding to biopsy if elastography is indeterminate, if results are discordant with clinical suspicion, or if there is a need to evaluate for alternative or additional liver diseases that could modify management [^a8c14a66] [^b239d39a] [^a533c276].

> I should double-check the purpose if biopsy is ultimately performed. The primary purpose would be to stage hepatic fibrosis, because identifying cirrhosis changes surveillance and follow-up, including initiation of hepatocellular carcinoma screening; biopsy can also quantify hepatic iron concentration and assess histologic patterns, though MRI has largely replaced biopsy for iron quantification in routine care [^f6260cca] [^a533c276].

> But wait, what if noninvasive testing is unavailable or unreliable in this setting? In that case, given ferritin above 1,000 mcg/L and elevated enzymes, proceeding directly to liver biopsy would be reasonable to ensure accurate fibrosis staging and to exclude cirrhosis, aligning with EASL's threshold-based consideration and with older AASLD guidance that supports biopsy in C282Y homozygotes with ferritin greater than 1,000 mcg/L or elevated transaminases [^a8c14a66] [^f86860e4].

> Final answer: Yes, liver biopsy should be considered in this patient because ferritin is greater than 1,000 mcg/L and ALT/AST are elevated, but the contemporary EASL-aligned approach is to perform noninvasive fibrosis assessment with transient elastography and MRI for hepatic iron quantification first, and to reserve liver biopsy for indeterminate results, discordant findings, or when histology is needed to evaluate alternative liver diseases. If biopsy is performed, the purpose is to stage fibrosis, identify cirrhosis to guide HCC surveillance, and quantify hepatic iron, recognizing that MRI has largely supplanted biopsy for iron quantification in current practice [^a8c14a66] [^b239d39a] [^a533c276] [^f86860e4].

Per EASL 2022, **liver biopsy is not routinely indicated** in C282Y homozygotes with ferritin > 1,000 mcg/L and mildly elevated transaminases when noninvasive fibrosis assessment is feasible [^b239d39a]. Instead, **noninvasive fibrosis assessment** (e.g. transient elastography or MR elastography) should be used first to stage fibrosis and guide management [^a533c276]. Biopsy is reserved for cases with indeterminate noninvasive results, suspected additional liver disease, or when histology will change management. If advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis is found, initiate HCC surveillance and consider variceal screening [^07f3243c].

---

## Indications for liver biopsy in hereditary hemochromatosis

Historically, liver biopsy was used to confirm iron overload and stage fibrosis; however, **modern guidelines prioritize noninvasive methods** [^a533c276]. According to EASL 2022, liver biopsy should be considered only in specific scenarios:

- **Indeterminate noninvasive fibrosis assessment**: When transient elastography or MR elastography yields inconclusive results, liver biopsy may be necessary to accurately stage fibrosis [^a533c276].

- **Suspected additional liver disease**: If there is clinical suspicion of concurrent liver diseases (e.g. nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, or chronic viral hepatitis), liver biopsy may be required to differentiate these conditions from iron-related injury [^ee79a4d1].

- **Management-altering histology**: When histological findings are likely to influence treatment decisions, such as the presence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, liver biopsy may be warranted [^f6260cca].

---

## Role of noninvasive fibrosis assessment

EASL 2022 emphasizes **noninvasive fibrosis assessment** as the preferred initial approach in patients with HFE hemochromatosis, particularly in C282Y homozygotes with elevated ferritin and mildly elevated transaminases [^b239d39a]. Noninvasive methods such as transient elastography (FibroScan) and MR elastography have demonstrated accuracy in staging liver fibrosis and can reliably identify patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis [^a533c276]. These methods are **less invasive**, associated with fewer complications, and can be repeated serially to monitor disease progression [^a533c276].

---

## Risk of advanced fibrosis in C282Y homozygotes

The risk of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis in C282Y homozygotes is significantly influenced by serum ferritin levels and liver enzyme abnormalities. Studies have demonstrated that **ferritin levels > 1,000 mcg/L** are associated with a higher prevalence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, particularly when accompanied by elevated transaminases [^40d46ef9]. However, even in patients with ferritin levels > 1,000 mcg/L, the absence of significant transaminase elevation or clinical evidence of cirrhosis substantially reduces the likelihood of advanced fibrosis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis

If advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis is identified, **management strategies must be adjusted** accordingly:

- **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance**: Patients with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis should undergo regular surveillance for HCC, typically with ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein measurements every six months [^07f3243c].

- **Variceal screening**: Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for esophageal varices, and if present, prophylactic therapy may be indicated to prevent variceal bleeding.

- **Aggressive iron removal**: Phlebotomy therapy should be intensified to achieve and maintain low ferritin levels, as iron removal can improve liver histology and reduce the risk of complications [^be2f7fed].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| C282Y homozygote with ferritin > 1,000 mcg/L and mildly elevated transaminases | - Noninvasive fibrosis assessment (transient elastography or MR elastography) [^b239d39a] <br/> - Liver biopsy reserved for indeterminate noninvasive results or suspected additional liver disease [^a533c276] |
| Indeterminate noninvasive fibrosis assessment | Consider liver biopsy to accurately stage fibrosis [^a533c276] |
| Suspected additional liver disease (e.g. NASH, alcoholic liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis) | Liver biopsy to differentiate and guide management [^ee79a4d1] |
| Advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis identified | - Initiate HCC surveillance [^07f3243c] <br/> - Screen for esophageal varices <br/> - Intensify phlebotomy therapy [^eaaf9315] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

In summary, **liver biopsy is not routinely indicated** for a 52-year-old male with confirmed C282Y homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis, ferritin 1,200 mcg/L, and mildly elevated transaminases. EASL 2022 recommends noninvasive fibrosis assessment as the initial approach, reserving liver biopsy for cases with indeterminate noninvasive results, suspected additional liver disease, or when histology will alter management. If advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis is identified, appropriate surveillance and management strategies should be implemented.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — diagnosis and treatment algorithm: In patients with suspected hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) based on symptoms, elevated liver enzymes, or family history, the suggested initial screening tests should be transferrin-iron saturation (TS) and serum ferritin (SF) level; if TS is < 45% and SF is normal, further evaluation is not necessary, whereas if TS is ≥ 45% and/or SF is elevated, HFE gene testing should be performed. All patients who are C282Y homozygotes should proceed to phlebotomy; if SF is > 1,000 μg/L, liver biopsy is suggested for fibrosis staging, and patients with cirrhosis should undergo screening for hepatocellular carcinoma; a liver biopsy can also be considered before initiating phlebotomy in C282Y homozygotes with elevated liver enzymes to rule out additional causes of liver disease. For patients who are not C282Y homozygotes, evaluation for other causes of elevated iron indices should be performed, including liver and hematologic disorders; if other causes of iron overload have been ruled out, hepatic iron concentration (HIC) should be assessed by liver biopsy or MRI, and patients with elevated HIC and SF of > 1,000 μg/mL should proceed to therapeutic phlebotomy.

Hemochromatosis — liver biopsy indications and ferritin-based risk in C282Y homozygotes: Serum ferritin helps triage biopsy; "Several studies have demonstrated that C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin > 1000 μg/L are at an increased risk of cirrhosis, with a prevalence of 20%-45%". In contrast, "fewer than 2% of C282Y homozygotes with a ferritin level < 1000 μg/L at the time of diagnosis has cirrhosis or bridging fibrosis". A study of "more than 670 asymptomatic C282Y homozygotes" performed biopsy "in 350 subjects" (cutoff "500 μg/L"), with cirrhosis "in 5.6% of all males and 1.9% of all females", and "All subjects with cirrhosis had a hepatic iron concentration (HIC) > 200 μmol/g of weight". Diagnostic performance showed "A serum ferritin level > 1000 μg/L had 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity for identification of cirrhosis", and "No subject with a serum ferritin level < 1000 μg/L had cirrhosis". Accordingly, "liver biopsy does not need to be performed when ferritin is < 1000 μg/L, in the absence of excess alcohol consumption and elevated serum liver enzymes". For non-C282Y homozygotes, "Patients with elevated serum iron studies, but who lack C282Y homozygosity, should be considered for liver biopsy if they have elevated liver enzymes or other clinical evidence of liver disease".

Hereditary hemochromatosis — Liver biopsy utility and ferritin thresholds: The primary utility of liver biopsy in HH is staging of fibrosis, particularly among C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin (SF) of > 1,000 ng/mL; in the absence of such risk factors, less than 2% of C282Y homozygotes with a SF of < 1,000 ng/mL have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and if clinical features of advanced fibrosis are present, a liver biopsy can be considered.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^edfdb197]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE) — Screening should be considered in all patients with abnormal AST/ALT levels and include an iron panel to determine transferrin saturation and serum ferritin; if the transferrin saturation is 45% or higher, or the serum ferritin is elevated, consideration should be given for HFE gene mutation analysis. Because ferritin is an acute phase reactant, an elevated ferritin in acute hepatitis likely does not indicate iron overload. The presence of a homozygous C282Y mutation confirms HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis, whereas compound C282Y/H63D heterozygotes rarely manifest chronic liver disease from iron overload. In patients with homozygous C282Y or compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D mutations who have elevated AST/ALT levels or ferritin > 1,000 μg/l, or in non-HFE hemochromatosis, liver biopsy should be considered to stage liver fibrosis and quantify hepatic iron overload to guide therapy.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis [^a0d2818e]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts the body's regulation of iron. It is the most common genetic disease in whites. Men have a 24-fold increased rate of iron-overload disease compared with women. Persons who are homozygous for the HFE gene mutation C282Y comprise 85 to 90 percent of phenotypically affected persons. End-organ damage or clinical manifestations of hereditary hemochromatosis occur in approximately 10 percent of persons homozygous for C282Y. Symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis are nonspecific and typically absent in the early stages. If present, symptoms may include weakness, lethargy, arthralgias, and impotence. Later manifestations include arthralgias, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism. Diagnosis requires confirmation of increased serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation, with or without symptoms. Subtyping is based on genotypic expression. Serum ferritin measurement is the most useful prognostic indicator of disease severity. Liver biopsy is performed to stage the degree of fibrosis with severe ferritin elevation or transaminitis, or to diagnose nonclassical hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with other genetic defects. Treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis requires phlebotomy, and the frequency is guided by serial measurements of serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation. Iron avidity can result from overtreatment. If iron avidity is not suspected, it may mimic undertreatment with persistently elevated transferrin saturation. Dietary modification is generally unnecessary. Universal screening for hereditary hemochromatosis is not recommended, but testing should be performed in first-degree relatives of patients with classical HFE-related hemochromatosis, those with evidence of active liver disease, and patients with abnormal iron study results. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is reserved for those with hereditary hemochromatosis and cirrhosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^361c0486]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — hereditary hemochromatosis diagnostic evaluation and management emphasize that the increasing use of noninvasive tests such as MRI T2✱ has made quantification of hepatic iron deposition easier and eliminated the need for liver biopsy in most patients, and that serum ferritin of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis remains an important diagnostic test to identify patients with a low risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and should be used routinely as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Genetic testing for other types of HH is available but is expensive and generally not useful in most clinical settings. Serum ferritin may be elevated among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in those with alcoholic liver disease, and these diagnoses are more common than HH among patients with elevated serum ferritin who are not C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes, so a secondary cause for liver disease should be excluded among patients with suspected iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy, although emerging novel therapies such as new chelating agents may have a role for selected patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^de34ee2d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — when to initiate treatment is outlined for HFE genotypes: Treatment should be initiated in C282Y homozygotes with elevated serum ferritin (SF), defined as > 300 ng/mL in men and > 200 ng/mL in women, along with a transferrin saturation (TS) of ≥ 45%. Homozygous patients with a SF within normal limits at diagnosis are unlikely to develop clinically relevant iron overload later in life and therefore can be monitored with serial assessment of liver aminotransferase and SF levels. Although patients with a SF of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis are unlikely to have end-organ damage, we still suggest treatment because between 13% and 35% of men and between 16% and 22% of women will progress to a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL if left untreated. For compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D) the risk of developing clinically relevant iron overload is low; a liver biopsy can be considered to rule out secondary liver disorders or to evaluate NAFLD and cirrhosis, particularly among individuals with a SF above 1,000 ng/mL, and for compound heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes with evidence of elevated hepatic iron concentration (HIC) on biopsy, iron removal can be considered.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^018dd209]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) — general population screening is not indicated or recommended; evidence includes limited clinical penetrance and low cirrhosis prevalence in population studies. Approximately 30% of C282Y homozygotes do not have phenotypic expression of excess iron stores in cross-sectional studies, and in a large Norwegian study, 65,238 subjects were screened using transferrin saturation with confirmatory testing as needed; in 147 subjects who underwent liver biopsy, only four men and none of the women had cirrhosis (2.7% prevalence of cirrhosis). An Australian population study of 3011 individuals revealed 16 C282Y homozygotes, of whom 11 with serum ferritin > 300 μg/L underwent liver biopsy, identifying five with advanced fibrosis and one with cirrhosis (6.3% prevalence of cirrhosis). Economic models have suggested screening would be effective only if 20% developed life-threatening complications, and long-term observational data followed patients for 25 years. Because of these considerations, general population screening for HH is not indicated, widespread population screening for HH is not recommended, and the guideline states: Average risk population screening for HH is not recommended.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis: insights from the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening (HEIRS) study [^6844825f]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Hemochromatosis comprises a group of inherited disorders resulting from mutations of genes involved in regulating iron metabolism. The multicenter, multi-ethnic Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study screened approximately 100,000 participants in the US and Canada, testing for HFE mutations, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. As in other studies, HFE C282Y homozygosity was common in Caucasians but rare in other ethnic groups, and there was a marked heterogeneity of disease expression in C282Y homozygotes. Nevertheless, this genotype was often associated with elevations of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation and with iron stores of more than four grams in men but not in women. If liver biopsy was performed, in some cases because of evidence of hepatic dysfunction, fibrosis or cirrhosis was often found. Combined elevations of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were observed in non-C282Y homozygotes of all ethnic groups, most prominently Asians, but not often with iron stores of more than four grams. Future studies to discover modifier genes that affect phenotypic expression in C282Y hemochromatosis should help identify patients who are at greatest risk of developing iron overload and who may benefit from continued monitoring of iron status to detect progressive iron loading.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is one of the most common genetic disorders among persons of northern European descent. There have been recent advances in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HH. The availability of molecular diagnostic testing for HH has made possible confirmation of the diagnosis for most patients. Several genotype-phenotype correlation studies have clarified the differences in clinical features between patients with the C282Y homozygous genotypes and other HFE mutation patterns. The increasing use of noninvasive tests such as MRI T2✱ has made quantification of hepatic iron deposition easier and eliminated the need for liver biopsy in most patients. Serum ferritin of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis remains an important diagnostic test to identify patients with a low risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and should be used routinely as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Genetic testing for other types of HH is available but is expensive and generally not useful in most clinical settings. Serum ferritin may be elevated among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in those with alcoholic liver disease. These diagnoses are more common than HH among patients with elevated serum ferritin who are not C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes. A secondary cause for liver disease should be excluded among patients with suspected iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy, but emerging novel therapies such as new chelating agents may have a role for selected patients.

### Haemochromatosis: find them or forget about them? [^514b1a69]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Haemochromatosis continues to be considered an uncommon disease despite large scale population screening studies demonstrating a high prevalence of C282Y homozygotes of approximately 1 in 200. Since many of the C282Y homozygotes that are discovered through screening are asymptomatic, or have non-specific symptoms commonly found in the ageing population, the attribution of any symptoms to haemochromatosis has become increasingly difficult. The demonstration of significant liver disease in family members is a strong reminder of the vital importance of pedigree studies when a typical haemochromatosis patient is identified.

Serum ferritin levels have an additional value as a predictor of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in confirmed HH. Several studies have demonstrated that a level of serum ferritin < 1000 μg/L is an accurate predictor for the absence of cirrhosis, independent of the duration of the disease.–A serum ferritin level > 1000 μg/L with an elevated aminotransferase level (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) and a platelet count < 200 × 10⁹/L predicted the presence of cirrhosis in 80% of C282Y homozygotes.

Recommendations:

3. In a patient with suggestive symptoms, physical findings, or family history, a combination of TS and ferritin should be obtained rather than relying on a single test. (1B) If either is abnormal (TS ≥ 45% or ferritin above the upper limit of normal), then HFE mutation analysis should be performed. (1B)

4. Diagnostic strategies using serum iron markers should target high-risk groups such as those with a family history of HH or those with suspected organ involvement. (1B)

Based on these recent studies, it can be concluded that serum ferritin is the single most important predictor of the presence of advanced hepatic fibrosis in C282Y homozygotes. Therefore, liver biopsy does not need to be performed when ferritin is < l000 μg/L, in the absence of excess alcohol consumption and elevated serum liver enzymes.

Patients with elevated serum iron studies, but who lack C282Y homozygosity, should be considered for liver biopsy if they have elevated liver enzymes or other clinical evidence of liver disease. These patients may have non-HH liver disease such as NAFLD, ALD, or chronic viral hepatitis.

When liver biopsy is performed, routine histopathologic evaluation should include standard hematoxylin–eosin and Masson's trichrome stains as well as Perls' Prussian blue stains for evaluating the degree and cellular distribution of hepatic iron stores. In addition, a portion of liver tissue can be obtained for measurement of HIC. It should be recognized that HIC can also be measured from formalin-fixed, deparaffinized specimens, but at least 4 mg dry weight of tissue should be available for evaluation. Qualitative and semiquantitative methods for grading the degree of stainable hepatic iron have been described. The Batts–Ludwig system uses an estimation of the proportion of hepatocytes that stain for iron, ranging from solely zone 1 (periportal) to inclusion of zones 2 and 3 (pericentral). The grading of iron staining ranges from grade 1 to grade 4, with grade 4 representing panlobular iron deposition. A semiquantitative "histological hepatic iron index" has been proposed based on the size and density of iron granules in hepatocytes, sinusoidal lining cells, and portal cells. This formula can be used to calculate a total iron score, and this system has been validated and found to be useful to differentiate heterozygotes from homozygotes. It is not widely used outside the research setting.

### Clinical penetrance in hereditary hemochromatosis: estimates of the cumulative incidence of severe liver disease among HFE C282Y homozygotes [^1eeab252]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Iron overload (hemochromatosis) can cause serious, symptomatic disease that is preventable if detected early and managed appropriately. The leading cause of hemochromatosis in populations of predominantly European ancestry is homozygosity of the C282Y variant in the HFE gene. Screening of adults for iron overload or associated genotypes is controversial, largely because of a belief that severe phenotypes are uncommon, although cascade testing of first-degree relatives of patients is widely endorsed. We contend that severe liver disease (cirrhosis or hepatocellular cancer) is not at all uncommon among older males with hereditary hemochromatosis. Our review of the published data from a variety of empirical sources indicates that roughly 1 in 10 male HFE C282Y homozygotes is likely to develop severe liver disease during his lifetime unless iron overload is detected early and treated. New evidence from a randomized controlled trial of treatment allows for evidence-based management of presymptomatic patients. Although population screening for HFE C282Y homozygosity faces multiple barriers, a potentially effective strategy for increasing the early detection and prevention of clinical iron overload and severe disease is to include HFE C282Y homozygosity in lists of medically actionable gene variants when reporting the results of genome or exome sequencing.

Hemochromatosis (HH) — genetic prevalence and clinical penetrance are characterized by C282Y homozygosity seen in approximately one in 250 Caucasians, with fully expressed disease with end-organ manifestations in fewer than 10% of these individuals, and full clinical manifestations seen approximately one in 2500. The heterozygote genotype (C282Y/wild type) is found in approximately one in 10 individuals and may be associated with elevated serum iron markers, but without associated tissue iron overload or damage. Approximately 75% did not have symptoms and did not exhibit any of the end-stage manifestations of the disease when identified in this way, and in large population screening studies only approximately 70% of C282Y homozygotes are found to have an elevated ferritin level; more men than women have increased ferritin levels.

Role of Liver Biopsy in Non– HFE -related HH

Liver biopsy may provide both diagnostic and prognostic information in patients with iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes. Abnormal serum iron studies are identified in approximately 50% of patients with other liver diseases such as ALD, NAFLD, or chronic viral hepatitis. Liver biopsy is used to evaluate those patients both from the standpoint of their underlying disease, determining the stage of fibrosis, and to determine the degree of iron loading. In the secondary iron overload seen with other liver diseases, iron deposition is usually mild (1+ to 2+) and generally occurs in both perisinusoidal lining cells (Kupffer cells) and in hepatocytes in a panlobular distribution. Liver biopsy is also useful to identify the different pattern of iron overload seen in patients with ferroportin disease, wherein the iron deposition is predominantly in reticuloendothelial cells or is in a mixed pattern of hepatocytes and reticuloendothelial cells without a periportal predominance.

Recommendations:

7. Liver biopsy is recommended for diagnosis and prognosis in patients with phenotypic markers of iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. (2C)

8. We recommend that in patients with non –HFE- related HH, data on hepatic iron concentration is useful, along with histopathologic iron staining, to determine the degree and cellular distribution of iron loading present. (2C)

### HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis [^9744f8d2]. Genetics in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

In populations of northern European descent, the p.C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is highly prevalent, and HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common type of inherited iron overload disorder. Inappropriate low secretion of hepcidin, which negatively regulates iron absorption, is postulated to be the mechanism for iron overload in this condition. The characteristic biochemical abnormalities are elevated serum transferrin-iron saturation and serum ferritin. Typical clinical manifestations include cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated serum aminotransferase levels, diabetes mellitus, restrictive cardiomyopathy and arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. Most patients are now diagnosed before the development of these clinical features. Molecular genetic tests are currently available for genotypic diagnosis. In selected individuals, diagnosis might require liver biopsy or quantitative phlebotomy. Iron depletion by phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment and is highly effective in preventing the complications of iron overload if instituted before the development of cirrhosis. Genetic testing is currently not recommended for population screening because of low yield as the majority of the healthy, asymptomatic p.C282Y homozygotes do not develop clinically significant iron overload. HFE gene testing remains an excellent tool for the screening of first-degree relatives of affected probands who are p.C282Y homozygotes.

General Population Screening

When considering the evidence required to determine whether general population screening should be performed for the C282Y mutation, a key factor is the clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygosity. Approximately 30% of C282Y homozygotes do not have phenotypic expression of excess iron stores in cross-sectional studies (Table 2). Because of this, from a public policy perspective, general population screening for HH is not indicated. In a large Norwegian study, 65,238 subjects were screened using TS, and when it was elevated on two determinations, cases were confirmed by genetic testing and/or liver biopsy. In 147 subjects, liver biopsies were performed and only four men and none of the women had cirrhosis (2.7% prevalence of cirrhosis). An Australian population study of 3011 individuals revealed 16 C282Y homozygotes. Of these 16, liver biopsy was performed in 11 cases with serum ferritin > 300 μg/L, of whom three were identified with advanced fibrosis and one with cirrhosis who had associated ALD (6.3% prevalence of cirrhosis). Other prospective population studies have reached similar conclusions that the clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygosity is quite low. This discrepancy between the morbidity seen in referred patients and the lack of morbidity in screened patients is not unique to HH.

Economic models that have included genetic testing have suggested that population screening for HH would be effective if only 20% of patients developed life-threatening complications. The natural history of untreated HH has been illustrated in the Copenhagen Heart Study, where patients were followed for 25 years with serial ferritin testing without an awareness that they were C282Y homozygotes. Many patients did not demonstrate progression of iron overload as measured by serum ferritin, and the costs of investigating false positive iron tests in a screening program were considered significant. This has led some to consider that a genetic test should be done first, followed by measurement of serum ferritin. There have been concerns expressed about the adverse effects of genetic testing such as genetic discrimination; however, several studies have demonstrated that this is rarely a valid concern. Nonetheless, widespread population screening for HH is not recommended, whereas more selective screening in high-risk populations needs further study.

Recommendations:

16. Average risk population screening for HH is not recommended.(1B)

### Hemochromatosis classification: update and recommendations by the BIOIRON society [^a533c276]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Liver biopsy was once regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of HC because it can reveal iron deposition in hepatocytes with the typical decreasing gradient from the periportal zone (most exposed to iron coming from the gut) to the central-lobular zone in the hepatic acinus. However, in current practice, the demonstration of p. Cys282Tyr homozygosity along with elevated serum ferritin and TSAT is considered sufficient to make the diagnosis of HC. Liver biopsy remains useful for prognostic purposes in HC patients with serum ferritin levels repeatedly > 1000 µg/L, allowing the early identification of advanced fibrosis or even subclinical cirrhosis. These conditions require close surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma even after iron depletion. Nowadays, liver biopsy is seldom performed due to its invasiveness, costs, and the increasing availability of noninvasive tools. Indeed, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have largely replaced it for the determination of liver iron concentration (LIC). This is obtained indirectly by using various MRI protocols, for which there is still no consensus on the best one. The choice of the protocol mainly depends on local expertise, as well as on the available equipment and software. Moreover, hepatic transient elastography (FibroScan) is a reliable noninvasive method for detecting liver fibrosis in HC patients, limiting the need for liver biopsy to those with indeterminate results.

Currently, HC is typically suspected in subjects with no or minimal symptoms, increased serum ferritin levels without alternative explanation, high TSAT, and evidence of increased liver iron stores by MRI. Making the diagnosis at this preclinical early stagehas the undoubted advantage of preventing organ damage by a relatively simple and cost-effective treatment (phlebotomy), as well as of allowing normal life expectancy.

The HFE genetic test, available in most laboratories, identifies the most common inherited defect in Whites predisposing to HFE -related HC, ie, p. Cys282Tyr homozygosity. Therefore, in Whites, an HFE genetic test is indicated when high TSAT is confirmed irrespective of parenchymal iron overload (IO) demonstration. p. Cys282Tyr homozygosity has a variable and difficult to predict clinical penetrance, with several inherited and acquired modifiers potentially contributing to the final phenotype. For this reason, HFE -related HC should not be viewed as a simple monogenic disorder but rather as the complex result of the interplay of environmental, lifestyle, and still unidentified genetic cofactors.

Liver Biopsy

Since the advent of HFE mutation analysis, liver biopsy has become less important as a clinical tool in the diagnosis of HH. Liver biopsy should be considered only for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, which does have prognostic value. Identification of cirrhosis may lead to adjustments in clinical management, such as screening for HCC and esophageal varices (and other features of portal hypertension). The risks of liver biopsy have been reviewed, with mild bleeding after biopsy reported to be in the range of 1%-6%, and mortality associated with a complication of less than 1:10,000.

Serum ferritin levels can help identify patients who may benefit most from having a liver biopsy. Several studies have demonstrated that C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin > 1000 μg/L are at an increased risk of cirrhosis, with a prevalence of 20%-45%. In contrast, fewer than 2% of C282Y homozygotes with a ferritin level < l000 μg/L at the time of diagnosis have cirrhosis or bridging fibrosis in the absence of another risk factor such as excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, or fatty liver disease.–A recent study of more than 670 asymptomatic C282Y homozygotes described the prevalence of advanced hepatic fibrosis. In this study, a liver biopsy was performed in 350 subjects because of elevated serum ferritin levels (using a cutoff of 500 μg/L) or abnormal serum liver enzyme results, the presence of hepatomegaly, or a combination of these. The majority of these biopsies were performed for diagnosis of HH prior to the availability of HFE mutation analysis. Cirrhosis was present in 5.6% of all males and 1.9% of all females. All subjects with cirrhosis had a hepatic iron concentration (HIC) > 200 μmol/g dry weight (approximately seven times the upper limit of normal). A serum ferritin level > 1000 μg/L had 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity for identification of cirrhosis. No subject with a serum ferritin level < 1000 μg/L had cirrhosis. These observations must be tempered when patients with HH also consume large amounts of alcohol. An Australian study showed that > 60% of patients with HH who consumed > 60 g alcohol/day had cirrhosis, compared to < 7% of those who consumed less alcohol.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relationship to other clinical parameters including the patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine, and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Assessment of silent liver fibrosis in hemochromatosis C282Y homozygotes with normal transaminase levels [^0847b7ee]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Population screening studies for hemochromatosis have demonstrated an increase in liver disease in C282Y homozygotes, but many participants have no evidence of liver dysfunction. Previous studies have suggested that liver fibrosis in hemochromatosis might be silent. The objective of this study was to assess the degree of liver injury in referred C282Y homozygotes who underwent elective liver biopsy and had serum AST and ALT levels < 40 IU/L.

Methods

All C282Y homozygotes who underwent liver biopsy with normal AST and ALT levels were included in this study.

Results

There were 35 men and 16 women in the study with a mean age of 51 years (range, 16–89). The mean serum ferritin level was 637 microg/L (range, 18–2062), and mean liver iron concentration was 131 micromol/g (range, 11–386). There were 42 patients with no fibrosis, 6 patients with fibrosis, and 3 patients with cirrhosis.

Conclusions

Silent liver fibrosis with normal transaminase levels is seen in 18% of referred C282Y homozygotes. Studies that have reported on biochemical liver dysfunction in hemochromatosis might have underestimated the prevalence of liver injury from iron overload.

Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of HH

Elevated liver enzymes and/or iron parameters indicative of iron overload (serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels) usually precede a symptomatic manifestation of hemochromatosis. Individuals with elevated body iron levels despite fully functional erythropoiesis are thus commonly diagnosed with hemochromatosis, regardless of whether or not they show disease symptoms. Genetic and biochemical screening of the general population for HFE mutations has been discussed but is currently not recommended because of its high costs and the low penetrance of the disease.

Depending on the degree of iron accumulation, cytotoxic hydroxyl and lipid radicals will be produced causing various organ pathologies, including those of the liver, heart, and pancreas, and ultimately lead to organ failure in affected individuals who remain untreated. The symptoms of hemochromatosis range from chronic fatigue, hyperpigmentation, joint and bone symptoms to diabetes, and liver diseases, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma(Table 1 and Figure 2). The correlation between increased ferritin levels and transferrin saturation with organ damage is poor, highlighting the need for better markers for iron-induced organ damage. Despite this, symptoms develop especially in men with homozygous p. Cys282Tyr mutations and serum ferritin concentrations greater than 1000 μg/L. Liver biopsies may thus be performed to test for liver damage in HH when serum ferritin levels exceed 1000 μg/L, while diverse arthropathies may also be observed in C282Y mutation carriers without severe iron overload. Patients diagnosed with clinical HH face a higher risk of developing liver cancer (when cirrhosis is present at diagnosis) compared to controls. Although highly debated, several studies have suggested a direct association of HFE mutations with the progression of various cancers including colon, breast, prostate, and epithelial ovarian cancer. – Patients with iron overload are also more susceptible to some infections, such as those caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio vulnificus, or HIV. Consistently, studies in mice with iron overload resulting from a hepcidin deficiency showed decreased survival of animals infected by Vibrio vulnificus or the malaria-causing Plasmodium berghei. In addition, Hfe-deficiency in mice prevents a proper response to infection in that recruitment of pulmonary neutrophils upon an inflammatory stimulus is reduced.

### A Chinese patient with non-HFE-linked iron overload [^efb04572]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The gene for hemochromatosis (HFE) was recently identified and contains two missense mutations: C282Y and H63D. The C282Y mutation is found homozygous in approximately 85% to 90% of patients of Northern European ancestry with hereditary hemochromatosis. There are no previous reports with results of genetic testing in Chinese patients with regard to iron overload. In this case report, we describe a Chinese woman with marked hepatic iron overload that was nonfamilial, with unusual biopsy findings, in whom neither the C282Y nor the H63D mutations in HFE were found.

Diagnosis

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, which reflects an increase in hepatic iron content. HH can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers (TS, ferritin) are widely available, and the majority of patients with HH are now identified while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. There are certain high-risk groups that should be targeted for evaluation, such as those with a family history of HH, those with suspected organ involvement, and those with chance detection of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of the possibility of iron overload. It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function have iron studies done at some point in their evaluation. The algorithm outlined in Fig. 3 can provide some further direction regarding testing and is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

Fig. 3
An algorithm can provide some further direction regarding testing and treatment for HH. The algorithm is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

The initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin (Table 7). TS is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to total iron-binding capacity. In some laboratories, the total iron-binding capacity is calculated from the sum of the serum iron and the unsaturated iron-binding capacity, whereas in others, it is calculated indirectly from the transferrin concentration in the serum. A recent study, using fasting samples, has shown no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes. Accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Over the years, different studies have used a variety of cutoff values for TS to identify patients eligible for further testing. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values. Thus, using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, and these cases will require further evaluation.

Other genetic iron overload disorders unrelated to HH

It is important to note that other genetic causes of severe iron overload exist, but these should be distinguished from HH because of their distinct clinical and pathological presentation. These include iron-loading anemias due to ineffective erythropoiesis (thalassemia syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, sideroblastic anemias, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia) or due to hemolysis, defects in iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors (hypotransferrinemia, defect in DMT1, aceruloplasminemia (reviewed in Fleming and Ponkaand Donker et al) or repeated blood transfusions. All these disorders demand a distinct clinical and molecular diagnosis workup that is out of the scope of the present document.

Clinical presentation and reasons for genetic testing referral

Early symptoms of HH are non-specific and may include weakness, lethargy, weight loss and arthralgia. Other suggestive, but also not specific, signs of more advanced disease include skin pigmentation, liver cirrhosis, chondrocalcinosis, arthritis, diabetes, hypogonadism, hepatocarcinoma or cardiomyopathy. If any of these conditions is related to HH, they will be necessarily associated with biochemical evidence of iron overload, namely an increased TS and elevated serum ferritin. Biochemical disease expression is usually present in presymptomatic disease stages, where elevated TS is the first indicator of iron overload. Therefore, patients with consistently increased TS and serum ferritin (SF) in the absence of hematological diseases are suspected to have HH and should be referred for molecular genetic testing. HFE genotyping is the first step for diagnosis, confirming or excluding the diagnosis of HFE-related HH. In patients presenting with phenotypically proven iron overload (ie, with severely increased liver iron stores demonstrated by biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging or quantitative phlebotomies) and a negative test for p.C282Y homozygosity, genetic testing for other HH-related variants is indicated if other hepatic or hematological causes have been excluded. This should be requested from referral centers offering expert advice on iron overload disorders and appropriate molecular diagnosis.

### Hemochromatosis: diagnosis and management [^5495eceb]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

HH should be distinguished from the other syndromes of iron overload. Many patients with HH have abnormal serum iron values before the development of any significant symptoms or clinical findings, and liver biopsy is less important in these patients. HFE mutation analysis has strengthened our ability to diagnose HH accurately and is useful in family studies. HFE mutations may play a contributory role in some patients with PCT, NASH, or chronic HCV. Generalized population screening for HH may someday become a reality and lead to the identification and treatment of more patients before they have tissue damage or increased morbidity. With the identification of the HFE gene, we are beginning to unravel many of the mysteries of both normal iron absorption and the disorder of iron metabolism found in patients with HH.

### Serum ferritin level predicts advanced hepatic fibrosis among U.S. patients with phenotypic hemochromatosis [^40d46ef9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

DNA-based HFE gene testing can confirm hereditary hemochromatosis in most people of Northern European descent. However, liver biopsy is important to detect cirrhosis.

Objective

To develop noninvasive criteria to predict the presence or absence of advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis in Americans with hemochromatosis.

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting

Six tertiary care referral clinics.

Patients

182 patients with phenotypically defined hemochromatosis.

Measurements

Liver histopathology and serum ferritin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with cirrhosis (defined as bridging fibrosis or unequivocal cirrhosis on biopsy).

Results

Cirrhosis was present in 40 of 182 (22%) patients in the overall group and in 35 of 147 (24%) of C282Y homozygotes. Only 1 of 93 patients with a serum ferritin level less than 1000 microg/L had cirrhosis compared with 39 of 89 patients with serum ferritin levels greater than 1000 microg/L (P < 0.001). No C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes with serum ferritin levels less than 1000 microg/L had cirrhosis. Elevated serum aminotransferase levels (P = 0.001) and serum ferritin levels greater than 1000 microg/L (P = 0.001), but not age older than 40 years (P = 0.2), were independently associated with cirrhosis. In a multivariate model, the probability of cirrhosis was 7.4% among patients with serum ferritin levels less than 1000 microg/L compared with 72% among patients with serum ferritin levels greater than 1000 microg/L after adjustment for age and elevated serum liver enzyme levels.

Conclusions

Patients with hemochromatosis and serum ferritin levels less than 1000 microg/L are unlikely to have cirrhosis. Liver biopsy to screen for cirrhosis may be unnecessary in such patients, regardless of age or serum liver enzyme levels.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on haemochromatosis [^eaaf9315]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Haemochromatosis is characterised by elevated transferrin saturation (TSAT) and progressive iron loading that mainly affects the liver. Early diagnosis and treatment by phlebotomy can prevent cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes, arthropathy and other complications. In patients homozygous for p. Cys282Tyr in HFE, provisional iron overload based on serum iron parameters (TSAT > 45% and ferritin > 200 μg/L in females and TSAT > 50% and ferritin > 300 μg/L in males and postmenopausal women) is sufficient to diagnose haemochromatosis. In patients with high TSAT and elevated ferritin but other HFE genotypes, diagnosis requires the presence of hepatic iron overload on MRI or liver biopsy. The stage of liver fibrosis and other end-organ damage should be carefully assessed at diagnosis because they determine disease management. Patients with advanced fibrosis should be included in a screening programme for hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment targets for phlebotomy are ferritin < 50 μg/L during the induction phase and < 100 μg/L during the maintenance phase.

### Protective altruistic phlebotomy: hereditary haemochromatosis presenting as hepatocellular carcinoma in a non-cirrhotic 83-year-old man [^7d3dfb48]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Hereditary haemochromatosis is a multisystem disorder of iron metabolism. Hepatic manifestations include hepatomegaly, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is almost always preceded by cirrhosis. We present a case of an 83-year-old man without history of liver disease or iron overload who presented with abdominal pain. Workup revealed mildly elevated transaminases, ferritin of 3996 and a solitary liver tumour. Biopsy was consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma in a background of haemosiderosis without cirrhosis. He was diagnosed with hereditary haemochromatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. He underwent a partial hepatectomy and was started on routine phlebotomy and surveillance imaging. He has improved and has not had signs of recurrence or new complications of haemochromatosis. We suggest a possible reason for his unique and late presentation.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^5fe6dbdf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — genetic testing practices and mutation prevalence: In 1996, Feder et al. reported the identification of a hemochromatosis mutation in a novel MHC class I–like gene that was present in 83% of subjects with clinically defined HH, and genotyping for HFE mutations (C282Y) is now standard of care for the evaluation of patients in whom HH is suspected on clinical grounds or based on the finding of elevated iron studies. The H63D mutation is more common than C282Y and is found in most populations worldwide, with the highest prevalence among whites of whom approximately 26% carry at least 1 copy of H63D, whereas the S65C mutation is less common with a heterozygote frequency of about 2% among whites. Neither the homozygous nor the heterozygous H63D or S65C mutation is a cause of pathologic iron overload. We recommend that individuals with the H63D or S65C mutation in the absence of C282Y mutation should be counseled that they are not at increased risk of iron overload (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). PICO question: Should testing for non-HFE genes vs not testing be used to diagnose hemochromatosis in those who are negative for the C282Y or H63D alleles?

### Who should be screened for hemochromatosis? [^49dce48d]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Hemochromatosis is the most common hereditary condition in persons of northern European descent, affecting one in 200 to 300 persons. The perceived rarity of the condition and its vague early symptoms result in many cases not being diagnosed until serious late complications occur because of iron deposition in the tissues. A review by Harrison and Adams stresses the need for a high index of suspicion and the benefits of early screening in all patients at risk, to prevent diabetes, hepatic cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, and liver cancer. Hemochromatosis should be suspected in patients with generalized weakness and arthralgias, because these are early nonspecific symptoms of the condition. It definitely should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with hepatomegaly, increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase, impotence, infertility, increased skin pigmentation, cardiomyopathy, diabetes types 1 and 2, and cardiac arrhythmias.

The other group to be considered for screening includes relatives of patients diagnosed with hemochromatosis. More than 90 percent of patients clinically diagnosed with hemochromatosis have a mutation on chromosome 6, specifically, a tyrosine substitution for cysteine at amino acid 282. Most of these C282Y cases are homozygous. The remaining cases are mainly caused by a second mutation at amino acid 63. Transmission is autosomal recessive, resulting in many heterozygous carriers in the population. Genetic testing should be offered to family members of patients who are discovered to be C282Y homozygotes, even if the index homozygote patient does not have biochemical or clinical evidence of iron overload. Experts estimate that 50 to 90 percent of homozygous persons eventually have at least biochemical indications of iron overload. Women develop signs less commonly and at a later age than men, possibly because of blood loss during reproductive years.

The recommended screening test is determination of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Hemochromatosis should be suspected if ferritin levels are 300 ng per mL or higher in men and 200 ng per mL or higher in women, but ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and can be elevated in several acute conditions. Transferrin saturation is reported to be 94 percent sensitive in diagnosing C282Y hemochromatosis and is most accurate when measured while the patient is fasting. Iron overload is possible at levels of greater than 50 percent in men and greater than 45 percent in women. Genetic testing is recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in all people with abnormal transferrin saturation or ferritin levels and all first-degree relatives of C282Y homozygotes. Siblings of homozygous persons have a one in four chance of being homozygous themselves, and children of homozygous persons have a chance of about one in 20.

Since genetic testing became available, liver biopsy is less important for diagnosis and now is used mainly to establish the presence or absence of cirrhosis. Liver biopsy is considered in C282Y homozygous persons who have liver dysfunction. as shown by AST levels greater than 40 U per L or ferritin levels greater than 1, 000 ng per mL. Cirrhosis is a serious prognostic finding because phlebotomy does not reverse the cirrhotic process. These patients have a 200-fold increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. If detected before organ damage has occurred, regular phlebotomy can maintain ferritin levels in the normal range with improvement in symptoms, lowered morbidity, and normal longevity. Patients also are advised to limit their intake of iron-containing foods and vitamin C.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^fccf8d96]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatic iron index (HII) was first introduced in 1986 and was used frequently to support a diagnosis of HH when the HII was > 1.9, prior to the advent of HFE mutation analysis.HII, which measures the rate of hepatic iron accretion, is calculated by dividing the HIC (in μmol/g) by the patient's age in years and was based on the concept that homozygotes would continue to absorb excess dietary iron throughout their lifetime, whereas those who were heterozygotes or those with iron overload due to associated alcohol use would not. Several studies showed that most homozygotes with iron overload had an HII > l.9 μmol/g/year, whereas patients with other chronic diseases had an HII < 1.9. The availability of genetic testing has now shown that phenotypic expression of homozygosity can occur at a much lower HIC and a much lower HII, and therefore the HII is no longer routinely used. Recent studies show good correlation between HIC determined on liver biopsy samples with HIC estimated by proton transverse relaxation time determined by magnetic resonance imaging.

Recommendations:

6. Liver biopsy is recommended to stage the degree of liver disease in C282Y homozygotes or compound heterozygotes if liver enzymes (ALT, AST) are elevated or if ferritin is > 1000 μg/L. (1B)

Surveillance for Hepatocellular Cancer

In patients with HH who present with cirrhosis, the recent AASLD guidelines for HCC surveillance should be followed. These recommendations should be extended to patients with HH who have cirrhosis, whether they have had phlebotomy to restore normal iron levels. The relative risk for HCC is approximately 20, with an annual incidence of 3%-4%. Patients with HH with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis should be screened regularly for HCC as per AASLD guidelines.

### Haemochromatosis [^be2f7fed]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Since the discovery of the haemochromatosis gene (HFE; chromosome 6p21.3) associated with haemochromatosis in 1996, many studies about diverse aspects of this common genetic disorder have been done. Some patients present with cirrhosis and show high mortality, whereas many asymptomatic homozygotes for the C282Y mutation in the haemochromatosis gene identified in population screening studies, who have been followed up for many years, do not develop iron overload. Studies described the usefulness of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin tests, and the acceptability of genetic testing for haemochromatosis. Phlebotomy therapy improves hepatic fibrosis. Here, we summarise some new findings in haemochromatosis, a disorder first described in 1865.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — iron studies for diagnostic evaluation: Transferrin saturation (TS) is the preferred initial screening test, and fasting is not required to accurately determine TS. A TS of greater than 45% identifies 97.9%–100% of C282Y homozygotes, although a small proportion of patients with HH such as young individuals at an earlier stage may have TS of < 45%. Serum ferritin (SF) is an excellent predictor of advanced fibrosis; in C282Y homozygotes, a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL, in combination with elevated aminotransferase levels and/or low platelet count, predicts cirrhosis in more than 80% of patients. A normal SF, defined as less than 200 ng/mL in premenopausal women or 300 ng/mL in men and postmenopausal women, in combination with a TS of < 45%, has a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload. A unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) below 26 μmol/L has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 50% for detecting C282Y homozygosity.

### Role of liver biopsy in the diagnosis of hepatic iron overload in the era of genetic testing [^f024d2c3]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We studied hepatic iron overload (HIOL) patterns in 32 patients who underwent liver biopsies and testing for HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D). Iron-stained biopsy specimens were examined for patterns of iron deposits: hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) pattern or non-HH pattern. Visual iron grade based on amount of cellular and lobular iron was evaluated. We found the HH pattern in 17 biopsy specimens (53%) and the non-HH pattern in 6 specimens (19%). HH with superimposed non-HH was noted in 9 cases (28%). In 25 patients with HFE mutations, HH alone and combined with non-HH patterns was noted in 22 specimens (88%). Visual iron grade correlated approximately with the hepatic iron index. Heavy HIOL was noted in C282Y homozygotes and 1 patient with cirrhosis without either HFE mutation. Mild steatohepatitis was found in 21 specimens (66%); it was associated with the non-HH pattern in 80% (12/15) and the HH pattern in 62% (16/26) of cases. Liver biopsy can identify pattern and grade of HIOL and associated pathology for diagnosis and management of patients with abnormal iron studies and elevated liver function test results. Genetic tests for HFE mutations and liver biopsies are complementary in the workup of these patients.

Hemochromatosis — serum ferritin interpretation and predictive thresholds include the following: in a study of individuals < 35 years of age, serum ferritin in the normal range in combination with a TS < 45% had a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload; in a California primary care population, a serum ferritin > 250 μg/L in men and > 200 μg/L in women was positive in 77% and 56% of C282Y homozygotes; and in the HEIRS screening study of 99,711 North American participants, serum ferritin levels were elevated (> 300 μg/L in men, > 200 μg/L in women) in 57% of female and 88% of male C282Y homozygotes. Ferritin can be elevated in the absence of increased iron stores, and in the general population, iron overload is not the most common cause of an elevated ferritin level; in most circumstances, serum ferritin provides additional confirmation of the significance of an elevated TS in C282Y homozygotes, and an elevated ferritin with a normal TS may occur particularly in non–HFE-related iron overload or in a C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote.

Causes of Iron Overload

The current classification of iron overload syndromes divides patients into three groups (Table 2): (1) those who have inherited causes of iron overload, (2) those who have various causes of secondary iron overload, and (3) a small miscellaneous group. Approximately 85%-90% of patients who have inherited forms of iron overload are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE, with a small minority who are compound heterozygotes, meaning that one allele has the C282Y mutation and one allele has the H63D or the S65C mutation. The remaining 10%-15% of patients who have inherited forms of iron overload most likely have mutations in one of the other aforementioned genes involved in iron homeostasis. Causes of secondary iron overload are divided between those causes related to iron loading anemias, those related to chronic liver disease, transfusional iron overload, and miscellaneous causes. Oral iron ingestion does not lead to iron overload except in genetically predisposed individuals or those who have ineffective erythropoiesis.

Patient data collection and investigations

All patients referred to the Unit of Liver Diseases at the Karolinska University Hospital for liver biopsy due to chronic liver disease and/or hemochromatosis, and with an elevated serum ferritin, between January 2008 and April 2013, were asked to participate in the study. Hyperferritinemia was defined as a serum ferritin > 350 μg/L. In addition, patients with chronic liver disease and normal iron parameters undergoing liver biopsy were enrolled for comparison. All patients were over 18 years of age and had given written informed consent. One patient was excluded due to iron deficiency. No patients included had been subject to treatment with iron reduction therapy before entering the study.

A total of 84 patients were enrolled (26 females, 58 males), of which 62 had elevated ferritin levels and 23 a normal serum ferritin concentration. Thirty-eight of the 84 patients had NAFLD, 17 had untreated hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), and 29 had various other causes of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as autoimmune liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, cryptogenic cirrhosis, porphyria cutanea tarda, methotrexate-induced liver fibrosis, or the hemochromatosis phenotype but without the C282Y or H63D mutations. All these other etiologies (except NAFLD and HFE -associated HH) were thus grouped together as CLD. NAFLD was defined as either Grade 1 or more steatosis in the liver biopsy according to Kleiner et al. or a bright liver with increased echogenicity at abdominal ultrasound investigation. Among the 17 patients with HH, 12 were HFE C282Y homozygotes and five were C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes. In the group of 29 patients with chronic liver disease, eight had a normal iron content in the liver, and 21 had iron overload, and were classified as "chronic liver disease with iron overload" (CLD-IO). One of these had received oral iron substitution for several years; however, none had been treated with parenteral iron substitution or blood transfusions. Amongst the 21 patients classified as CLD-IO, ten had a clinical phenotype of hemochromatosis (elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, and hepatic iron overload) but without homozygosity for the HFE C282Y mutation or compound heterozygosity for the C282Y and H63D mutations, and without alcohol overconsumption. The other 19 CLD patients had alcohol overconsumption (> 30 g/day) (n = 9), primary biliary cholangitis (n = 2), hepatitis C (n = 1), alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (n = 1), porphyria cutanea tarda (n = 1), cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 2), or methotrexate-treated psoriasis (n = 3). None of the patients with HH, NAFLD or CLD with the clinical phenotype of hemochromatosis had reported a previous or current alcohol consumption exceeding 20 g/day. Two CLD-IO patients (with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and alcohol overconsumption, respectively) were heterozygous for the H63D mutation, and one (with alcohol overconsumption) was heterozygous for the C282Y mutation.

### Hereditary hemochromatosis: rapid evidence review [^c9a9fdc6]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts iron homeostasis, resulting in systemic iron overload. It is the most common inherited disorder among people of northern European ancestry. Despite the high prevalence of the gene mutation, there is a low and variable clinical penetrance. The deposition of excess iron into parenchymal cells leads to cellular dysfunction and the clinical manifestations of the disease. The liver, pancreas, joints, heart, skin, and pituitary gland are the most commonly involved organs. Hereditary hemochromatosis is usually diagnosed in the 40s or 50s. Women are often diagnosed later than men, likely because of menstrual blood loss. There is no typical presentation or pathognomonic signs and symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis. Because of increased awareness and earlier diagnosis, the end-organ damage secondary to iron overload is not often seen in clinical practice. A common initial presentation is an asymptomatic patient with mildly elevated liver enzymes who is subsequently found to have elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Ferritin levels greater than 300 ng per mL for men and 200 ng per mL for women and transferrin saturations greater than 45% are highly suggestive of hereditary hemochromatosis. Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment and can help improve heart function, reduce abnormal skin pigmentation, and lessen the risk of liver complications. Liver transplantation may be considered in select patients. Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal and breast cancers. Genetic testing for the hereditary hemochromatosis genes should be offered after 18 years of age to first-degree relatives of patients with the condition.

Clinical Features

Hemochromatosis is increasingly being recognized by clinicians. Nonetheless, it is still underdiagnosed, because it is often considered a rare disorder that is manifested by the clinical findings seen in fully established disease consisting of cirrhosis, diabetes, and skin pigmentation (so-called "bronze diabetes"). Genetic susceptibility (C282Y homozygosity) for hemochromatosis is seen in approximately one in 250 Caucasians; however, fully expressed disease with end-organ manifestations is seen in fewer than 10% of these individuals. The reasons for the lack of phenotypic expression are unknown. It may involve interactions with gene products of other proteins involved in iron homeostasis (with or without mutation). This can explain the discrepancy between the high incidence of C282Y homozygosity in Caucasians (one in 250) versus how infrequently the full clinical manifestations of the disease are seen (approximately one in 2500). The heterozygote genotype (C282Y/wild type) is found in approximately one in 10 individuals and may be associated with elevated serum iron markers, but without associated tissue iron overload or damage.

Clinical manifestations in patients reported in series from the 1950s to the 1980s showed that most reported patients had classic symptoms and findings of advanced hemochromatosis (Table 3).–By the 1990s, HH was increasingly being identified in patients who had abnormal iron studies on routine chemistry panels or by patients having been identified by family screening. When patients with HH were identified in this way, approximately 75% of them did not have symptoms and did not exhibit any of the end-stage manifestations of the disease. Currently, in large population screening studies, only approximately 70% of C282Y homozygotes are found to have an elevated ferritin level indicative of increased iron stores (Table 4), and only a small percentage of these patients have clinical consequences of iron storage disease. More men than women have increased ferritin levels. Nonetheless, it is still important for clinicians to be aware of the symptoms that patients may exhibit and the physical findings with which they can present.

Family Screening

Once a patient with HH has been identified (proband), family screening should be recommended for all first-degree relatives. For ease of testing, both genotype (HFE mutation analysis) and phenotype (ferritin and TS) should be performed simultaneously at a single visit. For children of an identified proband, HFE testing of the other parent is generally recommended, because if results are normal, the child is an obligate heterozygote and need not undergo further testing because there is no increased risk of iron loading. If C282Y homozygosity or compound heterozygosity is found in adult relatives of a proband, and if serum ferritin levels are increased, then therapeutic phlebotomy can be initiated. If ferritin level is normal in these patients, then yearly follow-up with iron studies is indicated. When identified, C282Y heterozygotes and H63D heterozygotes can be reassured that they are not at risk for developing progressive or symptomatic iron overload. Occasional H63D homozygotes can develop mild iron overload. However, it should be recognized that any of these genotypes can be a cofactor for the development of liver disease when they occur in conjunction with other liver diseases such as PCT, hepatitis C infection, ALD, or NAFLD. Relatives who are identified as H63D heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes can be reassured that they are generally not at risk of progressive iron overload, although they may have minor abnormalities in serum iron measurements such as TS or ferritin.

Family studies have concluded that many homozygous relatives of probands demonstrate biochemical and clinical expression of disease. Furthermore, a recent population study of approximately 30,000 Caucasian subjects aged 40–69 years identified 203 C282Y homozygotes (108 females, 95 males). These subjects were evaluated sequentially over a 12-year period, prior to available knowledge of their genotype. Documented iron overload-related disease was present in 28% of males and 1% of females, especially when serum ferritin levels were > 1000 μg/L.

Recommendations:

5. We recommend screening (iron studies and HFE mutation analysis) of first-degree relatives of patients with HFE- related HH to detect early disease and prevent complications. (1A)

### Natural history of the C282Y homozygote for the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) with a normal serum ferritin level [^fce9bb16]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The discovery of a genetic test for hereditary hemochromatosis has identified many individuals who are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene with a normal transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level. The long-term prognosis, rate of iron accumulation, and surveillance guidelines for these individuals are unknown.

Methods

To determine the degree of iron accumulation over time, an updated serum ferritin level was obtained in patients initially identified as homozygous for the C282Y mutation with a normal serum ferritin level.

Results

Twenty-two asymptomatic untreated C282Y homozygotes with a normal serum ferritin level were identified, 10 through population screening, 9 through pedigree analysis, and 3 through a general medical work-up. There were 18 women (4 postmenopausal) and 4 men with a median age of 46 years, range 28–76 years. The median follow-up interval was 4 years, range 2–23 years. The serum ferritin levels of 20 of 22 patients remained below the upper limit of normal during the follow-up period. A decline in serum ferritin level was observed in 13 of 22 patients. Three patients had an increase in serum ferritin level of greater than 50%, with only 1 male patient exceeding the upper limit of normal by having a serum ferritin level increase from 295 to 344 microg/L during a 3-year period.

Conclusions

In C282Y homozygotes with a normal ferritin level at the time of diagnosis, 20 of 22 patients failed to show any significant increase in serum ferritin level during a median follow-up of 4 years. This has clinical and economic implications for follow-up and surveillance of this selected population.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in hemochromatosis probands with iron overload and HFE p.C282Y / p.C282Y [^d7778843]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

General characteristics of probands

There were 31 men (47.0%) and 35 women (53.0%) of mean age 49 ± 14 y. NAFLD was diagnosed in 16 probands (24.2%; 95% CI [14.9, 36.6]). All probands underwent one or more imaging procedures that detect NAFLD. Thirty-five probands (53.0%) underwent liver biopsy. Of 16 probands with NAFLD, 11 (68.8%) underwent liver biopsy. Of 50 probands without NAFLD, 24 (48.0%) underwent liver biopsy. These percentages did not differ significantly (p = 0.1653). Twenty-one probands (31.8%) underwent liver ultrasonography. Percentages of probands with and without NAFLD evaluated with liver ultrasonography did not differ significantly (25.0% vs. 34.0%, respectively; p = 0.5562). Eighteen probands (27.3%) underwent abdominal CT scanning. Percentages of probands with and without NAFLD evaluated with abdominal CT scanning did not differ significantly (18.8% vs. 30.0%, respectively; p = 0.5245). Eleven probands (16.7%) underwent liver evaluations with two of these modalities. Percentages of probands with and without NAFLD evaluated with two modalities did not differ significantly (25.0% vs. 14.0%, respectively; p = 0.4402). Two probands underwent fibroelastography as part of experimental or pre-marketing protocols (n = 2; 3.0%). Cirrhosis was not diagnosed in any proband based on clinical, liver biopsy, or imaging abnormalities.

### Clinical expression of haemochromatosis in Irish C282Y homozygotes identified through family screening [^ed5c3225]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In Ireland, the homozygote frequency of the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is 1/83. The biochemical expression of this mutation is high in haemochromatosis (HH) individuals identified through family screening, but the clinical expression of the mutation in Irish HH subjects to date has not been investigated fully.

Objectives

To determine the clinical, biochemical and histological penetrance of the C282Y mutation in Irish C282Y homozygotes identified through family screening.

Method

Two hundred and nine C282Y homozygous individuals comprising of 172 first-degree relatives, 31 second-degree relatives and four unrelated individuals were identified following HFE mutation analysis of 167 families. The following variables were analysed: age at identification, gender, fasting transferrin saturation, fasting serum ferritin, liver enzymes, clinical symptomatology, liver histopathology and histochemical iron staining.

Results

An elevated transferrin saturation in combination with an elevated ferritin was present in 43.4% of males and 23.3% of females. Abnormal liver enzymes were found in 32.3% of males. Diabetes, a haemochromatosis-specific association, was noted in 2.8% of males. Of those individuals requiring liver histopathology evaluation, 38% had moderate-to-severe iron staining, and 42% had fibrosis; 2.8% of the biopsied cohort had cirrhosis. Thus, HH cirrhotics were identified in less than 1% of the screened population.

Conclusion

Although the homozygote frequency in Ireland is very high, the prevalence of advanced liver disease was less than 1% of the family members screened. Nevertheless, 42% of biopsied patients had histological evidence of iron overload-related architectural change and 2.8% had cirrhosis. This cohort of young people had previously unrecognized biochemical iron overload and histopathological change. This emphasizes the importance and value of both genetic and biochemical screening in first-degree relatives of identified homozygotes.

Fig. 1
Schematic representation of the protein product of HFE. Most of the protein is extracellular. There is a short cytoplasmic tail and three extracellular alpha loops. The three principal mutations are identified.

With the advent of genetic testing in the late 1990s, HFE -related HH is now frequently identified in asymptomatic probands and in presymptomatic relatives of patients who are known to have the disease. Accordingly, a genetic diagnosis can be applied to individuals who have not yet developed any phenotypic expression. Therefore, these individuals have a "genetic susceptibility" to developing iron overload but may never do so, for reasons that are still to be determined.–This observation has changed the way we think about hemochromatosis. Twenty years ago, it was considered that all individuals who were genetically susceptible would ultimately have evidence of phenotypic expression. Now, it is clear that phenotypic expression only occurs in approximately 70% of C282Y homozygotes, and fewer than 10% of C282Y homozygotes will develop severe iron overload accompanied by organ damage and clinical manifestations of hemochromatosis. This acknowledgment has led to a recognition of the different stages and progression of hemochromatosis identified at a consensus conference of the European Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in 2000. These stages are defined as follows:
Stage 1 refers to those patients with the genetic disorder with no increase in iron stores who have "genetic susceptibility".
Stage 2 refers to those patients with the genetic disorder who have phenotypic evidence of iron overload but who are without tissue or organ damage.
Stage 3 refers to those individuals who have the genetic disorder with iron overload and have iron deposition to the degree that tissue and organ damage occurs.

This organizational schema is important to allow clinicians to categorize patients who have positive genetic test results.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^2813fdec]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Wilson disease evaluation — patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT should undergo initial serum ceruloplasmin testing; "Screening should be considered in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels, and consists of serum ceruloplasmin testing (56)". If ceruloplasmin is low, "confirmatory testing should be pursued including 24-h urine copper and/or serum copper levels, slit-lamp eye examination to identify pathognomonic Kayser-Fleischer rings, and possible liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, stage liver fibrosis, and quantify hepatic copper overload to guide management". Molecular testing can be used when needed, as "Molecular genetic analyses for the ATP7B mutation can be pursued in cases of diagnostic uncertainty", and genetic heterogeneity is noted: "Over 32 different mutations of the Wilsons gene have now been identified and unlike hemochromatosis, there is no predominant mutation".

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^9f945fab]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Excess alcohol greatly increases the prevalence of cirrhosis in hereditary hemochromatosis [^4fa0afdd]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The progression of fibrosis to cirrhosis is the most significant prognostic factor in hereditary hemochromatosis. We aimed to determine the range of hepatic iron concentration associated with cirrhosis in the absence of alcohol and other pro-fibrogenic cofactors and to quantify the contribution of excess alcohol consumption to the development of cirrhosis.

Methods

Liver biopsy data were evaluated on 224 C282Y homozygous hemochromatosis subjects. To determine the effect of alcohol alone on the development of fibrosis, subjects with viral hepatitis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis were excluded. Subjects were divided into those who consumed less than 60 g alcohol per day and those who consumed 60 g per day or more.

Results

Seven percent of subjects who consumed less than 60 g per day had severe fibrosis/cirrhosis compared with 61% of excess alcohol consumers.

Conclusions

Hemochromatosis subjects who drink more than 60 g alcohol per day are approximately 9 times more likely to develop cirrhosis than those who drink less than this amount, and the range of hepatic iron concentration associated with cirrhosis in the absence of cofactors was 233–675 micromol/g dry weight.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in hemochromatosis probands with iron overload and HFE p.C282Y / p.C282Y [^5d93a2a6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Laboratory

Blood specimens were collected during mornings without regard to fasting. TS and SF were measured using standard methods (Laboratory Corporation of America, Burlington, NC, USA). We defined these TS and SF phenotypes to be elevated: TS > 50% (men) and TS > 45% (women); and SF > 300 µg/L (men) and SF > 200 µg/L (women).

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured using standard methods (Laboratory Corporation of America, Burlington, NC, USA). We defined upper limits of normal for ALT and AST as > 40 IU/L, respectively. We created a single dichotomous variable representing either elevated ALT or elevated AST (elevated ALT/AST).

HFE allele analyses were performed as previously described. We demonstrated HFE p.C282Y homozygosity in 1996 or later in all probands regardless of dates of diagnoses. We defined HLA-A*03 as the marker of the hemochromatosis ancestral haplotype. Positivity for A*03 was defined as A*03 homozygosity or heterozygosity.

Liver biopsy

We recommended that probands undergo percutaneous liver biopsy (or not) in accordance with hemochromatosis diagnosis and management guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

We diagnosed NAFLD according to the Practice Guideline of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, American College of Gastroenterology, and the American Gastroenterological Association. Diagnostic criterion was steatosis detected either by interpretation of liver biopsy specimens, increased hepatic echogenicity, or attenuation difference between liver and spleen on unenhanced CT scanning images, in the absence of self-report of alcohol consumption > 14 g/d drink-equivalent, cirrhosis or other non-NAFLD liver disorder, use of steatogenic medication, or diagnosis of a heritable disorder associated with increased NAFLD risk.

### Testing for haemochromatosis in a liver clinic population: relationship between ethnic origin, HFE gene mutations, liver histology and serum iron markers [^97ee57f5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the most appropriate testing strategy for genetic haemochromatosis in a liver clinic population by determining the ethnic distribution of the HFE mutations and the relationship between serum iron markers, hepatic siderosis and HFE genotype.

Design and Setting

Observational study of 427 patients being investigated for abnormal liver function tests between 1997 and 2000 attending a liver clinic at a teaching district general hospital in south London, UK.

Methods

All patients were tested for H63D and C282Y gene mutations, and the ethnic origin was determined. Data were available for most patients for non-fasting serum iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation on presentation and fibrosis and siderosis scores from liver biopsy.

Results

The C282Y mutation was not detected in any patients of Asian or Afro-Caribbean origin but was found almost exclusively in northern Europeans, especially those classified as Celtic, one in seven of whom were heterozygous for this mutation. Three per cent of all the patients tested were C282Y homozygotes. The H63D mutation was distributed more widely. An elevated serum transferrin saturation was both a more sensitive and a more specific test for genetic haemochromatosis than either serum ferritin or iron. Significantly raised mean siderosis scores were found on liver biopsy in C282Y homozygote and C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote groups but not in wild-type, simple heterozygote, or H63D homozygote groups. Forty-five per cent of the C282Y homozygotes detected already had cirrhosis.

Conclusions

In a multiracial liver clinic population, previously undiagnosed C282Y homozygosity was found to be common (3% in our study) but restricted to those of northern European heritage, particularly those with Celtic ancestry. A serum transferrin saturation proved a better initial test to select patients for genotyping than serum iron or ferritin. Laboratory costs can be minimized with no loss of diagnostic sensitivity by selecting patients for genotyping based on northern European ethnic origin and raised serum transferrin saturation.

Table 7
Laboratory Findings in Patients with HH

Serum ferritin has less biological variability than TS, but it has a significant false positive rate because of elevations related to inflammation. Ferritin can be elevated in the absence of increased iron stores in patients with necroinflammatory liver disease (alcoholic liver disease [ALD], chronic hepatitis B and C, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]), in lymphomas, and in patients with other nonhepatic chronic inflammatory conditions. In fact, in the general population, iron overload is not the most common cause of an elevated ferritin level. Nonetheless, in the absence of other inflammatory processes, several studies of families with HH have demonstrated that the serum ferritin concentration provides a valuable correlation with the degree of body iron stores. In most circumstances, serum ferritin provides additional confirmation of the significance of an elevated TS in C282Y homozygotes. In a study of individuals < 35 years of age, serum ferritin in the normal range in combination with a TS < 45% had a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload. In a large study correlating phenotypic and genotypic markers in a primary care population in California, a serum ferritin > 250 μg/L in men and > 200 μg/L in women was positive in 77% and 56%, respectively, of C282Y homozygotes. In the HEIRS (HEmochromatosis and IRon Overload Screening) study that screened 99,711 North American participants, serum ferritin levels were elevated (> 300 μg/L in men, > 200 μg/L in women) in 57% of female and 88% of male C282Y homozygotes. It is recognized that a variety of disease conditions unrelated to iron overload may cause a nonspecific rise in serum ferritin, and in the absence of an elevated TS, this rise may be nonspecific. Conversely, iron overload may be present in a patient with an elevated ferritin and a normal TS, particularly in non– HFE -related iron overload or in a C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to diagnosis and staging [^7b4c011b]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and staging of NAFLD/NASH

Clinical features and blood tests

A diagnosis of NAFLD requires that there is evidence of hepatic steatosis on imaging or histology, and other causes of liver disease or steatosis have been excluded.NAFLD is usually asymptomatic, so diagnosis usually follows the incidental finding of abnormal liver enzymes or steatosis on imaging. If abnormal LFTs are present, this is usually mildly raised transaminases (ALT > aspartate transaminase (AST)) and/or gamma-glutamyltransferase. However, ∼80% of patients have normal-range ALT levels (males < 40 IU/L and females < 31 IU/L), and even if elevated, the ALT typically falls (and AST may rise) as fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis. ALT values do not correlate with histological findings and are unhelpful in both the diagnosis of NAFLD and determining disease severity. Clinicians overly rely on abnormal liver enzymes to identify patients with NAFLD, so patients with significant liver disease can be overlooked, potentially missing opportunities for intervention. It has been repeatedly shown that 70–80% of subjects with central obesity and 50–80% of patients with type 2 diabetes have evidence of NAFLD on imaging. Therefore, a new approach is needed to use metabolic risk factors to identify subjects with NAFLD/NASH rather than relying on liver enzyme abnormalities.

In patients with abnormal LFTs, alternative causes of liver disease (or cofactors) should be excluded, including alcohol excess, drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, haemochromatosis, coeliac disease and Wilson's disease (in patients < 45 years old). Autoantibodies are also frequently detected at a low titre in subjects with NAFLD (antinuclear antibody (ANA) ≥ 1:160 and/or antismooth muscle antibody (ASMA) ≥ 1:40) and are usually associated with normal IgG levels and do not generally indicate autoimmune hepatitis. Raised ferritin levels are common in NAFLD and usually reflect underlying inflammatory activity or insulin resistance. A transferrin saturation < 45% rules out haemochromatosis. If there is uncertainty about the diagnosis of NAFLD, then a liver biopsy should be considered.

### A tale of two sisters [^7da28153]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary haemochromatosis is the most common inherited disorder in white populations, whereas non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is becoming the most common reason for referral for investigation of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). This report describes two sisters, from similar environments, who were referred to the clinic after being found to be C282Y homozygotes and to have abnormal LFTs. One sister had developed features of haemochromatosis and the other had developed NASH. These cases illustrate the potential non-penetrance of HFE gene mutations and the need to investigate abnormal LFTs fully, even when there is a positive genetic test at the outset.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^42db41d0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis classification and HFE genotypes — ACG Clinical Guideline states there are 4 main types of HH, and type 1 HH is the most frequent inherited form of iron overload; the most common mutation is a G to A transition at nucleotide 845 of the HFE gene causing a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at amino acid 282 (C282Y), referred to as type 1a. The H63D mutation does not cause significant iron overload but may act as a cofactor for phenotypic expression primarily in combination with C282Y, with C282Y/H63D classified as HH type 1b or compound heterozygote. The prevalence of this mutation is approximately 2%–4% among patients of northern European origin, and penetrance for developing clinically significant iron overload is rare among patients with this genotype (0.5%–2%) unless cofactors such as alcohol or hepatitis C virus (HCV) are involved. Patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygotes for the H63D substitution are not at increased risk of developing clinical iron overload, though they may still present with elevation in TS and SF levels; a third HFE genotype known as type 1c is associated with the mutation S65C, and the S65C mutation may lead to increased serum iron and TS levels.
