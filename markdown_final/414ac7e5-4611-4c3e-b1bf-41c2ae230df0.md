## Question

Infusion time

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the appropriate infusion time for a given IV medication or fluid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the query refers to a specific drug or a general framework. Then, I should identify authoritative sources for dosing, preparation, and infusion instructions. Next, I will extract time specifications and rate/duration relationships. After that, I should reconcile scenarios where time is specified versus only a rate is provided. I will then consider safety constraints and special populations, integrate administration set and filter considerations, and finally synthesize a practical, verification-oriented recommendation, anchoring on examples like cidofovir, lidocaine, and parenteral nutrition while acknowledging limitations where no specific drug is named [^11541ocn] [^1127A1DP] [^116UW6eE].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Wait, let me verify the scope: the user is asking for a clinically rigorous, reference-aware method to determine infusion time when the agent is not specified, so I need to outline a universal decision pathway rather than a single-number answer. I should anchor the approach to regulatory labels, high-quality guidelines, and evidence-based safety practices to ensure generalizability across agents and settings, and I will explicitly flag when a definitive time cannot be provided without the drug name.

> Next, I should review the hierarchy of authoritative sources. I need to check the FDA label first because it carries legally binding administration instructions; if unavailable, I will consider specialty guidelines and peer-reviewed literature, recognizing that infusion time may be explicit in labels and sometimes embedded in rate or total volume guidance rather than a standalone time field [^11541ocn] [^1127A1DP].

> Now, I will extract explicit infusion time examples to anchor the reasoning. For cidofovir, the core dose is infused over 1 hour and is explicitly stated, which gives a clear benchmark for fixed-duration infusions in oncology and infectious disease settings [^11541ocn]. For lecanemab, the product is infused over approximately 1 hour with stepwise observation after infusion, illustrating standard monoclonal antibody infusion timing and post-infusion monitoring [^1133oCTn]. For lidocaine, bolus is given over minutes and continuous infusion follows at 1–4 mg/min, where duration is implicit to the rate and clinical response rather than a fixed clock time, highlighting the need to titrate to effect and monitor for toxicity [^1127A1DP]. For parenteral nutrition, continuous 24-hour infusion is common in acute care, with cycling to 10–14 hours when clinically appropriate, emphasizing individualized scheduling rather than a universal time window [^112Gu2EY].

> Hold on, I should verify the distinction between fixed-duration and rate-based infusions. When the label specifies a time, that time is prescriptive; when only a rate is given, duration equals total volume divided by rate, but I must also consider priming volumes, line dead space, and whether a flush is required to deliver the full dose, as this can meaningfully alter effective administration time and total patient exposure to fluids or drugs [^1127A1DP] [^111pMfDY] [^116UW6eE].

> Let me consider safety constraints that shape infusion time. Rapid infusion can precipitate reactions or fluid overload, whereas overly slow infusions may under-treat or risk contamination or degradation. ESMO hypersensitivity guidance supports rapid crystalloid for anaphylaxis, but this is a resuscitation context and not a model for routine drug infusion; similarly, saline suppression testing uses a fixed 4-hour infusion of 2 L saline for endocrine diagnostics, not therapeutics, so I should not generalize these to drug administration without evidence [^113kBmEk] [^116dXDd6]. I need to ensure I account for renal/cardiac risk, drug stability, and sterility constraints when deciding whether to prolong or compress an infusion window [^115eXLhn] [^116X8Uxj].

> I should double-check special populations and settings. In pediatrics, fluid kinetics and organ function necessitate weight-based rates and often more conservative durations; pediatric maintenance fluid guidance and trials underscore the risks of hyponatremia and the importance of isotonic solutions and careful monitoring, which indirectly shape how long and how fast infusions should proceed [^113qruDL] [^112cy4Vg]. In the ICU, continuous infusions and complex multi-infusion setups require pump programming, set labeling, and anti-mix-up strategies; here, the nominal "infusion time" must also include vigilance for line swaps, rate errors, and interruptions that can distort intended exposure over time [^116B9jRa] [^112Gu2EY].

> Next, I should review administration set and filter considerations that constrain time. Some agents require in-line filters with defined pore sizes and dedicated lines, and line flushing after completion ensures full dose delivery and reduces mix-up risk; delays or omissions here can inadvertently extend effective infusion time or cause underdosing, so I need to build these steps into the total administration window [^111pMfDY] [^1128aqCZ] [^116UW6eE]. I also need to remember tubing replacement intervals vary by infusate type; while not directly changing a single infusion's duration, it influences how long a set can remain in use for multi-day therapies, which impacts scheduling and infection risk, and therefore operational aspects of infusion time over a course of therapy [^116X8Uxj] [^114q9uo1].

> But wait, what if only a bolus or intermittent schedule is described without a single continuous duration. High-dose interleukin-2 uses 15-minute boluses every 8 hours over several days, whereas oxytocin protocols combine a bolus with subsequent infusions, and many antibiotics are dosed intermittently with 30–60 minute infusions; these patterns reinforce that infusion time is agent- and protocol-specific, and I should not extrapolate one agent's timing to another without corroborating data [^111pgKrr] [^116o5ny2].

> Let me synthesize a practical, verification-oriented approach. First, identify the exact drug or fluid and retrieve the FDA label or a recognized guideline. If time is explicitly stated, use it. If only rate and volume are provided, calculate duration as volume divided by rate, then adjust for priming and flushing steps and any mandatory observation period after infusion. Next, screen for patient-specific constraints such as renal or cardiac impairment, pediatric weight, and comorbidities that might necessitate slower rates or extended monitoring. Then, verify equipment requirements, filters, and whether a dedicated line is needed. Finally, plan for pump programming, handoff verification, and real-time monitoring for reactions or line issues, documenting actual start and stop times rather than assuming nominal durations [^11541ocn] [^1127A1DP] [^111pMfDY] [^112Gu2EY].

> I need to ensure I state the limitation clearly. Without the specific drug name, I cannot provide a definitive infusion time; however, the examples and framework above show that durations commonly range from minutes for boluses to 1 hour for many biologics and antivirals, to 4–24 hours for certain fluids or nutrition, with some continuous vasoactive therapies extending indefinitely with titration. If you tell me the exact agent, dose, and volume, I can confirm the labeled or guideline-endorsed infusion time and any required pre- or post-infusion steps, including hydration, probenecid, or observation windows that materially affect total chair time and safety [^11541ocn] [^1133oCTn] [^112Gu2EY] [^116dXDd6] [^111jqtmV] [^1127A1DP].

---

Infusion time is the **duration over which a medication or fluid is administered intravenously**, typically expressed in minutes or hours. It is determined by the drug's pharmacokinetics, dose, and clinical context, and must be followed precisely to ensure safety and efficacy [^116mEefF]. Examples include cidofovir infused over 1 hour [^11541ocn], lidocaine bolus over 1–2 minutes, and parenteral nutrition infused continuously over 24 hours [^112Gu2EY]. Deviations from prescribed infusion times can cause under- or overdosing, adverse reactions, or treatment failure [^111jqtmV].

---

## Factors influencing infusion time

Several factors **influence infusion time**, including:

- **Drug properties**: Pharmacokinetics, half-life, and stability determine infusion duration [^117PQMHf].

- **Patient factors**: Age, weight, renal/hepatic function, and comorbidities affect infusion rates [^113uJZAW].

- **Clinical indication**: Acute vs chronic conditions, severity, and urgency guide infusion duration [^114Pc711].

- **Safety considerations**: Risk of adverse reactions, fluid overload, or hypersensitivity may necessitate slower infusions or premedication [^112LCayV].

---

## Clinical implications of infusion time

Infusion time **significantly affects clinical outcomes**:

- **Therapeutic efficacy**: Adequate infusion time ensures optimal drug absorption and therapeutic effect [^115DCjtC].

- **Safety**: Proper infusion time minimizes adverse reactions, fluid overload, and medication errors [^115eXLhn].

- **Patient comfort**: Appropriate infusion duration reduces discomfort and improves patient compliance [^112Gu2EY].

## Examples of infusion times for common medications

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Infusion time** |
|-|-|-|
| Cidofovir | CMV retinitis | 1 hour [^11541ocn] |
| Lidocaine | Ventricular arrhythmias | Bolus: 1–2 minutes; Infusion: continuous [^1127A1DP] |
| Morphine | Analgesia | 2–8 mg/hour (continuous infusion) [^111uQ5SV] |
| Parenteral nutrition | Nutritional support | Continuous over 24 hours [^112Gu2EY] |
| Hypertonic saline | Severe hyponatremia | 150 mL over 20 minutes [^115WbE1C] |

---

## Risks associated with incorrect infusion time

Incorrect infusion time can lead to **significant risks**:

- **Underdosing or overdosing**: Rapid infusions can cause toxicity; slow infusions may reduce efficacy [^111jqtmV].

- **Adverse reactions**: Rapid infusions increase risk of hypersensitivity, fluid overload, or electrolyte disturbances [^113uJZAW].

- **Medication errors**: Misprogramming pumps or incorrect timing can cause serious harm [^116B9jRa].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of infusion time

Healthcare professionals should **monitor infusion progress**, adjust rates based on patient response, and promptly address any deviations or adverse reactions [^115KUzaA]. Regular assessment and documentation are essential to ensure safe and effective therapy [^116UW6eE].

---

Infusion time is a **critical parameter in IV therapy**, requiring careful consideration of drug properties, patient factors, and clinical context. Adherence to prescribed infusion times and vigilant monitoring are essential to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize risks [^112Gu2EY].

### Cidofovir dihydrate [^11541ocn]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Preexisting Renal Impairment

Cidofovir injection is contraindicated in patients with a serum creatinine concentration > 1.5 mg/dL, a calculated creatinine clearance ≤ 55 mL/ min, or a urine protein ≥ 100 mg/dL (equivalent to ≥ 2+ proteinuria).

Probenecid

Probenecid must be administered orally with each cidofovir injection dose. Two grams must be administered 3 hr prior to the cidofovir injection dose and one gram administered at 2 and again at 8 hr after completion of the 1 hr cidofovir infusion (for a total of 4 grams). Ingestion of food prior to each dose of probenecid may reduce drug-related nausea and vomiting. Administration of an antiemetic may reduce the potential for nausea associated with probenecid ingestion. In patients who develop allergic or hypersensitivity symptoms to probenecid, the use of an appropriate prophylactic or therapeutic antihistamine and/or acetaminophen should be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hydration

Patients must receive at least one liter of 0.9% (normal) saline solution intravenously with each infusion of cidofovir injection. The saline solution should be infused over a 1 to 2 hr period immediately before the cidofovir infusion. Patients who can tolerate the additional fluid load should receive a second liter. If administered, the second liter of saline should be initiated either at the start of the cidofovir infusion or immediately afterwards, and infused over a 1 to 3 hr period.

Regarding medical management for hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapy, more specifically with respect to management of anaphylaxis, ESMO 2017 guidelines recommend to administer a rapid infusion of 1–2 L of normal saline at a rate of 5–10 mL/kg in the first 5 minutes. Administer crystalloids or colloids in boluses of 20 mL/kg, followed by slow infusion.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116dXDd6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — saline suppression test: After sitting for 1 hour, blood should be drawn to mark t = 0. Two liters of normal saline are infused over 4 hours (500 mL/h for 4 hours) while maintaining a seated position, after which blood should be drawn; plasma aldosterone and serum potassium are measured at t = 0 and t = 4 hours. Plasma aldosterone < 162 pmol/L (5.8 ng/dL) via LC–MS/MS assay makes PA unlikely, and plasma aldosterone < 217 pmol/L (7.8 ng/dL) via immunoassay makes PA unlikely. Because hypokalemia may cause false-negative interpretations, serum potassium should be normalized before the study protocol; interpretation of results should be considered to be probabilistic as the evidence to support a singular diagnostic threshold is not firm. The protocol requires an in-person visit, space and staff to accommodate the procedures, and intravenous (IV) infusion of saline, and it should not be performed if baseline BP is uncontrolled, or in patients at high risk for pulmonary edema such as heart failure or advanced chronic kidney disease.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^1132d9kr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — Parkland formula for burn resuscitation states that for patients who require fluid resuscitation, "consider use of the Parkland formula" to calculate the volume of normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution that should be administered intravenously to ensure hemodynamic stability; the calculation is "Volume of Intravenous Fluid required in the first 24 hours (in mL) = (4 X patient weight in kg) X (Percentage of total body surface area burned)", with timing such that "The first half of the volume of fluid should be administered over the first 8 hours… with the remaining fluid administered over the following 16 hours". For pediatric patients, a "weight-based assessment tool (length-based tape or other system)" should be used, BSA estimates are different for pediatric patients compared to adults, and for children "the palmar surface of the hand (not including the fingers) is approximately equal to 1% BSA".

### Normal saline solution and lactated Ringer's solution have a similar effect on quality of recovery: a randomized controlled trial [^115wspGQ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that balanced crystalloids improve quality of recovery more than normal saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride) in stable emergency department (ED) patients. Secondary outcomes measured differences in health care use.

Methods

A single-site, participant- and evaluator-blinded, 2-arm parallel allocation (1:1), comparative effectiveness, randomized controlled trial allocated adults receiving intravenous fluids in the ED before discharge to receive 2 L of lactated Ringer's solution or normal saline solution. The primary outcome was symptom scores measured by the validated Quality of Recovery-40 instrument (scores 40 to 200) 24 hours after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included subsequent health care use and medication compliance.

Results

Participants (N = 157) were enrolled and follow-up was analyzed for 94 (follow-up rate of 60%) with intention-to-treat methodology. There was no difference in postenrollment Quality of Recovery-40 scores between normal saline solution and lactated Ringer's solution groups (mean difference 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.8 to 11.6). Although preenrollment scores were higher in the lactated Ringer's solution group (mean difference 10.5; 95% CI 1.9 to 19.0), adjusting for presurvey imbalances did not change the primary outcome (adjusted difference -3.9; 95% CI -12.9 to 5.2). There were no differences in return to ED (mean difference 7.5%; 95% CI -8.7% to 23.8%), prescriptions filled (mean difference 22.2%; 95% CI -3.3% to 47.6%), or seeking care from another provider (mean difference -2.0%; 95% CI -19.9% to 15.9%) at 7 days.

Conclusion

Normal saline solution and lactated Ringer's solution were associated with similar 24-hour recovery scores and 7-day health care use in stable ED patients. These results supplement those of recent trials by informing fluid choice for stable ED patients.

### Errors and discrepancies in the administration of intravenous infusions: a mixed methods multihospital observational study [^111rwyQn]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication administration deviations

Overall, 427 (21.3%) infusions involved at least one medication administration error (n = 211) or discrepancy (n = 257). The most frequent types of deviation concerned rates and unauthorised medications.

Rate deviations

Overall, 152 infusions (7.6%) were being administered at a different rate from that prescribed; 77 were classified as errors (rated ≥ C) and 75 as discrepancies (rated A1 or A2). A large proportion involved order changes that had not been correctly documented and infusions titrated based on the patient's clinical need or fluid allowance without such titration being prescribed. Three deviations involved prescribed boluses administered as infusions, and one was a prescribed infusion given as a bolus.

About 31% of rate errors occurred in infusions delivered via gravity (without using a pump), despite accounting for just 8% of infusions. Of the 12 most serious rate errors (rated D), eight were administered via gravity; these included red blood cells, vancomycin, paracetamol and piperacillin/tazobactam. Many medication orders specified a duration rather than rate (eg, over 8 hours). In one case an infusion was observed running at a very high rate to 'catch up' — 1 L of Plasmalyte 148 had been prescribed over 24 hours; at the time of observation, 27 hours after the start time, the rate was set at 500 mL/hour.

Unauthorised medication

Eighty-nine infusions did not have a corresponding medication order. Thirteen were flushes that did not require a medication order according to local policy. Therefore, 76 infusions (3.8%; 75 errors, one discrepancy) were judged to be unauthorised. Almost half were fluids used to flush the line, commonly in oncology settings, including sodium chloride 0.9% (n = 29), dextrose (1), Plasmalyte (2) and heparin (3). A further seven infusions were sodium chloride 0.9% administered at low rates to keep the vein open. Twenty infusions were unauthorised repeats of previously prescribed maintenance fluids. Four were administered based on verbal orders that had not been documented at the time of observation. Of the remaining 10 unauthorised infusions, seven involved maintenance fluids and three were drugs (calcium folinate, remifentanil, insulin). The remifentanil infusion had been prescribed and subsequently discontinued, but not represcribed after a decision to resedate the patient.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^115WbE1C]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients, initial management, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain a follow-up serum sodium concentration 20 minutes after the initial infusion, while administering a second infusion of 150 mL 3% hypertonic saline over the subsequent 20 minutes.

### Five unit bolus oxytocin at cesarean delivery in women at risk of atony: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^116o5ny2]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

I.v. bolus oxytocin is used routinely during cesarean delivery to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. Its adverse hemodynamic effects are well known, resulting in a recent change in dose from 10 IU to 5. Whether a 5 IU bolus has any advantages over infusion alone is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that a 5 IU i.v. bolus of oxytocin before the initiation of a continuous infusion decreases the need for additional uterotonic drugs in the first 24 hours after delivery in women with risk factors for uterine atony undergoing cesarean delivery, compared with infusion alone.

Methods

A prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted in 143 subjects undergoing cesarean delivery with at least 1 risk factor for uterine atony. Subjects received 5 IU bolus of oxytocin or normal saline i.v. over 30 seconds after umbilical cord clamping. All subjects received an infusion of 40 IU oxytocin in 500 mL normal saline over 30 minutes, followed by 20 IU in 1 L over 8 hours. The primary outcome was the need for additional uterotonics in the first 24 hours after delivery. Secondary outcomes included uterine tone as assessed by the surgeon (5-point Likert scale: 0 = "floppy", 4 = "rock hard"), estimated blood loss, side effects of bolus administration, and the oxytocin bolus-placental delivery interval.

Results

There was no difference in the need for additional uterotonic drugs in the first 24 hours between groups. There was a significant difference in uterine tone immediately after placental delivery (P < 0.01) (2.8 in the oxytocin group [95% confidence interval 2.6–3.0] vs 2.2 in the saline group [95% confidence interval 1.8–2.5]), which disappeared after 5 minutes. There were no differences in observed or reported side effects between groups.

Conclusions

We found that a 5 IU i.v. bolus of oxytocin added to an infusion did not alter the need for additional uterotonic drugs to prevent or treat postpartum hemorrhage in the first 24 hours in women undergoing cesarean delivery with risk factors for uterine atony, despite causing an initial stronger uterine contraction. Our study was not powered to find a difference in side effects between groups. These results suggest that an oxytocin infusion may be adequate without the need for a bolus, even in high-risk patients.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^113EZiHH]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of mildly symptomatic patients (acute setting), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider administering a single infusion of 3% hypertonic saline (150 mL IV, over 20 minutes) if the acute decrease in serum sodium concentration is > 10 mmol/L.

### Standardized competencies for parenteral nutrition administration: the ASPEN model [^116UW6eE]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2018). Medium credibility.

ASPEN Parenteral Nutrition (PN) Administration Competency Tool — critical behaviors for PN administration include confirming patient identity according to policy and identifying the appropriate administration route for type of PN with catheter tip placement and patency. The tool includes identifying pertinent allergies such as egg allergies for patients receiving ILE with acknowledgment of prescriber review; checking the PN label against the original PN order via standardized form/electronic health record (EHR) PN template; and inspecting PN admixture to detect defects or visual changes initially and then during the infusion for recognition of compromised admixture. It also lists accurately programming the PN infusion pump including correct rate and infusion time and expressing knowledge of policy on verifying pump settings during the infusion and at handoffs. Further items include demonstrating accurate use of intravenous (IV) filters on PN administration tubing with knowledge of occluded filter policy; tracing PN tubing to the catheter/body prior to attaching PN and labeling PN tubing to pump(s) to verify infusion source; expressing knowledge of need to flush the vascular access device (VAD) with normal saline prior to connecting PN; expressing knowledge of maintaining PN infusion at the prescribed rate to avoid interruptions; demonstrating knowledge of medication administration guidelines, including co-infusion and not adding medications to the PN bag; and demonstrating VAD dressing care procedures.

### No effect of epoprostenol on right ventricular diameter in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a randomized controlled trial [^112uMmtZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Study design

Patients were randomized to receive intravenous epoprostenol sodium (Flolan ®; GSK; Zeist, the Netherlands) or saline placebo infusion. Infusion of epoprostenol was started in a dose of 1 ng/kg/min. Every 10 minutes the dose was increased with 1 ng/kg/min to a maximum dose of 4 ng/kg/min. Patients not randomised to epoprostenol received a similar syringe pump containing isotonic saline. During titration of epoprostenol infusion, blood pressure, pulse rate and peripheral oxygen saturation were measured at 5 minute intervals. If, during titration, mean blood pressure dropped by > 10 mmHg, the dose of epoprostenol was not further increased and 0.5 liter of extra sodium chloride was administrated in 30 minutes. If blood pressure dropped by > 15 mmHg or if oxygen saturation dropped by > 7% (or absolute < 85%) epoprostenol infusion was decreased to the previous titrated dose. If blood pressure and/or oxygen saturation were not restored by down-titration, epoprostenol infusion was stopped. After inclusion of the first 8 subjects, no side effects of epoprostenol treatment at a dose of 4 ng/kg/min were observed. Because our study is a proof-of-principle study we decided to increase epoprostenol infusion rate every 10 minutes with 1 ng/kg/min to the maximum dose of 8 ng/kg/min, which is substantially higher than maximum initial doses used in epoprostenol intervention trials in patients with chronic pulmonary hypertension. After reaching the maximum dose, blood pressure, pulse rate and SaO₂ were assessed hourly for the entire duration of epoprostenol or placebo infusion. Epoprostenol infusion was continued for 20 hours, then tapered gradually during 4 hours and stopped. Hence, total treatment with epoprostenol or placebo encompassed a period of 24 hours.

The patient, the technician performing the echocardiographic examinations, as well as the cardiologist assessing the echocardiographic recordings were blinded for treatment allocation. The physician providing clinical care and monitoring vital parameters was not blinded in order to be able to respond appropriately if the patient showed signs of hemodynamic or respiratory deterioration.

All patients were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin adjusted for body weight, acenocoumarol, supplemental oxygen (2 l/min) and a isotonic saline infusion (80 ml/hr).

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^111uQ5SV]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Palliative care best practices — morphine infusion dosing for additional analgesia is specified as follows: If 4 mg or less of morphine given over 2 hours, start infusion at 2mg/hour. If 5–16 mg of morphine given over 2 hours, start infusion at 4–6 mg/hour. If more than 16mg of morphine given over 2 hours, start infusion at 8 mg/hour. Titrate every 15 minutes to patient comfort.

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115DCjtC]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Duration of infusion

The time of infusion was < 15 minutes in 24 studies (27.3%), between 15 and 29 minutes in 26 studies (29.5%), and ≥ 30 minutes in 29 studies (33%). Nine studies (10.2%) did not report duration of infusion. Where the fluid challenge was administered for < 15 minutes, between 15 and 29 minutes, and > 30 minutes, the proportions of patients deemed to be fluid responders were 59.2% (95% CI 54.2–64.1), 57.7% (95% CI 52.4–62.4), and 49.9% (95% CI 45.6–54) respectively. The duration of the fluid infusion affects the proportion of fluid responders [F (2,73) = 3.63, p = 0.03] (Fig. 2). The PR to a fluid challenge given in ≥ 30 minutes was lower than the PR when the fluid challenge was given in < 15 minutes (p = 0.045). The proportion of patients responding to a fluid challenge that was administered in < 15 minutes and between 15 and 30 minutes was similar (p = 1.0).

Fig. 2
Comparison of the proportion of responders (%) by duration of the infusion used for the fluid challenge. Planned contrast analysis revealed a significant difference between the third group (≥ 30 minutes) and the other two groups

Timing of assessment

The assessment of response to a fluid challenge was at the point of administration (n = 50 [58.1%]), between 1 and 10 minutes (n = 31 [36.8%]), or > 10 minutes (n = 5 [5.8%]) after completion of the fluid challenge. Where fluid responsiveness was assessed at the point of administration, between 1 and 10 minutes, and > 10 minutes after completion of the fluid challenge, 53.9% (95% CI 49.8–57.7), 57.7% (95% CI 52.9–62.7), and 52.3% (95% CI 32–90.5) of patients had a positive response, respectively. The time of assessment of fluid response did not affect the PR [F (2,80) = 0.76, p = 0.47] (Fig. 3).

### A randomized controlled trial of isotonic versus hypotonic maintenance intravenous fluids in hospitalized children [^112cy4Vg]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Intervention

Eligible children were invited to participate if they were expected to receive maintenance IV fluids for at least 8 hours. Participants were randomized to receive either 0.9% saline in 5.0% dextrose or 0.45% saline in 5.0% dextrose. Solution bags were covered with an opaque plastic covering by the pharmacist. Participants, the treating team and the research team were blinded to the contents of the solution bags.

Randomization was stratified by admission type (medical vs. surgical) and carried out in blocks of six using a computerized random number generator. Baseline serum [Na] was drawn prior to starting study fluid. In medical patients, this was done when the IV catheter was inserted; surgical patients had their blood drawn upon completion of the surgical procedure. The rate of infusion of study fluid, use of fluid boluses or additional IV fluids, and addition of potassium to solutions were left to the discretion of the treating physicians. Treating physicians were informed that the study fluid was either 0.9% or 0.45% saline in 5% dextrose, and advised to prescribe it as they would normally prescribe maintenance fluids. Oral fluids were not restricted and were considered to be composed of free water. Serum [Na] was repeated approximately 12 hours (minimum 8; maximum 18 hours) after the beginning of the infusion, at which point the study ended. Serum [Na] was measured using indirect potentiometry using the Beckman Coulter DxC analyzer, which has a range of [Na] detection between 100–200 mmol/L and a coefficient of variation of 1%.

Monitoring

All participants received routine in-patient nursing care, with vital signs including blood pressure monitored at least every 4 hours. Nurses also monitored for possible adverse events including symptoms potentially associated with hyponatremia (vomiting, change in level of consciousness, headache) or volume overload (edema, respiratory distress). All fluid intake during the study interval, including oral, was recorded.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117RKBRs]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

CMV gastrointestinal disease — alternative therapy and duration: Alternative therapy includes foscarnet 60 mg/kg IV every 8 hours or 90 mg/kg IV every 12 hours (BIII) for patients with treatment-limiting toxicities to ganciclovir or with ganciclovir resistance; or cidofovir 5 mg/kg/week IV for 2 weeks, then 5 mg/kg IV every other week with specified hydration and probenecid; administer 1 L of normal saline before and, if tolerated, another 1 L after infusion, and administer probenecid 2 g PO 3 hours before each cidofovir dose followed by 1 g PO 2 hours after and 1 g PO 8 hours after (total of 4 g) (CI), and cidofovir should be avoided in patients with sulfonamide allergy because of cross-hypersensitivity with probenecid. Duration of anti-CMV therapy is 21–42 days or until signs and symptoms have resolved (AIII), and after resolution of acute disease, maintenance therapy is not routinely recommended for CMV GI disease unless there is concurrent retinitis, there have already been recurrent infections, or severe disease was present initially.

### Are 2 smaller intravenous catheters as good as 1 larger intravenous catheter? [^113fDWRK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Using Poiseuille's law and standardized gauge sizes, an 18-gauge (g) intravenous catheter (IV) should be 2.5 times faster than a 20-g IV, but this is not borne out by observation, in vitro testing, and manufacturer's data. Our objective was to determine if the infusion rate of a single 18-g IV was equivalent to the infusion rate of two 20-g IVs.

Methods

This was a prospective study in healthy adult volunteers. Subjects simultaneously received 500 mL of normal saline via an 18-g IV in one arm and 500 mL of normal saline via two 20-g IVs in the other arm. We measured the rates of fluid administration. Paired Student's t test was used for comparison of the 2 arms of the study. We estimated that 18 trials were needed in sample size analysis.

Results

Eighteen trials were completed. The mean infusion rate for a single 18-g 500-mL IV administration was 35.6 mL/min (95% confidence interval, 30.3–40.8), with manufacturer's rating being 105 mL/min. The mean infusion rate for two 20-g IVs was 41.3 mL/min (95% CI, 36.1–46.4), with manufacturer's rating being 120 mL/min. The rate of infusion via two 20-g IVs were statistically significantly faster than the single 18-g IV, with a mean difference in flow rate of 5.7 mL/min (95% CI, 1.3–10; p = 0.026).

Conclusion

In healthy volunteers, administration of intravenous fluids through two 20-g IVs is faster than a single 18-g IV, although both approaches are markedly slower than the manufacturer's estimates.

### AutoSyP: a low-cost, low-power syringe pump for use in low-resource settings [^112z7GQS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical performance.

In the first phase of clinical testing, there was less than 3% error in the mean flow rate for all 10 healthy volunteer trials (Table 2). A single infusion was defined as the complete infusion of one syringe. In trials three and four, patients received multiple infusions using the same syringe size and flow rate. The average mean flow rate error over the 10 trials was −0.60% ± 1.65% (95% confidence interval [CI]: −1.61, 0.42). No true occlusions or device occlusion alarms occurred. There were also no malfunctions of the device.

In the second phase, 30 pediatric patients were enrolled from the Chathinka Neonatal Intensive Care Ward, the Pediatric Nursery High Dependency Unit, and the Pediatric Special Care Ward. About 59 infusions were completed in this phase. Patients were given one or multiple infusions of normal saline, dextrose, Ringer's lactate (with or without added potassium chloride) for treatment of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and/or hypoglycemia based on physicians' orders (Table 3). The age of subjects ranged from 2 days to 9 months and weights ranged from 1.2 to 7.8 kg.

Prescribed flow rates varied between 5 and 60 mL/hour, and prescribed volume delivered per infusion varied between 8 and 60 mL. Syringe sizes for all infusions were 60 mL. The average for mean flow rate error over the 59 infusions was −2.27% ± 1.91% (95% CI: −2.76, −1.78) (Figure 5).

During the pediatric patient study, there were 26 infusions where the occlusion alarm was triggered one or multiple times. The occlusion alarm alerted the nurse a total of 59 times, and 17 of the triggered occlusion alarms were false alarms. About 42 alarms were true positives, where the IV line occluded and stopped fluid delivery temporarily until a nurse could correct the occlusion. Two patients were discharged early and treatment with AutoSyP was discontinued.

### The half-life of infusion fluids: an educational review [^117PQMHf]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Almost all but the most minor surgical procedures begin with the attachment of an intravenous infusion. It is such a routine part of clinical practice that few of us give any serious thought as to which fluid to use, or what becomes of it once it is infused. However, establishing an intravenous infusion opens the door to problems such as fluid overload. Although probably rare, the incidence of this iatrogenic complication is unknown; clinicians are reluctant to report problems of their own making. A better understanding of the influence of infused fluids on the volumes of the plasma and the interstitium, and how this can change with a physiology manipulated by different aspects of clinical management, offers a more enlightened approach to fluid therapy. Through the medium of the half-life this review intends to examine what is known about the fate of infused fluids, and the factors that limit and extend their usefulness, so as to encourage an evidence-based approach to their use.

Turnover and half-life

Fluids are infused to maintain, restore or elevate the circulating volume but, as plasma volume increases, water and electrolytes pass out of the circulation into the interstitium. As the volume expansion of the plasma is reversed by renal excretion, so fluid will pass back from the interstitium into the plasma, maintaining homeostasis (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Schematic drawing showing the turnover of infused fluids in humans. Kinetic variables discussed in this review are marked in blue and others are indicated in red. Cl d = distribution clearance, Cl = elimination clearance, T₁/₂ = elimination half-life.

From a clinical perspective, the duration of plasma volume expansion, subject to both distribution clearance into the interstitium and elimination clearance by the kidneys, has an important bearing on the volume and rate of infusion of a particular fluid, and may be a significant factor in the choice of fluid. A fluid that is relatively short-lived may appear to have disadvantages in situations of plasma volume depletion such as haemorrhage, but such properties would be desirable in the event of overload. A means of comparing and contrasting the duration of different fluids is required and this is achieved through the concepts of turnover and half-life.

ILE administration set management and infusion duration — contamination precautions state that unfiltered ILE and PN admixtures must not be permitted to infuse; guidelines recommend changing administration tubing and filters every 24 hours for TNAs and every 12 hours for ILE infused separately; when prolonged ILE infusion is desirable to promote tolerance, the daily ILE dose should be divided into 2 parts, with a new container, tubing, and filter used every 12 hours; and the potential for contamination of ILE during administration has led to the recommendation to limit the infusion time for ILE containing fluids.

### Intravenous dextrose for children with gastroenteritis and dehydration: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^117656rF]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We seek to determine whether an initial intravenous bolus of 5% dextrose in normal saline solution compared with normal saline solution will lead to a lower proportion of hospitalized patients and a greater reduction in serum ketone levels in children with gastroenteritis and dehydration.

Methods

We enrolled children aged 6 months to 6 years in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of patients presenting to a pediatric emergency department. Subjects were randomized to receive a 20 mL/kg infusion of either 5% dextrose in normal saline solution or normal saline solution. Serum ketone levels were measured before and at 1- and 2-hour intervals after the initial study fluid bolus administration. Primary outcome was the proportion of children hospitalized. Secondary outcome was change in serum ketone levels over time.

Results

One hundred eighty-eight children were enrolled. The proportion of children hospitalized did not differ between groups (35% in the 5% dextrose in normal saline solution group versus 44% in the normal saline solution group; risk difference 9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5% to 22%). Compared with children who received normal saline solution, those who received 5% dextrose in normal saline solution had a greater reduction in mean serum ketone levels at both 1 hour (mean Δ 1.2 versus 0.1 mmol/L; mean difference 1.1 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.4 to 1.9 mmol/L) and 2 hours (mean Δ 1.9 versus 0.3 mmol/L; mean difference 1.6 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.9 to 2.3 mmol/L).

Conclusion

Administration of a dextrose-containing bolus compared with normal saline did not lead to a lower rate of hospitalization for children with gastroenteritis and dehydration. There was, however, a greater reduction in serum ketone levels in patients who received 5% dextrose in normal saline solution.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^113d9FF3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis early care — intravenous fluid and timing of vasopressors — We agree with delivering an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus during initial management of patients who have hypotension or findings of hypoperfusion absent signs of fluid overload. We do not support a prespecified volume or body mass–adjusted volume of fluid for all patients, though we recognize many patients benefit from 30 mL/kg of crystalloid; patient response may serve as the best indicator of the appropriateness of fluid resuscitation volume, rather than the delivery of a prespecified volume. We do not recognize a specific minimum fluid amount before starting vasopressor support, and vasopressor support may be coupled with plasma volume expansion in severe hypotension or life‑threatening hypoperfusion without requiring that a fluid administration threshold be reached prior to vasopressor initiation. We think serial examinations using more than one bedside tool to assess adequacy of resuscitation are best, with no one approach demonstrated as superior. We support using balanced crystalloid solutions as the primary resuscitation fluid in patients with sepsis, especially if volumes of more than 1 L are used, and note that infusions of saline solution can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may impair renal performance in commonly prescribed resuscitative doses.

Demographics, Baseline Characteristics, and Unadjusted Outcomes by Implementation Phase

Abbreviations: ED, emergency department; ICU, intensive care unit.

The median (IQR) volume of NS infused in the preimplementation period was 1000 (600–1469) mL; 65 726 of 86 388 (76.1%) patients received more than half of their total fluids as NS. Postimplementation, the median (IQR) balanced crystalloids volume infused was 1000 (1000–1800) mL, and 50 477 of 62 035 (81.4%) patients received more than half of their total fluids as balanced crystalloids (Table 1). The interrupted time series analysis demonstrated a week-on-week increase in the proportion of intravenous fluid administered that was balanced crystalloid that accelerated after clinician education began at sites where education occurred before the EHR implementation (Table 2 and Figure 1). There was an increase in the proportion of fluid received as balanced crystalloids associated with EHR implementation (odds ratio [OR], 3.44; 95% CI, 2.79–4.24). Balanced crystalloids administration proportion was stable after EHR implementation. Over the course of the study, the observed proportion of all fluids received that were balanced crystalloid increased from 28% during the first week to 75% during the last week (Figure 1). After the EHR implementation, 11.9% of NS orders (633 of 5316) occurring outside an approved order set were changed after the best-practice alert fired.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^112XSdcs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Imiglucerase (Cerezyme) hypersensitivity — epidemiology, evaluation, testing, graded challenge, and desensitization are described as follows: Up to 15% of patients may experience adverse reactions, and approximately 15% of patients have developed IgG antibodies; more than 90% tolerated infusion for at least 24 to 36 months, yet almost half later had symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity. In general, hypersensitivity reactions to intravenous imiglucerase have been reported in approximately 13.8% of patients, and anaphylaxis is rare (reported in < 1% of patients). The positive and negative predictive value of imiglucerase skin test is unknown due to limited data; therefore, skin testing is not recommended as a routine procedure, but if symptoms with imiglucerase infusions suggest possible IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, skin testing and/or graded challenge can be used, and skin testing is recommended only for moderate or severe recurrent infusion–associated reactions with features such as persistent bronchospasm, hypotension, and/or urticaria. For testing, imiglucerase is reconstituted at 200 units in 5 mL to make a 40 units/mL solution for prick testing; for intradermal testing, 10-fold serial dilutions with 0.9% sterile saline are used and the highest nonirritating concentration is 4 units/mL. For mild reactions not consistent with hypersensitivity, imiglucerase may be delivered with 2- or 3-step graded challenge protocols; in a 3-step protocol, 1% of the total therapeutic dose is infused over 1 hour, then 10% over 1 hour, and if tolerated the remaining 90% is given at the regular rate, with no further challenge needed if the third-step infusion ends without adverse events. Desensitization is recommended for patients who have hypersensitivity reactions to imiglucerase and have no alternative treatment; an example protocol could include 5 bags (from 1 unit/mL to 0.0001 unit/mL) with 10 steps each to deliver roughly 140 units in 5 hours, followed by another 4-step infusion to reach 100 mL/h, with total desensitization time typically 6 to 9 hours.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Parenteral Administration

In
hospitalized patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions or intractable
ulcers, or in patients who are unable to take oral medication, cimetidine
may be administered parenterally.

Intermittent
Intravenous Infusion: 300 mg every 6 to 8 hours, infused over 15
to 20 minutes. In some patients it may be necessary to increase dosage. When
this is necessary, the increases should be made by more frequent administration
of a 300 mg dose, but should not exceed 2400 mg per day.

Continuous Intravenous Infusion: 37.5 mg/hour (900
mg/day). For patients requiring a more rapid elevation of gastric pH, continuous
infusion may be preceded by a 150 mg loading dose administered by I.V. infusion
as described above. Note: A volumetric pump is recommended if the volume for
24-hour infusion is less than 250 mL. In one study in patients with pathological
hypersecretory states, the mean infused dose of cimetidine was 160 mg/hour
with a range of 40 to 600 mg/hour.

These doses maintained
the intragastric acid secretory rate at 10 mEq/hour or less. The infusion
rate should be adjusted to individual patient requirements.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^115eXLhn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis intravenous hydration monitoring and dosing — monitor clinical parameters and target early reassessment with moderate strategies. Monitoring depends on heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output, and hydration leading to a decrease in the HCT (hemoconcentration) and/or decreased BUN (blood urea nitrogen) has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality; the latest evaluation should be 6–8 hours after admission. A randomized study showed that moderate intravenous hydration for the first 24–48 hours may be equally effective as aggressive hydration and was less likely to cause volume overload. In patients with no evidence of hypovolemia, an initial resuscitation rate of no more than 1.5 mL/kg of body weight per hour should be administered, whereas in patients with hypovolemia, clinicians should administer a bolus of 10 mL/kg.

### A randomized controlled trial of isotonic versus hypotonic maintenance intravenous fluids in hospitalized children [^1166WQmW]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Isotonic saline has been proposed as a safer alternative to traditional hypotonic solutions for intravenous (IV) maintenance fluids to prevent hyponatremia. However, the optimal tonicity of maintenance intravenous fluids in hospitalized children has not been determined. The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the rates of change in serum sodium ([Na]) for patients administered either hypotonic or isotonic IV fluids for maintenance needs.

Methods

This was a masked controlled trial. Randomization was stratified by admission type: medical patients and post-operative surgical patients, aged 3 months to 18 years, who required IV fluids for at least 8 hours. Patients were randomized to receive either 0.45% or 0.9% saline in 5.0% dextrose. Treating physicians used the study fluid for maintenance; infusion rate and the use of additional fluids were left to their discretion.

Results

Sixteen children were randomized to 0.9% saline and 21 to 0.45% saline. Baseline characteristics, duration (average of 12 hours) and rate of study fluid infusion, and the volume of additional isotonic fluids given were similar for the two groups. [Na] increased significantly in the 0.9% group (+0.20 mmol/L/h [IQR +0.03, +0.4]; P = 0.02) and increased, but not significantly, in the 0.45% group (+0.08 mmol/L/h [IQR -0.15, +0.16]; P = 0.07). The rate of change and absolute change in serum [Na] did not differ significantly between groups.

Conclusions

When administered at the appropriate maintenance rate and accompanied by adequate volume expansion with isotonic fluids, 0.45% saline did not result in a drop in serum sodium during the first 12 hours of fluid therapy in children without severe baseline hyponatremia. Confirmation in a larger study is strongly recommended.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: WHO plan C versus slow rehydration [^114awj8G]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this clinical trial involving 122 children with severe dehydration due to gastroenteritis, we have shown that a simpler protocol involving slower rehydration with 100 ml/kg over 8-h irrespective of age was as safe as the 2-stage age-specific WHO plan C protocol. Correction of dehydration and time to tolerate oral fluids and time to discharge was similar in both arms. Overall, mortality in this phase II trial was substantially lower (3.3%) than previous reports and few other adverse events were recorded.

One of the additional objectives of the trial was to assess adherence to the rehydration protocol and other challenges for implementation rehydration. Whilst current management guidelines (WHO plan C) are thought to be widely practiced in African hospitals, it became apparent when conducting the training for the clinical trial that clinicians prior to the trial were not routinely able to adhere to plan C for a number of reasons. First, the administration of accurate volume and rates of infusion were found to be challenging to hospitals where gauged burettes or infusion sets are routinely unavailable. Second, the two-step plan C involving a fast infusion followed by slower intravenous replacement at two different rates and volumes for two age groups were confusing and thus difficult to recall and implement accurately in practice. Finally, the WHO treatment guideline for the child with severe dehydration presenting with shock is rather opaque on whether fluid boluses (20 ml/kg of normal saline given as fast as possible and repeated up to two times if shock persists) are given in addition to rehydration (thus, the maximum volume a child could receive would be 160 ml/kg) in 4–6 h. We found initially navigating and executing the plan C guideline a challenge to teach and implement, yet the trial teams, as a result of recurrent training throughout the trial, were able to demonstrate adherence to the guideline in the study arm.

### Optimal timing for intravascular administration set replacement [^116X8Uxj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The tubing (administration set) attached to both venous and arterial catheters may contribute to bacteraemia and other infections. The rate of infection may be increased or decreased by routine replacement of administration sets. This review was originally published in 2005 and was updated in 2012.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to identify any relationship between the frequency with which administration sets are replaced and rates of microbial colonization, infection and death.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2012), CINAHL (1982 to June 2012), EMBASE (1980 to June 2012), reference lists of identified trials and bibliographies of published reviews. The original search was performed in February 2004. We also contacted researchers in the field. We applied no language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized or controlled clinical trials on the frequency of venous or arterial catheter administration set replacement in hospitalized participants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed all potentially relevant studies. We resolved disagreements between the two review authors by discussion with a third review author. We collected data for seven outcomes: catheter-related infection; infusate-related infection; infusate microbial colonization; catheter microbial colonization; all-cause bloodstream infection; mortality; and cost. We pooled results from studies that compared different frequencies of administration set replacement, for instance, we pooled studies that compared replacement ≥ every 96 hours versus every 72 hours with studies that compared replacement ≥ every 48 hours versus every 24 hours.

Main Results

We identified 26 studies for this updated review, 10 of which we excluded; six did not fulfil the inclusion criteria and four did not report usable data. We extracted data from the remaining 18 references (16 studies) with 5001 participants: study designs included neonate and adult populations, arterial and venous administration sets, parenteral nutrition, lipid emulsions and crystalloid infusions. Most studies were at moderate to high risk of bias or did not adequately describe the methods that they used to minimize bias. All included trials were unable to blind personnel because of the nature of the intervention. No evidence was found for differences in catheter-related or infusate-related bacteraemia or fungaemia with more frequent administration set replacement overall or at any time interval comparison (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.69; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.70). Infrequent administration set replacement reduced the rate of bloodstream infection (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98). No evidence revealed differences in catheter colonization or infusate colonization with more frequent administration set replacement (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.86, respectively). Borderline evidence suggested that infrequent administration set replacement increased the mortality rate only within the neonatal population (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.36). No evidence revealed interactions between the (lack of) effects of frequency of administration set replacement and the subgroups analysed: parenteral nutrition and/or fat emulsions versus infusates not involving parenteral nutrition or fat emulsions; adult versus neonatal participants; and arterial versus venous catheters.

Authors' Conclusions

Some evidence indicates that administration sets that do not contain lipids, blood or blood products may be left in place for intervals of up to 96 hours without increasing the risk of infection. Other evidence suggests that mortality increased within the neonatal population with infrequent administration set replacement. However, much the evidence obtained was derived from studies of low to moderate quality.

### The half-life of infusion fluids: an educational review [^111MHs5e]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Volume kinetics

This describes an approach that is identical to the way that the half-life of drugs is calculated in pharmacokinetics (see Supplementary material). Volume kinetics is a term that describes the application of the dilution data to a mathematical model. The data are used to generate a dilution curve that is exponential in nature, but the application of a simple formula converts this to a linear form that follows the process of dilution, and this is what is used in the volume kinetics analysis. Once the data have been fitted to a kinetic model the dilution and volume expansion of the plasma can be simulated for other rates of infusion, or sequence of infusions, not just the one in current use. The dilution and the volume expansion of the interstitial fluid space can also be simulated and analysed, which is not possible with other methods. The expected urinary excretion can also be simulated over time. The appearance of such curves is exemplified in Fig. 2.

Studies in volunteers

Much of the initial investigation of fluid volume kinetics was conducted in volunteers and based on morning experiments involving groups of conscious, healthy volunteers who would generally be given one glass of fluid to drink in the early morning to limit overnight dehydration. Intermediate-sized fluid volumes (12.5 to 25 mL kg −1 of crystalloid or 10 mL kg −1 of colloid fluid) would be infused over 30 min, followed by frequent assessment of haemodilution over 3 to 4 h. Observation of urinary excretion allow more accurate calculation of the kinetic constants.

Most researchers commonly employed a 30 min infusion time, but on occasion, 15 min infusion times would be used. Some experiments compared the kinetics of the same volume being infused over 15, 30, 45 and 80 min. In total, 30 min infusions are practical from many aspects, but above all, from the data obtained, they permit a good description of the distribution phase up to termination of the infusion.

### The half-life of infusion fluids: an educational review [^116KSovz]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Measuring half-life

Although urine elimination half-life is simple, it is not a very precise measure because it typically provides just one point of measurement. The time to first void is even worse, as the bladder size differs between individuals, making it no more than a rough estimate. The information it provides is largely to do with elimination, which is important in relation to overload, rather than distribution, which is related to circulating volume. However, if the urinary excretion is related to haemodilution over time, the measure is much improved.

A variety of techniques have been used to measure plasma volume. Typically, a radioactive tracer would be injected and its dilution measured. Such a technique is unsuitable for following the kinetics of an infused fluid because it requires a volumetric steady state, which is not a feature of a dynamic physiology (Fig. 2). For example, a labelled protein such as albumin would require a steady state for 30 to 40 min, making capture of the distribution process impossible. Although such tracers distribute too slowly to make an assessment of the kinetics of a crystalloid fluid a feasible proposition, they are probably useful for colloids. As with urine volume, there is one point of measurement but based on two analyses – one before the injection and one following dilution in the plasma.

Measurement of haemodilution, provided by the blood haemoglobin concentration, overcomes these problems, permitting multiple sampling, generally providing one measurement every 5 min for as long as sampling is possible and there is still some infused fluid left in the body. A favoured technique is to take triplicate samples at baseline and then measure haemoglobin concentration once every 5 to 10 min for 3 to 4 h. This provides a very detailed picture of the haemodilution process, allowing distribution to be mathematically separated from elimination. The additional measurement of urinary excretion makes it even more precise.

An alternative to measuring haemoglobin concentration is desiccation. A tube is filled with about 1 mL of blood and it is weighed precisely to several decimal places before being placed in an open heater at 100°C overnight. The following day the tube is weighed again when all water has evaporated and the water content of the original sample can then be calculated. Similar results are obtained from data using haemoglobin concentration or water because they move in a reciprocal fashion. Measuring haemoglobin is the simpler and cheaper marker to measure, while desiccation is labour intensive and requires several measurements before the water concentration can be inferred.

### The half-life of infusion fluids: an educational review [^115Br6A5]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

To treat infusion fluids in the same manner as drugs would represent a familiar approach, but their basal constituent is water, a property they share with body fluids. The term 'turnover' is used when pharmacokinetic principles are applied to substances that are already present in the body. The elimination in a turnover model is often reported as the fractional turnover rate, but can be expressed as the more commonly used 'half-life' (T₁/₂) or the time required for elimination of 50% of an infused fluid volume. A longer half-life would increase volume expansion of both the plasma and the interstitial fluid, and a reduction would have the opposite effect (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Effects of different elimination half-lives (T₁/₂, represented by the different colours) on the distribution of excess volume between plasma (a), interstitial fluid (b), and urine (c) when 2 l of Ringer's acetate is infused over 60 min. The other kinetic variables were set to typical values in conscious adult male volunteers. –

Figure 1 shows the fate of infusion fluids and also the points at which volume measurements might be made. Perhaps the simplest and easiest measure of the T₁/₂ of a fluid load is the time to the first void or the voided volume at a specific time point, since urinary excretion is the ultimate fate of infused fluid. The most difficult volume to measure is that of the interstitium, which would need an ionic isotope dilution assay and an isotopic measurement of blood volume. In between is measurement of the plasma volume, which is probably what is of greatest interest to most clinicians. Urine volume measurement and techniques for assessing plasma volume are not mutually exclusive and are worthy of further consideration.

### Cerliponase alfa (Brineura) [^115xLDES]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Hematoma

Hematoma adverse reactions were reported in 5 of 24 (21%) patients treated with BRINEURA and presented as hematoma, post procedural hematoma, traumatic hematoma and subdural hematoma. Hematomas did not require treatment and did not interfere with BRINEURA infusion.

Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 11 out of 24 patients (46%) treated with BRINEURA during or within 24 hours after completion of the BRINEURA infusion, despite pre-medication with antihistamines with or without antipyretics or corticosteroids. The most common manifestations observed concomitantly with hypersensitivity included pyrexia with vomiting, pleocytosis, or irritability, which are not consistent with classic immune mediated hypersensitivity. Symptoms resolved over time or with administration of antipyretics, antihistamines and/or corticosteroids and no patient discontinued treatment with BRINEURA.

One patient experienced hypoxia (decreased oxygen saturation less than 88% by pulse oximeter), 8 hours after BRINEURA infusion, followed by a low mean arterial pressure at 15 hours post infusion. Symptoms resolved after oxygen administration, airway repositioning and normal saline infusion. One patient reported decreased oxygen saturation (90% by pulse oximeter), 45 minutes after starting BRINEURA with associated low diastolic blood pressures. Hypoxia resolved after oxygen administration. No treatment was administered for the low diastolic blood pressure, which returned to normal while the patient continued to receive BRINEURA infusion without change to the infusion rate or dose.

### Changes in body composition, hematologic parameters, and serum biochemistry after rapid intravenous infusion or oral intake of 2 liters of 0.9% saline solution in young healthy volunteers: randomized crossover study [^117MTmwb]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The perioperative infusion of 2 L of saline is associated with weight gain and decreased serum albumin and hematocrit. We hypothesized that these parameters would respond differently to oral administration and intravenous infusion of saline solution.

Methods

This was a crossover study that included 10 healthy young men (ages 18–26 years). At two times, 8 weeks apart, the participants were randomized to receive 2 L of 0.9% saline over 1 h by intravenous (IV) administration to a forearm vein or by oral intake. The participants were weighed and body masses were calculated. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed with a single-frequency device using tetrapolar distal limb electrodes. Blood samples were collected 1 h after the administration period for laboratory assays: hematocrit, hemoglobin, blood glucose, serum electrolytes, albumin, creatinine, osmolality.

Results

There was an increase in body weight (p < 0.01), total body water (p < 0.01), and lean body mass (p < 0.01) after the experiment in both groups, with no difference between them. The volume of urine output was similar in the two experiments. The hemoglobin (oral group from 14.4 ± 0.8 g/dl to 13.8 ± 0.8 g/dl; IV group from 14.4 ± 0.6 g/dl to 12.6 ± 0.6 g/dl) and hematocrit (oral group from 43.2 ± 1.8% to 43.2 ± 2.8%; IV group from 43.6 ± 2.2% to 40.0 ± 2.6%) significantly decreased (p < 0.01) with IV saline. Serum albumin remained stable after oral intake but significantly decreased (p = 0.04) after IV infusion.

Conclusions

Oral intake of 2 L of 0.9% saline results in minimal variations in serum albumin, hemoglobin, and hematocrit when compared to IV infusion of the same volume.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^112BGw9b]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia

As shown in Figure 2, hypertonic saline (typically 3% NaCl) is recommended for the treatment of acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia. Hypertonic saline is an effective and potentially life-saving treatment for cerebral oedema caused by hyponatraemia, as the high extracellular Na + concentration immediately removes water from the intracellular space. In case of patients with hypervolemic hyponatraemia, hypertonic saline can be combined with loop diuretics.

Figure 2.
Algorithm for the management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke.

In every step of hyponatraemia treatment, physicians should rigorously search for and stop non-essential fluids, medications and other factors that can contribute to or provoke hyponatraemia. In addition, cause-specific treatment is strongly recommended.

In case of severe symptoms, regardless of hyponatraemia being acute or chronic, intravenous administration of 150 mL 3% hypertonic saline over 20 min two to three times as needed is recommended until symptoms are resolved or until a target of 5 mmol/l Na + increase is achieved during the first hour (Figure 2). If these do not happen, infusion of 3% hypertonic saline should be continued aiming for an additional 1 mmol/l/h Na + increase until serum Na + concentration increases 10 mmol/l in total or it reaches 130 mmol/l, whichever occurs first. Of note, physicians should not expect patients with severe symptoms to fully recover immediately, as brain needs some time to fully recover. They should also be aware that sometimes it may not be possible to assess an improvement in symptoms, such as in the case of a stroke patient, who can also be intubated and sedated. Finally, the contribution of any potassium (K +) correction to an increase in Na + concentrations should be considered and can be estimated with the formula of Adrogue–Madias: expected change in serum Na⁺ = [(infusate Na⁺ + infusate K⁺ − serum Na⁺)/(total body water + 1)]. Of note, the estimated total body water (litre) is calculated as ~50% of body weight approximately (0.6 in non-elderly men and 0.5 in non-elderly women; 0.5 and 0.45 in elderly men and women, respectively).

In case of moderate symptoms or acute asymptomatic hyponatraemia exceeding 10 mmol/l, a single intravenous infusion of 150 mL 3% hypertonic saline over 20 min is recommended (Figure 2).

Outcomes

The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution, defined as the time elapsed between ED presentation and resolution of ketoacidosis, using the following criteria for resolution of ketoacidosis from the American Diabetes Association Consensus Statement on Hyperglycemic Crises — plasma glucose less than 200 mg/dL and 2 of the following: plasma bicarbonate greater than or equal to 15 mEq/L, venous pH greater than 7.3, and anion gap less than or equal to 12 mEq/L. Patients discharged from the hospital without meeting laboratory criteria for DKA resolution were classified as having DKA resolution at the time of hospital discharge.

The secondary outcome was time to discontinuation of insulin infusion, defined as the time between initiation and final discontinuation of intravenous insulin infusion during the hospitalization for DKA. Patients who never had an insulin infusion started were coded as 0 for time to discontinuation of insulin infusion. Additional outcomes are described in eTable 2 in the Supplement.

Randomisation and drug administration

Random numbers were generated by computer software in a 1:1 ratio. Patients were randomized to receive morphine 0.5 mg/mL with or without dexmedetomidine 1 μg/mL. Study drugs were prepared according to the randomization results by a study coordinator. Anesthesiologist and the investigator responsible for the study outcomes assesssment were blinded.

For patients in the dexmedetomidine group (Group Dex), an initial loading dose of 0.4 μg/kg dexmedetomidine was given by intravenous infusion 0.5 h before the end of surgery. PCA was begun with 0.5 mg/mL morphine plus 1 μg/mL dexmedetomidine in 100 mL normal saline. While for patients in the control group (Group Ctrl), normal saline was given 0.5 h before the end of surgery, and PCA was begun with 0.5 mg/mL morphine in 100 mL normal saline. For all patients, PCA was programmed to deliver a 2 mL bolus on-demand with a lockout time of 8 min and a background infusion at a rate of 1 mL/h.

The investigator assessing patients outcomes was blinded to group assignment and blinding was maintained throughout the study period.

### Optimal frequency of changing intravenous administration sets: is it safe to prolong use beyond 72 hours? [^117Ehvk5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the safety and cost-effectiveness of replacing the intravenous (IV) tubing sets in hospitalized patients at 4- to 7-day intervals instead of every 72 hours.

Design

Prospective, randomized study of infusion-related contamination associated with changing IV tubing sets within 3 days versus within 4 to 7 days of placement.

Setting

A tertiary university cancer center.

Patients and Methods

Cancer patients requiring IV infusion therapy were randomized to have the IV tubing sets replaced within 3 days (280 patients) or within 4 to 7 days of placement (232 patients). Demographic, microbiological, and infusion-related data were collected for all participants. The main outcome measures were infusion- or catheter-related contamination or colonization of IV tubing, determined by quantitative cultures of the infusate, and infusion- or catheter-related bloodstream infection (BSI), determined by quantitative culture of the infusate in association with blood cultures in febrile patients.

Results

The two groups were comparable in terms of patient and catheter characteristics and the agents given through the IV tubing. Intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated a higher level of tubing colonization in the 4- to 7-day group versus the 3-day group (median, 145 vs 50 colony-forming units; p = 0.02). In addition, there were three episodes of possible infusion-related BSIs, all of which occurred in the 4- to 7-day group (P = 0.09). However, when the 84 patients who received total parenteral nutrition, blood transfusions, or interleukin-2 through the IV tubing were excluded, the two groups had a comparable rate of colonization (0.4% vs 0.5%), with no catheter- or infusion-related BSIs in either group.

Conclusion

In patients at low risk for infection from infusion- or catheter-related infection who are not receiving total parenteral nutrition, blood transfusions, or interleukin-2, delaying the replacement of IV tubing up to 7 days may be safe, as well as cost-effective

Acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections — treatment failure due to acyclovir resistance should be suspected if lesions do not begin to resolve within 7–10 days after initiation of anti-HSV therapy, and all acyclovir-resistant strains are also resistant to valacyclovir with most resistant to famciclovir; treatment should be given in consultation with an infectious disease expert (AIII). Preferred therapy is IV foscarnet 40 mg/kg every 8–12 hours until clinical response (AI). Alternative therapy options include topical imiquimod 5% cream three times a week (BIII), topical cidofovir 1% gel once daily (BIII), topical trifluridine 1% three times a day (BIII), topical foscarnet 1% five times a day (BIII), or IV cidofovir 5 mg/kg once weekly for 2 weeks, then every other week (CIII), with probenecid and hydration as follows: administer probenecid 2 g PO 3 hours before each cidofovir dose followed by 1 g PO 2 hours after the dose, and 1 g PO 8 hours after the dose (total of 4 g), and administer 1 L of normal saline before and, if tolerated, another 1 L after each infusion; cidofovir should be avoided in patients with sulfonamide allergy because of cross-hypersensitivity with probenecid. Duration is based on clinical response; typically 21–28 days or longer. Additional notes include an expanded access program of oral pritelivir for immunocompromised people with acyclovir-resistant HSV, the lack of commercially available topical formulations of trifluridine, cidofovir, and foscarnet with extemporaneous compounding options, and that after resolution of the acyclovir-resistant episode, suppressive therapy with acyclovir can be considered to prevent additional recurrences (CIII).

### Lidocaine (lidocaine hydrochloride) [^1127A1DP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Adults:

Single Direct Intravenous Injection (bolus): ONLY THE 5 mL, 50 MG or 100 MG DOSAGE SIZES should be used for direct intravenous injection. The usual dose is 50 to 100 mg of lidocaine hydrochloride (0.70 to 1.4 mg/kg; 0.32 to 0.63 mg/lb) administered intravenously under ECG monitoring. This dose may be administered at the rate of approximately 25 to 50 mg/min (0.35 to 0.70 mg/ kg/min; 0.16 to 0.32 mg/lb/min). Sufficient time should be allowed to enable a slow circulation to carry the drug to the site of action. If the initial injection of 50 to 100 mg does not produce a desired response, a second dose may be injected after five minutes. NO MORE THAN 200 TO 300 MG OF LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED DURING A ONE HOUR PERIOD.

Continuous Intravenous Infusion: Following bolus administration, intravenous infusions of lidocaine hydrochloride may be initiated at the rate of 1 to 4 mg/min of lidocaine hydrochloride (0.014 to 0.057 mg/kg/min; 0.006 to 0.026 mg/lb/min). The rate of intravenous infusions should be reassessed as soon as the patient's basic cardiac rhythm appears to be stable or at the earliest signs of toxicity. It should rarely be necessary to continue intravenous infusions of lidocaine for prolonged periods.

When administering lidocaine hydrochloride (or any potent medication) by continuous intravenous infusion, it is advisable to use a precision volume control I.V. set.

Pediatric: Controlled clinical studies in the pediatric population to establish dosing schedules have not been conducted. The American Heart Association's Standards and Guidelines recommends a bolus dose of 1 mg/kg, and an infusion rate of between 20–50 mcg/kg/min for prolonged therapy. When drug clearance is reduced, as in patients with shock, congestive heart failure or cardiac arrest, the infusion rate should not exceed 20 mcg/kg/min.

NOTE: Regarding Prolonged Infusions: There are data that indicate the half-life may be 3 hours or longer following infusions of greater than 24 hours in duration. Do not use if solution is discolored or cloudy.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand.

WEZLANA solution for intravenous infusion must be diluted, prepared and infused by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique.

Calculate the dose and the number of WEZLANA vials needed based on patient weight (Table 4). Each 26 mL vial of WEZLANA contains 130 mg of ustekinumab-auub.
Withdraw, and then discard a volume of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP from the 250 mL infusion bag equal to the volume of WEZLANA to be added (discard 26 mL sodium chloride for each vial of WEZLANA needed, for 2 vials- discard 52 mL, for 3 vials- discard 78 mL, 4 vials- discard 104 mL). Alternatively, a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be used.
Withdraw 26 mL of WEZLANA from each vial needed and add it to the 250 mL infusion bag. The final volume in the infusion bag should be 250 mL. Gently mix.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discoloration or foreign particles are observed.
Infuse the diluted solution over a period of at least one hour. Once diluted, the infusion should be completely administered within eight hours of the dilution in the infusion bag.
Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer).
Do not infuse WEZLANA concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents.
WEZLANA does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for one-time use in only one patient. Discard any remaining solution. Dispose any unused medicinal product in accordance with local requirements.

Storage

If necessary, the diluted infusion solution may be kept at room temperature up to 25°C (77°F) for up to 7 hours. Storage time at room temperature begins once the diluted solution has been prepared. The infusion should be completed within 8 hours after the dilution in the infusion bag (cumulative time after preparation including the storage and the infusion period). Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion of the infusion solution.

### Quantitative assessment of required separator fluid volume in multi-infusion settings [^116JkwjR]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Flushing procedures to clean intravenous (IV) tubing and catheters are common practice whenever solutions are administered intravenously. IV tubing, which connects an IV bag or syringe to the patient's IV access, is flushed to make sure all drugs present in the tubing are delivered into the bloodstream of the patient. IV catheters need to be flushed and locked at the end of infusion to clear or prevent obstruction and thrombus formation, or to reduce bacterial colonization during the period when the catheter is idle. Normal saline (NS; NaCl 0.9%) and glucose 5% (G5) are commonly used as a flushing fluids as they are compatible with many IV drugs.

Another function of flushing is to separate two incompatible drug solutions that are sequentially administered. A separator fluid (SF) serves to avoid the contact of the incompatible solutions before they reach the bloodstream. When two drug solutions are physically or chemically incompatible, precipitation or inactivation may occur when they are mixed. When incompatible IV solutions must be administered continuously, a common way to address this problem is the use of multiple catheters or multi-lumen catheters that allow for a separated flow of each solution. However, even with such systems, the number of incompatible solutions may still exceed the number of available lumens.

In such a case sandwiching a SF between the incompatible solutions facilitates the use of a single lumen for the administration of these solutions. When administering a SF between incompatible solutions it is important to know what minimal separator fluid volume (SFV) is required so that no relevant interaction takes place between the constituents of these solutions.

This volume must be sufficient to avoid mixing, but should not be excessive as patients may have a limited fluid intake regimen. The administration rate, drug solvent, choice of SF, and IV tubing volume may also be factors affecting the required SFV. – However, to our knowledge there is no literature on the requirements of flushing.

In this study we aimed to investigate whether and how the administration rate, drug solvent, choice of SF, its administration rate, and the IV tubing volume affects the SFV required for the safe separation of incompatible drug solutions. Please see Appendix 1 for a list of key-definitions.

Procedures

The day before surgery, potential subjects were informed of the study by a member of the study team. Upon agreement, they provided written informed consent and were randomized. Shortly after the induction of general anesthesia, the bladder was voided and the study fluid was initiated at a guideline-recommended rate of 27 mL per kg of body weight per day with a maximum of 100 mL per hour. The administration rate remained unchanged during surgery and in the ICU until the end of the study was reached as soon as any of the following situations occurred: the patient was discharged from the ICU, an adverse event occurred for which the treating physician decided the study treatment needed to be stopped, or the time reached 8 A.M. on the third postoperative day if the patient was still in the ICU. The detailed study outline is reported in Online Appendix. As the use of diuretics would render the interpretation of the primary and secondary endpoints impossible, clinicians were asked to use diuretics only in the case of clinically relevant fluid overload, to stop the study at that time and to report this as an adverse event. All adverse events were monitored closely. On the case report form, specific attention was given to predefined adverse events that could be related to the study treatment: clinical or radiographic occurrence of fluid overload, hyperkalemia > 5 mmol/L, and evolving hyponatremia < 130 mmol/L with or without symptoms. As the treatment of sodium and potassium disorders depends on the baseline value, the speed of increase or decrease and the clinical picture, the approach to electrolyte disorders and the (dis)continuation of the study treatment remained at the discretion of the treating clinicians.

During the entire treatment period, all urine was collected using a bladder catheter. Resuscitation fluids and blood products were administered at the discretion of the treating clinicians and were recorded. Oral fluid intake, perioperative blood loss and drain outputs were also assessed to calculate net cumulative fluid balance. Sodium (post hoc albumin-corrected, see Online Appendix), chloride, potassium, creatinine, albumin and aldosterone were sampled at fixed time points: at the start and the end of surgery, upon ICU admission, each morning and evening in the ICU, and at the end of the study. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was assessed later as an exploratory analysis. Body weight was not measured as this was deemed too error prone and influenced by weight loss due to reduced caloric intake.

### High dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)-expert consensus on best management practices-2014 [^111pgKrr]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Overall schedule and dose

Most centers continue to utilize the original empirically defined NCI schedule of one week on (cycle 1), one week off, one week on (cycle 2), defined as one "course" of treatment. The inter-cycle time may be extended by another week based upon patient recovery or site preference. The disease response, assessed at 6–12 weeks from therapy initiation, after a full course of therapy helps determine the value of administering another course. Any response is generally viewed as a reason to give another course. If stable disease is observed, delay of an additional 4–6 weeks or longer followed by reassessment may inform the decision for further dosing. Continued disease stability over months in a patient with clearly progressive disease before therapy is frequently, although not always, viewed as reason to continue treating. Of note, in one study, 90% of patients that achieved a response to treatment, did so after one course of IL-2. In light of these observations, decisions about additional courses of IL-2 should be individualized based on toxicity of prior therapy, extent of residual disease and availability of alternative treatment options. The interval between courses may vary considerably for a variety of other reasons including patient recovery and logistics. The standard dose of HD IL-2 remains 600,000 IU/kg (based on initial studies), although higher and lower approaches have been described in the literature -. The NCI and some sites use 720,000 IU/kg. For the most part, doses are given as a short bolus infusion (over 15 minutes) every 8 hours, over the course of 5 days. Toxicities generally occur over the 6 hours following a bolus dose, abating before the next scheduled dose. If recovery from the previous dose is not noted at 8 hours, some centers skip a dose and resume the 8 hour schedule. Some sites extend the time between doses to 12 hour intervals at this juncture. Individual dose reductions should not be used. Treatment extends for 5 days, stopping when the 14th planned dose would have been administered (end of day 5) regardless of the number of doses administered. Treatment is typically concluded earlier when adverse events occur that make further dosing intolerable, thus only a small minority of patients receive all 14 doses. The IL-2 treating physician will decide when to hold or stop dosing during a cycle based upon criteria to be discussed later in this paper. The current total mean number of doses administered is in the range of 16–20 of the 28 maximum doses in the two cycles of treatment.

### The half-life of infusion fluids: an educational review [^111tUZNy]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Distribution effects

The perceived wisdom is that infused crystalloids are fairly rapidly distributed throughout the extracellular fluid. This may not be true for all situations. Two recent studies suggest that distribution of small amounts of crystalloid fluid (≤ 5 mL kg −1) might be limited to only within the plasma volume. An explanation for this is that for such small volumes, the interstitial fluid matrix has too low a compliance to permit volume expansion. Larger volumes clearly open up the interstitium for volume expansion. Crystalloids flow almost freely across the capillary membrane, but the fine proteoglycan filaments in the interstitial matrix prevent fluid from flowing easily through the gel. The restriction of flow explains why crystalloid fluid has a distribution half-time of about 8 min, making equilibration complete in 25 to 30 min. This half-time is quite stable under variable physiological conditions, and a dramatic reduction only occurs in acute hypotension. A decrease in MAP of > 20% arrests the fluid distribution until a new Starling equilibrium is reached (Fig. 3 c).

The fact that crystalloids have a relatively slow distribution in this situation greatly improves their clinical efficacy. The fluids have a reasonably good plasma volume expanding effect as long as the infusion is continued, but this effect disappears within 30 min of the infusion being turned off (Fig. 4 a). Even though distribution is prolonged, the process still occurs too fast to be adequately illustrated by tracer methods.

### 2% lidocaine hci [^1156nAjx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Adults:

Single Direct Intravenous Injection (bolus): ONLY THE 5 mL, 50 MG or 100 MG DOSAGE SIZES should be used for direct intravenous injection. The usual dose is 50 to 100 mg of lidocaine hydrochloride (0.70 to 1.4 mg/kg; 0.32 to 0.63 mg/lb) administered intravenously under ECG monitoring. This dose may be administered at the rate of approximately 25 to 50 mg/min (0.35 to 0.70 mg/kg/min; 0.16 to 0.32 mg/lb/min). Sufficient time should be allowed to enable a slow circulation to carry the drug to the site of action. If the initial injection of 50 to 100 mg does not produce a desired response, a second dose may be injected after five minutes. NO MORE THAN 200 TO 300 MG OF LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED DURING A ONE HOUR PERIOD.

Continuous Intravenous Infusion: Following bolus administration, intravenous infusions of lidocaine hydrochloride may be initiated at the rate of 1 to 4 mg/min of lidocaine hydrochloride (0.014 to 0.057 mg/kg/min; 0.006 to 0.026 mg/lb/min). The rate of intravenous infusions should be reassessed as soon as the patient's basic cardiac rhythm appears to be stable or at the earliest signs of toxicity. It should rarely be necessary to continue intravenous infusions of lidocaine for prolonged periods.

When administering lidocaine hydrochloride (or any potent medication) by continuous intravenous infusion, it is advisable to use a precision volume control I.V. set.

Pediatric: Controlled clinical studies in the pediatric population to establish dosing schedules have not been conducted. The American Heart Association's Standards and Guidelines recommends a bolus dose of 1 mg/kg, and an infusion rate of between 20–50 mcg/kg/min for prolonged therapy. When drug clearance is reduced, as in patients with shock, congestive heart failure or cardiac arrest, the infusion rate should not exceed 20 mcg/kg/min.

NOTE: Regarding Prolonged Infusions: There are data that indicate the half-life may be 3 hours or longer following infusions of greater than 24 hours in duration. Do not use if solution is discolored or cloudy.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand.

### Saline flush after rocuronium bolus reduces onset time and prolongs duration of effect: a randomized clinical trial [^115XV6nt]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Circulatory factors modify the onset time of neuromuscular-blocking drugs. Therefore, we hypothesized that infusion of a saline flush immediately after rocuronium administration would shorten the onset time without influencing the duration of the rocuronium effect.

Methods

Forty-eight patients were randomly allocated to the control or saline flush group. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol and remifentanil, and all patients received 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium in 10 mL of normal saline. In the saline flush group, 20 mL normal saline was immediately infused after rocuronium administration. Neuromuscular blockade was assessed using acceleromyography at the adductor pollicis muscle with train-of-four (TOF) stimulation. The neuromuscular indices for rocuronium were calculated as follows: the latent onset time, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium infusion until first occurrence of depression of the first twitch of the TOF (T1) ≥ 5%; onset time, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium infusion until first occurrence of depression of the T1 ≥ 95%; clinical duration, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium administration until T1 recovered to 25% of the final T1 value; recovery index, defined as the time for recovery of T1 from 25% to 75% of the final T1 value; and the total recovery time, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium administration until reaching a TOF ratio of 0.9. Significance was designated at P < 0.05.

Results

The measured latent onset time and onset time were significantly shorter in the saline flush group than the control group by 15 seconds (95.2% confidence interval, 0–15, P = 0.007) and 15 seconds (0–30, P = 0.018), respectively. Saline flush significantly depressed the T1 height at 30, 45, and 60 seconds after the rocuronium bolus by 17%, 24%, and 14%, respectively. In addition, the recovery phase was significantly prolonged in the saline flush group. The mean clinical duration (5th-95th percentile range) in the saline flush group and control group was 35 minutes (27–63 minutes) and 31 minutes (19–48 minutes; P = 0.032), respectively; the recovery index was 13 minutes (8–25 minutes) and 10 minutes (7–19 minutes; P = 0.019), respectively; and the total recovery time was 61 minutes (44–108 minutes) and 50 minutes (35–93 minutes; P = 0.048), respectively.

Conclusions

Administering a 20-mL saline flush immediately after infusion of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium in 10 mL normal saline shortened the onset time and prolonged the recovery phase of neuromuscular blockade.

### AutoSyP: a low-cost, low-power syringe pump for use in low-resource settings [^114iLNB6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical evaluation protocol.

Evaluation of the clinical accuracy and usability of the device was carried out in a 2-phase clinical trial at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) in Blantyre, Malawi. The study protocol was approved by the National Health Science Research Committee of the Malawi Ministry of Health (protocol no. 1304) and the institutional review board at Rice University (protocol no. 14–150F). In the first phase, 10 trials were performed. Infusions of normal saline were administered to healthy adults at flow rates ranging from 3 to 60 mL/hour with a 10-, 20-, or 60-mL syringe. This initial study aimed to mimic pediatric infusions and validate the safety and accuracy of the device in a healthy, low-risk population.

In the second phase of the study, the accuracy and usability of AutoSyP was evaluated in its intended clinical setting with a target patient population. In this phase, 30 babies in the pediatric department at QECH who had been prescribed IV fluid infusions were enrolled in the study. Programmed flow rates and syringe sizes were based on clinician indication according to the specific needs of the patient. Three staff nurses were trained on AutoSyP use, clinical preparations, and study protocol and recruitment procedures. These nurses managed patient recruitment and consent, programmed infusion settings on the device, and prepared the IV lines and cannulas during the study. During the infusion, a nurse closely monitored the device and baby every hour for any infusion-related complications. In addition, trained technicians monitored the technical performance of the AutoSyP device every 30 minutes and intervened if there were any technical complications. If the device malfunctioned or an alarm was triggered, the technician recorded the event and solution on the patient's monitoring form to track device performance. If the subject's guardian, the nurse, or research technician indicated concern during the infusion, the treatment was discontinued and the subject received treatment as necessary using the standard IV drip system or a commercial syringe pump if it was available.

Data were logged using the serial monitor to track fluid dispensed, number of motor steps, and any triggered alarms. Percent errors were calculated for mean flow rate error. The mean flow rate equation for nonelectrically driven portable infusion devices (ISO-286020) and the logged data were used to calculate the average flow rate for each clinical infusion. The calculated mean flow rate was compared with the programmed flow rate to calculate the mean flow rate error.

### High dose interleukin-2 (aldesleukin)-expert consensus on best management practices-2014 [^113ZbMdZ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Some institutions have adopted schedules that continue to use the standard amount of IL-2 per dose but offer variations in dosing interval and number of dosing cycles. These approaches indicate that interest remains in optimizing IL-2 therapy in ways which maintain efficacy but improve the safety profile for patients. Little data exists on the dose response curve, however, the response rate between 600,000 or 720,000 IU/kg (HD) and 72,000 IU/kg (moderate dose) is significantly different.

Initial admission and management - standing orders (Additional file 1)

Most centers have a set of routine IL-2 orders that establish the basic procedural approach of the local IL-2 team. Although these vary considerably from site to site, they are strictly adhered to within a site, in order to maintain continuity among nursing shifts and facilitate clinical decision making. Standard protocols for maintaining intravenous access catheters, intravenous fluids, prophylactic-and as needed (PRN) medications for symptom control, monitoring parameters, and daily laboratory evaluations, guide the daily management of patients. Reactive management of expected complications, such as hypotension, decline in oxygen saturation, tachycardia, and alterations mental status should also be listed. Threshold values for various monitoring parameters should be listed which require contacting the physician. Standing order specifics are imbedded in Table 2. Additional file 1 provides an example of standing orders. These parameters take into consideration the standards in each clinical unit, the type of monitoring available and the philosophical approach of the team. The frequency of blood testing is usually once daily, with additional testing as needed and directed by the IL-2 physician. Patients are admitted to the hospital the evening before or the morning of the first IL-2 infusion. The most common dosing schedule is 8 AM, 4 AM and midnight often with the first dose being administered at 4 AM on day 1.

### Potassium chloride and sodium chloride (potassium chloride in sodium chloride) [^113uJZAW]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Important Administration Instructions
Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is intended for intravenous infusion using sterile equipment.
To avoid life threatening hyperkalemia, do not administer Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP as an intravenous push (i.e., intravenous injection manually with a syringe connected to the intravenous access) without a quantitative infusion device (see WARNINGS).
Do not connect flexible plastic containers in series in order to avoid air embolism due to possible residual air contained in the primary container.
Set the vent to the closed position on a vented intravenous administration set to prevent air embolism.
Use a dedicated line without any connections to avoid air embolism.
Do not pressurize intravenous solutions contained in flexible plastic containers to increase flow rates in order to avoid air embolism due to incomplete evacuation of residual air in the container.
The choice of a central or peripheral venous route of infusion should depend on the osmolarity of the final infusate. Solutions with osmolarity of greater than or equal to approximately 900 mOsm/L must be infused through a central catheter.
Prior to infusion, visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discoloration. The solution should be clear and there should be no precipitates. Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged.
Use of final filter is recommended during administration of all parenteral solutions, where possible.
Dosing Information
The choice of the specific potassium chloride and sodium chloride formulation, dosage, volume, rate and duration of administration is dependent upon the age, weight and clinical and metabolic condition of the patient and concomitant therapy, and administration should be determined by a physician experienced in intravenous fluid therapy.
Additional electrolyte supplementation may be indicated according to the clinical needs of the patient. Additives can be introduced to the container; however, some additives may be incompatible. Evaluate all additions to the plastic container for compatibility and stability of the resulting preparation. Consult with a pharmacist, if available.
If, in the informed judgment of the physician, it is deemed advisable to introduce additives, use aseptic technique. After addition, if there is a discoloration and/or the appearance of precipitates, insoluble complexes or crystals, do not use. Mix thoroughly when additives have been introduced. Do not store solutions containing additives. Discard any unused portion.
Rapid correction of hyponatremia and hypernatremia is potentially dangerous (risk of serious neurologic complications). To avoid complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) during administration, follow the important administration instructions, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

### Hypertonic saline (7.5%) decreases perioperative weight gain following cardiac surgery [^1121eKBq]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of 7.5% hypertonic saline (HS) and 0.9% normal saline (NS) on perioperative weight gain in cardiac surgical patients.

Design

Prospective, randomized study.

Setting

University teaching hospital.

Participants

Patients (n = 72) scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 7.5% HS (36 patients) or 0.9% NS (36 patients) as a single dose of 4 mL/kg over 30 minutes during the postoperative rewarming phase in the intensive care unit.

Measurements and Main Results

Weight gain until the first postoperative morning was significantly greater in the NS group than in the HS group (1.9 plus minus 1.4 kg, median, 2.1 kg; 0.8 plus minus 1.5 kg, median, 0.8 kg; p = 0.005). One-hour diuresis after the fluid infusion was significantly greater in the HS group compared with the NS group (501 plus minus 282 mL and 237 plus minus 173 mL; p < 0.001). In the linear regression model, the 2 most important factors affecting the perioperative weight gain were the volume of fluid infused postoperatively in the intensive care unit (4,098 plus minus 916 mL in the HS group and 4,589 plus minus 1,344 mL in the NS group) and the total diuresis after surgery (3,351 plus minus 1,035 mL in the HS group and 2,942 plus minus 846 mL in the NS group).

Conclusions

HS had an intense diuretic effect, which reduced intraoperative fluid retention. This effect was confirmed by the lesser increase in body weight measured on the first postoperative morning.

### Intravascular volume therapy in adults: guidelines from the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany [^115vVjuM]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

A4: Guideline objectives

Overall, the Guideline aims to improve the quality of volume therapy in peri-interventional or critically ill adult inpatients. The best volume therapy should include a correct indication (diagnosis of volume depletion), correct dosage (volume therapy management) and the selection of the infusion solution best suited to the patient. There are competing concepts for each of these three areas. By promoting effective, correctly dosed, efficient and evidence-based volume therapy with the best benefit to risk balance, the Guideline aims to secure the best treatment of volume depletion in adult patients treated in medical units throughout all levels of the healthcare system.

The Guideline's recommendations are intended to further improve the quality of hospitals' structures and procedures, and help improve the quality of results. For this reason, the Guideline can and should be used in acute treatment situations, and in discussions about local protocols, in quality assurance and any other appropriate forum.

Since the Guideline authors wish to stimulate discussion about volume therapy, criticism and proposals for improvement are expressly requested. Ideally, recommended amendments should be concisely summarised, substantiated with references, and forwarded to the publisher.

The Guideline does not concern itself with the topic of infusion therapy for patients without volume depletion (as part of parenteral feeding and the correction of electrolyte or acid-base imbalances, or infusions used as carrier solutions for drug delivery). Nor does it concern itself with blood product therapy; here, the Guideline Group refers the reader to the appropriate cross-sectional Guideline from the German Medical Association.

A5: Target user group

The Guideline is addressed primarily to healthcare professionals who are familiar with one or more aspects of intravascular volume therapy for inpatients (diagnostics, choice of solution and therapy management). Such professionals will generally be physicians and nursing staff.

The Guideline also addresses individuals wishing to learn about evidence-based intravascular volume therapy for adult inpatients. This group includes members of other medical professions as well as patients and their families.

Table 3
Flow rates associated with intravenous infusion pumps

While Table 2 presents a guide for the volume of various catheters, Hickman catheters are often cut to patient length and may have a different volume than anticipated. Measuring the cut catheter volume with saline prior to insertion can provide the volume of the catheter in this instance. While several centers have a policy of priming 0.75 mL medication from a computerized ambulatory drug delivery (CADD) Legacy pump (Smiths Medical, St Paul, MN, USA) into the new catheter before rapid sequence transfer of medication (personal communication with other pulmonary hypertension practitioners and specialty pharmacies), this does not account well for the above variables. If a treprostinil infusion is transitioned from a Hickman catheter to a peripherally inserted central catheter line, a nontunneled central venous catheter, or a peripheral intravenous catheter, then a rapid transition without priming is usually well tolerated, as the medication will be delivered systemically prior to a half-life elimination. This is contrasted with a transition from a peripherally inserted central catheter line to a single lumen Hickman catheter. Because of the large catheter volume of the Hickman catheter, the time from initiation of infusion to systemic delivery could be as long as 90 hours (for a slowly infusing treprostinil infusion from a CADD-MS3 pump (Smiths Medical)), much longer than the 4.5-hour half-life of the medication. Similarly, a patient receiving intravenous therapy (epoprostenol or treprostinil) from a CADD Legacy pump could have a delay from initiation to systemic delivery of 1 to 2 hours, much longer than the half-life of 3 to 6 minutes. In both examples, consideration must be given to either overlapping the infusions or priming the new catheter with medication, so that excessive time without medication can be avoided. Of these two options, we prefer overlapping medication, because this will prevent the potentially ill-effects of inadvertent drug bolus administration while priming the new line (in our experience, even a bolus of one-half the catheter volume instilled over 5 to 10 minutes can lead to symptoms of prostacyclin toxicity). We believe that symptoms of prostacyclin excess can occur with catheter priming due to rapid instillation of product into the catheter causing unintended transference of medication systemically.

### User-testing guidelines to improve the safety of intravenous medicines administration: a randomised in situ simulation study [^116mEefF]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first to investigate whether user-testing of guidelines results in safer medication administration. There was no significant difference in the frequency of moderate-severe medication errors. However, use of user-tested guidelines more than doubled the probability of avoiding an IMG-related error during preparation and administration of an intravenous medicine on hospital wards. The procedure was also completed faster with user-tested guidelines, as participants were able to locate the information they required more quickly. Nurses felt more confident about their decisions when using user-tested guidelines and preferred them to the original version.

The guideline revisions likely to have contributed to the reduced frequency of errors after user-testing can be identified by considering the error types with the largest reduction (table 2). These include dose and rate discrepancies (including administration by short injection rather than infusion), suggesting that the improved support for dose, rate and dilution calculations in the user-tested guidelines (eg, equations and tables)at least partially contributed to safer and faster preparation and administration of the medicine. This is consistent with the findings of our previous study, where dose and rate calculation problems occurred more often with the current guidelines than with the user-tested guidelines. A common calculation error with the current guidelines was not accounting for displacement volume when measuring the volume of drug solution containing the prescribed dose. The user-tested guidelines helped prevent this error by providing an equation for this calculation. A common rate discrepancy with the current guidelines was to administer the infusion over 1 hour. The instructions stated 'give over 1–3 hours (maximum rate 3 mg/kg/hour)', and some participants used the first time listed (1 hour) rather than calculating the maximum infusion rate based on the second part of this instruction (3 mg/kg/hour = 2 hours). The user-tested guidelines did not present this range of infusion times (which was only applicable to some doses) and instead provided a table of infusion lengths and an equation to support the calculation, thus preventing this error. This suggests that guideline authors should provide equations and tables to support health professionals making calculations. However, as different ways of presenting information may be successful in different contexts, the safety improvements suggested by this study will be best achieved through user-testing.

### Distribution of normal saline and 5% albumin infusions in cardiac surgical patients [^114UffLt]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relative distribution of fluid within the extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) and the effect on oxygen delivery after infusing either normal saline or 5% albumin in cardiac surgical patients.

Design

Prospective, randomized, unblinded, interventional study.

Setting

Cardiac surgical intensive care unit in a 450-bed teaching hospital.

Patients

Postoperative cardiac surgical patients (n = 40).

Interventions

Infusion of either normal saline or 5% albumin to a hemodynamic end point determined by the patient's clinician.

Measurements and Main Results

Plasma volume (PV), ECFV, cardiac index, and arterial oxygen content were measured immediately before (baseline) and after each fluid infusion. PV and ECFV were measured by dilution of (131)I-albumin and [(35)S]sodium sulfate, respectively. Interstitial fluid volume (ISFV) was calculated as ECFV - PV. Baseline values for PV, ISFV, ECFV, and oxygen delivery index did not differ between treatment groups. Infusion of normal saline and 5% albumin increased PV by 9 ± 23% and 52 ± 84% of the volume infused, respectively (p < .05), whereas there was no significant difference between saline and albumin in the change in ISFV per volume infused. Only 5% albumin significantly increased cardiac index, although oxygen delivery did not change significantly after either infusion.

Conclusions

In postoperative cardiac surgical patients, infusion of 5% albumin is approximately five times as efficient as a PV expander but has comparable effects on changes in ISFV and oxygen delivery relative to normal saline.

### Weight loss, saline loading, and the natriuretic peptide system [^114FqKnr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Sample

A study research coordinator screened charts for eligibility from a pool of patients who were referred to the weight center of the Massachusetts General Hospital for Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass surgery. Eligible patients were informed about the details of the research protocol, including the need for 2 saline infusion visits at the Clinical Research Center (CRC) 6 months apart. A study physician investigator verified the medical history of study participants including the use of medications at the time of the saline protocol visit. The subjects were asked to keep a detailed diary of all the food and beverages consumed for the 48 hours prior to each study visit to estimate their nutritional status.

Subjects were excluded if they had any of the following: history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, or left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction < 50%, greater than mild valvular stenosis or regurgitation or any regional wall motion abnormalities by cardiac imaging, chronic renal failure or serum creatinine ≥ 3.0 mg/dL, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus requiring insulin therapy, systolic blood pressure ≥ 170 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg at the most recent weight center visit, a history of current loop or thiazide diuretic use, a history of obstructive lung disease, or thyroid dysfunction. Female subjects who were pregnant or planned to become pregnant within 6 months were also excluded. The Partners Human Research Committee approved the protocol. All subjects provided informed consent.

Saline Protocol

Eligible study subjects were admitted after overnight fasting for an outpatient visit at the MGH CRC. Upon admission, two intravenous catheters were placed for phlebotomy and 10 mL/m² of body‐surface area (BSA)/minute normal saline (0.9 mEq/mL) was infused over 2 hours. Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were measured every 20 minutes during the saline infusion. BSA was calculated according to the DuBois algorithm (BSA (m²) = 0.20247 × height(m)⁰.⁷²⁵ × weight(kg)⁰.⁴²⁵). Venous blood was sampled beginning immediately prior to the start of the infusion and at 40, 80, 120, and 180 minutes after the start of the infusion.

The study subjects were brought back to the MGH CRC 6 months after gastric bypass surgery and underwent an identical saline infusion protocol. Subjects were excluded from completing the second saline challenge protocol if they had developed complications of gastric bypass surgery including significant peri‐operative complications (myocardial infarction, persistent atrial fibrillation, sepsis, or gastrointestinal bleeding requiring blood transfusion > 2 units).

### A.S.P.E.N. parenteral nutrition safety consensus recommendations [^112Gu2EY]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

A.S.P.E.N. parenteral nutrition safety — infusion practices and cycling states PN infusions "should be administered according to the prescribed rate via an infusion pump", and nurses "shall verify the correct rate when the PN infusion is initiated, at regular intervals during the infusion, and at handoffs". In acute care, PN is "commonly infused continuously over 24 hours", but a cycled schedule to "10 to 14 hours (based on patient tolerance) can offer physiologic and psychological benefits" in selected circumstances. Transition "typically takes place by reducing the infusion time by 4 to 6 hours each day", though "cycling PN to 12 hours can be accomplished in one step". Because of a "high incidence of adverse events associated with PN cycling", the text underscores "the importance of close patient monitoring during the transition to cycled PN", and notes that "Hyperglycemia, edema, or symptoms of fluid intolerance signal the need for a more cautious approach to cyclic infusion".

### Effects of intravenous infusion of lidocaine and dexmedetomidine on inhibiting cough during the tracheal extubation period after thyroid surgery [^113fMxNu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Study protocol

All surgeries were performed by three experienced surgeons. All patients received intramuscular hyoscine (0.3 mg) 30 min before the induction of anesthesia. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG) and peripheral pulse oximeter (SPO₂) values were monitored by using a multiparameter monitor (Philips MIX500, Boeblingen, Germany). In the LIDO group, the patients were given an IV bolus infusion of lidocaine (2%)1.5 mg/kg made to 20 mL with normal saline and 20 mL normal saline respectively, over 10 min before induction of anesthesia, followed by a continuous IV infusion of lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg made up to 20 mL and 20 mL normal saline every hour until 30 min before the end of surgery, respectively. In the DEX group, patients were given IV bolus infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.5 μg/kg made to 20 mL with normal saline and 20 mL normal saline respectively, over 10 min before induction of anesthesia, followed by a continuous IV infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.4 μg/kg made up to 20 mL and 20 mL normal saline every hour until 30 min before the end of surgery, respectively. In the CON group, the patients were given an 20 mL normal saline and 20 mL normal saline respectively, over 10 min before induction of anesthesia, followed by a continuous IV infusion 20 mL normal saline and 20 mL normal saline every hour until 30 min before the end of surgery, respectively. General anesthesia was induced with midazolam (0.05 mg/kg), propofol (2 mg/kg), sufentanil (0.5 μg/kg) and vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg), and anesthesia was maintained with propofol (50–80 μg/kg/min) and remifentanil (0.15–0.2 μg/kg/min). Tracheal intubation was performed after adequate muscle relaxation. All of the patients were ventilated with an Aspire view anesthetic machine (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI, USA). In the three groups, the tidal volume (VT) was maintained at 8 ml/kg, the respiratory rate (RR) was fixed at 12 breaths/min, the inspiratory to expiratory time ratio (I: E) was 1:2 and the inspired oxygen fraction (FiO 2) was 0.5 (balanced with air) throughout the anesthesia period. To maintain a controlled ventilation, vecuronium was intermittently used for muscle relaxation. The depth of anesthesia was maintained with an infusion rate of propofol and remifentanil, according to the Bispectral Index values (BIS) and the hemodynamic parameters within 20% of the baseline. To prevent the occurrence of intraoperative awareness, the BIS values were kept between 45 and 60 in the three groups during surgery. Neuromuscular blocks were reversed with atropine (0.5 mg) and neostigmine (1 mg) before the tracheal extubation. Experienced surgeons preserved the anatomical integrity of motor nerves by visual identification and exposure both of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve was prevented injury by intraoperative neuromonitoring during thyroid surgery. After the tracheal extubation, all of the patients were transferred to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU).

### Perioperative administration of buffered versus non-buffered crystalloid intravenous fluid to improve outcomes following adult surgical procedures [^112SAEXh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative fluid strategies influence clinical outcomes following major surgery. Many intravenous fluid preparations are based on simple solutions, such as normal saline, that feature an electrolyte composition that differs from that of physiological plasma. Buffered fluids have a theoretical advantage of containing a substrate that acts to maintain the body's acid-base status - typically a bicarbonate or a bicarbonate precursor such as maleate, gluconate, lactate, or acetate. Buffered fluids also provide additional electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and calcium, more closely matching the electrolyte balance of plasma. The putative benefits of buffered fluids have been compared with those of non-buffered fluids in the context of clinical studies conducted during the perioperative period. This review was published in 2012, and was updated in 2017.

Objectives

To review effects of perioperative intravenous administration of buffered versus non-buffered fluids for plasma volume expansion or maintenance, or both, on clinical outcomes in adults undergoing all types of surgery.

Search Methods

We electronically searched the Clinicaltrials.gov major trials registry, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to June 2016), Embase (1980 to June 2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to June 2016). We handsearched conference abstracts and, when possible, contacted leaders in the field. We reran the search in May 2017. We added one potential new study of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate this trial into formal review findings when we prepare the review update.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials that compared buffered versus non-buffered intravenous fluids for surgical patients were eligible for inclusion. We excluded other forms of comparison such as crystalloids versus colloids and colloids versus different colloids.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus, in collaboration with a third review author. We contacted trial authors to request additional information when appropriate. We presented pooled estimates for dichotomous outcomes as odds ratios (ORs) and for continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed data via Review Manager 5.3 using fixed-effect models, and when heterogeneity was high (I² > 40%), we used random-effects models.

Main Results

This review includes, in total, 19 publications of 18 randomized controlled trials with a total of 1096 participants. We incorporated five of those 19 studies (330 participants) after the June 2016 update. Outcome measures in the included studies were thematically similar, covering perioperative electrolyte status, renal function, and acid-base status; however, we found significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity among the included studies. We identified variable protocols for fluid administration and total volumes of fluid administered to patients intraoperatively. Trial authors variably reported outcome data at disparate time points and with heterogeneous patient groups. Consequently, many outcome measures are reported in small group sizes, reducing overall confidence in effect size, despite relatively low inherent bias in the included studies. Several studies reported orphan outcome measures. We did not include in the results of this review one large, ongoing study of saline versus Ringer's solution. We found insufficient evidence on effects of fluid therapies on mortality and postoperative organ dysfunction (defined as renal insufficiency leading to renal replacement therapy); confidence intervals were wide and included both clinically relevant benefit and harm: mortality (Peto OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.37 to 9.33; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 6 deaths, 276 participants; low-quality evidence); renal insufficiency (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.98; I² = 0%; 4 trials, 22 events, 276 participants; low-quality evidence). We noted several metabolic differences, including a difference in postoperative pH measured at end of surgery of 0.05 units - lower in the non-buffered fluid group (12 studies with a total of 720 participants; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.07; I² = 61%). However, this difference was not maintained on postoperative day one. We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate. We observed a higher postoperative serum chloride level immediately after operation, with use of non-buffered fluids reported in 10 studies with a total of 530 participants (MD 6.77 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.38 to 10.17), and this difference persisted until day one postoperatively (five studies with a total of 258 participants; MD 8.48 mmol/L, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.88). We rated the quality of evidence for this outcome as moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence is insufficient to show effects of perioperative administration of buffered versus non-buffered crystalloid fluids on mortality and organ system function in adult patients following surgery. Benefits of buffered fluid were measurable in biochemical terms, particularly a significant reduction in postoperative hyperchloraemia and metabolic acidosis. Small effect sizes for biochemical outcomes and lack of correlated clinical follow-up data mean that robust conclusions on major morbidity and mortality associated with buffered versus non-buffered perioperative fluid choices are still lacking. Larger studies are needed to assess these relevant clinical outcomes.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^115KUzaA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Ongoing fluid administration — assessment‑driven resuscitation for suspected sepsis specifies that fluid administration after an initial bolus should be based on serial assessments of the patient and response to therapy. No singular assessment approach is superior, and we recommend using multiple assessments at multiple time intervals; if using a quantitative resuscitation approach, we recommend dynamic measures over static measures. Up to 50% of patients with septic shock fail to increase cardiac output in response to fluid administration and, when fluid loading does increase cardiac output, the response is often transient; all patients with ongoing hypotension or elevated lactate levels after initial fluid resuscitation need repeated hemodynamic assessment. Because no specific method of hemodynamic assessment is clearly superior in altering survival, we present 2 approaches — a clinical evaluation with basic techniques widely available in emergency care settings and a quantitative evaluation using more advanced assessment methods — and both are reasonable for monitoring and serial assessment; using either method, sepsis assessment should iteratively use multiple parameters to guide therapy. Patients who improve with the initial bolus of fluid are candidates for subsequent fluid boluses using aliquots such as 500 to 1,000 mL, followed by repeat serial clinical examinations to evaluate response and volume overload.

### Continuous controlled-infusion of hypertonic saline solution in traumatic brain-injured patients: a 9-year retrospective study [^116PgAKu]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Dose adaptation of a continuous HSS

To limit the risk of fluid overload observed with other saline solutions, we used a 20% chloride sodium solution infusion (adapted from; see Figure 1 and Addition File 1 for an example). Dose-adaptation of HSS infusion was performed by nurses according to an algorithm (Figure 1). Biologic monitoring (blood and urinary electrolyte concentrations, osmolarity) was performed every 4 hours. For calculation, three situations were available:

1. On infusion initiation or when natremia was below the target, a bolus of chloride sodium was administered. The dose of sodium was calculated according to the natremia measured in the previous 12 hours (natremia below the target, Figure 1). Considering that a bolus of chloride sodium only fills the extracellular fluid compartment (one fourth of the body weight), the required volume of NaCl 20% was calculated as follows:

The bolus was administered in 1 hour.

2. When the target of natremia was reached, the flow of continuous infusion of HSS (NaCl 20%) was adapted to the urinary excretion of sodium, and the extraurinary sodium loss was neglected. The flow of NaCl 20% was calculated as follows:

3. When the natremia was above the target, the infusion of NaCl (20%) was discontinued for 1 hour. Then the continuous infusion of NaCl was resumed for the remaining 3 hours.

A polyuria has been described with the intravenous infusion of HSS. In an attempt to prevent severe dehydration, a compensation of the volume loss due to excessive diuresis should be performed. Replacement for volume loss was performed in 1 hour when diuresis exceed 120 ml/h (corresponding to basal hydration excluding HSS infusion) with a solution composed as follows: 1,000 mL Glucose (2.5%) + NaCl (natriuresis/17) grams + KCl (kaliuresis/13) g.

Definitions

Local normal ranges for natremia were 137 to 145 mmol/L. Acute kidney injury was defined by a 200% increase in serum creatinine concentration as compared with a previous assessment of renal function. Severe central pontine myelinolysis was considered if clinical symptoms (prolonged alteration of consciousness, quadriplegia, and dysarthria) were associated with the appearance of a central pons lesion on magnetic resonance imaging.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^1178zu3L]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Supplementary treatment was left to the discretion of the treating physician. All patients took angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and nitrates. No thiazide diuretics, nesiritide, or arginine vasopressin antagonists were administered during the hospitalization period. Hypertonic saline solution was administered to the patients who developed hyponatremia (serum Na values < 128 mEq/L) during treatment with the goal of restoring plasma sodium values up to 134 mEq/L. For this reason Na concentration was monitored each day during the infusion period. The hypertonic saline solution consisted of 20 mEq of NaCl in 500 mL saline solutions (0.9% of NaCl). Infusion was administered at 80 cc/h once or twice a day, depending on the Na value. Dopamine infusions were administered to patients with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg with the goal of restoring systolic values up to 100 mmHg maintaining diuretic infusion. Inotrope therapy was stopped when blood pressure values were sustained at approximately 105 mmHg during 12 sequential hours for four consecutive measurements.

The frequency of laboratory tests to evaluate electrolyte balance and renal function during hospitalization was at the discretion of the attending physician but was guided by a dose-escalation algorithm. This trial was approved by our hospital's Institutional Review Board of Siena and all patients gave their signed informed consent. This trial was registered and regularly updated in ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier number: NCT01441245.

Inclusion criteria

Patients over age 18 years of age were screened if they met diagnostic criteria for ADHF due to systolic dysfunction and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45% by exhibiting at least one of the following symptoms at rest: dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema or major fatigue and at least two clinical signs including rales, pulmonary congestion on chest radiography, jugular vein dilatation, or a third heart sound. Elevations in blood BNP > 400 pg/mL were considered supportive for a diagnosis of ADHF.

Exclusion criteria

Patients were excluded if they had received more than two IV doses of furosemide or any continuous infusion of furosemide one month before randomization, if they had end-stage renal disease or the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or ultrafiltration), isolated diastolic dysfunction with LVEF > 45% or recent myocardial infarction within thirty days of screening. Patients with a systolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg or with serum creatinine levels > 4.0 mg/dL were also excluded, as well as patients who received recent intravenous iodinated contrast.

### Out of hours intravenous fluid therapy: a prompt to guide prescribing [^115A2m2G]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Recent NICE guidance has highlighted the importance of appropriate and safe intravenous fluid use. We aimed to improve the quality of out of hours fluid prescription in a Bristol hospital by ensuring that indications and cautions for fluid therapy were clearly documented at the time of initiation. Time-pressured on-call doctors need quick access to information regarding patients' care. A documented "fluid plan" allows doctors to undertake a more informed assessment of the patient's fluid balance, leading to safer prescriptions. Our ideal was for 100% of out of hours intravenous fluid prescriptions to be appropriate. Our process measures included the proportion of patients on intravenous fluids who had a documented fluid plan in the medical notes or on the prescription chart on Friday, prior to the weekend on call period. This was defined as mention of indications and/or cautions to fluid therapy. The introduction of a sticker to prompt fluid plan documentation did marginally improve use of fluid plans. It was notable that 96% of these were followed where plans were documented (n = 23). Initiation of IV fluid with an accompanying plan is likely to make subsequent fluid prescriptions safer. Rapid turnover of staff and stationary proved significant barriers to consistent implementation of the sticker. Despite these challenges we demonstrated a "proof of concept", suggesting system modification to include fluid plans is safe and effective.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^112NAXVM]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

ASPEN Safe Practices — measuring and ensuring accurate enteral nutrition (EN) volume infused provides recommendations and supporting rationale. Recommendations state: "Do not rely on pump rate and volume settings alone to determining the amount of feeding infused", "Document the volume of EN and other fluid administered and investigate when suboptimal nutrition and fluid seems to have been delivered", "Monitor nutrition and fluid trends, including any gaps in delivery", and "Implement methods to ensure that adequate nutrition is being administered for patients who continue EN after they transition from acute care to another setting". Ordering should be tailored to accuracy: "Consider volume-based feeding schedules where a specific volume is to be infused in a 24-hour period" and "Use an easily measurable volume, such as one or two 1-liter containers/d or 2 cartons (cups) of feeding per EN 'meal', in orders for EN in the home care setting". Oversight is reinforced: "Institute systems to embed accountability and oversight for accurate delivery of nutrition intake, including methods of ordering and documenting actual intake. Have policies and procedures to determine whether systems are suboptimal or break down, and use system improvement methods to address problems", and "Encourage use of electronic connectivity between the enteral pump and the intake portion of the EHR to document EN volume infused". Rationale notes that "Volume-based ordering has been recommended over rate-based ordering for more accurate EN delivery", that unresolved discrepancies can leave "why 100 mL of EN remains after an overnight infusion", that specificity can improve accountability such as "2 cartons/cans/cups of feeding 3 times per day or one 1000-mL container per night", and that pump performance contributes to underdelivery since "Deficits of 0.5%-21% have been observed".

### Improving the frequency of visual infusion phlebitis (VIP) scoring on an oncology ward [^112aygAw]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Healthcare workers insert peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheters every day into the majority of patients who are admitted to an acute care facility. It is estimated that 150 million PIV catheters are inserted annually in the United States, with an increasing use of medication therapy that is toxic to the veins. Early studies found that 25%–70% of all the patients receiving PIV therapy developed infusion-related phlebitis, defined as the inflammation of a vein, with an acceptable rate of phlebitis at 5% [5] Infusion-related phlebitis may develop while the intravenous catheter is in situ and up to 96 hours after the intravenous catheter is removed.

Conclusive comparison of PIV phlebitis rates as measured by visual assessment of the PIV site is dependent on the usage of a valid and reliable phlebitis scale. The visual infusion phlebitis (VIP) scale, a modified version of the original Maddox scale[15], was developed to numerically rate phlebitis based on observable symptoms [16] This scale recommends a specific action for each numeric rating. Standardized use of this scale can eliminate dwell time as the predominant variable for changing peripheral PIV sites.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^115rp3Xo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Ofatumumab (Arzerra) [^112LCayV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Infusion Rate Dose Modification for Infusion Reactions

Interrupt infusion for infusion reactions of any severity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Treatment can be resumed at the discretion of the treating physician. The following infusion rate modifications can be used as a guide.
If the infusion reaction resolves or remains less than or equal to Grade 2, resume infusion with the following modifications according to the initial Grade of the infusion reaction.
Grade 1 or 2: Infuse at one‑half of the previous infusion rate.
Grade 3 or 4: Infuse at a rate of 12 mL/hour.
After resuming the infusion, the infusion rate may be increased according to Tables 1 and 2 above, based on patient tolerance.
Consider permanent discontinuation of ARZERRA if the severity of the infusion reaction does not resolve to less than or equal to Grade 2 despite adequate clinical intervention.
Permanently discontinue therapy for patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction to ARZERRA.

2.4 Premedication

Patients should receive all of the following premedication agents 30 minutes to 2 hours prior to each infusion of ARZERRA. See Table 3 for pre-medication schedule prior to each infusion.

### Central venous access device management for children undergoing treatment for blood disorders and cancer: a descriptive international cross-sectional survey [^113JYNJx]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Routine practices, such as frequency of dressing change, totally implanted venous access device needle change, and flushing and locking solutions, are similar across different income levels, which indicates consistency or coherence to current evidence practice. However, the frequency of CVAD site assessment during infusion was reported differently. Clinicians in high-income countries reported assessing CVAD sites hourly, whereas in middle-income countries, assessments were conducted every shift during infusion. This variation may reflect differences in staffing levels, resource availability, or local interpretations of best practices, highlighting the need for globally applicable yet contextually sensitive guidelines. Both income-level countries reported normal saline as the most used for flushing and heparin as the most frequent solution for locking. The recent network meta-analysis found that chelating agents (such as taurolidine-citrate) and antibiotic locks were associated with lower odds of CVAD-associated bloodstream infections compared to heparinized saline. However, this survey indicates that these advanced locking solutions are not widely adopted. When the patient is discharged, the CVAD is locked weekly for PICC, tunneled non-cuffed, and tunneled cuffed, and totally implanted venous access device (port) were only locked 4 to 6 weekly. The responses broadly align with CNSA guideline. However, the guideline on lock frequency was primarily based on low-level evidence, including surveys, retrospective studies, small prospective studies, and expert opinion, highlighting the need for more robust research in this area. Concerningly, a third of responses reported unknown locking practices for long-term devices after discharge, indicating a significant knowledge gap in outpatient CVAD management.

Our findings emphasize the critical lack of evidence-based practice guidelines for CVAD management in pediatric oncology. This gap may be attributed not only to the limited number of studies, particularly randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but also to the lack of high-quality evidence specifically tailored to the pediatric cancer population and reflective of different global resource levels, which is necessary to generate context-specific evidence.

Future guidelines could incorporate tiered recommendations that provide options based on available resources, allowing healthcare providers to implement the best possible practices within their constraints. This approach has been successfully implemented in middle-areas of global health and could benefit CVAD practices in pediatric oncology. By fostering research capacity and collaboration in resource-limited settings, we can develop more inclusive, applicable, and effective guidelines that address the unique challenges and opportunities in these contexts.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^1116eKHF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Oxaliplatin — twelve-step desensitization protocol specifies three solutions and stepwise infusion parameters culminating in a cumulative dose of 500.0000 mg. Solution 1 is 250 mL of 0.020 mg/mL (5.000 mg per bag), Solution 2 is 250 mL of 0.200 mg/mL (50.000 mg per bag), and Solution 3 is 250 mL of 1.984 mg/mL (496.065 mg per bag). Step 1 uses Solution 1 at 2.0 mL/h for 15 min to infuse 0.50 mL delivering 0.0100 mg (cumulative 0.0100 mg), and step 12 uses Solution 3 at 80.0 mL/h for 174.375 min to infuse 232.50 mL delivering 461.3405 mg (cumulative 500.0000 mg). Total time is 339.375 min (5.66 h), and the table notes the total volume and dose dispensed are more than the final dose given to patient because many of the solutions are not completely infused.

### Patient controlled analgesia for vaso-occlusive episodes in children: a retrospective study [^114qiLvG]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) administration in pediatric patients admitted with sickle cell vaso-occlusive episode (VOE).

Methods

This single-center retrospective study included all inpatient hematology admissions for VOE between 2014 and 2020. PCA-ratio was calculated as the ratio of bolus over continuous IV opioids dose, and time to PCA adjustment as time between first PCA order and a subsequent order that increased dosing or changed opioid medication.

Results

A total of 866 encounters (172 unique patients) with PCA for VOE were included. The mean age was 15.4 years old (SD = 5.0). On average, after admission (hospital arrival), the first opioid dose was given at 1 hour, PCA started at 3.5 hours, and mean length of stay was 4.3 days (SD = 2.5). The mean initial PCA-ratio was 1.7 (SD = 0.6). There were no significant associations between age, gender, initial pain score, or admission hemoglobin and PCA-ratio (linear regression model P = 0.443). In 24.7% of encounters, the PCA was adjusted within 6 hours. After adjusting by age and gender, lower admission pain scores (OR = 1.15, P = 0.004), lower PCA-ratio (OR = 2.1, P = 0.003), longer time to PCA start (OR = 1.2, P = 0.001), and no adjuvant ketamine (OR = 2.4, P < 0.001) were associated with PCA unadjusted within 6 hours.

Conclusion

At our institution, patients with VOE received opioids and PCA within the first hours of admission. PCAs were started at a ratio of 1.5–1.8, considered normal continuous. While no specific PCA-ratio was clearly superior for pain control, lower ratios (high continuous infusion) were associated with not requiring PCA adjustments at 6 hours. Prospective studies are needed.

Acute heart failure (AHF) is new onset of, or a sudden worsening of, chronic heart failure characterised by congestion in about 95% of cases or end-organ hypoperfusion in 5% of cases. Treatment often requires urgent escalation of diuretic therapy, mainly through hospitalisation. This Cochrane review evaluated the efficacy of intravenous loop diuretics strategies in treating AHF in individuals with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification III or IV and fluid overload.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intravenous continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for the initial treatment of acute heart failure in adults.

Search Methods

We identified trials through systematic searches of bibliographic databases and in clinical trials registers including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CPCI-S on the Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry platform (ICTRP), and the European Union Trials register. We conducted reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. The latest search was performed on 29 February 2024.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with AHF, NYHA classification III or IV, regardless of aetiology or ejection fraction, where trials compared intravenous continuous infusion of loop diuretics with intermittent bolus injection in AHF. We excluded trials with chronic stable heart failure, cardiogenic shock, renal artery stenosis, or end-stage renal disease. Additionally, we excluded studies combining loop diuretics with hypertonic saline, inotropes, vasoactive medications, or renal replacement therapy and trials where diuretic dosing was protocol-driven to achieve a target urine output, due to confounding factors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened papers for inclusion and reviewed full-texts. Outcomes included weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission following discharge, and occurrence of acute kidney injury. We performed risk of bias assessment and meta-analysis where data permitted and assessed certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

The review included seven RCTs, spanning 32 hospitals in seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. Data collection ranged from eight months to six years. Following exclusion of participants in subgroups with confounding treatments and different clinical settings, 681 participants were eligible for review. These additional study characteristics, coupled with our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, improve the applicability of the body of the evidence as they reflect real-world clinical practice. Meta-analysis was feasible for net weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission, and acute kidney injury. Literature review and narrative analysis explored daily fluid balance; cardiovascular mortality; B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) change; N-terminal-proBNP change; and adverse incidents such as ototoxicity, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances. Risk of bias assessment revealed two studies with low overall risk, four with some concerns, and one with high risk. All sensitivity analyses excluded trials at high risk of bias. Only narrative analysis was conducted for 'daily fluid balance' due to diverse data presentation methods across two studies (169 participants, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect). Results of narrative analysis varied. For instance, one study reported higher daily fluid balance within the first 24 hours in the continuous infusion group compared to the bolus injection group, whereas there was no difference in fluid balance beyond this time point. Continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics may result in mean net weight loss of 0.86 kg more than bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 0.86 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.28; 5 trials, 497 participants; P < 0.001, I² = 21%; very low-certainty evidence). Importantly, sensitivity analysis excluding trials with high risk of bias showed there was insufficient evidence for a difference in bodyweight loss between groups (MD 0.70 kg, 95% CI -0.06 to 1.46; 3 trials, 378 participants; P = 0.07, I² = 0%). There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality between continuous infusion and bolus injection (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.90; 5 trials, 530 participants; P = 0.19, I² = 4%; low-certainty evidence). Despite sensitivity analysis, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. No trials measured cardiovascular mortality. There may be little to no difference in the length of hospital stay between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -1.10 days, 95% CI -4.84 to 2.64; 4 trials, 211 participants; P = 0.57, I² = 88%; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis improved heterogeneity; however, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. There may be little to no difference in the readmission to hospital between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16; 3 trials, 400 participants; P = 0.31, I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show insufficient evidence for a difference in the readmission to hospital between groups. There may be little to no difference in the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse event between continuous infusion and bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.49; 3 trials, 491 participants; P = 0.92, I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show that continuous infusion may make little to no difference on the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse events compared to the bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics.

Authors' Conclusions

Analysis of available data comparing two delivery methods of diuretics in acute heart failure found that the current data are insufficient to show superiority of one strategy intervention over the other. Our findings were based on trials meeting stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure validity. Despite previous reviews suggesting advantages of continuous infusion over bolus injections, our review found insufficient evidence to support or refute this. However, our review, which excluded trials with clinical confounders and RCTs with high risk of bias, offers the most robust conclusion to date.

### Untangling infusion confusion: a comparative evaluation of interventions in a simulated intensive care setting [^116B9jRa]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

When a patient is receiving multiple IV infusions, the various components (bags, tubing, and pumps) often become entwined at the bedside (referred to as "spaghetti syndrome"). Also, infusions look similar and there is a lack of information along an infusion pathway. Consequently, whenever an infusion change is required (e.g. rate change, disconnection), a clinician must reconcile the bag with the associated tubing, pump, and patient access port. Given this complicated setup, infusion mix-up errors (e.g. adjust rate on wrong pump) and delays have occurred, which is particularly concerning in emergency situations and has resulted in patient harm and death.

Kane-Gill et al showed that higher number of drugs being infused IV translates into greater likelihood of having an adverse drug event. A review by the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority of IV infusion incidents reported from 2004 to 2013 found that infusion mix-ups errors were the most common error (22.6%; n = 205), of which 92% involved high-alert drugs (e.g. heparin, insulin). In 2010 the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an urgent call to action to improve the management of multiple infusions, and ECRI Institute rated infusion mix-ups as one of the top 10 health technology hazards for 2015.

Current strategies to reduce infusion mix-ups are limited, with infusion setups varying between clinicians, units, and hospitals. Although interventions have been proposed (.), they have not been empirically evaluated except for a study that demonstrated that infusion labels improved timely infusion identification. Thus, further empirical assessment of interventions is required to identify effective risk-mitigation strategies. Without this knowledge, we will not be able to respond to the urgent calls to improve the safety of administering multiple infusions, and mix-up errors will continue. To this end, as part of a larger study, we evaluated the impact of three interventions on the accuracy and speed of infusion identification and disconnection.
