## Question

65 year old male with history of diverticulitis and hypothyroidism presents with 6 days of luq / left lower rib pain that extends now down to the llq

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 65-year-old man with a history of diverticulitis and hypothyroidism who presents with 6 days of left upper quadrant pain extending to the left lower quadrant, and wants to know about the differential diagnosis, imaging strategy, and management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability and how age, prior history, and pain distribution shape the differential. Then, I should verify red flags and the immediate workup including vitals, exam, and labs. Next, I will review imaging choices and why CT with IV contrast is preferred in this scenario. After that, I need to consider key differentials that can mimic diverticulitis or complicate it. Finally, I will outline management pathways for uncomplicated versus complicated disease and close with follow-up and special considerations in older adults and those with hypothyroidism.

> Let me first confirm the pretest probability. In a 65-year-old with prior diverticulitis, the likelihood of recurrent diverticulitis is high, and the pain migration from LUQ to LLQ is anatomically compatible with sigmoid or descending colonic involvement, especially given the propensity for left-sided disease in Western populations and the frequency of recurrence after an initial episode [^115XUUdp] [^112CmiLz]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; atypical pain localization can occur, and older adults may have blunted or atypical presentations, so I should keep a broader differential while prioritizing diverticulitis given the history and trajectory of pain [^113CYQrJ].

> I need to check for red flags and systemic toxicity now. I should confirm fever, tachycardia, hypotension, peritoneal signs, inability to tolerate oral intake, and immunocompromise, as these factors increase the risk of complicated disease and influence the urgency and setting of care [^113gnDzk]. Wait, let me verify the role of labs; leukocytosis and CRP elevation support inflammation but are neither sensitive nor specific enough to exclude complications in older adults, so I should not rely on labs alone to decide on imaging or disposition [^113gnDzk].

> Next, I should review the immediate workup. I will obtain CBC with differential, CRP, basic metabolic panel including creatinine, and urinalysis to assess for urinary involvement or alternative diagnoses, while performing a focused abdominal exam for localized tenderness, guarding, rebound, and masses, and documenting bowel habits and urinary symptoms that might suggest fistula or obstruction [^112BidjC]. Hold on, I should verify that in patients over 65 with suspected diverticulitis, cross-sectional imaging is generally recommended to avoid missing complications; yes, European guidance emphasizes CT for older adults with suspected diverticulitis, particularly when systemic features are present or the presentation is atypical [^113gnDzk].

> Now, imaging. My first instinct is to say "CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is mandatory", but wait, I should double-check the nuance here. ACR 2023 recommends CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast as the initial imaging modality for suspected diverticulitis or complications, and this is especially compelling in older adults and when the diagnosis is uncertain or complications are suspected [^115deDqE]. But hold on, I should verify selective imaging guidance; EAES/SAGES allows selective imaging in highly likely, uncomplicated cases with LLQ pain, absence of vomiting, and CRP greater than 50 mg/L, yet even they acknowledge that many clinicians prefer CT to confirm diagnosis and stage disease, and this patient's LUQ-to-LLQ migration and age push me toward CT regardless of selective criteria [^112VUYtq] [^117E6r28]. I should also confirm alternatives; ultrasound or MRI can be considered if CT is unavailable or contraindicated, but CT remains first-line for accuracy and speed in the ED setting [^116vHXNc] [^116bht5B].

> Let me consider the differential while awaiting imaging. Recurrent acute diverticulitis remains most likely, but I should actively exclude complications such as abscess, microperforation with free air, fistula, obstruction, and peritonitis, which alter management and prognosis [^112m49r9]. I should also keep in mind colonic neoplasm, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, IBD flare, ureteral colic, and extra-colonic causes like pancreatitis or splenic pathology given the LUQ component, as CT will help distinguish these entities and uncover alternative diagnoses or coexisting conditions [^112BidjC] [^115deDqE].

> If CT confirms uncomplicated diverticulitis without abscess, perforation, obstruction, or fistula, I should confirm candidacy for outpatient management. I need to ensure the patient is hemodynamically stable, afebrile or low-grade fever only, able to tolerate oral intake, has reliable follow-up within 48–72 hours, and is immunocompetent; if these criteria are met, supportive care without routine antibiotics is reasonable, with clear return precautions and early reassessment [^114q159b] [^114tSnhe]. Wait, I should verify antibiotic exceptions; AGA supports selective antibiotic use in mild uncomplicated cases with systemic inflammatory features or larger areas of inflammation, so if CRP is markedly elevated or there is a small phlegmon, I may offer antibiotics after discussing risks, benefits, and shared decision-making [^114tSnhe] [^116t3h3t].

> If CT shows complicated disease, I need to escalate promptly. For abscesses larger than about 4–5 cm, percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics is preferred when feasible, whereas smaller collections may respond to antibiotics alone with close monitoring; free perforation or generalized peritonitis warrants urgent surgical consultation and operative management, and fistulas often require interval elective resection after source control and optimization [^1174RrCX] [^113sdRcJ]. Hold on, I should verify that initial nonoperative management with antibiotics alone can be considered for small abscesses if drainage is not immediately available; yes, that is acceptable with vigilant reassessment for clinical deterioration [^113sdRcJ].

> I should confirm site-of-care decisions explicitly. Uncomplicated cases in reliable patients can be managed as an outpatient with early follow-up, whereas patients with significant comorbidities, inability to maintain hydration, unreliable follow-up, or persistent pain despite analgesia should be admitted for observation and supportive care, and any complicated features mandate inpatient management and specialty involvement [^114q159b] [^111jM41t]. But wait, what if the patient prefers inpatient care for reassurance or has limited social support; in older adults, aligning care with patient goals and functional context is essential, so a lower threshold for admission may be appropriate [^115qUopy].

> Next, I should review special considerations. Hypothyroidism itself does not directly alter the pathophysiology of diverticulitis, but it can blunt systemic responses and delay recognition of sepsis, so I need a lower threshold for imaging and inpatient care in this 65-year-old, and I should ensure levothyroxine is continued and interactions with acute medications are considered [^notfound]. I need to ensure age-friendly principles are applied, emphasizing what matters to the patient, medication safety, mentation and mobility, and aligning treatment with functional goals and preferences [^115qUopy].

> Finally, I will outline follow-up and prevention. After resolution of an acute episode, colonoscopy is recommended in 6–8 weeks if not recently done to exclude malignancy or other pathology, and I should counsel on dietary fiber, hydration, physical activity, and weight management while discussing the limited role of elective surgery after recovery, which is generally reserved for recurrent complicated disease or frequent, debilitating episodes after shared decision-making [^115jfupo] [^111gFceH]. Hold on, I should verify that persistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment warrant repeat imaging and endoscopy to exclude ongoing inflammation or alternative diagnoses; yes, AGA advises reassessment with imaging and lower endoscopy when symptoms persist or recur to avoid anchoring bias and missed pathology [^116V4vdC] [^113LtfTL].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **acute diverticulitis** [^115XBXDM] given the patient's history and classic left-sided pain pattern [^114TX2yA]. CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is the **diagnostic test of choice** [^115deDqE] to confirm diverticulitis and assess for complications [^116P5YkJ]. Obtain CBC, CRP, and urinalysis [^112BidjC]; if CRP > 50 mg/L and there is no vomiting, the likelihood of diverticulitis is high [^112VUYtq]. If uncomplicated, manage outpatient with clear liquids, analgesia, and selective antibiotics [^111jM41t] [^114tSnhe] [^111JbdHE]; if complicated (abscess, perforation, fistula, obstruction), admit for IV antibiotics and surgical consultation [^115XUUdp] [^117H9Cyy]. Hypothyroidism does not change acute management but may blunt symptoms, so maintain a low threshold for imaging and escalation [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for left-sided abdominal pain in a 65-year-old male includes:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal | - Diverticulitis [^115deDqE] <br/> - Colitis (infectious, ischemic, inflammatory bowel disease) <br/> - Colorectal cancer <br/> - Constipation/obstruction <br/> - Irritable bowel syndrome [^notfound] |
| Genitourinary | - Urinary tract infection <br/> - Pyelonephritis <br/> - Nephrolithiasis <br/> - Prostatitis |
| Musculoskeletal | - Costochondritis <br/> - Muscle strain <br/> - Rib fracture |
| Other | - Pancreatitis <br/> - Splenic pathology <br/> - Hernia <br/> - Abdominal aortic aneurysm |

---

Given the history of diverticulitis and the classic left-sided pain pattern, **acute diverticulitis is the most likely diagnosis** [^115XBXDM].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment should include a thorough **history** detailing the pain's onset, duration, character, radiation, associated symptoms (fever, nausea, vomiting, altered bowel habits, urinary symptoms), and any previous similar episodes [^113jsyCA]. The **physical examination** should assess vital signs, abdominal tenderness, guarding, rebound, masses, and costal margin tenderness, and include a rectal examination [^111FXtYL].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for leukocytosis [^116hviAB].
- **C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Elevated CRP (> 50 mg/L) strongly suggests diverticulitis [^112VUYtq].
- **Urinalysis**: Rule out urinary tract infection or hematuria suggesting urologic pathology [^notfound].

---

### Imaging

CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is the **gold standard** [^notfound] to confirm diverticulitis, assess severity, and detect complications (abscess, perforation, fistula, obstruction) [^115XBXDM]. Ultrasound may be used as an alternative if CT is unavailable or contraindicated, but it is operator-dependent and less sensitive [^116bht5B].

---

## Management

Management depends on whether the diverticulitis is **uncomplicated or complicated**:

---

### Uncomplicated diverticulitis

- **Outpatient management**: Appropriate for stable, immunocompetent patients without severe comorbidities [^114q159b].
- **Diet**: Clear liquids, advance to low fiber as tolerated.
- **Analgesia**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs if no contraindications.
- **Antibiotics**: Selective use; consider in patients with systemic inflammation (elevated CRP, leukocytosis) or immunocompromise [^114tSnhe] [^115dhejn].
- **Follow-up**: Re-evaluate within 7 days; earlier if deterioration [^114q159b].

---

### Complicated diverticulitis

- **Hospitalization**: For abscess, perforation, fistula, obstruction, or systemic toxicity [^notfound].
- **Intravenous antibiotics**: Empiric coverage of gram-negative and anaerobic organisms [^notfound].
- **Interventional radiology**: Percutaneous drainage for abscesses > 4–5 cm [^1174RrCX].
- **Surgical consultation**: For refractory cases, recurrent episodes, or suspected malignancy [^115jfupo].

---

## Role of hypothyroidism

Hypothyroidism does not significantly alter the acute management of diverticulitis, but it may blunt symptom perception, potentially delaying presentation and masking severity. Continue **levothyroxine** and monitor for interactions with antibiotics or analgesics.

---

## Conclusion

The most likely diagnosis is **acute diverticulitis**. CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is the diagnostic test of choice [^115deDqE]. Management is guided by severity: uncomplicated cases can often be managed outpatient with selective antibiotics, while complicated cases require hospitalization, IV antibiotics, and possible intervention [^116t3h3t]. Hypothyroidism may blunt symptoms, so maintain a low threshold for imaging and escalation [^notfound].

A 52-year-old white woman presented with severe pain over the right upper abdomen and nonpleuritic, right-sided, lower chest-wall pain. Her pain had progressively gotten more frequent and severe over the last 5 months. It was also associated with a nonexertional, pressure-like sensation in the central chest. The patient denied any shortness of breath, fevers, cough, or any sputum production. She was taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and was a 30-pack-year current smoker; there was no history of drug abuse or occupational exposure. Previous chest radiographs dating back to 5 years consistently showed an elevated right-sided hemidiaphragm without any infiltrates or effusions; cardiomediastinal structures were unremarkable. She had not had a previous workup for these abnormal findings.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^113gnDzk]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing diverticulitis requires an approach that considers atypical presentations in older adults (Figure 2). The 2022 European multi‐society guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis in older adults provide recommendations for how to incorporate these differences into clinical practice. They suggest avoiding diagnosis based solely on exam findings or laboratory results, as this may lead to underdiagnosis. Instead, cross‐sectional CT imaging with IV contrast is suggested for all patients older than 65 years with suspected diverticulitis. Obtaining a CT scan in every patient over 65 with abdominal pain and suspected diverticulitis may not be feasible, and this may be omitted in select cases with mild local symptoms and reliable close clinical follow‐up. However, patients with any systemic signs, including atypical symptoms such as fatigue, renal insufficiency, chest pain, or syncope should be evaluated with CT imaging to rule out complicated disease that may require inpatient management or procedural intervention.

Case example part 1: A 78‐year‐old woman with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, prior stroke, obesity, COPD and one prior episode of diverticulitis presents to clinic with 3 days of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, loose stools, anorexia, and fatigue. Physical exam reveals tachycardia to 105 with an irregular rhythm, fever to 38°C, and focal left lower quadrant tenderness. Her white blood cell count is 13,000 and creatinine is 1.4. Other laboratory values are normal. Given her systemic symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, in addition to her elevated creatinine, a CT scan is obtained which demonstrate acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Differential diagnosis

Given the lack of any diagnostic marker or examination, IBS can be presented or misdiagnosed as another disease with similar signs or symptoms. The differential diagnosis includes many diseases, not only of the gastrointestinal tract, but also from extraintestinal causes. Diseases that commonly present with diarrhea and should be excluded first are microscopic colitis, IBD, celiac disease, infections, hyperthyroidism, carbohydrate malabsorption, and bile acid diarrhea. On the other hand, disorders that present with constipation and should be excluded are colorectal cancer or anal malignancy that obstructs the lumen, dyssynergic defecation, and hypothyroidism. Other reasons for abdominal pain should also be excluded in patients with IBS. Endometriosis, diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ovarian cancer are just some examples of diseases that could possibly present with similar abdominal pain.

Case presentation

A previously fit and well 69-year-old man was admitted to the gastroenterology department with a short one month history of lethargy, decreased appetite, persistent vomiting, significant weight loss of six kilograms over 1 month and a dry cough. He denied abdominal pain, haematemesis, dysphagia and a change in bowel habit and described no cardiac, respiratory, neurological symptoms or bone pain. His past medical history includes appendectomy and total hip joint replacement. At the time of admission, he was not on any regular medication.

Physical examination revealed that he was febrile (38.8C°) and appeared cachexic but with no peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease. His abdominal examination revealed hepatomegaly but no other organomegaly, per rectal examination was unremarkable. His cardiopulmonary examinations were unremarkable apart from bilateral pitting edema up to his ankles. Peripheral blood analysis revealed an anaemia of chronic disease with hemoglobin of 108 g/L (norm - male 130–175 g/L), serum iron 2 μmol/L (norm 10–30 μmol/L), transferrin 1.4 g/L (2–3.5 g/L), transferrin saturation 6% (norm 16–50%) and ferritin 354 μg/L (norm 20–500 μg/L). Consistent with a systemic illness the c-reactive protein was increased to 208 mg/L (norm < 5 mg/L) but multiple urine and blood cultures were negative for bacterial infection. Normal serum electrolytes and creatinine of 83 μmol/L (norm 50–120 μmol/L). Liver function test was normal apart from a marked hypoalbuminaemia of 28 g/L (norm 35–50 g/L). Protein electrophoresis, Vitamin B12, folate, and thyroid functions were normal. Chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltration involving both lung bases. Lung function test was consistent with a restrictive lung disease (FVC 3.33 L (73%), FEV1 2.49 L (72%), FEV1/FVC 75% and decreased in diffusion capacity (DLCO 17.81 ml/min/mmHg). Ultrasound of the abdomen confirmed a 19 cm hepatomegaly, with normal liver texture and no evidence of a mass lesion. Due to ongoing vomiting and weight loss, a gastroscopy was performed with no significant pathology. Computer tomography (CT) of the chest showed peri-aortic tissue infiltration creating the appearance of "coated aorta" (Figure 1) as well as thickening of the interlobular septa in both lungs (Figure 2). The infiltration processes also involved the pulmonary vessels, pericardium, lung parenchyma and the oesophagus. CT of the abdomen showed hypo-attenuated homogenous tissue infiltration with weak contrast enhancement in the renal fossa. Symmetric and bilateral infiltration of the peri-renal, anterior and posterior para-renal spaces gave the appearance of "hairy kidney" (Figure 3). Inferior vena cava, aorta and mesentery were also involved. These findings were seen as consistent with a possible diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD).

### Caecal diverticulitis presenting as acute appendicitis: a case report [^111Rb9pm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Solitary caecal diverticulum is rare especially in the Caucasian populations. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is required in the diagnosis of caecal diverticulitis and should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute right iliac fossa pain. Its diagnosis should particularly be suspected in patients with a longer history of pain with atypical presentations of acute appendicitis. Generally, this clinical condition is mostly diagnosed intraoperatively but the use of abdominal USS or CT scan may lead to preoperative diagnosis. One needs to develop a low threshold for the use of a diagnostic laparoscopy in patients and especially in women with atypical presentations of acute appendicitis. An uncomplicated caecal diverticulitis, when a preoperative diagnosis is made convincingly should be managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics. However, majority of the cases are treated surgically because of difficulty distinguishing it from an acute appendicitis or excluding a caecal carcinoma. There are different surgical approaches and generally, a right hemicolectomy is recommended in the presence of an inflammatory mass and when a carcinoma cannot be excluded.

### Caecal diverticulitis can be misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis: a systematic review of the literature [^111vppzc]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Caecal diverticulitis is a rare condition, which was historically often misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis, therefore resulting at times in unnecessary exploratory surgery. Analyses of different publications starting from 1930 demonstrate that medical imaging took a critical place in supporting the clinician to diagnose this condition and to administer adequate treatment. Imaging should be part of the standard diagnostic management of right sided lower abdominal pain. Once diagnosed, uncomplicated CD can be safely managed with antibiotics. Surgery should be kept for complicated cases only.

### The challenging diagnosis and treatment of duodenal diverticulum perforation: a report of two cases [^11625rEn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 51-years old female patient was admitted through the emergency department with abdominal pain of acute onset, mainly epigastric with a right lumbar reflection. The patient had already visited a private medical facility, where she underwent a CT-scan of the abdomen with oral and IV contrast. The findings were consistent with a duodenal perforation and the clinicians referred the patient to the emergency department for further diagnosis and treatment. The patient did not complain of fever, vomit or nausea. Also, she denied any history of NSAIDs and steroid use or a history of ulcer disease, nor did she describe related symptoms.

On clinical examination, the patient had a soft abdomen, mild epigastric tenderness with no signs of peritoneal irritation. The patient's vital signs were normal. She mentioned a medical history of Hashimoto disease under treatment. We proceeded on laboratory testing with the following findings: WBC: 12.93 K/μL, Neut: 76.1%, Hb: 131 g/L, Hct: 36.1%, C-reactive protein on a level of 212.8 mg/l and d-dimmers: 855 ng/ml. Consequently, a new CT scan of the abdomen revealed free air located in the hepatic hilum, the retroperitoneal follicle and the upper liver surface (Fig. 1 a, b).

Fig. 1
a - b: CT scan of the abdomen, showing free locules of air in the hepatic hilum and the lesser omental sac

We decided to perform an immediate exploratory laparotomy during which we noted the presence of a perforated duodenal diverticulum on the second part of the duodenum (Fig. 2 a-b). A diverticulectomy was performed with the use of a linear stapler along with the placement of a drain tube in the anatomical area of the second part of the duodenum. The diverticulum was sent for pathology. A Naso-Gastric tube was used and the patient returned to the ward. She stayed at nil per os until hospital day (HD) 8 and started treatment with intravenous antibiotics and PPIs. On post-operative laboratory tests, we noted an immediate drop of WBC (8.37 K/μL). The highest drainage measurement per day was 200 mL on hospital day 2 and the NG tube measurement ranged from 100 to 600 mL per day.

The John A. Hartford Foundation and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement comprehensive guide for Age‐Friendly Health Systems encourages emphasis on four elements of care for older adults: What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility. This framework can be applied to diverticulitis care in this population. Here, we place emphasis on "what matters" when considering the best approach to diagnosing and managing diverticulitis in older patients. Understanding what is important to the patient and how diverticulitis and its treatment may impact the patient's life goals can be a powerful guide for management. In some cases, deviating from the management strategies advocated for younger healthier patients may be best for an older adult with diverticulitis.

### How would you manage this patient with recurrent diverticulitis? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115jfupo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute diverticulitis, which refers to inflammation or infection, or both, of a colonic diverticulum, is a common medical condition that may occur repeatedly in some persons. It most often manifests with left-sided abdominal pain, which may be associated with low-grade fever and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Complications may include abscess, fistula formation, perforation, and bowel obstruction. The American College of Physicians recently published practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis, the role of colonoscopy after resolution, and interventions to prevent recurrence of this condition. Among the recommendations were the use of abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning in cases where there was diagnostic uncertainty, initial management of uncomplicated cases in the outpatient setting without antibiotics, referral for colonoscopy after an initial episode if not performed recently, and discussion of elective surgery to prevent recurrent disease in patients with complicated diverticulitis or frequent episodes of uncomplicated disease. Here, 2 gastroenterologists with expertise in acute diverticulitis debate CT scanning for diagnosis, antibiotics for treatment, colonoscopy to screen for underlying malignancy, and elective surgery to prevent recurrent disease.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^114Y6a1M]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the longtime prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder of primarily older people in western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation.

### Diverticulitis: a comprehensive review with usual and unusual complications [^112932TB]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Besides the usual signs and symptoms, in the course of the diverticular disease, several unusual complications may be seen. Pylephlebitis, perforation, intestinal obstruction, abscess and fistula formation may be counted among the unusual complications. MDCT is a very robust imaging tool for the primary diagnosis of the acute diverticulitis and its usual and unusual complications. Although CT is the most commonly used modality, radiologists should be familiar with US findings as sonography is generally the first preferred imaging study in the emergency department. Radiologists should be cognizant of the complex unusual complications of acute diverticulitis as they may require a multi-disciplinary treatment approach.

### Left lower quadrant pain of unusual cause [^112kNK7i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower quadrant abdominal pain in an adult man includes, among others, sigmoid diverticulitis; leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm; renal colic; epididymitis; incarcerated hernia; bowel obstruction; regional enteritis; psoas abscess; and in this rare instance, situs inversus with acute appendicitis. We report a case of situs inversus totalis with left-sided appendicitis and a brief review of the literature. There were several subtle indicators of total situs inversus present that were missed by the physicians and surgeons who initially evaluated the patient prior to surgery. Computed tomography scan with contrast, however, revealed the diagnosis immediately, and treatment was successfully initiated.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^111gFceH]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Ultimately, the decision to move forward with surgery should take into consideration multiple factors, including risk and severity of possible recurrence, impact of diverticulitis episodes on a patient's daily life and function, and risks associated with an elective procedure (Figure 4). Although a severe diverticulitis recurrence may be life threatening, understanding what matters to each patient and whether the anticipated outcomes of surgery align with their goals should primarily drive the decision.

### Case series: diverticulitis in the young [^114mhPKH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis has long been regarded as a disease of the elderly, but its incidence has been increasing in those under age 40. Younger patients with diverticulitis are more likely to be male and obese. They often have atypical presentations, and 25% may have right lower quadrant pain. Not surprisingly, the condition is often misdiagnosed, resulting in unnecessary surgery. An abdominal CT scan is the modality of choice for diagnosis, but the most important diagnostic step is simply to include diverticulitis on the differential diagnosis of a young person with lower abdominal pain.

### The unexpected epidural: a case report [^112RTbge]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 53-year-old caucasian G1P1 otherwise healthy female patient was known for a long history of diffuse right and left colonic diverticular disease, with repeated episodes of abdominal pain due to recurrent diverticulitis.

She presented to the emergency department at our institution with severe left-lower-quadrant abdominal pain, cramping and anorexia. Physical examination revealed a soft abdomen, with localized left lower quadrant sharp tenderness, guarding and moderate rebound on examination. Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed bowel wall thickening and contrast-enhancement along a 45 mm portion of the medium-to-distal sigmoid colon. A marked increase in soft tissue density was also observed within the pericolonic fat, with evidence of a 23 mm paramedian fluid collection in the pre-sacral area. The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and antibiotic coverage was started together with analgesics. Symptoms resolved quickly, she was discharged home a week later with a diagnosis of self-limited diverticular microperforation, and an outpatient follow-up was scheduled for elective surgical planning.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic and recurrent diverticulitis [^112CmiLz]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

In Western countries the prevalence of diverticular disease has increased over the past century. Although, most patients remain asymptomatic, among those who experience an attack of diverticulitis, one-third will have recurrent symptoms, and a further third will have a subsequent episode. The indications for surgery after treatment of acute diverticulitis is still under debate. Uncomplicated disease less commonly as thought, progresses to a life threatening situation such as free perforation. Among those who develop complicated diverticulitis, it is often their first presentation. Fistula to the urinary tract often require surgery; however, complicated disease such as an abscess or phlegmon can be managed conservatively and subsequent surgery is selective depending on the recovery from the initial episode. Patients with chronic diverticular disease (persistent pain in the absence of inflammation) have greatly improved quality of life with surgery. The question of greater virulence of disease among young patients may no longer be true and recommendations for surgery may parallel that of older patients. Immunocompromised patients should have definitive surgical therapy early on in the course of the disease. Right-sided disease remains uncommon in the Western world and a conservative approach in the absence of free perforation is recommended. In right-sided disease and in young patients, misdiagnosis is common. In the elective setting, a laparoscopic approach is rapidly becoming preferred because of less morbidity and shorter hospital stay. The treatment of diverticular disease is rapidly undergoing reevaluation, and novel therapies and increased conservative approaches are evolving. Prospective randomized trials are needed, but remain difficult owing to the uncertain natural history of the disease.

### Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis: updated evidence for same old questions [^114ZTGwP]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Summary

A 58-year-old man with a previous history of hypertension presented to the emergency department because of acute left lower quadrant pain. Neither nausea nor vomiting was described. At physical examination, he had tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant with no signs of peritonitis. The patient's body temperature and heart rate were unremarkable (37.2°C/86 beats per minute). Laboratory blood tests showed minimal leukocytosis (13,000 cells/mm 3) with no other relevant findings. An abdominal CT was performed, which confirmed the clinical suspicion of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (AUD). It was described as the presence of a sigmoid thickening and phlegmon in an area with several diverticula, but no free air, fluid, or abscesses were identified (Fig. 1). After the administration of painkillers, the patient remained completely asymptomatic, with good pain control and no fever, so he was recommended conservative outpatient treatment without antibiotics. One week after the AUD episode, the patient was checked, and he confirmed that the resolution had been uneventful and he had been asymptomatic, confirming that the outpatient treatment was successful. The patient asked for any measures that he could follow to prevent further episodes and showed interest in surgical treatment options.

### Left lower-quadrant pain: guidelines from the American college of radiology appropriateness criteria [^113Y3yaq]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower-quadrant pain includes gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and renal/ureteric pathology. Imaging is helpful in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain, and is generally guided by the clinical presentation. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected when the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is present. The severity of disease varies from mild pericolonic and peridiverticular inflammation to severe inflammatory changes with complications such as perforation, peritonitis, or abscess or fistula formation. Computed tomography is the preferred test in evaluating clinically suspected diverticulitis. It is used to evaluate the severity and extent of disease and to identify complications, but it also may diagnose other causes of left lower-quadrant pain that can mimic diverticulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess left lower-quadrant pain. It has superior resolution of soft tissues and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and requires more time to perform. Transabdominal ultrasonography with graded compression is another effective technique but is limited by its high operator dependency and technical difficulties in scanning patients who are obese. Pelvic ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in women of childbearing age. Radiography with contrast enema is less sensitive than computed tomography in diagnosing diverticulitis and is seldom used.

Imaging plays a major role in the evaluation of patients who present to the emergency department with acute left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain. Multidetector computed tomography is currently the primary modality used for imaging these patients. The peritoneal reflections, subperitoneal compartment, and peritoneal spaces of the LUQ are key anatomic features in understanding the imaging appearance of acute diseases in this area. Diseases of the stomach, spleen, pancreas, and splenic flexure are encountered in patients with acute LUQ pain. Optimization of the imaging protocol is vital for accurate diagnosis and characterization of these diseases in the acute setting.

### Emergency medicine updates: acute diverticulitis [^115XUUdp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute diverticulitis is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning acute diverticulitis for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Diverticulitis is a complication of diverticulosis and most commonly affects the sigmoid and descending colon in Western countries. History and examination can suggest the diagnosis, with abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant being the most common symptom and sign, respectively. Change in bowel habits and fever may also occur. Laboratory testing may demonstrate leukocytosis or an elevated C-reactive protein. Imaging options can include computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US), though most classification systems for diverticulitis incorporate CT findings. While the majority of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, complications may affect up to 25% of patients. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis requires antibiotics and surgical consultation. Antibiotics are not required in select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Appropriate patients for supportive care without antibiotics should be well-appearing, have pain adequately controlled, be able to tolerate oral intake, be able to follow up, have no complications, and have no immunocompromise or severe comorbidities.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the ED care of patients with acute diverticulitis.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered. If ultrasonography results are inconclusive in pregnant patients, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography when available.

Two days before she experienced vomiting and diarrhea. At arrival, she complained of moderate pain in the left lower hemithorax. The pain was characterized as dull, constant, radiating to the left upper abdominal quadrant, aggravated by body posture changes without any alleviating factors, and accompanied by nausea and low-grade fever. Her medical history was unremarkable except for previous appendectomy. The patient did not take any medications, and she was not a smoker or an alcohol consumer. She looked ill with a blood pressure of 123/88 mmHg, a pulse rate of 84 beats/min and a temperature of 38.5°C. A thorough physical examination revealed hypoventilation in the left lower base without other relevant findings. The laboratory examination was unremarkable except for poly-morphonuclear leukocytosis (total leukocyte count, 18000/mL; neutrophils, 86%) and an elevated C-reactive protein (86 mg/dL; reference range, 0–5). An upright chest radiograph demonstrated elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and free gas under the diaphragm (Fig. 1).

### Acute colonic diverticulitis [^116KvfG7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a gastrointestinal condition frequently encountered by primary care practitioners, hospitalists, surgeons, and gastroenterologists. Clinical presentation ranges from mild abdominal pain to peritonitis with sepsis. It can often be diagnosed on the basis of clinical features alone, but imaging is necessary in more severe presentations to rule out such complications as abscess and perforation. Treatment depends on the severity of the presentation, presence of complications, and underlying comorbid conditions. Medical and surgical treatment algorithms are evolving. This article provides an evidence-based, clinically relevant overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute diverticulitis.

### Caecal diverticulitis presenting as acute appendicitis: a case report [^114C1Zeq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Solitary caecal diverticulum is an uncommon entity and therefore difficult to diagnose except at surgery. Caecal diverticulitis is an infrequent cause of acute abdomen and usually presents in a manner similar to acute appendicitis. It is extremely difficult to differentiate it preoperative from acute appendicitis and such distinction is usually made in the operating room. The optimal management of this clinical condition is still controversial, ranging from conservative treatment with antibiotics to aggressive surgical resections. We report a case of a 61 year old Caucasian who presented with acute onset right iliac fossa pain indistinguishable from acute appendicitis. The true diagnosis of a perforated acute caecal diverticulitis with an abscess mass was only made at operation in the presence of a macroscopically normal appendix. We reviewed the literature to highlight the difficulty of a preoperative diagnosis and the need for a high index of suspicion especially in the older age group presenting in manner similar to acute appendicitis.

### Diverticulitis: a comprehensive review with usual and unusual complications [^112m49r9]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Complications of diverticulitis

Perforation

Perforation of diverticulitis occurs secondary to severe inflammation of bowel wall layers with subsequent necrosis and loss of intestinal wall integrity. Perforation from colonic diverticulitis almost always occurs on the left side. Well-contained perforations manifest as small and self-limited; however, non-contained perforations which occur in 1%–2% of patients with acute diverticulitis may lead to local abscess and fistula formation (Fig. 1). Free air is usually detected locally with well-contained perforation while widespread intraabdominal free air is detected in large non-contained perforations (Fig. 2). Intraperitoneal perforation may present with acute abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Retroperitoneal air can result from perforation of second and third portions of duodenum, posterior aspect of the ascending, descending and sigmoid colon segments. The clinical presentation may be insidious and relatively silent in these patients causing delayed diagnosis and potentially life-threatening complications.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^1174RrCX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute diverticulitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to consider performing percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic therapy in patients with large abscesses. Consider administering an initial treatment with antibiotic therapy alone, if clinical condition permits, when percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available. Perform an operative intervention as an alternative option.

### Abdominal pain in the emergency department: missed diagnoses [^111FXtYL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common chief complaint in the Emergency Department. Abdominal pain is caused by a variety of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal disorders. Some frequently missed conditions include biliary pathology, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and urogenital pathology. The Emergency Medicine clinician must consider all aspects of the patient's presentation including history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging. If no diagnosis is identified, close reassessment of pain, vital signs, and physical examination are necessary to ensure safe discharge. Strict verbal and written return precautions should be provided to the patient.

### Emergency presentations of diverticulitis [^1155P9Bv]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Acute diverticulitis is a common condition that has been increasing in incidence in the United States. It is associated with increasing age, but the pathophysiology of acute diverticulitis is still being elucidated. It is now believed to have a significant contribution from inflammatory processes rather than being a strictly infectious process. There are still many questions to be answered regarding the optimal management of acute diverticulitis because recent studies have challenged traditional practices, such as the routine use of antibiotics, surgical technique, and dietary restrictions for prevention of recurrence.

### Small bowel diverticulitis: an often overlooked cause of acute abdomen [^1122uTKm]. Emergency Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

We present 3 cases of small bowel diverticulitis ultimately presenting to our Emergency Department over a span of 2 years. Though the final diagnosis was the same, each patient's symptomatology was different, mimicking more common pathologies. Thus, it is important to consider this entity when confronted with signs and symptoms of acute abdomen, especially in the elderly. A missed or delayed diagnosis can lead to costly erroneous studies, incorrect treatments and delay in proper management, resulting in significant morbidity and even mortality. The variety of presentations can often be misleading; therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed on the part of the Emergency Department physician and Radiologist.

### Caecal diverticulitis presenting as acute appendicitis: a case report [^114Sas3r]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The preoperative diagnosis of caecal diverticulitis is difficult and one report claims it is only made in 9% of the cases, and most of these patients have had previous appendicectomy. Acute appendicitis is by far the initial preoperative diagnosis on account of similar presentation of low grade fever, right iliac fossa pain and tenderness with guarding. However some studies have suggested certain subtle clinical features that may help in differentiating caecal diverticulitis from acute appendicitis including a relatively longer history of right iliac fossa pain with relative lack of systemic toxicity despite prolonged duration of the symptoms especially with a posteriorly located lesion. Nausea and vomiting are less frequent, abdominal pain typically starts and remains in the right iliac fossa rather than beginning in the central abdomen and shifting to the RIF and RIF tenderness is not usually as marked as in acute appendicitis.

As acute appendicitis is mainly a clinical diagnosis, many patients presenting with RIF pain and tenderness with a presumptive diagnosis of appendicitis are usually not subjected to preoperative radiological investigations except where the diagnosis is in doubt especially in female patients or where a mass is palpable and a caecal carcinoma is suspected. Our patient did not have a preoperative radiological investigation because of a strong suspicion of an acute appendicitis. However, abdominal ultrasound scan (USS) and computerised tomography (CT) scan have been shown to have high diagnostic accuracy and may play a role in the preoperative diagnosis. In a review of 934 patients with caecal diverticulitis presenting with indeterminate right lower quadrant abdominal pain, Chou et al reported a sensitivity of 91.3% and a specificity of 99.5% with abdominal USS with an overall accuracy of 99.5% in the diagnosis of caecal diverticulitis. The preoperative accuracy of distinguishing acute appendicitis from caecal diverticulitis with CT scan has been shown in various studies with a sensitivity and specificity of 98%. The CT scan findings are similar to those of left sided diverticulitis, including caecal wall thickening, focal pericaecal inflammation with stranding of adjacent fascia, associated diverticulitis, abscess formation, extraluminal air signifying perforation and extraluminal mass effect. These features may however be present with caecal pole tumour especially in the presence of tumour perforation or associated peritumoural inflammatory reaction. Caecal diverticulitis may actually be indistinguishable from carcinoma on the CT scan in about 10% of cases.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaLeft lower quadrant pain-suspected diverticulitis [^115XBXDM]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the relevant literature regarding imaging of suspected diverticulitis as an etiology for left lower quadrant pain, and imaging of complications of acute diverticulitis. The most common cause of left lower quadrant pain in adults is acute sigmoid or descending colonic diverticulitis. Appropriate imaging triage for patients with suspected diverticulitis should address the differential diagnostic possibilities and what information is necessary to make a definitive management decision. Patients with diverticulitis may require surgery or interventional radiology procedures because of associated complications, including abscesses, fistulas, obstruction, or perforation. As a result, there has been a trend toward greater use of imaging to confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis, evaluate the extent of disease, and detect complications before deciding on appropriate treatment. Additionally, in the era of bundled payments and minimizing health care costs, patients with acute diverticulitis are being managed on an outpatient basis and rapid diagnostic imaging at the time of initial symptoms helps to streamline and triage patients to the appropriate treatment pathway. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Beyond appendicitis: common and uncommon gastrointestinal causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain at multidetector CT [^1169b6pf]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Right lower quadrant abdominal pain is one of the most common causes of a patient visit to the emergency department. Although appendicitis is the most common condition requiring surgery in patients with abdominal pain, right lower quadrant pain can be indicative of a vast list of differential diagnoses and is thus a challenge for clinicians. Other causes of right lower quadrant pain beyond appendicitis include inflammatory and infectious conditions involving the ileocecal region; diverticulitis; malignancies; conditions affecting the epiploic appendages, omentum, and mesentery; and miscellaneous conditions. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) has emerged as the modality of choice for evaluation of patients with several acute traumatic and nontraumatic conditions causing right lower quadrant pain. Multidetector CT is an extremely useful noninvasive method for diagnosis and management of not only the most common causes such as appendicitis but also less common conditions.

### Right-sided diverticulitis mimics appendicitis [^1164tyD8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Right-sided diverticulitis is a rare source of right lower quadrant pain in Western society; however, it is quite common in Asian societies. Right-sided diverticulitis presents very similarly to appendicitis, with right lower quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and laboratory abnormalities, and is often seen in young patients.

Objectives

In this report, we present a case of right-sided diverticulitis. We review right-sided diverticulitis' diagnosis and management. It is important to diagnose right-sided diverticulitis because it is a good mimic of appendicitis and ideally should be diagnosed before a patient has unnecessary surgery.

Case Report

A 26-year-old Asian woman presented for evaluation of right lower quadrant pain and fever. She was initially thought to have appendicitis clinically, but had right-sided diverticulitis diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan. She was admitted and received intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Her right-sided diverticulitis resolved in 3 days.

Conclusions

Severe right lower quadrant pain in young patients of Asian descent can be right-sided diverticulitis. Right-sided diverticulitis is a benign condition managed medically that mimics appendicitis. CT imaging seems to be the best way to avoid unnecessary surgery.

### The challenging diagnosis and treatment of duodenal diverticulum perforation: a report of two cases [^1173wi2V]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The duodenum is described as the second most common location for intestinal diverticula only surpassed by the colon. Regarding the DD, they are more frequently situated in the second part, especially on the medial wall, around the ampulla of Vater. Their incidence increases with age and they show no sex predisposition. Most of them appear solitary, roughly 85–90%. In the existing case series, the main causes of DD perforation appear to be diverticulitis (62%), enterolithiasis (10%), iatrogenic (5%), ulceration (5%), trauma (4%) and foreign bodies. Although rare, perforation bears a high mortality rate of 20–34% in older series. Thorson et al. report 8% mortality in a review of 61 cases from 1989 to 2011 and Mathis et al. as low as 3% in a series of 34 patients treated in a single center from 1969 to 2001.

Presenting symptoms from a perforated DD may vary and will not, in most cases be pathognomonic. Pain is the leading symptom that will drive the patient to seek medical help. In the case of intra-peritoneal perforation, it will be abdominal, located at the right upper quadrant or the epigastrium, as in the cases presented here. Some patients may complain of back pain, especially if the perforation is retroperitoneal. Other symptoms will be fever, nausea or vomiting. Some patients will report a long history of vague signs and symptoms which can only be related to the DD retrospectively. Such signs can be weight loss, jaundice, and fullness for a period of months or even years. This variety of clinical presentations may puzzle the clinician and thus, high suspicion is required.

What is the best way to make a diagnosis of ALCD?

In patients with suspected ALCD, we suggest a complete assessment of the patients using clinical history, signs, laboratorial inflammation markers, and radiological findings (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

In patients with suspected, ALCD we suggest against diagnosis based only on clinical examination (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

Clinical findings of patients having ALCD include acute pain or tenderness in the left lower quadrant that may be associated with increased inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Clinical diagnosis of ALCD usually lacks accuracy. In a prospective analysis conducted on 802 consecutive patients who presented with abdominal pain to the emergency department, positive and negative predictive values of clinical diagnosis were 0.65 and 0.98, respectively. Additional cross-sectional imaging had a positive and negative predictive value of 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. Additional radiology examinations improved the diagnostic accuracy in 37% of the patients, but changed the management in only 7%.

In 2010, using logistic regression analysis, Laméris et al. developed a clinical decision rule for diagnosis of ALCD, based on 3 criteria: (1) direct tenderness only in the left lower quadrant, (2) CRP > 50 mg/l, and (3) absence of vomiting. Of 126 clinically suspected patients enrolled in this prospective study, 30 patients had all 3 features (24%), of whom 29 had a final diagnosis of acute diverticulitis (97%; 95% CI 83–99%). Of the 96 patients without all 3 features, 45 (47%) did not have diverticulitis. In a quarter of patients with suspected diverticulitis, the diagnosis could be made clinically based on the combination of the three criteria.

Andeweg et al. in 2011, using retrospective data from 287 patients, developed a clinical scoring system for the diagnosis of ALCD with diagnostic accuracy of 86%. It was based on independent predictors of ALCD including age, a clinical history of one or more previous episodes, localization of symptoms in the lower left abdomen, aggravation of pain on movement, the absence of vomiting, localization of abdominal tenderness on examination in the lower left abdomen, and C-reactive protein of 50 mg/l or higher.

### Diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis [^111EPLgr]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis is somewhat standardized, the scientific evidence and basis for treatment has been questioned. For years, medical and surgical management of acute diverticulitis has been based on the theory that more than 2 significant attacks of diverticulitis would lead to the recommendations of surgical resection. This should be questioned and further investigated with prospective randomized trials. Only a small number of well-published articles support the surgical management with good scientific data. Although our ability to take a history and skill of physical examination has not changed, the use of improved technology such as high-speed computerized axial tomography has afforded us the ability to make earlier and more accurate diagnoses. This may further allow us to standardize treatment and study outcomes. The time has come to further investigate and justify this management. It is possible that only the most critical situations may necessitate an operation. Clearly, the age group less than 40 years, as well as the immunocompromised, steroid-dependent, diabetic, and transplant patients, seem to be at greater risk with increased morbidity if not treated early and aggressively. And those individuals who present with perforation or compromised obstruction most likely will continue to need emergent intervention. We should try to set the rules by evidence-based medicine, while remaining within the confines of excellent and cost-effective care.

### History information management strategy for minimising biases and noise for improved medical diagnosis [^113jsyCA]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Risks

Encompasses endogenous patient factors such as medical history and family history. For example, a middle-aged woman with colonic diverticulosis and worsening left lower quadrant pain over 2 days may indicate diverticulitis, while recurrent bloody stools following abdominal aortic surgery in an older man could suggest an aorto-enteric fistula. Although past and family histories are routinely addressed, emphasising this risk assessment highlights the importance of structured questioning to elicit relevant risk factors, enabling a precise diagnosis.

Exposure

Includes exogenous factors like medication, occupation, residency, travel, allergies, living things and sexual contact. They aid in enhancing differential diagnoses based on other data. As they can impact the diagnosis, less seemingly significant details should also be inquired about, but in the right way and the right time. Alternatively, in cases where the diagnosis proves challenging, paying attention to these aspects can potentially lead to the correct diagnosis. For instance, in the case of a 42-year-old man experiencing unexplained fever and generalised pain, a history of consuming bear meat during a vacation revealed the diagnosis of trichinosis. Similarly, in the case of a 55-year-old individual with longstanding dizziness and peripheral neuropathy, an occupational history of exposure to organic solvents in a factory setting unveiled the cause. These examples highlight how inquiring about such information can elucidate the diagnosis and provide valuable insights.

Description

Focus on obtaining detailed information, to the extent of being 'visualised', regarding self-reported symptoms, including their onset, clinical course, and associated factors and assessing the clinical course as linear, recurrent, or unchanged aids in forming differential diagnoses. Additionally, gathering information on factors that may affect the course (aggravating or alleviating) and patients' anxiety or specific concerns related to the symptoms is essential. When symptoms involve pain or sensory disturbances, detailed structured information regarding anatomical location and nature of the symptoms is necessary.
