## Question

Rich is reading a 372-page book. He has already read 125 pages of the book. If he skipped the 16 pages of maps, how many more pages does he have left to read to finish the book?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many more pages Rich has left to read in a 372-page book, given that he has already read 125 pages and skipped 16 pages of maps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of pages in the book. Then, I should verify how many pages Rich has already read. Next, I will consider whether the 16 pages of maps are part of the total count and whether they should be subtracted from the remaining pages. After that, I will calculate the remaining pages that Rich actually needs to read. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and state the answer clearly.

> Let me first confirm the total page count and what has been read. The book has 372 pages total, and Rich has read 125 pages so far, so the straightforward remaining would be 372 minus 125, which equals 247 pages, but wait, let me verify whether the 16 map pages are included in the 372 total and whether they affect what Rich still needs to read [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the status of the maps. The problem states Rich skipped 16 pages of maps; if those 16 pages are part of the 372-page total, then the pages Rich actually needs to read are fewer than 372, and the remaining readable pages would be 372 minus 16 equals 356 pages total that are not maps, so I need to subtract both the maps and the pages already read to find what is left to read [^notfound].

> Let me calculate carefully. Total non-map pages equal 372 minus 16, which is 356 pages. Rich has read 125 of those non-map pages, so pages left to read equal 356 minus 125, which is 231 pages. I should double-check that subtraction: 356 minus 125 is indeed 231, so the final answer is 231 pages left to read [^notfound].

Rich has **231 pages** left to read. The book has 372 total pages, and he has read 125 pages and skipped 16 pages of maps. The remaining pages are 372 − 125 − 16 = **231 pages**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

- **Total pages in the book**: 372 pages
- **Pages already read**: 125 pages
- **Pages skipped (maps)**: 16 pages
- **Pages remaining to be read**: 372 − 125 − 16 = 231 pages

---

## Explanation

The total pages Rich needs to read are the total pages minus the pages he has already read and the pages he skipped. Skipped pages are excluded from the remaining count because he will not read them. Thus, **231 pages remain** to be read.

---

## Final answer

Rich has **231 pages** left to read.

### How to read a scientific research paper [^aaad1254]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Reading is the most common way that adults learn. With the exponential growth in information, no one has time to read all they need. Reading original research, although difficult, is rewarding and important for growth. Building on past knowledge, the reader should select papers about which he already holds an opinion. Rather than starting at the beginning, this author suggests approaching a paper by reading the conclusions in the abstract first. The methods should be next reviewed, then the results--first in the abstract, and then the full paper. For efficiency, at each step, reasons should be sought not to read any further in the paper. By using this approach, new knowledge will be obtained and many papers will be evaluated, read, and considered.

The ultimate objective of biomedical research is to connect human diseases with the genes that underlie them and drugs that treat them. But this remains a daunting task, and even the most inspired researchers still have to resort to laborious screens of genetic or chemical libraries. What if at least some parts of this screening process could be systematized and centralized? And hits found and hypotheses generated with something resembling an internet search engine? These are the questions the Connectivity Map project set out to answer.

Health literacy—developing written materials for patients—Develop written materials, keep the messages simple, and limit the number of messages (the general guideline is four main messages). Focus on action with specific recommendations based on behavior (eg, “Take a warm-water bath two times a day”). Use the active voice instead of the passive voice, use familiar language and avoid jargon, and use visual aids, such as drawings or models, for key points. Use at least a 12-point type size to make the messages easy to read and leave plenty of white space around margins and between sections.

Figure 3 
Screenshots of the GUI pages after the phenotypic data (left) and marker map (right) have been uploaded. Any output from the underlying functions is shown in the right-half of a page.

The function statement for reading the SNP data differs from the two previous input statements. Besides the file name, additional arguments are required. The file type needs specifying. Here, since the marker data are in a space delimited text file, the type=“text” argument is included in the function statement. Other allowable formats are variant call format (type=“vcf”) and PLINK ped (type=“PLINK”). Text files give the user the freedom to select their own coding scheme but how these codes map to the SNP genotypes need specifying. In this example, the file contains codes 0, 1, and 2 for SNP genotypes AA, AB, and BB, respectively. This means that the function statement includes the arguments AA = 0, AB = 1, and BB = 2. Also, it is good practice to set the amount of available memory, in gigabytes, with the availmemGb argument. The default is to assume 16 GB of memory.

The ReadMarker function statement for this example is

R> genoObj<- ReadMarker(“genoex.dat”,type=“text”,

+ AA = 0, AB = 1, BB = 2, availmemGb = 8)

A screenshot of the corresponding GUI page after uploading the file is shown in Figure 4. The output from running the statement is the same as the output shown in the right-half of the GUI page. Unlike the other input functions, ReadMarker does not read the data into memory. Instead, the marker data, and its transpose, are stored on disk in a binary form. By not holding the genotype data in memory, it gives Eagle the ability to analyze marker data larger than the memory capacity of a computer. The object returned by ReadMarker is a list object that holds elements containing information on the dimensions of the marker data, the name and location of the reformatted marker data, and the number of phenotypic samples.

### Atlas of cancer signalling network: a systems biology resource for integrative analysis of cancer data with google maps [^8e984f8b]. Oncogenesis (2015). Low credibility.

ACSN is a large and detailed map of molecular interactions representing multiple distant crosstalks between molecular processes. This richness is a ‘double-edged sword', because the density of the presented information makes the navigation through the map difficult. This problem is addressed in ACSN in four complementary ways.

First, exploration of the content is facilitated by the hierarchical modular structure of ACSN. Shuttling between the global ACSN map to individual maps of biological processes and further to functional module maps is possible. It allows visualization of only a limited number of molecular species and reactions related to a particular molecular mechanism (Figures 1, 2b and c).

Second, the semantic zooming feature in ACSN simplifies navigation through the large maps of molecular interactions, showing readable amount of details at each zoom level. Gradual exclusion of details allows exploration of map content from the detailed towards the top-level view (Supplementary Figure S4). Pruning of maps helps to eliminate non-essential information, highlighting the core processes corresponding to the canonical pathways. The principle of pruning can be understood from the ACSN representation of the Cell cycle map or from the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) module of Cell survival maps (Supplementary Figure S5).

Third, to facilitate exploration of individual entities of the map, the function of selecting and highlighting only species of interest is available in the ACSN user interface (detailed in the user guide at the ACSN website). It is also possible to select and highlight neighbours of a molecular species of interest. This way, the connectivity of the selected entities through the map can be studied. Step-wise enlarging of the neighbourhood coverage can help to follow the propagation of signalling from one molecular entity to another (Supplementary Figure S6).

The fourth way to explore the map is via detailed annotation post of each component of the map that can be accessed through the callout window or from the selection panel (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S3). Annotations contain extended information on the entities, such as involvement in ACSN maps and modules; participation in complexes; participation in reactions and their regulation and so on. Each component listed in the annotation post is a hyperlink leading to the corresponding map entity. Shuttling between the annotation post and the map facilitates the exploration of ACSN. In addition, annotation posts contain links to directly access external resources. Finally, users can leave comments via an integrated blog system that helps to map maintenance (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3).

Photographs in telemedicine—advice for travelers—emphasizes capturing key lesion features, including distribution, configuration and arrangement of lesions with respect to one another, a primary lesion, and lesions with secondary changes; if several lesions are present or if the lesion is subtle, highlight the specific lesion with a marking pen or (for digital images) editing software, and take pictures in a well-lit room or outdoors in a shaded area. High-quality image set-up includes an orientation view showing the entire body or affected body part with the lesion’s location obvious, a mid-distance view centered on the lesion with an anatomical landmark for orientation and size, and a close-up view that can be physically close (under 18 inches) using the camera’s macro function or from farther away if using a zoom lens; ensure the lesion is in the center and fills most of the frame with some normal skin, include a scale or size comparison using a ruler, measuring tape, or a standard object like a pencil, paper clip, or US coin, and take as many pictures as necessary and send sharply focused, well-lit photos only because blurry pictures are not helpful.

### How to map the evidence: the development of the systematic review in anaesthesia [^4e8ae9c5]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

The decision of where to start a research project has been influenced by many factors over the years. Tradition has a large impact, but the individual researchers' or clinicians' personal interest has also played a major role. The pharmaceutical industries' interest has without doubt initiated and sponsored many projects in order to get new products onto the market. The lack of an overview and control has led to an abundance of evidence within certain areas of our specialty, whereas other areas are scarcely, or not at all, researched. One way of 'mapping' the evidence in order to find out what we know and what we do not know is the production of systematic reviews. Although systematic reviews are considered top of the evidence hierarchy, they are not flawless. The aim of this article is to explain the systematic review and point to some of the challenges in the development and use of systematic reviews.

### Rapid reviews methods series: guidance on rapid scoping, mapping and evidence and gap map (' big picture reviews') [^94099243]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The term 'Big Picture Reviews' (BPRs) is an umbrella term that covers scoping, mapping and evidence gap maps (EGM) (Figure 1 shows the definition and overall features of each). The terms ‘scoping review’ and ‘mapping review’ are not used consistently within the published literature. At times, the terms appear to be used interchangeably, while in other instances, they refer to quite different approaches. These differences can be explained in part by the different academic traditions from which they have arisen.We suggest that there is value in regarding these as different approaches but within the same ‘family’ of approaches. While scoping, mapping and EGMs share the same aims, they also have differences, notably in the depth of data that is extracted and coded, and how findings are displayed and reported. EGMs, for example, include an interactive, visual presentation of the evidence grouping studies into predefined categories.The creation of a ‘map’ onto which the evidence is plotted makes them a particularly valuable tool for identifying knowledge gaps.There is no current guidance on the application of rapid approaches for BPRs, and this paper addresses this gap. It draws on both published evaluations of rapid approaches and recommendations from methodological experts and summarised in Table 1.

Figure 1 
Summary of similarities and differences between scoping, mapping and evidence and gap map reviews (‘Big Picture Reviews’).*High-level data is data which is readily retrieved and requires no interpretation: country of study, types of outcomes measured, population, in contrast of more complex data requiring more in-depth reading of the included study, such as the quality of the study, the extent to which equity is considered in the study and methods of analysis used.

Table 1 
Summary of rapid approaches in Big Picture Reviews

A rapid review (RR) is a ‘type of evidence synthesis that brings together and summarises information from different research studies to produce evidence for people such as the public, healthcare providers, researchers, policymakers and funders in a systematic, resource-efficient manner’.This is done by speeding up the ways we plan, do and/or share the results of conventionally structured (systematic) reviews, by simplifying or omitting a variety of methods that should be clearly defined by the authors.

Each week, half a million readers access the Journal electronically, and our content is now seen online by about four times as many people as those who see the print edition. This mode of information delivery has expanded tremendously since the Journal first went online in 1996.(1) Not so long ago, electronic publishing was viewed as secondary to print publication, basically as a convenient way to deliver the print version of an article. Today, the electronic presentation of scientific articles has become the version of record, with print becoming only one part of the complete publication, which may include video, . . .

### Welcome to oncogenesis [^9a9b896a]. Oncogenesis (2012). Low credibility.

A very, very long-time ago, way back before there was email, science was communicated in two ways. We would read papers that were actually on paper, bound into journals, and sent to libraries, offices and homes by something called mail (not to be confused with the aforementioned email). To find a paper, we would scan tables of contents, and physically turn the pages to a title of potential interest. The other way was to attend meetings, which we still do of course, but then it was to hear about papers that might be ‘in press,' by which we meant ‘being printed on an actual printing press,' and it would be months, at least, before the print arrived in our ‘mail boxes.'

Reading a paper, although, was trivial compared with actually preparing our work for possible publication. These had to be typed by hand, on machines called ‘typewriters' (you can still see these in museums). Graphs were hand drawn and lettered, and photographs were developed in tanks of chemicals. When I started out (yes, this was all in my lifetime), photocopied papers were not acceptable—copies had to be prepared separately, although the use of carbon paper was allowed (don't ask). Yes, we were very primitive, but we could fill up the gas tanks of our cars for <5 $ (you might say, ‘petrol' and ‘pounds,' and oh yes, we didn't have euros then, either).

### Graphical data presentation [^8085a383]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Figures and charts are the most influential vehicles for distributing scientific information, for affecting decisions as to the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, and for attracting the attention of the scientific community to study results. Graphical excellence is mainly defined, first, by the highest possible data density (that is, the amount of information provided per graph area); second, by a low ink-to-data ratio (the avoidance of unnecessary shading, three-dimensionality, gridlines and what is often called 'chartjunk'); and third, by clear and unequivocal labelling of axes. The researcher's essential graphical toolbox should contain histograms, bar charts (always with measures of error), box-and-whiskers plots, scatter plots and forest plots.

### Clinical consensus methodology [^b3ed17fb]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical consensus methodology—evidence review for clinical consensus describes how literature is searched, screened, prioritized, and mapped to support recommendations. Just before publication submission, a final supplemental literature search is performed, and study inclusion and exclusion criteria are developed by the authoring team members, committee leadership, and the methodologist; titles and abstracts are screened by staff with priority given to high-quality systematic reviews, published evidence-based guidelines by clinical or public health organizations, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational studies. Authors complete full-text review based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria with standardized reasons for article exclusion, and the development process does not involve a risk of bias analysis or grading of the evidence. After identifying a final list of relevant studies and guidelines, ACOG staff develop summary evidence maps that provide a concise display organized by the hierarchy of evidence (systematic reviews, RCTs, observational studies, case studies, and narrative reviews), summarize guidelines from professional societies and other relevant stakeholders, and are used by the writing team and committee when developing full recommendation statements and descriptions of supportive evidence.

### Clinical consensus methodology [^4a5dcf27]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical consensus methodology—development of the recommendations and manuscript explains how recommendations are crafted from the mapped evidence. Authoring team members review the evidence included in the evidence maps and propose key recommendations, and Clinical Consensus recommendations include a description of the relevant population, intervention, comparator, outcome, timing, setting, and dosing regimens as appropriate. When evaluating evidence, authors consider benefits and harms, patients’ values and preferences, resource use, cost, effect on equity, and generalizability, and they identify evidence related to specific segments of the U.S. population that may be disproportionately or differentially affected and propose specific recommendations based on the evidence review when possible. Articles in the evidence map not cited in the draft manuscript undergo additional review, and if after additional review it is determined that an article should not be included, the article is then removed from the evidence summary.

### Graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications: the good, the bad, and how not to be the latter [^a3a1cb03]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Graphs, figures, and tables can save readers time and energy, aid their understanding of an article, and reduce the word count of the main text. However, many graphics submitted to and published in scientific journals fail to meet their potential and include mistakes that jeopardize their clarity. Many formats are available for presenting data, as well as a variety of techniques for enhancing interpretability. When the appropriate format is used to depict data, it conveys the greatest amount of information in the clearest fashion, complements the text, and deepens readers' understanding. The aims of this article are to draw attention to the necessity of well-constructed graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications, and to show how to create them.

### Why do we still page each other? Examining the frequency, types and senders of pages in academic medical services [^1f1596a6]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Paging still represents an important form of communication within hospitals, but it results in interruptions, and other more modern approaches could be superior. This study aims to describe how paging is currently used in an academic medical centre, including the frequency, type, urgency and sender of pages, so that improvements in communication can be better informed.

Study Sample

In order to understand what communication needs paging fulfils in a modern academic medical centre, we analysed a database of 1252 pages sent to internal medicine residents within an academic medical centre. We assessed all pages from 3 separate general medicine rotations over a total of 56days encompassing 602h.

Results

Residents were paged an average of 22.4 times per day, with a maximum of 50 pages per day. Most pages were deemed clinically relevant (76%) and important (76%) to patient care. Overall, 59% of pages required a response. A mean of 7.7 pages were sent per patient, up to a maximum of 70 pages for one patient. Nurses (28%), consultants (16%) and the clinical laboratory (15%) were responsible for the majority of pages. Almost all pages from nurses (82%) and consultants (82%) required a response. Regionalised services had significantly fewer pages per day than non-regionalised services (19 vs 37, p≤0.00001).

Conclusions

Paging remains widely used for communications within hospitals about patient care. Although the majority of pages were judged to be clinically relevant and important, they frequently required a response potentially leading to interruptions in workflow, and communication waste. Paging rate and volume has not decreased in 25years despite significant penetration of newer technologies. For the majority of current uses of pages, we believe other approaches may now be more appropriate. Regionalisation significantly reduces the number and urgency of the pages.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^f54e01be]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA guideline provides 106 formal recommendations and the ESC/ESH provides 122. In both guidelines, each recommendation is characterized by a class of recommendation that specifies the strength or importance of the recommendation and by a level-of-evidence designation. Both the ESC/ESH and ACC/AHA guideline committees voted on the wording and grading of each recommendation. Both guidelines provide comprehensive advice for prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high BP/hypertension. As a result, the 2 full reports are relatively long (103 pages for the ACC/AHA and 84 pages for the ESC/ESH). For ease of reading, however, the documents are divided into sections and subsections that use a similar presentation format. In addition, a variety of shorter executive summaries and brief synopses have been published. Guideline authors have published articles that expand on individual guideline topics, provide perspective for the evidence underpinning selected recommendations, and furnish quantitative estimates of potential impact based on universal application of guideline recommendations in their target populations. Last, both guidelines are complemented by publicly available slide sets, CVD risk estimation calculators, and other educational tools.

### Readability and quality of online eating disorder information-are they sufficient? A systematic review evaluating websites on anorexia nervosa using DISCERN and flesch readability [^51b6896d]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluate the quality and readability of United Kingdom-based websites on anorexia nervosa.

Method

First-page search results of three search engines (with search term "anorexia nervosa") were consulted. Websites were excluded if they were pro-ana, duplications, advertisements, Wikipedia, nonwritten/video, invalid addresses, non-English, book links, articles/news pages, and discussion forums. Fifteen websites were evaluated on information quality using DISCERN, and on readability using the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) Scale. Spearman's correlations between quality and readability were calculated.

Results

DISCERN-scores ranged from 34 to 71 (M = 49.27, SD = 9.16), representing "fair" information quality. FRE-scores ranged from 28 to 64 (M = 42.7, SD = 13.43), representing "difficult" readability. The Royal College of Psychiatrists website (https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/) received the only "excellent" quality rating and was the only website that met the recommended reading level. The other websites' quality varied, and their reading levels ranged from fairly to very difficult.

Conclusion

Website quality scores varied. Oftentimes, information about treatment risks and benefits was lacking, and texts were too complex. Website quality seals could prove beneficial, and web developers should use quality and readability measures to ensure information accessibility. Future research should utilize DISCERN and FRE to evaluate quality and readability of websites pertaining to other eating disorders too.

### A global map of travel time to access veterinarians [^d1e7e25f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Each query of Google Maps always returned the names and addresses of veterinary practices complete with geographic coordinates. In contrast, every OpenStreetMap query returned entries with geographic coordinates, but only 37.7% of them were complete with names and addresses of veterinary practices. Every other online source inspected provided only the addresses of veterinary practices, and, where available, their name and specialization, as text strings. Therefore, we used different means to extract such information from PDFs and web pages. For PDFs, we used the R package tabulizer to extract the file’s tables containing the addresses of veterinary practices. When addresses were only available on online platforms, we sampled them through web-scraping. Specifically, we coded web-scraping software (web-scrapers) in the R and Python programming languages through the packages rvest and BeautifulSoup. Before launching the web-scrapers, we used the R package robotstxt to ensure that web-scrapers had the right to access the online platforms. This information is contained inside source code of each platform, built through the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). In platforms denying access to web-scrapers (2 out of 87), we collected addresses of veterinary practices manually. In addition, we used the selenium WebDriver packageto automate web navigation through web-crawlers to visualize and sample data in multiple web pages of the same website. This practice was also used with websites embedding applications displaying data only upon users’ interaction with specific buttons (e.g. buttons that open sub-sections containing the addresses of veterinary practices).

Finally, we used every address sampled as input for Google geocoding APIto retrieve its geographic coordinates if not already available (detailed point pattern examples in Supplementary Fig. 16).

Health literacy definition and determinants—Health literacy is defined as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services they need to make appropriate health decisions." In general literacy is described as having "three components: 1) print literacy (writing and reading), 2) oral literacy (listening and speaking), and 3) numeracy (using and understanding numbers)." The abstract notes multiple contributors to understanding, including "cultural factors, a physician’s health knowledge and communication skills, the demands of the situation, the environment in which the health information is being conveyed, and time constraints."

### "Is it realistic? " the portrayal of pregnancy and childbirth in the media [^7ee36ee5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Scoping reviews map relevant literature in the field of interest, including the ‘grey literature’. The latter includes practitioners' journals, conference papers, unpublished dissertations, books, literature from a range of public, private and voluntary sector bodies and government publications. Scoping reviews do not seek to limit the included literature to a certain type of study (e.g. randomised controlled trials) but instead use broad inclusion criteria. Like a systematic review, the process is rigorous and transparent and documented in detail to enable the review to be replicated.

The following electronic databases were searched Medline, Pubmed, NHS Evidence, Academic Search Complete, MIDIRS, Education Research Complete, CINAHL Plus, Scopus, Intute, Zetoc and Web of Knowledge. Databases were searched from their starting date until summer 2014. The following journals were hand-searched, ‘ Midwives (RCM)’, ‘Maternity & Infant Care’, ‘Media, Culture & Society’ and BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth.

Databases were searched using the key terms; ‘media representations’, ‘media influence’, ‘media effects’, ‘childbirth’, ‘labour/labor’. ‘The results of searching electronic databases are measured in terms of yield, recall and precision. However, a high yield does not necessarily result in high precision rates, example.g. ‘labour/labor’ yielded many studies on ‘employment’.

A total of 4,014 publications were identified and the titles and abstracts (where available) of the identified publications were screened and included if they met the following inclusion criteria: -
published in English;
included research (qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods approach);
contained portrayals of childbirth and/or labour in the media.

Figure 1 shows 56 publications met the inclusion criteria, as one was not available the full texts of 55 were reviewed, 38 were included and 17 were omitted (2 were editorials, 4 letters, 1 undergraduate essay, 2 book reviews and the remaining 8 were opinion pieces). All papers were read by two authors one with a media background (AL) and one with a health background (MC), thematic analysis was undertaken to identify the key themes through reading and re-reading the included publications. Selected papers were read by the remaining authors to help decide on disagreements between the first two readers and to verify all themes. As this is a secondary analysis of existing literature and no primary data were collected no ethical approval was required.

### Rapid reviews methods series: guidance on rapid scoping, mapping and evidence and gap map (' big picture reviews') [^96a3a3a7]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Reporting, data visualisation and presentation

The reporting stage of BPRs is often accompanied by visualisations (ie, graphical representation of different pieces of information or data) that support the summary of the extracted data. Clear dialogue with commissioners and KUs should inform how the data is collated, described and visualised. Visualisation is a particularly useful tool for a more accessible and readable report. Data might be presented in pie charts, bubble plots, tables, graphs, heat maps and word clouds.The review team should include those with expertise in reporting BPRs and data visualisation skills, considering accessibility for colour-blind readers. There exists a growing array of software resources that might be useful in both rapid and standard BPR approaches, and the Systematic Review Toolboxprovides an on-line regularly updated catalogue of tools that can support the review process.

In a rapid context, commissioners may prefer key findings to be presented in very concise and readable summaries and follow existing report formats.The methods used to conduct the review should also be transparently reported, including the potential risks to the generalisability and rigour of the review findings. One approach to reporting the methods includes placing the description of methods at the back of the report, and key findings highlighted in summary tables.In preparation for publication and wider dissemination, PRISMA-ScRis currently the recommended tool to inform reporting of the review.

### Weak supervision as an efficient approach for automated seizure detection in electroencephalography [^a60597ac]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1 
High-level view of integrating deep learning training within the clinical workflow.

After EEG monitoring on patients, a mixed group annotates the signal before a clinician does the final assessment to generate a medical report. In our work, we evaluate using weak labels, which are fast and cheap to acquire within the clinical workflow, to train deep learning models for onset seizure detection. On the other hand, existing methods use expert-provided gold labels, which are costly and not a part of the clinical workflow.

In this work, we present a deep learning model for the detection of seizure onset across different patients that is trained on a massive, weakly labeled dataset of scalp EEGs. This approach formally falls within the scope of weak supervision techniques, which include data programming, distant supervision, and crowdsourcing. We consider training labels drawn only from the weak annotations included with each EEG signal archived by a pediatric and an adult hospital at our institution—that is, we use no data hand-labeled by expert clinicians for model training. In total, our dataset consists of 136,014 EEG signals coming from 12,430 patients. For perspective, to obtain clinician-provided hand-labels for the number of signals we consider in this study—which cover 12 years of clinical practice at a major center—we conservatively estimate that it would require over 25,000 person-hours and $3 million dollars in clinician support (136,014 EEG signals, $125/hour for the clinician rate, and a median EEG read time of 12.5 min). Since clinicians usually read EEG signals in 10–15 s-long pages, we observed that some seizures may be detected in the scope of a single page, while other seizures require viewing multiple pages after seizure onset for accurate detection. We consider these different time scales by building models for 12-s clips to simulate fast detection (i.e. single-page) scenarios, and 60-s clips to simulate slow detection (i.e. multi-page) scenarios (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for examples). In each case, we evaluate the effectiveness of using weak annotations for model supervision. We use only the most common 10–20 subset of EEG leads to ensure that our model is applicable to as many patients as possible. Our fast detection models achieve an average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.91 on pediatric patients, while attaining a lower average (AUROC) of 0.82 on adult patients. On the other hand, our slow-detection models provide improved performance levels of 0.93 AUROC on pediatrics and 0.94 AUROC on adults. We also compare our models with traditional machine learning approaches for seizure detection, with models trained on a publicly available EEG database, and with Persyst, a leading provider of clinically deployed software for automatically detecting seizures from EEG. Our models consistently outperform those trained using either traditional machine learning approaches on our dataset or the same model architecture on a publicly available EEG database. Further, our approach achieves higher performance than Persyst by 18 and 11 F1-points for pediatric and adult populations respectively, which suggests immediate clinical utility. In the following sections, we present related work, describe our experimental setup, evaluate the performance of our models, assess our results in the context of publicly available datasets, and analyze success and failure modes of the learned models from a clinical perspective.

Seasonal influenza epidemiology—Influenza seasonality varies geographically, and the risk for influenza exposure during travel depends on the time of year and destination. In temperate regions, epidemics are more common during cooler months, October–March in the Northern Hemisphere and April–September in the Southern Hemisphere. In subtropical and tropical regions, seasonal influenza epidemics follow a similar pattern, but influenza illnesses can occur throughout the year. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, there was a sharp decrease in global influenza activity.

### Demystifying the search button: a comprehensive PubMed search strategy for performing an exhaustive literature review [^d3b7a133]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

A general, unqualified PubMed search will retrieve citations through several different pathways. Wherever possible, PubMed will translate the user’s search terms into MeSH terminology, a process known as Automatic Term Mapping. Frequently, however, this is not possible, and PubMed must rely on the less sophisticated indexing system of word searching.When a search word does not map to a MeSH term, PubMed looks for the search phrase in other fields of the document. It first attempts to match the phrase to a journal name, then to an author name, then to a name of a research investigator, and finally it searches for the phrase in [all fields].A search in [all fields] includes areas such as the title field, the author field, the publication date field, and an abstract field when available.It then breaks the search phrase into its component words and repeats the above process for each individual word. While this may retrieve many relevant articles, these articles will be interspersed with an abundance of irrelevant articles. Many users circumnavigate this inconvenience by employing the “PubMed Related Citations” feature available on the right side of any PubMed search results page (Figure 1).

### Practical guide to choosing an appropriate data display [^63bd2040]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The primary objective of graphing research data is to communicate key information visually in a rapid, accurate, and concise way. Graphs might be considered visual take-home lessons of the major point(s) of the manuscript. In choosing a graph, it is tempting to concentrate only on ways of illustrating summary statements characterizing the group(s). However, individual patients are unique, and their characteristics or outcomes may not be predicted by a group summary. Consequently, if possible, graphs should demonstrate individual responses as well as group summaries. "Graphical literacy," "graphical excellence," and "graphical acumen" are achievable with work and collaboration. To produce a well-designed graph, a combination of by-subject detail and overall results should be the goal within the same illustration. The practice gap addressed in this article is that little attention from authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers seems to be paid to graphical literacy. The purpose of this article is to present some practical guidelines for choosing or evaluating more appropriate data displays.

### Healthy, happy, rational: reflections on genetic counselling in the GDR [^fd21fca5]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 1977, the popular magazine Neue Berliner Illustrierte (NBI) titled its cover story ‘Genes under Control? [Gene im Griff]’. 1 Regine Witkowski, the main author of the principal book on genetic counselling in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), was featured in large print on the front page, dressed in a white coat, with a colourful shirt and scarf underneath. 2 Holding a roll of paper printed with chromosomes in her left hand, she is looking in a friendly manner into the camera. Her professional, yet not overly stiff, appearance radiates reliability, attentiveness and confidence. The published story ‘Genes under Control?’ included a one-page interview with Witkowski about genetic counselling. Its subheading ‘Do we have the genes under control?’ was intended to catch the reader’s eye by playing on their supposed fear of loss of control. However, this fear is immediately countered by a black box, positioned under the article title, which contains a more formal, professional photo of Witkowski, accompanied by her name and academic title, and the line: ‘Hereditary diseases – Evil under control’. Thus, even a reader who does not read the whole interview gets the central message: do not worry! (, 16).

Nepal—malaria epidemiology and traveler risk indicate very low incidence and limited exposure areas. Although targeted for complete elimination of malaria by 2020, Nepal continues to report low (and decreasing) numbers of indigenous cases, primarily Plasmodium vivax, and the World Health Organization reported only 36 cases in the whole country in 2022, down from over 2,000 a decade before. Although the vector for malaria can exist at altitudes below 2,000 meters (6,500 feet), the risk of malaria is limited to remote parts of Nepal rarely visited by tourists, and in 40 years of monitoring by the main clinic that cares for foreigners in Nepal, there have been fewer than 5 cases, all from remote areas that tourists almost never visit.

Essential elements for systematic reviews using crowdsourcing or previous “known” assessments in the selection process

If crowdsourcing was used to screen records, provide details of the platform used and specify how it was integrated within the overall study selection process.
If datasets of already-screened records were used to eliminate records retrieved by the search from further consideration, briefly describe the derivation of these datasets. For example, if prior work has already determined that a given record does not meet the eligibility criteria, it can be removed without manual checking. This is the case for Cochrane’s Screen4Me service, in which an increasingly large dataset of records that are known not to represent randomised trials can be used to eliminate any matching records from further consideration.

Example of item 8 of PRISMA 2020 checklist

“Three researchers (AP, HB-R, FG) independently reviewed titles and abstracts of the first 100 records and discussed inconsistencies until consensus was obtained. Then, in pairs, the researchers independently screened titles and abstracts of all articles retrieved. In case of disagreement, consensus on which articles to screen full-text was reached by discussion. If necessary, the third researcher was consulted to make the final decision. Next, two researchers (AP, HB-R) independently screened full-text articles for inclusion. Again, in case of disagreement, consensus was reached on inclusion or exclusion by discussion and if necessary, the third researcher (FG) was consulted.”

### Basic mapping principles for visualizing cancer data using geographic information systems (GIS) [^636f342e]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Maps and other data graphics may play a role in generating ideas and hypotheses at the beginning of a project. They are useful as part of analyses for evaluating model results and then at the end of a project when researchers present their results and conclusions to varied audiences, such as their local research group, decision makers, or a concerned public. Cancer researchers are gaining skill with geographic information system (GIS) mapping as one of their many tools and are broadening the symbolization approaches they use for investigating and illustrating their data. A single map is one of many possible representations of the data, so making multiple maps is often part of a complete mapping effort. Symbol types, color choices, and data classing each affect the information revealed by a map and are best tailored to the specific characteristics of data. Related data can be examined in series with coordinated classing and can also be compared using multivariate symbols that build on the basic rules of symbol design. Informative legend wording and setting suitable map projections are also basic to skilled mapmaking.

### A global map of travel time to cities to assess inequalities in accessibility in 2015 [^3a128e66]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

The economic and man-made resources that sustain human wellbeing are not distributed evenly across the world, but are instead heavily concentrated in cities. Poor access to opportunities and services offered by urban centres (a function of distance, transport infrastructure, and the spatial distribution of cities) is a major barrier to improved livelihoods and overall development. Advancing accessibility worldwide underpins the equity agenda of 'leaving no one behind' established by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. This has renewed international efforts to accurately measure accessibility and generate a metric that can inform the design and implementation of development policies. The only previous attempt to reliably map accessibility worldwide, which was published nearly a decade ago, predated the baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals and excluded the recent expansion in infrastructure networks, particularly in lower-resource settings. In parallel, new data sources provided by Open Street Map and Google now capture transportation networks with unprecedented detail and precision. Here we develop and validate a map that quantifies travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre by integrating ten global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and 13,840 high-density urban centres within an established geospatial-modelling framework. Our results highlight disparities in accessibility relative to wealth as 50.9% of individuals living in low-income settings (concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa) reside within an hour of a city compared to 90.7% of individuals in high-income settings. By further triangulating this map against socioeconomic datasets, we demonstrate how access to urban centres stratifies the economic, educational, and health status of humanity.

### Reproducibility: let's get it right from the start [^692b7962]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

“…the trio of published checklists, source data and reviewer reports together will represent powerful proof of the strength and rigor of the published work and the peer review process that helped to improve it.”

To further promote transparency, we will also be asking our authors to supply for publication the source data underlying any graphs and charts, and uncropped, unprocessed scans of any blots or gels. In order to avoid delaying the first round of peer review, we will initially only request that source data be supplied with the revised versions of the manuscript, unless we feel that it would be particularly important for the reviewers to have access to these data at an earlier stage. However, we strongly encourage authors to lead the way in promoting transparency by making sure that their work fulfils or exceeds our criteria right from the start. Here are four simple steps you can take to give your paper the best possible chance of flying through peer review:
Define your n numbers : just stating ‘ n = 5’ is no longer sufficient—it must be clear what your n number refers to for each experiment. For example, did you do the experiment on five plants, on five tissue samples from the same plant, or did you run the same sample for analysis five times over? You should be able to justify your choice of sample size and statistical tests in the reporting summary.
Show us the spread : bar charts with error bars are commonly used to depict numerical data, but they can be misleading when sample sizes are small. Wherever possible, use graph types that include individual data points to directly show the spread of the data.
Make it available : before submitting your paper, take a close look at ouron the availability of materials, data and code, and craft clear availability statements in your paper that explain to reviewers and future readers how they can access everything they might need to reproduce your findings. For some types of data, deposition in an approved publicly accessible database is mandatory for publication, but don’t stop there: include source data with your manuscript, and make use of repositories such asto make other data available to your reviewers and readers. For datasets with high re-use value, consider also submitting a data descriptor to our sister journal,, and making the dataset publicly available through one of their.
Let us be your guide : the reporting summary and solar cells and lasing reporting summaries detail a lot of important information that can be used not just to help you describe your experimental design, figures of merit, the materials used and the analysis employed, but also to plan the experiment in the first place. Taking care to consider these requirements before you conduct your experiments will improve your chances of successful publication in any journal.

Explanation: Authors should provide a detailed description of the information sources, such as bibliographic databases, registers and reference lists that were searched or consulted, including the dates when each source was last searched, to allow readers to assess the completeness and currency of the systematic review, and facilitate updating.Authors should fully report the “what, when, and how” of the sources searched; the “what” and “when” are covered in item #6, and the “how” is covered in item #7. Further guidance and examples about searching can be found in PRISMA-Search, an extension to the PRISMA statement for reporting literature searches in systematic reviews.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### The physical maps for sequencing human chromosomes 1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 20 and X [^214bc9a6]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

We constructed maps for eight chromosomes (1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 20, X and (previously) 22), representing one-third of the genome, by building landmark maps, isolating bacterial clones and assembling contigs. By this approach, we could establish the long-range organization of the maps early in the project, and all contig extension, gap closure and problem-solving was simplified by containment within local regions. The maps currently represent more than 94% of the euchromatic (gene-containing) regions of these chromosomes in 176 contigs, and contain 96% of the chromosome-specific markers in the human gene map. By measuring the remaining gaps, we can assess chromosome length and coverage in sequenced clones.

### Outcomes of treated hypertension at age 80 and older: cohort analysis of 79, 376 individuals [^4ac3fd96]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Data were from 79,376 individuals aged 80 and older who met inclusion criteria for the analysis. Mean age was 82.1 ± 3.3, and 30.5% were men (Table 1). The average number of BP measurements according to SBP category varied from 7.2 for SBP less than 125 mmHg to 13.4 for SBP of 165 to 174 mmHg (Table S3). There were trends in covariates across SBP (e.g. current or recent smoking 24% at SBP <125 mmHg and 18% at SBP >185 mmHg) (Table 1). Maximum follow‐up was 11.9 years (overall mean 4.4 ± 2.9 years), with mean follow‐up times somewhat shorter in the low SBP groups.

### Evolution of wikipedia's medical content: past, present and future [^562ef408]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Some background on the encyclopaedia and its relatives

Wikipedia is a massive online encyclopaedia with global reach and recognition.Its total content has grown rapidly since its inception in 2001, with 44 million articles across 295 languages, including >5.4 million in English as of May 2017 (figure 1A,B). The English-language Wikipedia is the largest and best known project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), and will be the main focus of this article. Other projects host open-access images, education materials and structured data.

Figure 1 
Wikipedia total size and editors. (A) Total number of articles in the encyclopaedia (all languages). (B) Total number of articles in the encyclopaedia (in English). (C) Total number of editors making >100 edits per month (in English). (D) The proportion of the top 10 most spoken languages (native + secondary) compared with the size of different language versions of Wikipedia, and usage on the internet as a whole.

After initial exponential growth of key topics, the English Wikipedia has settled into a slower, linear growth, as more niche topics and current affairs are added. These articles are written and edited by a community of approximately 30 000 editors that make >5 edits per month, and 3000 that make >100 edits per month. This number is down from its peak in 2007, when stricter content guidelines were introduced, but has remained stable over recent years, with a minor increase as easier writing and editing and tools are introduced (figure 1C). The size of the different language versions of Wikipedia is skewed towards English, although less in proportion to the internet as a whole (figure 1D).

Common criticisms of Wikipedia include concerns over content quality, coverage, readability and vandalism. However, much has been done to make Wikipedia’s open editing system remarkably robust—from editor culture and policies (eg, increased focus on reliable references)to technological improvements (eg, automated software that reverts vandalism).This has been reflected by improvements in perceived accuracy by readers.As the encyclopaedia’s contents, editors and policies change over time, studies of it can quickly go out of date. This article therefore aims to give an overview of the past, present and possible future of Wikipedia’s medical content.

### PRISMA 2020 explanation and elaboration: updated guidance and exemplars for reporting systematic reviews [^5555b031]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Study selection

Item 16a. Describe the results of the search and selection process, from the number of records identified in the search to the number of studies included in the review, ideally using a flow diagram (see fig 1)

Fig 1 
PRISMA 2020 flow diagram template for systematic reviews (adapted from flow diagrams proposed by Boersand Mayo-Wilson et al.and Stovold et al.). The boxes in grey should only be completed if applicable; otherwise they should be removed from the flow diagram. Note that a “report” could be a journal article, preprint, conference abstract, study register entry, clinical study report, dissertation, unpublished manuscript, government report or any other document providing relevant information.

Explanation: Review authors should report, ideally with a flow diagram (see fig 1), the results of the search and selection process so that readers can understand the flow of retrieved records through to inclusion in the review. Such information is useful for future systematic review teams seeking to estimate resource requirements and for information specialists in evaluating their searches.Specifying the number of records yielded per database will make it easier for others to assess whether they have successfully replicated a search. The flow diagram in figure 1 provides a template of the flow of records through the review separated by source, although other layouts may be preferable depending on the information sources consulted.

### The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate healthcare interventions: explanation and elaboration [^690870d2]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

How to use this paper

We modeled this explanation and elaboration document after those prepared for other reporting guidelines.To maximise the benefit of this document, we encourage people to read it in conjunction with the PRISMA statement.

We present each checklist item and follow it with a published exemplar of good reporting for that item. (We edited some examples by removing citations or web addresses, or by spelling out abbreviations.) We then explain the pertinent issue, the rationale for including the item, and relevant evidence from the literature, whenever possible. No systematic search was carried out to identify exemplars and evidence. We also include seven boxes at the end of the document that provide a more comprehensive explanation of certain thematic aspects of the methodology and conduct of systematic reviews.

Although we focus on a minimal list of items to consider when reporting a systematic review, we indicate places where additional information is desirable to improve transparency of the review process. We present the items numerically from 1 to 27; however, authors need not address items in this particular order in their reports. Rather, what is important is that the information for each item is given somewhere within the report.

### Understanding systematic reviews and meta-analyses [ formula: see text ] [^a0b57635]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews should be distinguished from narrative reviews. In the latter, an editor asks an expert to sum up all of the information that is known about a particular topic. However, the expert is under no constraints regarding what he or she does, or does not, choose to include in the review. As a result, his or her bias can influence the final message. A systematic review, which may or may not be written by experts, typically asks a narrower question, and then answers it using the entirety of the medical literature. The systematic review process includes computer searches to identify the pertinent literature, a statement of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for identified studies, a list of items of interest to extract from each study, a method to assess the quality of each study, a summary of the evidence that has been found (which may or may not involve attempts to combine data), a discussion of the evidence and the limitations of the conclusions, and suggestions for future research efforts. If the data are combined, that process is called meta-analysis. In meta-analysis, an estimate of the reliability of each study is made, and those that appear to be more reliable are weighed more heavily when the data are combined. While systematic reviews depend on a more preplanned method and thus, unlike narrative reviews, contain sections on method, they can be easily read once the reader becomes familiar with the vocabulary.
