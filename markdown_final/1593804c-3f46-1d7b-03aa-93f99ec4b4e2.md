## Question

Femoral anteversion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about femoral anteversion, including its definition, normal ranges, developmental patterns, measurement methods, biomechanical consequences, and management across pediatric, arthroscopy, and arthroplasty contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining femoral anteversion and its normal ranges. Then, I should verify developmental changes and population variability. Next, I will review measurement techniques and their validity. After that, I need to analyze biomechanical consequences and clinical associations. Finally, I will consider management strategies in pediatrics, hip arthroscopy, and total hip arthroplasty, and close with a concise synthesis and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition and normal values. Femoral anteversion is the axial-plane angle between the femoral neck axis and the transcondylar axis of the distal femur, typically expressed as anteversion when positive and retroversion when negative, with a commonly cited adult normal range around 12–20 degrees, though population means hover near 14–15 degrees with substantial interindividual variability [^c77f1b26] [^00efbee5] [^9f6d5758].

> Wait, let me verify developmental patterns before drawing conclusions. Femoral anteversion is high at birth, often 30–40 degrees, and declines rapidly in early childhood by roughly 1.5 degrees per year until about age 8, then more slowly to adult values by skeletal maturity; this trajectory explains why many children with intoeing improve spontaneously over time [^132ae7f4] [^2eeb9330].

> Hold on, I should verify population variability and symmetry. Healthy adults show a wide range of femoral anteversion, approximately 5–30 degrees, with side-to-side differences averaging about 2–5 degrees but exceeding 10–15 degrees in a meaningful minority; importantly, femoral version more closely mirrors the contralateral limb than a fixed population mean, which matters for surgical planning and trauma reconstruction [^00efbee5] [^e2e9405a].

> Next, I should review measurement methods and their accuracy. CT remains the reference standard for femoral version, with excellent reliability and small interobserver error; MRI correlates with CT but tends to underestimate anteversion by about 3–9 degrees depending on technique and positioning, so thresholds should be adjusted if using MRI; clinical tests have moderate agreement with imaging and a wide confidence interval, limiting standalone diagnostic utility [^e2e9405a] [^9f6d5758] [^ad9d0546].

> I need to check whether radiographic alternatives can substitute for CT. A modified Budin radiographic view shows excellent correlation with CT in method-comparison studies, and EOS biplanar imaging correlates strongly with CT in typical ranges but performs less reliably in malrotated or deformed femurs; thus, modality choice should balance accuracy needs, radiation, and patient factors [^a79f3a91] [^4b3fbb8b].

> Let me consider the biomechanical consequences of abnormal version. Increased femoral anteversion is associated with greater hip internal rotation and reduced external rotation, which can drive patellofemoral maltracking, anterior hip microinstability, and higher contact pressures; conversely, femoral retroversion limits internal rotation and predisposes to anterior femoroacetabular impingement and labral injury, with both extremes linked to osteoarthritis risk over time [^c77f1b26] [^86672775] [^868219a5].

> But wait, what if multiple deformities coexist. I should double-check that impingement and instability factors frequently coexist; indeed, two or more impingement or instability parameters are present in the majority of painful hips, underscoring the need to assess femoral and acetabular version together rather than in isolation [^213d8bb5].

> Now, I will examine pediatric management. Most children with increased femoral anteversion improve spontaneously, so observation is appropriate unless there is severe functional limitation, tripping, or cosmetic concern; when indicated, derotational osteotomy with intramedullary fixation achieves reliable correction and functional gains, with low nonunion risk when canal fit and dynamic locking are optimized [^52f3e0ab] [^31ac2047] [^bde8bee5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in hip arthroscopy. Outcomes after arthroscopy are mixed in the setting of abnormal version; systematic reviews suggest no clear disadvantage for acetabular retroversion but poorer results in high femoral anteversion, particularly when combined with dysplasia or microinstability; therefore, version should be measured preoperatively and osteotomy considered when version extremes threaten arthroscopic success [^72f97a50] [^66f92b36].

> I should confirm THA implications next. Stem anteversion is constrained by native femoral anatomy and varies with implant design, so combined anteversion strategy is essential; changing femoral anteversion during THA alters anterior offset and femoral rotation, and increases in anteversion are associated with postoperative ischiofemoral impingement, especially after anterior approach; preserving preoperative femoral anteversion and using navigation or robotic assistance can improve accuracy and mitigate iatrogenic complications [^2b376cb2] [^1a3f280f] [^658d5499].

> Let me reconsider the overarching message. Femoral anteversion is a key determinant of hip and lower-extremity mechanics with broad clinical implications; accurate measurement, recognition of developmental and individual variability, and context-specific management — observation in most children, selective osteotomy in symptomatic adolescents and adults, and combined anteversion planning in arthroplasty — are critical to optimizing outcomes and avoiding persistent pain, instability, or impingement [^c77f1b26] [^00efbee5] [^17769aeb].

---

Femoral anteversion is the **axial rotation of the femoral neck** relative to the distal condyles, with a normal adult range of 10–20° [^c77f1d26]. It is best measured by **CT or MRI** [^9f6d5758], as clinical tests are less accurate [^ad9d0546]. Excessive anteversion (> 20°) increases hip internal rotation and can cause intoeing, patellofemoral pain, and instability [^86672775], whereas retroversion (< 10°) limits internal rotation and predisposes to impingement and osteoarthritis [^c77f1d26]. Management is individualized: observation for mild cases, physical therapy for symptoms, and derotational osteotomy for severe or refractory cases [^f57c1406] [^31ac2047]. In THA, combined anteversion principles guide implant positioning to balance stability and wear [^17769aeb] [^e31aecf2].

## Normal values and anatomical variations

- **Normal range**: 10–20° in adults, with a mean around 15° [^c77f1d26] [^92d0cff8].
- **Development**: High at birth (~30–40°), decreasing to adult values by age 8–10 [^132ae7f4] [^2eeb9330].
- **Variability**: Wide interindividual range (5–30°) and side-to-side differences up to 10–15° are common [^00efbee5] [^e2e9405a].

---

## Measurement methods

| **Method** | **Accuracy and reliability** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| CT | Gold standard; high accuracy and reliability [^e2e9405a] | Widely used for surgical planning |
| MRI | High correlation with CT; slightly lower values (~3–9°) [^9f6d5758] | Useful without radiation; longer scan time |
| Clinical exam (prone, trochanteric prominence) | Moderate agreement with MRI (ICC ≈ 0.7); SEM ≈ 6° [^ad9d0546] | Screening tool; limited precision |
| EOS biplanar radiography | Strong correlation with CT; low radiation [^4b3fbb8b] | Alternative to CT; limited availability |

## Clinical implications of abnormal femoral anteversion

### Increased femoral anteversion

- **Gait**: Intoeing, clumsy gait, frequent tripping [^2eeb9330].
- **Hip mechanics**: Increased internal rotation, decreased external rotation, anterior instability [^c77f1d26] [^86672775].
- **Patellofemoral**: Maltracking, pain, instability, elevated contact pressures [^868219a5] [^6b8f6e4f].
- **Hip pathology**: Labral tears, microinstability, earlier osteoarthritis [^c77f1d26] [^7d74ae00].

---

### Decreased femoral anteversion (retroversion)

- **Impingement**: Limited internal rotation, anterior femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears [^c77f1d26] [^bb00b163].
- **Osteoarthritis**: Higher risk due to impingement and cartilage damage [^c77f1d26] [^11679727].
- **SCFE**: Increased risk in adolescents [^b29ad4f1].

---

## Associated conditions

- **Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH)**: Often increased anteversion [^efa989e6].
- **Cerebral palsy**: Common excessive anteversion with gait disturbances [^b91f4c67].
- **Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)**: Higher prevalence of retroversion [^b29ad4f1].
- **Patellar instability**: Linked to increased anteversion and altered TT-TG [^f4465895] [^e0a442a0].

---

## Management strategies

### Non-surgical management

Non-surgical management includes **observation** for mild, asymptomatic cases — especially in children, given spontaneous improvement [^52f3e0ab] — and **physical therapy** focused on core and hip muscle strengthening, gait training, and patellofemoral stabilization [^notfound].

---

### Surgical management

- **Indications**: Severe symptoms, functional impairment, or failure of conservative care [^notfound].
- **Procedure**: Derotational femoral osteotomy (subtrochanteric or diaphyseal) with internal fixation [^f57c1406] [^31ac2047].
- **Outcomes**: Improved gait, reduced pain, and enhanced function; high satisfaction in adolescents and adults [^31ac2047] [^f6c5ec1b].

---

## Femoral anteversion in total hip arthroplasty (THA)

- **Importance**: Critical for implant stability, wear, and dislocation risk [^e31aecf2].
- **Combined anteversion**: Sum of femoral and acetabular anteversion; target ~37° (range 25–50°) [^17769aeb] [^2295e2af].
- **Implant positioning**: Adjust cup anteversion to femoral stem anteversion to stay within the safe zone [^17769aeb] [^2295e2af].
- **Navigation/robotics**: Improve accuracy of femoral and combined anteversion [^658d5499] [^2295e2af].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Normal range**: 10–20° in adults, with developmental decline from infancy [^c77f1d26] [^132ae7f4].
- **Measurement**: CT/MRI are preferred; clinical exam is less accurate [^9f6d5758] [^ad9d0546].
- **Excessive anteversion**: Causes intoeing, instability, patellofemoral pain, and early osteoarthritis [^86672775] [^6b8f6e4f].
- **Retroversion**: Causes impingement, limited internal rotation, and osteoarthritis [^c77f1d26] [^11679727].
- **Management**: Individualized; observation, PT, or derotational osteotomy as indicated [^f57c1406] [^31ac2047].
- **THA**: Combined anteversion guides implant positioning for stability and longevity [^17769aeb] [^e31aecf2].

---

Femoral anteversion is a key rotational parameter of the proximal femur; **accurate assessment and management** are essential to address gait abnormalities, hip instability, and joint degeneration, and to optimize outcomes in hip preservation and arthroplasty.

### How Do changes in femoral anteversion impact femoral rotation and anterior offset after total hip arthroplasty? [^2b376cb2]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of femoral anteversion changes on femoral rotation and anterior offset following total hip arthroplasty (THA) has not been well studied. This study therefore investigated the relationship among femoral anteversion, anterior offset, and femoral rotation before and after THA.

Methods

There were 995 patients who had staged primary bilateral THAs who received a preoperative supine computerized axial tomography (CT) scan, following a standardized protocol, for surgical planning prior to each THA. The following measurements were performed for the first operative hip preoperatively and postoperatively on the first and second CT scans, respectively: femoral anatomic anteversion, defined as the angle between the native femoral neck or stem neck axis and the posterior condylar axis; femoral rotation, defined as the angle of the posterior condylar axis relative to the coronal plane of the CT; and femoral anterior offset, defined as the shortest distance between the femoral head center and a femoral plane containing the epicondyles and the piriformis fossa. The mean time between imagings was 11 months (range, 2 to 44). Associations are described using linear regression (β = slope) and Pearson correlation (r) coefficients. A t distribution was used for testing correlation.

Results

Femoral anteversion correlated with femoral anterior offset preoperatively (β = 0.565, r = 0.914, P < 0.001) and postoperatively (β = 0.671, r = 0.958, P < 0.001), and with femoral rotation preoperatively (β = 0.623, r = 0.575, P < 0.001) and postoperatively (β = 0.459, r = 0.517, P < 0.001). Increasing anteversion from preoperatively to postoperatively increased anterior offset (β = 0.621, r = 0.908, P < 0.001) and femoral internal rotation (IR) (β = 0.241, r = 0.273, P < 0.001). Patients who had > 20° increase in anteversion (mean increase 26°, range 20 to 40.5°, n = 71) had a mean increase in femoral IR of 9.6 ± 9.8°.

Conclusions

Increasing femoral anteversion increases anterior offset and IR of the femur, with approximately a 1° increase in IR for every 4° increase in anteversion on average. Surgeons should appreciate the implications of changing anteversion during THA planning.

### Does femoral rotation more closely mirror the contralateral side or a population mean of 15 degrees of anteversion? A radiologic study of 219 healthy patients [^00efbee5]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare whether femoral version more closely mirrors the contralateral femur or a population norm estimate of 15° of anteversion.

Design

Radiologic observational study.

Setting

Level I Trauma Center.

Patient Selection Criteria

Patients with no history of anatomy-altering femoral injury who underwent bilateral lower extremity CT scans. Outcome Measures and Comparisons: CTs were analyzed to measure femoral version on each side. The asymmetry in femoral version between left and right in each patient (interfemoral rotational variance [IRV]) was recorded. The difference of each femur's version from a proposed population mean of 15° of anteversion was also recorded.

Results

219 patients with a mean femoral version of 14.9° ± 10.5° of anteversion were included. Mean IRV was 5.3°, compared to 8.2° of mean variation from the population norm of 15° of anteversion (p < 0.001). Five percent of patients had IRV > 15° compared to 15% that had femoral rotation > 15° from the population mean of 15° (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In the setting of a comminuted diaphyseal femur fracture, knowledge of the appropriate target for restoration of rotational alignment is critical. This radiologic cohort study found that on average, femoral version more closely mirrors an individual patient's contralateral femur as opposed to a population norm of 15° of anteversion.

### Editorial commentary: both femoral acetabular anteversion and retroversion may contribute to the effect of femoroacetabular impingement: what's your version? [^386afa13]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Femoral anteversion may be a protective factor for hip impingement, whereas hip arthroscopy outcomes are worse for patients with femoral retroversion. Changes in version also affect the location of impingement. The association of increased anteversion with cam lesions may also explain the high number of patients with asymptomatic cam lesions. Thus, some patients may have large α angles but be asymptomatic. Finally, although femoral version is important, it must be considered in the setting of the patient's acetabular morphology. There is a complex interplay of femoral and acetabular morphologies.

### Combined anteversion in healthy hips: should there Be a single implant alignment target in total hip arthroplasty? [^368a9374]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The ideal anteversion at which the acetabular and femoral components for a total hip arthroplasty (THA) should be implanted is still a subject of debate. An alignment philosophy being explored is restoration of individual constitutional femoral and acetabular anteversion. This study aimed to measure combined anteversion in a healthy hip population and understand the expected phenotypes and ranges for constitutional hip alignment.

Methods

Computed tomography scans of 338 healthy hips were analyzed using advanced modeling and analysis software that automatically maps landmarks consistently across all scans. Four distinct methods for measuring the acetabular and femoral versions were employed, each derived from different landmark placements. Acetabular and femoral versions were classified as either normal (10 to 20°), increased (> 20°), or decreased (< 10°), resulting in nine potential hip phenotypes, and the prevalence of each in the healthy population was determined.

Results

Femoral and acetabular version angles varied depending on the number of points used to measure them. There was wide variability in acetabular and femoral anteversion angles, ranging from 6 to 26° acetabular anteversion and from 5° retroversion to 32° femoral anteversion. Only 29% of hips were found to have constitutional combined anteversion between 20 and 40°, with acetabular version between 10° and 20° and femoral version between 10 and 20°.

Conclusions

There is increasing interest in individualized implant alignment for THA, since studies have shown the Lewinnek "safe zone" does not guarantee hip stability. The results found in this study suggest that a single target for implant alignment may not be optimal for recreating a patient's constitutional hip alignment. Further research should consider how changes in combined anteversion during THA implant placement can impact patient outcomes.

### Editorial commentary: increased femoral anteversion correlates with elevated patellofemoral contact pressures [^868219a5]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Internally rotating the femur increases pressures within the patellofemoral joint, particularly affecting the lateral facet of the cartilage. Although increased femoral anteversion is commonly associated with patellofemoral instability and elevated contact pressures, thresholds for surgical intervention remain elusive. Biomechanical studies have reinforced this association, yet methodologic compromises-particularly disruption of native soft-tissue structures-limit clinical applicability. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that individual variations in soft-tissue anatomy and quadriceps morphology influence susceptibility to lateral facet overload, even in the presence of "normal" skeletal alignment. These insights underscore the multifactorial nature of patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis and the need for refined models to better understand the true impact of femoral torsion. Until such data emerge, clinical decision making must remain cautious.

### Can anatomic measurements of stem anteversion angle Be considered as the functional anteversion angle? [^116e511e]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Stem anteversion angle is important in the combined anteversion theory to avoid implant impingement after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, anatomic measurements of stem anteversion angle may not represent functional anteversion of the femur if the femur undergoes axial rotation. Herein, the femoral rotational angle (FRA) was measured in supine and standing positions before and after THA to evaluate the difference between anatomic and functional measurements.

Methods

A total of 191 hips (174 patients) treated with THA for osteoarthritis were analyzed in this retrospective, case-controlled study. The FRA was measured as the angle between the posterior condylar line and the line through the bilateral anterior superior iliac spines (positive for external rotation) and was measured preoperatively and postoperatively in supine and standing positions with computed tomography segmentation and landmark localization of the pelvis and the femur followed by intensity-based 2D-3D registration. The number of cases in which the absolute FRA remained < 15° in both positions was also calculated.

Results

The average ± standard deviation preoperative FRA was 0.3° ± 8.3° in the supine position and -4.5° ± 8.8° during standing; the postoperative FRA was -3.8° ± 9.0° in supine and -14.3° ± 8.3° during standing. There were 134 cases (70%) in which the preoperative absolute FRA remained < 15° in both positions while only 85 hips (45%) remained < 15°, postoperatively.

Conclusion

Substantial variability was seen in the FRA, especially during the postoperative period. These results suggest that the anatomic stem anteversion angle may not represent the functional anteversion of the femur.

### Does native combined anteversion influence pain onset in patients with dysplastic hips? [^eac112d4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Combined anteversion is the sum of femoral and acetabular anteversion and represents their morphological relationship in the axial plane. Few studies have investigated the native combined anteversion in patients with symptomatic dysplastic hips.

Questions/Purposes

We hypothesized the following: (1) dysplastic hips have two distinct populations, which differ from each other and from normal hips in their combined anteversion; and (2) these populations differ clinically in terms of correlation between age of onset of symptoms and amount of anteversion.

Methods

We measured radiographic parameters by CT of 100 dysplastic hips in 76 patients who were symptomatic enough to undergo periacetabular osteotomy and of 50 normal hips in 44 patients who had CT scans as part of preparation for computer-navigated TKAs; these patients had no visible hip arthritis or dysplasia and no hip symptoms. Dysplastic hips were divided into the anteversion (83 hips) and retroversion groups (17 hips) based on acetabular version. Age at pain onset was determined from their medical charts.

Results

Combined anteversion in the anteversion group was greater than that in the retroversion and control groups: 47° ± 12°, 30° ± 16°, and 36° ± 9°, respectively. In the anteversion group, combined anteversion (r = -0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.66 to -0.27; p < 0.001) and femoral anteversion (r = -0.41; 95% CI, -0.60 to -0.19; p < 0.001) were associated with an earlier age at pain onset; however, no such relationships were observed in the retroversion group. After controlling for relevant potential confounding variables, we found that combined anteversion (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.07; p = 0.006) and Sharp angle (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02–1.17; p = 0.008) were associated with an earlier age of pain onset in the anteversion group.

Conclusions

These results suggest that not only lateral coverage of the femoral head, but also axial joint morphology is important for the development of pain in the anteversion group. Optimal combined anteversion should be considered during periacetabular osteotomy.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, prognostic study.

### Axial oblique CT to assess femoral anteversion [^d6e6c6f8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of our study was to compare anteversion measurements of a human cadaveric femur obtained using axial CT slices with axial oblique reformations along the femoral neck and assess how accuracy changes across a range of simulated femur positions.

Conclusion

Axial oblique reformations allow more accurate anteversion assessment than axial images with femoral flexion, extension, and internal and external rotation. Centers should consider replacing the standard straight axial technique with the axial oblique method for CT determination of femoral anteversion.

### Femoral anteversion in THA and its lack of correlation with native acetabular anteversion [^2e8055b5]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Several studies support the concept that, for optimum range of motion in THA, the combined femoral and acetabular anteversion should be some constant or fall within some "safe zone". When using a cementless femoral component, the surgeon has little control of the anteversion of the component since it is dictated by native femoral anteversion. Given this constraint, we asked whether the surgeon should use the native anteversion of the acetabulum as a target for implant position in THA. Forty-six patients scheduled for primary THA underwent CT scanning and preoperative planning using a computer workstation. The native acetabular anteversion and the native femoral anteversion were measured. Prosthetic femoral anteversion was measured on the workstation by three-dimensional templating of a straight-stemmed tapered implant. The mean of the sum of the native acetabular anteversion and native femoral anteversion was 28.9 degrees; however, 17% varied by 10 degrees to 15 degrees and 11% by more than 15 degrees. The mean of native femoral anteversion and prosthetic femoral anteversion was 13.8 degrees (range, -6.1 degrees-32.7 degrees) and 22.5 degrees (range, 1 degrees-39 degrees), respectively. Based on our data, we believe the surgeon should not use the native acetabular anteversion as a target for positioning the acetabular component.

### The combined anteversion technique for acetabular component anteversion [^17769aeb]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2008). Low credibility.

The combined anteversion technique for acetabular component placement of total hip arthroplasty is beneficial because of the surgeons' limited ability to control the anteversion of a cementless femoral stem. Our data show that the cementless stem anteversion can be 15 degrees different than anticipated. By determining femoral stem anteversion before positioning cup anteversion, the cup anteversion can be adjusted for the stem anteversion. The combined anteversion technique should provide a mean near 35 degrees with a safe zone of 25 degrees to 50 degrees.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^86672775]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — femoral version describes motion patterns and risk: excessive anteversion is characterized by increased femoral internal rotation and limited external rotation, whereas excessive retroversion shows the opposite limitation; a significant limitation in femoral rotation range of motion due to anteversion or retroversion may place an individual at risk for labral injury and increase their risk for developing hip osteoarthritis (OA).

### Long-term outcome of idiopathic increased femoral anteversion in 58 untreated individuals at a mean age of 46.2 years [^8545ffdf]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Increased femoral anteversion is a common problem in children, but the condition usually normalizes spontaneously over time. There is limited knowledge of the long-term consequences of persistently increased anteversion. The purpose of this study was to analyse the long-term functional complaints of untreated adults with idiopathic increased anteversion compared with a control group.

Methods

Study participants were recruited from our institutional register of increased femoral anteversion during the period 1975 to 2008. Inclusion criteria were anteversion angle ≥ 30 degrees and no other disorders affecting the lower limbs. Outcome measures were the HAGOS and KOOS questionnaires, radiographic signs of osteoarthritis, and clinical examination. A control group of 24 healthy individuals was examined with the same methods.

Results

Fifty-eight patients (46 females) with a mean age of 46.2 years were included in the AV group. The mean anteversion angle was of 40.2 degrees in the anteversion group and 20.6 degrees in the controls. The mean external foot progression angle was 0.5 degrees in the anteversion group and 4.6 degrees in the controls (P < 0.001). The anteversion group scored significantly worse than the control group in 5 out of 6 HAGOS subscales: Pain (P = 0.032), Symptoms (P = 0.041), Sport/Rec (P = 0.001), PA (P = 0.036), and QOL (P = 0.001). The KOOS subscale Symptoms was the only subscale with a worse score in the AV group (P = 0.006). Only 1 patient in the anteversion group had hip osteoarthritis.

Conclusions

Untreated adults with idiopathic increased femoral AV at a mean age of 46 years experienced more hip pain and limitations in participation in physical activities and sports compared with healthy individuals, but the limitations were mostly small to moderate and would hardly influence the present strict indications for surgical correction in children.

Level Of Evidence

### Concurrent criterion-related validity and reliability of a clinical test to measure femoral anteversion [^ad9d0546]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Clinical measurement, criterion standard.

Objectives

To determine if the clinical measure of femoral anteversion is comparable to measures obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An additional purpose of this study was to assess the intertester and intratester reliability of the clinical test.

Background

Femoral anteversion is commonly assessed as part of the physical examination; however, limited and inconsistent data exist on the validity and reliability of the clinical test.

Methods

Eighteen healthy adults (9 males, 9 females; mean ± SD age, 25.4 ± 3.3 years; body mass index, 22.9 ± 3.4 kg/m²) participated. Each underwent 3 data collection sessions: (1) MRI to measure femoral anteversion, (2) clinical testing of femoral anteversion, measured independently by 2 physical therapists, and (3) repeated clinical testing. Validity and reliability were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC₂,₃) and standard error of measurement (SEM).

Results

Moderate agreement was found between the clinical test and MRI measures of femoral anteversion (ICCs of 0.69 and 0.67 for examiners 1 and 2, respectively). The SEM was similar for both examiners (5.8 degrees and 6.0 degrees). Both intra tester (ICCs of 0.88 and 0.90 for examiners 1 and 2, respectively) and intertester (ICC = 0.83) reliability was found to be substantial.

Conclusions

In persons with a low body mass index, the clinical test to assess femoral anteversion was shown to exhibit substantial reliability, but only moderate agreement with MRI measurements. When performing the clinical test, one can be 95% confident that the true value of femoral anteversion will fall within 11.8 degrees of the clinically measured value. This relatively wide confidence interval calls into question the clinical utility of the clinical test for assessing femoral anteversion.

### An anatomic study on whether femoral version originates in the neck or the shaft [^222954e3]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Femoral anteversion is generally asymptomatic but can result in lower extremity issues like patellofemoral instability and pain. Surgical correction of anteversion can be performed proximal, mid shaft or distal. A better understanding of the specific location of the rotational deformity can help guide the optimal location of the osteotomy. In this study we examine the contribution of the femoral neck and shaft to total femoral version.

Methods

We studied 590 pairs of well-preserved cadaveric femurs. Total femoral version was defined as the axial plane angle between the femoral neck and posterior femoral condyles. Femoral shaft torsion was defined as the axial plane angle between the lesser trochanter and posterior femoral condyles. Neck version was the mathematical difference between total femoral version and shaft version.

Results

Neck version (right femur R = 0.582; left femur R = 0.632) contributed slightly more than shaft version (right femur R = 0.505; left femur R = 0.480) to overall femoral version, but both were substantial and neither completely predicted overall femoral version. Age was not found to contribute to femoral version, and sex and race had statistically significant but small contributions.

Conclusions

Our data show that both the femoral neck and femoral shaft substantially contribute to femoral version, and to our knowledge is the first to statistically demonstrate that neither level can be used to predict total femoral version. This suggests that one cannot generalize a single optimal site for correction or prediction of femoral version from an osteological perspective, and that individualized assessment may be beneficial.

Clinical Relevance

This study suggests that methodologies for determining the level of femoral version might be important as the level in any given patient can vary.

### Decision making and management of anterior knee pain in young patients with pathological femoral anteversion: a critical analysis review [^6b8f6e4f]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathological femoral anteversion (FAV) or femoral maltorsion is often overlooked as a cause of anterior knee pain (AKP). Therefore, it should be routinely evaluated during physical examination of the patient with AKP. FAV is a problem because it changes the direction of the quadriceps and thereby the force acting on the patellofemoral joint. The Murphy CT method comes closest to showing the anatomical reality when FAV is evaluated. The treatment of choice in a patient with AKP with symptomatic excessive FAV is the femoral derotational osteotomy. Before doing a derotational osteotomy, the hip joint should be evaluated to avoid hip pain. Currently, no scientific evidence supports the cutoff point at which derotational femoral osteotomy should be the treatment of choice in young patients with AKP with symptomatic pathological FAV. Furthermore, no evidence exists regarding the level at which the osteotomy must be done.

### Editorial commentary: a simple twist of fate: the ramifications of abnormal femoral version [^b50e90b8]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

The abnormalities of femoral twist or version, whether increased anteversion or retroversion, are frequently overlooked. These skeletal aberrations are responsible for a host of hip problems such as impingement, instability and damage to the labrum and articular cartilage, often resulting in osteoarthritis if left untreated. In addition to the intrinsic hip damage, extra articular problems such as posterior hip impingement, pelvic tendonopathies, problems with gait and sitting as well as spinal decompensation are also very common. It is incumbent upon those who manage hip problems to be aware of the damage caused by femoral version abnormalities and the treatment options available.

### Combined anteversion technique for total hip arthroplasty [^2295e2af]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Combined cup and stem anteversion in THA based on femoral anteversion has been suggested as a method to compensate for abnormal femoral anteversion. We investigated the combined anteversion technique using computer navigation. In 47 THAs, the surgeon first estimated the femoral broach anteversion and validated the position by computer navigation. The broach was then measured with navigation. The navigation screen was blocked while the surgeon estimated the anteversion of the broach. This provided two estimates of stem anteversion. The navigated stem anteversion was validated by postoperative CT scans. All cups were implanted using navigation alone. We determined precision (the reproducibility) and bias (how close the average test number is to the true value) of the stem position. Comparing the surgeon estimate to navigation anteversion, the precision of the surgeon was 16.8 degrees and bias was 0.2 degrees; comparing the navigation of the stem to postoperative CT anteversion, the precision was 4.8 degrees and bias was 0.2 degrees, meaning navigation is accurate. Combined anteversion by postoperative CT scan was 37.6 degrees ± 7 degrees (standard deviation) (range, 19 degrees -50 degrees). The combined anteversion with computer navigation was within the safe zone of 25 degrees to 50 degrees for 45 of 47 (96%) hips. Femoral stem anteversion had a wide variability.

### Effect of femoral anteversion on clinical outcomes after hip arthroscopy [^4df03c73]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the clinical outcomes after hip arthroscopy of patients with femoral retroversion, normal femoral version, and excessive femoral anteversion.

Methods

Patients who underwent primary hip arthroscopy from August 2008 to April 2011 and underwent femoral anteversion measurement by magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance arthrogram were included. The patients were divided into 3 groups: retroversion, normal version, and excessive anteversion. The normal-version group was considered to have a value within 1 SD of the mean femoral version value. Four patient-reported outcome scores and the visual analog pain score were prospectively collected with analysis performed retrospectively.

Results

Two hundred seventy-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. Among these patients, mean anteversion was 8.2° ± 9.3°, creating a retroversion group defined as -2° or less and an anteversion group defined as 18° or greater. There were 25 patients in the retroversion group, 219 in the normal-version group, and 34 in the excessive-anteversion group. Most labral tears were noted in the 12- to 2-o'clock range, with the main difference at the anterior 3-o'clock position, where the excessive-anteversion group showed a lower incidence of tearing (30%) than the retroversion group (73%) and normal-anteversion group (78%). Postoperatively, there was a statistically significant improvement from preoperative scores in all 3 groups and for all scores (P < .001). When the postoperative scores were compared for the 3 groups, although all scores were higher in the retroversion group than in the other 2 groups, this was not statistically significant and there were no significant differences in scores among the 3 groups (modified Harris Hip Score, P = 0.104; Non-Arthritic Hip Score, P = 0.177; Hip Outcome Score-Activities of Daily Living, P = 0.152; Hip Outcome Score-Sport-Specific Subscale, P = 0.276; visual analog scale score, P = 0.508).

Conclusions

On the basis of patient-reported outcome scores without accounting for diagnoses and treatments, the amount of femoral anteversion does not appear to affect the clinical outcomes after hip arthroscopy.

### Femoral anteversion in developmental dysplasia of the hip [^efa989e6]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Limited data exist in the literature with regard to the amount of femoral anteversion in children with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The data that do exist are variable: certain studies cite increased version in DDH compared with normal while others have found no significant difference. The purpose of our study was to quantify the degree of femoral anteversion in a large, consecutive series of children with DDH.

Methods

We performed a prospective study on 37 consecutive hips (30 patients) that were undergoing surgical procedures for DDH. After induction with general anesthesia (before the planned procedure), arthrograms were performed to allow accurate localization of the center of the femoral head. An anteroposterior radiograph was taken with the patient positioned supine and the knee flexed 90 degrees over the end of the operating table and the leg held perpendicular to the plane of the table. The limb was then rotated 90 degrees for the lateral radiograph. The offset of the center of the femoral head to the midline of the femoral shaft was measured in each view and a simple trigonometric relationship was used to calculate the femoral version.

Results

The mean age of the children in our series was 33.5 months (range: 6 to 79 mo). There were 4 boys and 26 girls; 7 patients had bilateral involvement. The mean femoral anteversion was 50.3 degrees ± 17.9 degrees. Significant variability was found: the lowest femoral version measured 0 degrees and the highest measured 95.7 degrees.

Conclusions

In most of our children with DDH, femoral anteversion was increased compared with published norms; however, significant variation existed. Given the variability of femoral anteversion, we believe that an individualized surgical approach is warranted, including preoperative assessment of the femoral version followed by derotational femoral osteotomy only if indicated by the patient's specific torsional profile.

Level Of Evidence

### Editorial commentary: excessive femoral retroversion and increased femoral anteversion has a negative effect on hip arthroscopy outcomes: symptomatic extremes of version require an osteotomy [^66f92b36]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

With the rise in the prevalence of hip arthroscopy, patient selection and proper surgical execution are key to achieving excellent outcomes. As our understanding of femoral acetabular impingement grows, so does our surgical indications to achieve excellent surgical outcomes. Some impingement pathologies are amenable to arthroscopy alone and those with excessive version, dysplasia, Perthese, protrusio, and coxa-vara, or valga require an isolated or combined osteotomy. The version of the femur is known to be a significant source of impingement, and its impact on arthroscopic surgical outcomes has long been assumed to be inconsequential. Those that perform open and arthroscopic hip surgery understand this to be untrue, and arthroscopy alone cannot solve all of our impingement problems.

### Position of the greater trochanter and functional femoral antetorsion: which factors matter in the management of femoral antetorsion disorders? [^a333c306]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

The primary aim of this study was to define and quantify three new measurements to indicate the position of the greater trochanter. Secondary aims were to define 'functional antetorsion' as it relates to abductor function in populations both with and without torsional abnormality.

Patients and Methods

Three new measurements, functional antetorsion, posterior tilt, and posterior translation of the greater trochanter, were assessed from 61 CT scans of cadaveric femurs, and their reliability determined. These measurements and their relationships were also evaluated in three groups of patients: a control group (n = 22), a 'high-antetorsion' group (n = 22) and a 'low-antetorsion' group (n = 10).

Results

In the cadaver group, the mean anatomical antetorsion was 14.7° (sd 8.5; 0 to 36.5) and the functional antetorsion 21.5° (sd 8.1; 3.6 to 44.3): the posterior tilt was 73.3° (sd 10.8; 46.9 to 88.7) and the posterior translation 0.59 (sd 0.2; 0.2 to 0.9). These measurements had excellent intra and interobserver agreement with a range from 0.93 to 0.99. When the anatomical antetorsion decreased, the greater trochanter was more tilted and translated posteriorly in relation to the axis of the femoral neck, and the difference between functional and anatomical antetorsion increased. The results the three patient groups were similar to those of the cadaver group.

Conclusion

The position of the greater trochanter and functional antetorsion varied with anatomical antetorsion. In the surgical management of femoral retrotorsion, subtrochanteric osteotomy can result in an excessively posterior position of the greater trochanter and an increase in functional antetorsion.

### Utility of preoperative femoral neck geometry in predicting femoral stem anteversion [^ca01fd0c]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2015). Low credibility.

This study investigated the relationships between the preoperative femoral anteversions and the femoral stem anteversion using CT scans and CT-based 3D models to determine whether any preoperative anteversion measurement correlates with the postoperative stem anteversion. Pre-operative and post-operative CT scans of 19 hips with THAs were evaluated. Five preoperative anatomical femoral anteversion measurements (CT-Head, CT-Below Head, CT-Neck, 3D-Head, and 3D-Neck) were compared with the postoperative femoral stem anteversion. The preoperative CT-Neck anteversion measurement was most correlated with the postoperative stem anteversion (r = 0.761, P = 0.002) with the narrowest ranges of the differences (-10.2° to 11.0°). The preoperative anteversions using the femoral neck geometry from CT scans can be used for the estimation of the postoperative femoral stem anteversion in THA.

### Knee pain and activity outcomes after femoral derotation osteotomy for excessive femoral anteversion [^31ac2047]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Excessive femoral anteversion is a developmental condition that can become symptomatic into adolescence and manifest as anterior knee pain, tripping, and or problems with sports. Femoral derotational osteotomy about an antegrade intramedullary nail (IMN) is an accepted option to treat this condition. This is the first report of the clinical and functional outcomes of treatment of excessive anteversion with femoral derotational osteotomy stabilized with an IMN.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 28 consecutive patients between 2013 and 2014 who underwent derotational osteotomy. Physical examination measures were used to calculate the amount of angular correction with focus on internal and external rotation of the hip, as well as the trochanteric prominence angle test of femoral anteversion. The International Knee Documentation Committee-9, Marx, and Tegner activity scales were 3 patient-reported outcomes recorded.

Results

After femoral derotation osteotomy over an IMN, femoral anteversion, as measured by the trochanteric prominence angle, improved an average of 29 degrees (P < 0.0001). At 1-year minimum follow-up, 22 of 28 subjects (78.5%) demonstrated a mean significant improvement of 13 points for International Knee Documentation Committee-9 (SD = 15.4, P = 0.0007), which surpassed the level of minimal clinically important change. Furthermore, the Tegner inventory scores for the cohort improved by an average of 1.9 activity levels (SD = 2.4, P = 0.0012).

Conclusions

For adolescents with symptomatic excessive femoral anteversion, derotational osteotomy over an IMN offers a reliable surgical option that provides predictable deformity correction and significant improvements in both function and pain scales.

### Measurement of femoral anteversion by biplane radiography and computed tomography imaging: comparison with an anatomic reference [^63d589da]. Investigative Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The ability of biplane radiography and standard computed tomography (CT) imaging techniques to measure accurately the human femoral anteversion was evaluated and compared with an anatomic reference: the osteometric method.

Methods

Femoral anteversion of 10 normal adult cadaveric human femora were determined using a standardized anatomic measurement method (the anatomic reference) and the 2 selected common imaging techniques (biplane radiography and CT).

Results

On average, anteversion measurements using biplane radiography were 21/2 times greater in magnitude than measurements using the anatomic reference (absolute mean difference, 13.5 degrees; P = 0.004). In contrast, the discrepancy between CT and anatomic reference measurements was notably less and not statistically significant (absolute mean difference, 2.8 degrees; P = 0.351). In addition, biplane radiography demonstrated greater inter- and intrarater variability than CT imaging for repeated measurements of the same bone specimens.

Conclusions

Compared with the anatomic reference, CT imaging was an accurate and valid technique for measuring the femoral anteversion. In contrast, biplane radiography demonstrated significant inconsistencies in the measurement of this anatomic parameter.

### Axial orientation of the femoral trochlea is superior to femoral anteversion for predicting patellar instability [^4b445931]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The femoral anteversion angle is considered to be the same as femoral torsion; however, the femoral anteversion angle is strongly influenced by the femoral posterior condylar morphology. It remains unclear whether the femoral anteversion angle and axial orientation of the femoral trochlea can predict patellar instability. This study aimed to redefine the femoral inherent torsion, verify whether the femoral anteversion angle reflects the femoral inherent torsion, and compare the validity and calculate the cut-off values of the femoral anteversion angle and femoral trochlear axial orientation for predicting patellar instability.

Methods

Seventy-three patients with patellar instability and 73 matched controls underwent computed tomography to measure the femoral anteversion angle, femoral inherent torsion, and femoral trochlear axial orientation. Pearson's product moment correlation coefficients and linear regression were calculated to determine correlations between measurements. Receiver operating characteristic curves and nomograms were plotted to evaluate the predictive validity of the femoral anteversion angle and femoral trochlear axial orientation for patellar instability.

Results

All measurements showed excellent intra- and inter-observer reliability. Compared with the control group, the patellar instability group had a significantly larger femoral anteversion angle (25.4 ± 6.4° vs. 20.2 ± 4.5°) and femoral inherent torsion (18.3 ± 6.7° vs. 15.8 ± 3.4°), and significantly smaller femoral trochlear axial orientation (58.1 ± 7.3° vs. 66.9 ± 5.1°). The femoral anteversion angle and femoral trochlear axial orientation had area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 79 and 84%, respectively, and cut-off values of 24.5° and 62.7°, respectively. The calibration curve and decision curve analysis showed that the femoral trochlear axial orientation performed better than the femoral anteversion angle in predicting patellar instability. There was a strong correlation between the femoral anteversion angle and femoral inherent torsion (r > 0.8). Linear regression analysis of the femoral inherent torsion with the femoral anteversion angle as the prediction variate showed moderate goodness-of-fit (adjusted R² = 0.69).

Conclusion

The femoral anteversion angle moderately reflects the femoral inherent torsion. The femoral trochlear axial orientation is better than the femoral anteversion in predicting patellar instability in terms of predictive efficiency, consistency with reality, and net clinical benefit. These findings warn orthopaedists against overstating the role of the femoral anteversion angle in patellar instability, and suggest that the femoral trochlear axial orientation could aid in identifying at-risk patients and developing surgical strategies for patellar instability.

### Modular necks improve the range of hip motion in cases with excessively anteverted or retroverted femurs in THA [^02a3831a]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Anteversion of an acetabular component often is difficult to ascertain in patients with THA in whom excessively anteverted or retroverted femurs may result in limited ROM or risk of dislocation. Restriction of motion, however, is determined by the combination of version of both components.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore determined the combined anteversion values that provide adequate ROM. We varied acetabular version by differing implantations and varied femoral version with modular necks.

Methods

ROM was tested by changing cup anteversion after setting the femoral version to 20° or 60° anteversion or 20° retroversion. The angle of the modular neck was adjusted in 11 increments of 5° each. Range of internal rotation (IR) at 90° flexion, external rotation (ER) at 0° extension, and flexion (Flex) were measured when any impingement occurred before dislocation. We defined a required ROM as having 40° IR, 30° ER, and 110° Flex.

Results

At 60° anteversion, ER was less than 10° even when the acetabular component was set at 10° retroversion because of posterior impingement. When a modular neck with 25° retroversion was used, ER improved to greater than 30°. At 20° retroversion, IR was 31° even when the acetabular component was opened to 35° anteversion. IR improved to 34° and 40° with 20° and 25° anteverted modular necks, respectively.

Conclusions and Clinical Relevance

In cases with excessive femoral anteversion or retroversion, the required ROM could not be achieved by simply changing the version of acetabular components. The adjustment of femoral versions using the modular necks allowed additional improvement of ROM.

### Age at onset of walking in infancy is associated with hip shape in early old age [^c5553822]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hip geometry has been shown to be associated with a number of burdensome musculoskeletal health conditions including osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis. Gross morphological features such as a wider femoral neck 1 and femoral head, 2 smaller neck‐shaft angle, 3 and anteversion (external rotation of the femur) 4 are associated with hip OA. Similarly, a narrower, longer femoral neck 5 and greater neck‐shaft angle 6 are associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. Hip shape is largely determined in childhood, although patterns vary between geometrical variables. Evidence suggests that neck‐shaft angle increases during gestation, and then decreases through childhood until around age 10, 7 thereafter remaining stable throughout adulthood. 8 Similarly, after peaking at birth, femoral neck anteversion declines dramatically in the first 3 to 4 years, 9 thereafter declining more slowly until maturity. Increases in femoral neck length 10, 11 and width 12, and femoral head size 13 occur until the late teens, although periosteal apposition continues to occur at a reduced rate throughout adulthood. 14 Given the clinical relevance of these components of hip shape and their developmental timing, it is important to identify potentially modifiable factors in childhood that may influence hip shape.

### Functional and anatomic orientation of the femoral head [^a8cc3c33]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Femoral neck geometry directly affects load transmission through the hip. Orientations may be described anatomically or using functional definitions that consider load transmission.

Questions/Purposes

This study introduces and applies a new method for characterizing functional femoral orientation based on the distribution of subchondral bone density in the femoral head and compares it with orientation measures generated via established anatomic landmark-based methods. Both orientation methods then are used to characterize side-to-side symmetry of orientation and differences between men and women within the population.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective review of CT imaging data from 28 patients was performed. Anatomic orientation was determined using established two-dimensional and three-dimensional landmarking methods. Subchondral bone density maps were generated and used to define a density-weighted surface normal vector. Orientation angles generated by the three methods were compared, with side-to-side symmetry and differences between genders also investigated.

Results

The three methods measured substantially different angles for anteversion and neck-shaft angle. Weak correlations were found between anatomic and functional orientation measures for neck-shaft angle only.

Conclusions

Neck-shaft angles calculated using the functional orientation method corresponded well with previous in vivo loading data. An absence of strong correlation between functional and anatomic measures reinforces the concept that bone geometry is not solely responsible for determining loading of the femoral head.

### Editorial commentary: physical therapy alone may not successfully treat patients with hip pain and large α angles or decreased femoral anteversion combined with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome [^0fa59953]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the relation between spinopelvic (lumbopelvic) tilt and femoracetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is complex, and determining the optimal patient parameters that lead to successful nonoperative management is vital. Physical therapy (PT) focusing on core and posterior chain strengthening is often successful. PT can change the posterior tilt of the pelvis by 5° to 10°, allowing increased range of motion (ROM) and decreased impingement of the hip. However, PT does not change cam anatomy. Thus, PT alone may not sufficiently increase ROM in patients with cam-type impingement and large α angles or limited femoral anteversion. Pelvic compensation may lead to successful nonoperative management of FAIS, but not in all patients. Large-cam, high-flexion athletes with chronic hip pain should try PT. Yet, while some patients with large cam lesions may improve without surgery if femoral version and/or pelvic tilt ROM can be increased, surgery should not be excessively delayed in patients with poor prognostic factors for nonoperative management.

### Editorial commentary: femoral version and capsular thickness analysis in hip preservation surgery-surgical indications are as important as surgical technique [^7d74ae00]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimal treatment of patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome requires both thoughtful decision-making and skillful operative technique. Traditional evidence-based literature and routine clinical practice overemphasize the role of the alpha angle on the femoral side and lateral center edge angle on the acetabular side. Femoral and acetabular version are critical values that influence outcomes and warrant measurement and consideration. Without version analysis, an uniformed, possibly poor, decision may be made. The literature and clinical practice also place dichotomous emphasis on labral (torn/intact) and capsular (torn/intact) integrity, with minimal appreciation of the morphological details of both. Not all capsules are created equal. "Normal" capsule thickness is a nebulous concept, with thinner anterior capsules more prone to anterior instability. Intuitively, it biomechanically stands to reason that excessive femoral anteversion (and excessive anterior cranial and central acetabular version) would place additional stress on the anterior capsule. Excessive femoral anteversion is associated with a thinner anterior capsule. Whether the latter is a reactive process (implies causation) or simply 2 concordant metrics (only correlation) has yet to be determined. In patients with nonarthritic hip pain, comprehensive quantitative consideration of both femoral and acetabular version and capsular thickness determines the optimal hip preservation procedure. Surgical indications are as important as surgical technique.

### Analysis of computed tomography-based technique for measuring femoral anteversion: implications for measuring rotation after femoral intramedullary nail insertion [^e2e9405a]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the reliability of the current computed tomography (CT)-based technique for determining femoral anteversion and quantify the prevalence and magnitude of side-to-side differences.

Design

Cross-sectional cohort study.

Setting

Academic trauma center.

Patients

We reviewed CT scans from 120 patients with bilateral full-length axial cuts of both femurs. Two hundred forty femurs with no fractures or other identifying features in their femora were included. Ten unique data sets were created to measure anteversion of the left and right sides.

Main Outcome Measurements

Intraobserver and interobserver reliability were calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and pooled absolute differences. The mean absolute difference between the sides was determined using a fixed-effects model.

Results

Interobserver reliability was high (ICC: 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83–0.88). The pooled mean absolute magnitude of variation between reviewers was small at 1.6 degrees (95% CI: 1.4–1.8 degrees) per scan. The intraobserver reproducibility was high (ICC: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88–0.93) with a mean error of 2.7 degrees (95% CI: 2.2–3.1 degrees) per repeat viewing of the same scan by the same person. The magnitude of side-to-side variation was 2.0 degrees (95% CI: 1.5–2.6 degrees). Twenty-one subjects (18%, 95% CI: 12%-25%) had a mean side-to-side calculated femoral anteversion difference of ≥ 10 degrees, whereas 6 (5%, 95% CI: 2–10) subjects had a calculated mean side-to-side difference of ≥ 15 degrees.

Conclusions

CT based femoral anteversion measurement techniques demonstrate good precision. Only 1 in 20 patients had side-to-side differences of 15 degrees or more.

### Does the rule of thirds adequately detect deficient and excessive acetabular coverage? [^a80ec6aa]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Assessment of AP acetabular coverage is crucial for choosing the right surgery indication and for obtaining a good outcome after hip-preserving surgery. The quantification of anterior and posterior coverage is challenging and requires either other conventional projections, CT, MRI, or special measurement software, which is cumbersome, not widely available and implies additional radiation. We introduce the "rule of thirds" as a promising alternative to provide a more applicable and easy method to detect an excessive or deficient AP coverage. This method attributes the intersection point of the anterior (posterior) wall to thirds of the femoral head radius (diameter), the medial third suggesting deficient and the lateral third excessive coverage.

Question/Purpose

What is the validity (area under the curve [AUC], sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratios [LR(+)/LR(-)], positive/negative predictive values [PPV, NPV]) for the rule of thirds to detect (1) excessive and (2) deficient anterior and posterior coverages compared with previously established radiographic values of under-/overcoverage using Hip2Norm as the gold standard?

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated all consecutive patients between 2003 and 2015 from our institutional database who were referred to our hospital for hip pain and were potentially eligible for joint-preserving hip surgery. We divided the study group into six specific subgroups based on the respective acetabular pathomorphology to cover the entire range of anterior and posterior femoral coverage (dysplasia, overcoverage, severe overcoverage, excessive acetabular anteversion, acetabular retroversion, total acetabular retroversion). From this patient cohort, 161 hips were randomly selected for analysis. Anterior and posterior coverage was determined with Hip2Norm, a validated computer software program for evaluating acetabular morphology. The anterior and posterior wall indices were measured on standardized AP pelvis radiographs, and the rule of thirds was applied by one observer.

Results

The detection of excessive anterior and posterior acetabular wall using the rule of thirds revealed an AUC of 0.945 and 0.933, respectively. Also the detection of a deficient anterior and posterior acetabular wall by applying the rule of thirds revealed an AUC of 0.962 and 0.876, respectively. For both excessive and deficient anterior and posterior acetabular coverage, we found high specificities and PPVs but low sensitivities and NPVs.

Conclusion

We found a high probability for an excessive (deficient) acetabular wall when this intersection point lies in the lateral (medial) third, which would qualify for surgical correction. On the other hand, if this point is not in the lateral (medial) third, an excessive (deficient) acetabular wall cannot be categorically excluded. Thus, the rule of thirds is very specific but not as sensitive as we had expected.

### Femoral anteversion change is associated with ischiofemoral impingement after total hip arthroplasty: a retrospective CT evaluation [^1a3f280f]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated the relationship between femoral anteversion (FA), FA change, and ischiofemoral impingement (IFI) and the relationship between FA, femoral offset (FO), and greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) after total hip arthroplasty (THA).

Materials and methods

In this retrospective study, two readers assessed FA and FO on CT images of 197 patients following primary THA with an anterior surgical approach between 2014 and 2021. FA change was calculated relative to preoperative CT, while FO change was calculated relative to preoperative radiographs and classified as decreased (≥ −5 mm), increased (≥ + 5 mm), or restored (± 5 mm). Clinical and imaging data were analyzed for IFI and GTPS after surgery. Group differences were evaluated using Student's t -test, chi-square analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

Results

The change in FA was 3.6 ± 3.3° to a postoperative FA of 22.5 ± 6.8°, while FO increased by 1.7 ± 3.5 mm to a postoperative FO of 42.9 ± 7.1 mm. FA and FA change were higher in patients with IFI (p ≤ 0.006), while no significant difference was observed for patients with and without GTPS (p ≥ 0.122). IFI was more common in females (p = 0.023). In the ROC analysis, an AUC of 0.859 was observed for FA change to predict IFI, whereas the AUC value was 0.726 for FA alone. No significant difference was found for FO change in patients with and without IFI or GTPS (p ≥ 0.187).

Conclusion

Postoperative FA, FA change, and female sex were associated with IFI after anterior-approached THA. The change in FA was a better predictor of IFI than absolute postoperative FA alone.

Clinical relevance statement

The findings of this study suggest that preservation of the preoperative femoral anteversion may reduce postoperative ischiofemoral impingement in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.

Key Points

- Higher postoperative femoral anteversion and anteversion change were associated with ischiofemoral impingement.

- Femoral anteversion change was a better predictor of impingement than absolute postoperative anteversion.

- No significant association was found between femoral offset and postoperative hip pain.

### True femoral anteversion during primary total hip arthroplasty: use of postoperative computed tomography-based sections [^ae82ce72]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2006). Low credibility.

This study investigated a reference line that is closer to the true femoral anteversion on only the cutting surface of the proximal femoral neck during a femoral stem insertion in a cementless total hip arthroplasty. A postoperative computed tomography of both hips from 33 consecutive patients after a unilateral primary cementless total hip arthroplasty with an avascular necrosis of the femoral head was taken to observe the positioning of the stem and its correlation with the true anteversion of the contralateral side. The average of the midcortical angle was 14.1 degrees ± 6.8 degrees on the lesion side and 0.1 degrees ± 1.3 degrees more than the true anteversion on the contralateral side. This study has shown that anteversion using a midcortical line between the anterior cortical line and the posterior cortical line is compatible with the true femoral anteversion. However, further investigation is required to confirm the true femoral anteversion.

### A comparison of surgeon estimation and computed tomographic measurement of femoral component anteversion in cementless total hip arthroplasty [^2e64ebac]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The intraoperative estimation of the anteversion of the femoral component of a total hip arthroplasty is generally made by the surgeon's visual assessment of the stem position relative to the condylar plane of the femur. Although the generally accepted range of intended anteversion is between 10 degrees and 20 degrees, we suspected that achieving this range of anteversion consistently during cementless implantation of the femoral component was more difficult than previously thought.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated the accuracy of femoral component anteversion in 109 consecutive total hip arthroplasties (ninety-nine patients), in which we implanted the femoral component without cement. In all hips, we measured femoral stem anteversion postoperatively with three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction of the femur, using both the distal femoral epicondyles and the posterior femoral condyles to determine the femoral diaphyseal plane. The bias and precision of the measurements were calculated.

Results

The surgeon's estimate of femoral stem anteversion was a mean (and standard deviation) of 9.6 degrees ± 7.2 degrees (range, -8 degrees to 28 degrees). The anteversion of the stem measured by computed tomography was a mean of 10.2 degrees ± 7.5 degrees (range, -8.6 degrees to 27.1 degrees) (p = 0.324). The correlation coefficient between the surgeon's estimate and the computed tomographic measurement was 0.688; the intraclass coefficient was 0.801. Anteversion measured by computed tomography found that forty-nine stems (45%) were between 10 degrees and 20 degrees of anteversion; forty-three stems (39%) were between 0 degree and 9 degrees of femoral anteversion; eight stems (7%) were in anteversion of > 20 degrees; and nine stems (8%) were in retroversion.

Conclusions

The surgeon's estimation of the anteversion of the cementless femoral stem has poor precision and is often not within the intended range of 10 degrees to 20 degrees of anteversion. The implications of this finding increase the importance of achieving a safe range of motion by evaluating the combined anteversion of the stem and the cup.

### Use of inherent anteversion of an intramedullary nail to avoid malrotation in femur fractures [^925eaf5f]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2014). Low credibility.

Rotational malalignment after intramedullary (IM) nailing of femoral fractures remains a significant problem. A technique using intraoperative fluoroscopy and the anteversion inherent to the IM nail for obtaining appropriate femoral rotational alignment is presented. The technique is advocated as a simple alternative to more complex methods for estimation of femoral anteversion during placement of femoral IM nails. This method is simple and requires intraoperative fluoroscopy on the injured extremity alone. It reliably sets the femoral anteversion within a normal physiologic range with minimal additional intraoperative steps and without preoperative measurements.

### Navigated femoral nailing using noninvasive registration of the contralateral intact femur to restore anteversion. technique and clinical use [^0eec6ec3]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2007). Low credibility.

The difficulty in assessing femoral rotation during intramedullary nailing is well-established. Navigation systems allow the surgeon to detect and set the version of the injured leg at the desired angle. We report the first cases of navigated femoral nailing using noninvasive registration of the contralateral uninjured leg to determine the patient's anatomy. This allows the desired femoral rotation, which is that of the healthy femur, to be statically locked to precisely match the contralateral limb.

### The effect of femoral and acetabular version on outcomes following hip arthroscopy: a systematic review [^72f97a50]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Torsional hip deformities are common among patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. However, recent studies have suggested conflicting outcomes following arthroscopy in the setting of abnormal hip version. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the literature and determine the impact of femoral and acetabular version on patient-reported outcomes following primary arthroscopic hip surgery.

Methods

This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. Studies investigating femoral and acetabular version in primary hip arthroscopy with clinical outcomes were identified, and data were extracted in duplicate.

Results

Overall, 11 studies met inclusion criteria and comprised 1,297 hips (726 femora and 571 acetabulae), with a mean patient age of 29.2 years (range, 14 to 74.7 years). In patients with acetabular retroversion, there was no significant difference, when compared with the normal acetabular version group, in the modified Harris hip score (mHHS), the Hip Outcome Score-Sports Specific Subscale (HOS-SSS), and visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores postoperatively. Among patients with femoral retroversion, in 2 of 3 studies, the authors reported no difference in mHHS postoperatively compared with patients with normal femoral version. In patients with high femoral anteversion, in 2 of 3 studies, the authors reported a significant difference in postoperative mHHS favoring patients with normal femoral version. Studies examining high femoral anteversion included patients with borderline hip dysplasia and patients who underwent concurrent psoas-lengthening procedures.

Conclusions

Although the definition of the normal version of the hip varied within the literature, hip arthroscopy in patients with acetabular retroversion resulted in no difference in functional outcomes compared with patients with normal version. Postoperative functional outcomes in patients with femoral retroversion and high femoral anteversion were mixed, although the procedure was possibly less effective in high femoral anteversion combined with specific clinical scenarios. Further prospective studies based on standardized definitions and version analysis techniques would be useful in identifying the precise surgical indications for safe arthroscopic surgical procedures in patients with version abnormalities of the femur and acetabulum, particularly those with high femoral anteversion and retroversion.

### Editorial commentary: magnetic resonance imaging may underestimate hip femoral version versus computed tomography scan: both may Be optimized using 3-dimensional imaging [^e2a0aca2]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Hip arthroscopy has become increasingly popular in the treatment of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. Careful preoperative planning including evaluation of acetabular and femoral version is necessary to optimize outcomes. Increased femoral anteversion has been associated with microinstability, and conversely, decreased femoral version may predispose to impingement. Computed tomography (CT) is considered the gold standard for femoral version measurements and preoperative planning. However, with recent advancements in technology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown comparable measurements to CT imaging. In terms of advantages and disadvantages, CT requires radiation, albeit "low dose". MRI has a longer acquisition time, and movement of the patient may affect image quality and subsequent accuracy. MRI generally underestimates true version, probably as a result of patient positioning. Three-dimensional imaging could resolve this issue and may become the gold standard for both CT and MRI.

### MRI for the preoperative evaluation of femoroacetabular impingement [^bb00b163]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Measurements

Alpha angles

Alpha angles are measured utilizing oblique axial images, obtained parallel to the long axis of the femoral neck, through the midportion of the femoral neck (Fig. 3). An alpha angle of > 55° is considered a risk factor for FAI, although there is considerable overlap between the range of alpha values in symptomatic and non-symptomatic subjects, the measured alpha angle should be considered in the clinical context of the patient's symptoms.

Femoral anteversion

Femoral anteversion (antetorsion) is the angle between the femoral neck and the femoral condyles. This can be calculated by measuring angles on the straight or oblique axial images of the femoral neck using a correction factor, taking into account the relative anteversion or retroversion of the femoral condyles (Fig. 11). Normal femoral anteversion is approximately 12–13°. Femoral retroversion or a relative decrease in femoral anteversion exacerbates the effect of a cam or pincer lesion, as impingement may occur with only minimal internal rotation and hip flexion. Increased anteversion results in reduced external rotation, with the potential for impaction of the femur on the posterior acetabulum.

Fig. 11
Calculation of femoral version corrected for distal femoral rotation. On the straight axial image(s) of the hip/pelvis covering the femoral head and neck, a line is drawn between the center of the femoral head and center of the femoral neck at its narrowest point to calculate the uncorrected femoral anteversion angle (A; A is a negative value when the femur is retroverted). To correct for distal femoral rotation, another line is drawn along the posterior border of the femoral condyles to calculate the angle (B; B is a negative value when the knee is internally rotated). Femoral version = A − B. A positive value indicates femoral anteversion. A negative value indicates femoral retroversion. Normal femoral anteversion is approximately 12–13°

### The 2014 frank stinchfield award: the 'landing zone' for wear and stability in total hip arthroplasty is smaller than we thought: a computational analysis [^e31aecf2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Positioning of total hip bearings involves tradeoffs, because cup orientations most favorable in terms of stability are not necessarily ideal in terms of reduction of contact stress and wear potential. Previous studies and models have not addressed these potentially competing considerations for optimal total hip arthroplasty (THA) function.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore asked if component positioning in total hips could be addressed in terms of balancing bearing surface wear and stability. Specifically, we sought to identify acetabular component inclination and anteversion orientation, which simultaneously resulted in minimal wear while maximizing construct stability, for several permutations of femoral head diameter and femoral stem anteversion.

Methods

A validated metal-on-metal THA finite element (FE) model was used in this investigation. Five dislocation-prone motions as well as gait were considered as were permutations of femoral anteversion (0°-30°), femoral head diameter (32–48 mm), cup inclination (25°-75°), and cup anteversion (0°-50°), resulting in 4320 distinct FE simulations. A novel metric was developed to identify a range of favorable cup orientations (so-called "landing zone") by considering both surface wear and component stability.

Results

When considering both wear and stability with equal weight, ideal cup position was more restrictive than the historically defined safe zone and was substantially more sensitive to cup anteversion than to inclination. Ideal acetabular positioning varied with both femoral head diameter and femoral version. In general, ideal cup inclination decreased with increased head diameter (approximately 0.5° per millimeter increase in head diameter). Additionally, ideal inclination increased with increased values of femoral anteversion (approximately 0.3° per degree increase in stem anteversion). Conversely, ideal cup anteversion increased with increased femoral head diameter (0.3° per millimeter increase) and decreased with increased femoral stem anteversion (approximately 0.3° per degree increase). Regressions demonstrated strong correlations between optimal cup inclination versus head diameter (Pearson's r = -0.88), between optimal cup inclination versus femoral anteversion (r = 0.96), between optimal cup anteversion versus head diameter (r = 0.99), and between optimal cup anteversion and femoral anteversion (r = -0.98). For a 36-mm cup with a 20° anteverted stem, the ideal cup orientation was 46° ± 12° inclination and 15° ± 4° anteversion.

Conclusions

The range of cup orientations that maximized stability and minimized wear (so-called "landing zone") was substantially smaller than historical guidelines and specifically did not increase with increased head size, challenging the presumption that larger heads are more forgiving. In particular, when the cup is oriented to improve not only stability, but also wear in the model, there was little or no added stability achieved by the use of larger femoral heads. Additionally, ideal cup positioning was more sensitive to cup anteversion than to inclination.

Clinical Relevance

Positioning THA bearings involves tradeoffs regarding stability and long-term bearing wear. Cup positions most favorable to minimization of wear such as low inclination and elevated anteversion were detrimental in terms of construct stability. Orientations were identified that best balanced the competing considerations of wear and stability.

### Do your routine radiographs to diagnose cam femoroacetabular impingement visualize the region of the femoral head-neck junction you intended? [^07b45ea1]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To use computer models and image analysis to identify the position on the head-neck junction visualized in 10 radiographic views used to quantify cam morphology.

Methods

We generated 97 surface models of the proximal femur from computed tomography scans of 59 control femurs and 38 femurs with cam morphology-a flattening or convexity at the femoral head-neck junction. Each model was transformed to a position that represents the anteroposterior, Meyer lateral, 45° Dunn, modified false-profile, Espié frog-leg, modified 45° Dunn, frog-leg lateral, cross-table, 90° Dunn, and false-profile views. The position on the head-neck junction visualized from each view was identified on the surfaces. This position was then quantified by a clock face generated on the plane of the head-neck junction, in which the 12-o'clock position indicated the superior head-neck junction and the 3-o'clock position indicated the anterior head-neck junction. The mean visualized clock-face position was calculated for all subjects. Analysis was repeated to account for variability in femoral version. A general linear model with repeated measures was used to compare each radiographic view and anteversion angle.

Results

Each radiographic view provided visualization of the mean clock-face position as follows: anteroposterior view, 12:01; Meyer lateral view, 1:08; 45° Dunn view, 1:40; modified false-profile view, 2:01; Espié frog-leg view, 2:14; modified 45° Dunn view, 2:35; frog-leg lateral view, 2:45; cross-table view, 3:00; 90° Dunn view, 3:13; and false-profile view, 3:44. Each view visualized a different position on the clock face (all P < .001). Increasing simulated femoral anteversion by 10° changed the visualized position of the head-neck junction to a more clockwise position (range, 0:07 to 0:29; all P < .001), whereas decreasing anteversion by 10° visualized a more counterclockwise position (range, -0:23 to -0:08; all P < .001).

Conclusions

Ten common radiographic views used to identify cam morphology visualized different clock-face positions of the head-neck junction. Our data will help clinicians to understand the position of the head-neck junction visualized for each radiographic view and make educated decisions in the selection of radiographs acquired in the clinic.

Clinical Relevance

Our findings will aid clinicians in choosing a set of radiographs to capture cam morphology in the assessment of patients with hip pain.

### Morphologic development of the posterior sloping angle of the proximal femoral epiphysis in children: what is the peak risk age for slipping? [^132ae7f4]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

A limited number of studies have reported values of PFEP orientation by measuring PSA in healthy children. This cross-sectional study provides the normal values of PSA in different age groups by performing measurements on pelvic frog-leg lateral radiographs of 800 hips of 400 healthy Chinese children.

During normal growth and development in children, the physiological parameters of the proximal femur often follow an age-dependent developmental pattern. For example, the neck-shaft angle decreases with age from 4 to 16 years and then stabilizes. Similarly, the anteversion decreases by ~1.5 degrees per year from birth to 16 years of age. The geometric development of the proximal femur is the result of morphologic changes associated with the continuous adaptation of the orientation of the proximal femoral epiphyseal plate to the biomechanical forces exerted during upright walking.

### Femoral anteversion change is associated with ischiofemoral impingement after total hip arthroplasty: a retrospective CT evaluation [^bb301d73]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Femoral anteversion

Mean FA was 18.2° (4.4°) before surgery and 22.5° (6.8°) after surgery, with a change of 3.6° (3.3°). Student's t -test revealed that patients in the IFI group had higher postoperative FA angles (25.2° [5.9°]) compared to patients without IFI (14.4° [10.2°], p = 0.006, Table 2). FA change was 5.4° (3.2°) in the IFI group and 1.4° (3.1°) in the non-IFI group (p < 0.001). Differences in FA and FA change between patients with and without GTPS were non-significant (p ≥ 0.549). The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed an excellent predictive power for FA change (AUC = 0.859, 95% CI 0.770–0.948) for identifying patients with IFI, whereas the predictive power for absolute FA values was moderate (AUC = 0.726, 95% CI 0.611–0.842) (see Fig. 6). Interreader agreement for both preoperative and postoperative CT images was almost perfect (κ = 0.813 and κ = 0.836, respectively).

### A validated single-view radiographic alternative to computed tomography for the measurement of femoral anteversion: a method-comparison study [^a79f3a91]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although preoperative templating in total hip arthroplasty is helpful to ensure appropriate component position, there is no single-view radiographic method to determine femoral anteversion (FA) preoperatively. The aim of the present study was to validate the use of radiographic measurement of FA using a modified Budin view.

Methods

This prospective study reports on 105 limbs from 65 patients. Computed tomography (CT) scans and radiographs were obtained to measure native FA. Radiographs were obtained using the modified Budin protocol with 90° flexion at the knee and 90° flexion and 30° abduction at the hip. Pearson correlation analyses, paired-samples t-test, and Bland-Altman plots were performed to assess correlation and agreement between methods. Data were grouped into subsets based on CT-derived FA in 5° intervals. Groups included all limbs, FA < 35°, FA < 30°, and FA < 25°.

Results

For all limbs, Bland-Altman analysis revealed a fixed bias (mean bias, -0.8°; 95% confidence interval, -1.4° to -0.2°) and showed that radiographic methods underestimated FA. Subset analyses were performed and revealed excellent correlation between CT and radiographic measurements for all subgroups (r = 0.97, P < .001). Paired-samples t-tests revealed no significant difference between methodologies for any of the subgroups. Radiographic and CT methods showed excellent agreement, and the bias between methods was within 0.5° for all subgroups. There was no fixed bias and thus no systematic difference in methods within any of the subgroup analyses.

Conclusion

Radiographic measurement of FA using a modified Budin view is a valid and reliable technique.

### Femoral anteversion in the hip: comparison of measurement by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and physical examination [^9f6d5758]. Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of femoral anteversion, as well as the relation of anteversion with physical examination and radiographic findings.

Methods

Preoperative CT and MRI measurements of anteversion along with clinical examination were performed on 129 consecutive hips before hip arthroscopy for nonarthritic hip injuries. All anteversion measurements were performed by 2 musculoskeletal radiologists. The radiographic findings and physical examination findings were analyzed for statistically significant correlations. For statistical analysis purposes, the patients were divided into 3 groups according to the mean CT anteversion measurement: group I (low), less than 10°; group II (medium), 10° to 22°; and group III (high), greater than 22°.

Results

High interobserver correlation was found for femoral anteversion measurement by CT and MRI (r = 0.95 and r = 0.86, respectively; P < .0001 for both). CT and MRI measurements showed high correlation with each other (r = 0.80, P < .0001). However, in 96% of the cases, the CT measurement was larger, with a mean difference of 8.9° (range, -37° to 1.5°). A significant correlation coefficient was found between internal rotation and anteversion angles as measured by CT (r = 0.36, P < .0001). However, no correlation was found with other hip movement measurements. Abnormal femoral acetabular bony architecture of the hip was found in 64% of the patients; isolated cam impingement was more prevalent in group I, whereas isolated pincer impingement was more prevalent in group III (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Although high correlation was found between anteversion angle measurements by CT and MRI, significant discrepancies in the absolute anteversion number between the 2 techniques suggest that they may not be interchangeable. Furthermore, CT was found to have higher interobserver reliability than MRI. There was a significant correlation between CT and examination of internal rotation of the hip. Clinically, the findings of the study show that the diagnosis of excessive femoral anteversion or retroversion should have different thresholds according to MRI and CT measurements; moreover, the diagnosis should not rely exclusively on either examination or radiologic criteria.

### Out-toeing… [^2eeb9330]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Hip Rotation The range of internal and external rotation of the hips should be measured with the child prone and knees flexed to 90 degrees. Internal rotation is determined by fully abducting the legs. External rotation is determined by fully adducting the legs. The degrees of internal and external rotation are generally equal, about 45 degrees. In children with excess femoral anteversion, the femoral neck axis is rotated anteriorly in relation to the frontal plane of the femoral condyles. The internal rotation will far exceed external rotation, while the opposite is true in femoral retroversion. 8 Clinical Conditions INTOEING Intoeing is caused by one of three types of deformity: metatarsus adductus, internal tibial torsion, and increased femoral anteversion. INCREASED FEMORAL ANTEVERSION Femoral anteversion describes the normal position of the femur, which is medially rotated on its long axis at birth.

It is often familial and is usually bilateral, affecting females more than males. 5, 9 The child with increased femoral anteversion walks with his or her patellae and feet pointing inward. The gait appears clumsy and the child may trip as a result of crossing his or her feet. 9 The child will have strong tendency to sit in a "W" position. Physical examination reveals increased internal hip rotation and decreased external rotation. Increased femoral anteversion is usually diagnosed after three years of age, peaks at four to six years, and then gradually resolves. 12 Spontaneous resolution occurs in more than 80 percent of cases by late childhood. 9 The hip range of motion can be measured every six to 12 months to document gradual decrease in femoral anteversion.

FEMORAL RETROVERSION Femoral retroversion is common in early infancy and is caused by external rotation contracture of the hip secondary to intrauterine packing. 1, 7, 9 It becomes apparent when the prewalking child stands with his or her feet turned out to nearly 90 degrees. 12 Femoral retroversion occurs more commonly in obese children. When femoral retroversion is unilateral, it is more common on the right side. 1, 9.

### Femoral derotation osteotomy in adults for version abnormalities [^aea09cc5]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

It has been reported that osteoarthritis may occur with either femoral retroversion or increased anteversion. Retroversion of the femur, either alone or in combination with other deformities, can cause hip damage secondary to impingement.,

The damage with excessive anteversion occurs at the periphery of the acetabulum secondary to high compressive and shear forces on the articular cartilage and labrum, causing hip pain and arthritis. The onset of pain in patients with dysplasia occurs earlier if there is coexistent excessive combined anteversion. Increased femoral anteversion has also been associated with posterior greater trochanteric impingement, decreased abductor power by < 28% due to diminished femoral offset, and hip instability. Psoas irritation may be due to anterior instability; the tendon may act as a dynamic stabilizer and releasing it may exacerbate the problem. Patients with symptomatic ischiofemoral impingement with diminished clearance between these two structures are more likely to have excessive femoral anteversion compared to asymptomatic patients. Other problems associated with excessive femoral anteversion include increased hip and knee adduction moments, an intoeing gait and patellofemoral maltracking, pain, and arthritis.

The arthroscopic treatment of hip impingement may fail if bony débridement is inadequate. In addition, these procedures may also fail if coexisting femoral retroversion is not detected or treated. Six of the patients in this study with retroversion of the femur had previously undergone an arthroscopic débridement with initial symptomatic relief, but eventually had a relapse of painful impingement and a lack of internal rotation.

There is no uniform agreement as to the value of normal femoral and acetabular version. The reported values for the acetabulum range from 13° to 20° of anteversion in three studies, averaging 17°. For the femur, the range of anteversion is 10° to 20° in three studies, averaging 15°. The McKibbin index is the sum of acetabular version and femoral version; "normal" is approximately 30°, and values > 60° are considered to be highly unstable. The goal of surgical correction was to approach 15° of femoral version. Three-dimensional CT scans were used to measure version as precisely as possible and have long been considered the benchmark technique to measure version.

### Morphologic development of the posterior sloping angle of the proximal femoral epiphysis in children: what is the peak risk age for slipping? [^5786e44d]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

The morphologic development of the proximal femur in children varies with age, with corresponding radiographic parameters, such as the neck-shaft angle, femoral anteversion, and Alsberg angle, often following age-dependent developmental patterns.

The orientation of the proximal femoral epiphyseal growth plate (PFEP), which is influenced by biomechanical factors, is also critical to the morphologic development of the proximal femur. The abnormal orientation of the PFEP alters the normal biomechanics of the hip joint and can lead to associated conditions. During growth, biomechanical forces acting on the proximal femur cause the PFEP to tilt more steeply in the coronal plane, shifting the forces acting on it from compression to shear stress.

Previous evaluations of the orientation of the PFEP have been primarily on the coronal plane, with limited research on its morphology in the sagittal plane. According to a study by Chung et al, the shear stress on the epiphyseal plate is three-dimensional, with medial, inferior, and posterior components. Specifically, they reported that the magnitude of the posterior component correlated closely with the degree of sagittal plane tilt of the PFEP.

In 2005, Barrios and colleagues introduced the posterior sloping angle (PSA) of the proximal femoral epiphysis as a measure to assess sagittal plane inclination of the femoral head epiphysis, which has been shown to have high interobserver and intraobserver reliability and minimal variation with limb positioning and has since been widely used in clinical practice. –

The PFEP is the weakest point between the epiphysis and metaphysis of the proximal femur, and as PSA increases, so does the shear force applied to the epiphysis, significantly increasing the likelihood of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Several studies from Europe and the United States suggest that PSA is a reliable indicator for predicting contralateral slip risk in SCFE patients, with a PSA > 12 to 14.5 degrees indicating the need for prophylactic fixation. However, Ou Yang et aldid not find a significant correlation between PSA and future slippage in children of Asian descent.

While current research confirms ethnic differences in the distribution of SCFE, the presence of ethnic differences in PSA, a key anatomic parameter associated with SCFE, –, remains unexplored. Furthermore, the dynamics and magnitude of PSA changes over time in children remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the developmental trends of PSA in a sample of Chinese children aged 5 to 14 years, to provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and evaluation of PFEP disorders in clinical settings.

### Is internal rotation measurement of the hip useful for ruling in cam or pincer morphology in asymptomatic males? A diagnostic accuracy study [^bd5ba342]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Another limitation of our study is that the test cannot differentiate between restricted internal rotation caused by femoral retroversion (retrotorsion), acetabular retroversion, or cam morphology. Femoral retroversion may have a larger effect on internal rotation than cam morphology. Furthermore, the test might produce a false negative in patients with concomitant hip dysplasia and cam morphology, where large femoral antetorsion and insufficient femoral coverage allow for high internal rotation despite the cam morphology. In addition, cutoffs based on our data may overestimate the test performance, and the specificity and sensitivity might be lower in an independent sample. Finally, one limitation is that the chair is not commercially available, although it is easy to build (Appendix 1).

Discussion of Key Findings

We are unaware of other studies that evaluated the same standardized tool to measure internal hip rotation. Only a few studies have evaluated sensitivity and specificity for the measurement of internal rotation to detect cam morphologies. In a study with a cohort of 200 asymptomatic participants without prior hip surgery or childhood hip problems, the sensitivity to detect a cam morphology was 0.36 and the specificity was 0.83 for a cutoff of at most 20° internal rotation (cam morphology was defined as an alpha angle of more than 50.5°), for a positive likelihood ratio of only 2.10. Among 65 male American football players, in one subset (rater 1) the sensitivity to detect a cam morphology (alpha angle > 50°) was 0.88 and the specificity was 0.47, for a threshold of 41° internal rotation of the hip, and in a second subset (rater 2) sensitivity was 0.81 and specificity was 0.51, for a threshold of 38°. These values yielded negative likelihood ratios of 0.26 and 0.37, respectively, similar to those in our study.

### A validation study for estimation of femoral anteversion using the posterior lesser trochanter line: an analysis of computed tomography measurement [^991fccaa]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to introduce a simple and reliable intraoperative reference guide to reproduce the normal femoral anteversion during total hip arthroplasty (THA). We hypothesized that the posterior lesser trochanter line (PLTL) could be a useful guide for estimating femoral anteversion during THA. We conducted a study of 56 men (112 hips) to evaluate the relationship between the PLTL and the femoral anteversion using computed tomography scans. The mean femoral anteversion was 9.0° ± 8.1° (range, -16.2° to 32.9°). The PLTL angle correlated (r² = 0.12, P < 0.05) with the femoral anteversion. We found a constant relationship between the PLTL and femoral anteversion, and the PLTL may be used as a guide for estimating the femoral stem anteversion during femoral stem fixation.

Background

Appropriate stem anteversion is important for achieving stability of the prosthetic joint in total hip arthroplasty. Anteversion of a cementless femoral stem is affected by the femoral canal morphology and varies according to stem geometry. We investigated the difference and variation of the increase in anteversion between 2 types of cementless stems, and the correlation between each stem and the preoperative femoral anteversion.

Methods

We retrospectively compared 2 groups of hips that underwent total hip arthroplasty using a metaphyseal filling stem (78 hips) or a tapered wedge stem (83 hips). All the patients had osteoarthritis due to hip dysplasia. Computed tomography was used to measure preoperative femoral anteversion at 5 levels and postoperative stem anteversion.

Results

The increase in anteversion of the tapered wedge stem group (22.7° ± 11.6°) was more than that of the metaphyseal filling stem group (17.2° ± 8.3°; P = 0.0007). The variation of the increase in the tapered wedge stem group was significantly larger than that in the metaphyseal filling stem group (P = 0.0016). The metaphyseal filling stem group was more highly and positively correlated with femoral anteversion than the tapered wedge stem group.

Conclusion

Femoral anteversion affects stem anteversion differently according to stem geometry. The tapered wedge stems had greater variation of the increase in anteversion than did the metaphyseal filling stems. Based on the results of this study, it is difficult to preoperatively estimate the increase in stem anteversion for tapered wedge stems.

### Clinical outcomes after arthroscopic psoas lengthening: the effect of femoral version [^5df75f96]. Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between femoral anteversion and clinical outcomes after arthroscopic lengthening of a symptomatic, snapping psoas tendon in young patients.

Methods

Sixty-seven consecutive patients with symptomatic coxa saltans underwent arthroscopic psoas tendon lengthening through a transcapsular approach during a 3-year period by a single arthroscopic hip surgeon. Demographic and clinical variables were collected. Patients were divided into low/normal femoral version and high femoral version groups and analyzed for association of femoral version with clinical outcomes as measured by the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) and Hip Outcome Score (HOS) preoperatively and postoperatively with a minimum of 6 months' follow-up (range, 6 to 24 months). Two-sample t tests were used for data analysis, with P < .05 defined as significant.

Results

Preoperative evaluation showed excessive anteversion (> 25°) associated with worse HOS sports subscale scores (26.6 v 50.0 for excessive v low/normal anteversion, P = 0.013) and no difference in mHHS and HOS activities-of-daily living subscale scores. Postoperative mHHS scores were significantly different (76.9 v 86.1 for excessive v low/normal anteversion, P = 0.031). No association was noted between clinical outcome measures and any other clinical or demographic variable (P > .05).

Conclusions

Patients with increased femoral anteversion may be at greater risk for inferior clinical outcomes after arthroscopic lengthening of a symptomatic, snapping psoas tendon. The psoas tendon may be an important passive and dynamic stabilizer of the hip in these patients, and release may result in a greater alteration of kinematics with high-demand activities, particularly terminal extension and external rotation when the tendon is typically at its highest tension. These results may help surgeons identify which patients may be at risk for inferior clinical outcome after psoas lengthening.

### Signficant femoral version abnormalities and patient-reported quality of life [^487f6d40]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Excessive femoral version is a condition that can have a notable effect on one's quality of life. Knee pain, gait abnormalities, and cosmetic concerns are some of the key indications for a femoral derotational osteotomy. Notably, if femoral version abnormalities are left untreated, excessive femoral anteversion, or retroversionhave been suggested to lead to the development of hip arthritis. Consequently, surgical approaches and techniques have been developed to ameliorate symptomatic femoral version abnormalities, and improve pain levels, gait, and overall alignment of the lower extremities in affected patients. However, there is no clear consensus among orthopaedic surgeons regarding indications for surgical intervention to address femoral version abnormalities.

One important factor to consider regarding indications for femoral derotational osteotomy is patient quality of life. Heath et aldescribed the importance of patients' perceived quality of life as a necessary factor when planning for lower limb deformity surgery. Indeed, capturing the patient-centered experience through patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) surveys can help surgeons provide more patient-focused and higher-quality care. To this end, Heath et aldemonstrated that patients presenting with a limb deformity (limb-length discrepancy, angular deformity, or combined limb-length discrepancy with an angular deformity) scored markedly worse on preoperative survey scores compared with healthy control subjects. However, differences in PROM survey responses between patients with femoral version abnormalities and healthy control subjects have not yet been established.

The primary goal of this study was to determine the quality-of-life deficit using the Limb Deformity–Modified Scoliosis Research Society (LD-SRS)and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)questionnaires for patients with symptomatic femoral version abnormalities compared with asymptomatic healthy control subjects.

### Accuracy of femoral component anteversion in robotic total hip arthroplasty [^658d5499]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Femoral component anteversion is an important factor in the success of total hip arthroplasty (THA). This retrospective study aimed to investigate the accuracy of femoral component anteversion with the Mako THA system and software using the Exeter cemented femoral component, compared to the Accolade II cementless femoral component.

Methods

We reviewed the data of 30 hips from 24 patients who underwent THA using the posterior approach with Exeter femoral components, and 30 hips from 24 patients with Accolade II components. Both groups did not differ significantly in age, sex, BMI, bone quality, or disease. Two weeks postoperatively, CT images were obtained to measure acetabular and femoral component anteversion.

Results

The mean difference in femoral component anteversion between intraoperative and postoperative CT measurements (system accuracy of component anteversion) was 0.8° (SD 1.8°) in the Exeter group and 2.1° (SD 2.3°) in the Accolade II group, respectively (p = 0.020). The mean difference in anteversion between the plan and the postoperative CT measurements (clinical accuracy of femoral component anteversion) was 1.2° (SD 3.6°) in the Exeter group, and 4.2° (SD 3.9°) in the Accolade II group (p = 0.003). No significant differences were found in acetabular component inclination and anteversion; however, the clinical accuracy of combined anteversion was significantly better in the Exeter group (0.6° (SD 3.9°)) than the Accolade II group (3.6° (SD 4.1°)).

Conclusion

The Mako THA system and software helps surgeons control the femoral component anteversion to achieve the target angle of insertion. The Exeter femoral component, inserted using Mako THA system, showed greater precision for femoral component and combined component anteversion than the Accolade II component.

### Femoral derotation osteotomy in adults for version abnormalities [^11679727]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

In the surgical treatment of hip disorders, a major cause of failure is either insufficient correction or a failure to fully recognize the underlying deformities causing pain and joint damage. One type of femoral deformity that is still frequently overlooked are rotational deformities of the femur, that is, excessive anteversion or femoral retroversion. These rotational deformities may occur alone or may coexist with acetabular dysplasiaor various types of hip impingement. Rotational deformities may also be associated with cerebral palsyand labral tearsand are not unusual after the fixation of femoral shaft fractures.

Excessive femoral anteversion can cause instability, damage of the articular cartilage and acetabular labrum, and eventually osteoarthritis. Furthermore, it can cause a decrease in the length of the abductor lever arm, posterior extra-articular impingement, and ischiofemoral impingement. Finally, excessive femoral anteversion may cause increased hip and knee adduction moments, an intoeing gait and patellofemoral maltracking, with resultant knee pain and arthritis.

Femoral retroversion, on the other hand, causes damage due to impingement between the femoral neck and acetabulum, which may result in damage to the labrum and articular cartilage, ultimately resulting in osteoarthritis of the hip. Other potential retroversion problems include an increased risk of slipped capital femoral epiphysisand susceptibility to a traumatic posterior hip dislocation. Residual, untreated femoral retroversion may be a reason why hip preserving surgeries may fail, especially after the arthroscopic treatment of hip impingement.

Despite the important role of femoral rotational deformity in the pathogenesis of hip disease, there is little written about the outcomes of treatment. This article describes the technique and outcomes of a closed, derotation osteotomy of the femur to correct either excessive femoral anteversion or retroversion as part of a hip preservation effort. The question to be answered is whether hip pain as a result of version abnormalities of the femur can be alleviated by this type of surgery.

### Body mass index is related to femoral anteversion, hip rotation during gait, and passive hip range of motion in children and adolescents [^bee4a148]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Overweight and obesity are major global health issues, often linked to orthopaedic problems, skeletal malalignments, and altered gait biomechanics. However, skeletal and biomechanical adaptions in the transverse plane remain underexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and variables describing lower extremity torsional profiles, hip rotation mobility, and transverse plane gait characteristics in children and adolescents.

Methods

Acetabular and femoral anteversion, tibial torsion (measured through computed tomography), hip and knee rotation, and foot progression angles during the stance phase of gait (measured by 3D gait analysis), as well as passive hip rotation range of motion (evaluated as the midpoint of hip rotation in clinical examination), were retrospectively analyzed in 122 children and adolescents. Correlations between all variables and logit-transformed BMI percentiles were calculated.

Results

Moderate correlations were found between BMI percentile and hip rotation during the stance phase (r = -0.68, P < 0.001), the passive midpoint of hip rotation (r = -0.51, P < 0.001), and femoral anteversion (r = -0.50, P < 0.001). Small correlations were observed for acetabular anteversion (r = -0.36, P < 0.001), knee rotation during stance phase (r = 0.34, P < 0.001), and foot progression angle during stance phase (r = -0.31, P < 0.001). Tibial torsion showed a nonsignificant negligible relationship with BMI percentile (r = -0.26, P = 0.004).

Conclusion

BMI percentile was positively correlated with external hip rotation during the stance phase of gait and passive external hip rotation, and negatively correlated with femoral anteversion. These findings suggest abnormal body weight is associated with static and dynamic biomechanical alterations. Therefore, weight management should be considered in orthopaedic assessments and treatment planning for children and adolescents.

### Determinants of hip displacement in children with cerebral palsy [^488350fe]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Coxa valga and femoral anteversion often are seen in patients with spastic hip displacement and osteotomy is recommended. However, the relationship between femoral deformities and hip displacement has not been clearly defined and other factors, such as joint motion and posture, should be considered before recommending treatment.

Questions

For children with cerebral palsy with Gross Motor Function Classification System Level IV or V, we questioned (1) whether hip abduction range correlates with hip displacement, (2) what the relationships are between proximal femoral deformities and hip displacement, and (3) whether the patient with a windblown posture has greater degrees of femoral anteversion?

Methods

We retrospectively studied 31 consecutive children with cerebral palsy with Level IV or V gross motor function who underwent three-dimensional CT for preoperative assessment of hip displacement between January 2010 and December 2013. Among the children, 23 had a windblown posture and eight had symmetric hip motion. Femoral anteversion and true neck-shaft angle were measured from the three-dimensional CT images. Migration percentage was the dependent variable we chose to study in relation to femoral anteversion, neck-shaft angle, maximal hip abduction, and hip flexion contracture, using correlations and multiple linear regressions. Using ANOVA and Scheffé's post hoc tests, we analyzed and compared the data of 23 abducted hips and 23 adducted hips in the 23 children with windblown posture and in 16 displaced hips in the eight children with symmetric hip abduction.

Results

Greater migration percentage was associated with less hip abduction range (r = -0.86; p < 0.001). Femoral anteversion had a weak correlation (r = 0.28; p < 0.05) to migration percentage, and the association became insignificant after considering hip abduction motion. Adducted windblown hips had greater femoral anteversion than the symmetric displaced hips and abducted windblown hips (46° vs 36° and 38°, respectively; p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Our study results did not support a relationship between femoral deformities and hip displacement after considering gross motor function and hip abduction motion. Greater femoral anteversion was noted in the adducted hips of patients with windblown posture, and derotation osteotomy is especially recommended.

### Femoral anteversion in children with cerebral palsy. assessment with two and three-dimensional computed tomography scans [^c6d1f81b]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Assessment of femoral anteversion in children with cerebral palsy with two or three-dimensional computed tomography scans may be limited by both positional and anatomic variables. Three-dimensional computed tomography techniques are considered to be more accurate than two-dimensional imaging when the femur is not optimally positioned in the gantry or when the neck-shaft angle is increased.

Methods

Computed tomography scanning was performed on a series of nine model femora with anteversion ranging from 20 degrees to 60 degrees and neck-shaft angles ranging from 120 degrees to 160 degrees. Each femoral model was scanned in two holding devices, the first of which held the femur in optimal alignment (normal model) and the second of which held the femur in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (cerebral palsy model) relative to the gantry. Femoral anteversion was calculated for each model from two and three-dimensional computed tomography scans by four examiners on two separate occasions. The intraobserver and interobserver reliability, the accuracy, and the effect of increasing the neck-shaft angle on the accuracy of the measurements made on the two and three-dimensional scans of the normal and cerebral palsy models were then examined.

Results

The mean differences in the measurements of femoral anteversion made by the same examiner (intraobserver reliability) were < 2 degrees for the two-dimensional scans of the normal and cerebral palsy models and the three-dimensional scans of the normal models, and the mean difference was < 4 degrees for the three-dimensional scans of the cerebral palsy models. The mean differences among examiners (interobserver reliability) were < 3 degrees for the two-dimensional scans of the normal and cerebral palsy models and the three-dimensional scans of the normal models, and the mean difference was < 6 degrees for the three-dimensional scans of the cerebral palsy models. The accuracy of the assessments of femoral anteversion of the normally aligned models was comparable between the two and three-dimensional scans. However, the three-dimensional assessment was significantly more accurate than the two-dimensional assessment for measurement of anteversion of the cerebral palsy models (p = 0.003). Accuracy within 5 degrees was comparable between the two and three-dimensional scans for measurement of the normally aligned models, with 86% of the two-dimensional measurements and 78% of the three-dimensional measurements falling within 5 degrees of the actual measurements. However, the accuracy within 5 degrees was significantly compromised when the models were placed in cerebral palsy alignment. Only 3% of the two-dimensional measurements and 14% of the three-dimensional measurements fell within 5 degrees of the actual measurements, with three-dimensional assessment being significantly better than two-dimensional assessment (p = 0.006). Increasing the neck-shaft angle did not significantly compromise the accuracy of measurement of femoral anteversion with either the two-dimensional or the three-dimensional technique (p > 0.05 for all comparisons).

Conclusions

When adequate alignment of the femur in the computed tomography scanner was possible, a simple two-dimensional technique exhibited excellent intraobserver and interobserver reliability and clinically acceptable accuracy within the relevant ranges of anatomic variability tested (neck-shaft angles of 120 degrees to 160 degrees and femoral anteversion of 20 degrees to 60 degrees). When optimal alignment of the femur in the scanner was not possible, neither two-dimensional nor three-dimensional techniques exhibited clinically acceptable accuracy for the measurement of femoral anteversion.

### Presurgery and postsurgery outcomes following lower extremity torsional osteotomies [^f6c5ec1b]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Torsional osteotomies of the femur and tibia may be indicated in select individuals with a combination of increased femoral anteversion and external tibial torsion. This study aims to quantify the presurgery and postsurgery levels of pain, function and mobility, and gait patterns in patients with lower extremity torsional abnormalities (LETAs).

Methods

Patients with LETA who underwent torsional osteotomy of the femurs and/or tibias were recruited. Before and 1 year postsurgery, participants had a gait analysis and completed patient-reported outcomes. CT torsional assessment was performed at baseline. Paired t tests and statistical parametric mapping were used to assess presurgery and postsurgery changes.

Results

Ten participants (18 ± 2 y) completed the study. Participants had 29 ± 10 degrees of femoral anteversion and 45 ± 11 degrees of external tibial torsion. The hip rotational arc and transmalleolar axis improved towards norms following surgery. The major deviations found in the kinematic were observed in the transverse plane, and they improved towards norms postsurgery. The patient-reported outcomes were below norm presurgery but improved significantly postsurgery.

Conclusions

Results from this study suggest that LETA can be diagnosed based on radiologic, gait, and physical abnormalities. Postsurgery results showed that torsional osteotomy alleviated pain, restored physical function, and normalized gait patterns.

### How common is femoral retroversion and how is it affected by different measurement methods in unilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis? [^b29ad4f1]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although femoral retroversion has been linked to the onset of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), and may result from a rotation of the femoral epiphysis around the epiphyseal tubercle leading to femoral retroversion, femoral version has rarely been described in patients with SCFE. Furthermore, the prevalence of actual femoral retroversion and the effect of different measurement methods on femoral version angles has yet to be studied in SCFE.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Do femoral version and the prevalence of femoral retroversion differ between hips with SCFE and the asymptomatic contralateral side? (2) How do the mean femoral version angles and the prevalence of femoral retroversion change depending on the measurement method used? (3) What is the interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility of these measurement methods?

Methods

For this retrospective, controlled, single-center study, we reviewed our institutional database for patients who were treated for unilateral SCFE and who had undergone a pelvic CT scan. During the period in question, the general indication for obtaining a CT scan was to define the surgical strategy based on the assessment of deformity severity in patients with newly diagnosed SCFE or with previous in situ fixation. After applying prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria, we included 79 patients. The mean age was 15 ± 4 years, 48% (38 of 79) of the patients were male, and 56% (44 of 79) were obese (defined as a BMI > 95th percentile (mean BMI 34 ± 9 kg/m²). One radiology resident (6 years of experience) measured femoral version of the entire study group using five different methods. Femoral neck version was measured as the orientation of the femoral neck. Further measurement methods included the femoral head's center and differed regarding the level of landmarks for the proximal femoral reference axis. From proximal to distal, this included the most-proximal methods (Lee et al. and Reikerås et al.) and most-distal methods (Tomczak et al. and Murphy et al.). Most proximally (Lee et al. method), we used the most cephalic junction of the greater trochanter as the landmark and, most distally, we used the center base of the femoral neck superior to the lesser trochanter (Murphy et al.). The orientation of the distal femoral condyles served as the distal reference axis for all five measurement methods. All five methods were compared side-by-side (involved versus uninvolved hip), and comparisons among all five methods were performed using paired t-tests. The prevalence of femoral retroversion (< 0°) was compared using a chi-square test. A subset of patients was measured twice by the first observer and by a second orthopaedic resident (2 years of experience) to assess intraobserver reproducibility and interobserver reliability; for this assessment, we used intraclass correlation coefficients.

Results

The mean femoral neck version was lower in hips with SCFE than in the contralateral side (-2° ± 13° versus 7° ± 11°; p < 0.001). This yielded a mean side-by side difference of -8° ± 11° (95% CI -11° to -6°; p < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of femoral retroversion in hips with SCFE (58% [95% CI 47% to 69%]; p < 0.001) than on the contralateral side (29% [95% CI 19% to 39%]). These differences between hips with SCFE and the contralateral side were higher and ranged from -17° ± 11° (95% CI -20° to -15°; p < 0.001) based on the method of Tomczak et al. to -22° ± 13° (95% CI -25° to -19°; p < 0.001) according to the method of Murphy et al. The mean overall femoral version angles increased for hips with SCFE using more-distal landmarks compared with more-proximal landmarks. The prevalence of femoral retroversion was higher in hips with SCFE for the proximal methods of Lee et al. and Reikerås et al. (91% [95% CI 85% to 97%] and 84% [95% CI 76% to 92%], respectively) than for the distal measurement methods of Tomczak et al. and Murphy et al. (47% [95% CI 36% to 58%] and 60% [95% CI 49% to 71%], respectively [all p < 0.001]). We detected mean differences ranging from -19° to 4° (all p < 0.005) for 8 of 10 pairwise comparisons in hips with SCFE. Among these, the greatest differences were between the most-proximal methods and the more-distal methods, with a mean difference of -19° ± 7° (95% CI -21° to -18°; p < 0.001), comparing the methods of Lee et al. and Tomczak et al. In hips with SCFE, we found excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] > 0.80) for intraobserver reproducibility (reader 1, ICC 0.93 to 0.96) and interobserver reliability (ICC 0.95 to 0.98) for all five measurement methods. Analogously, we found excellent agreement (ICC > 0.80) for intraobserver reproducibility (reader 1, range 0.91 to 0.96) and interobserver reliability (range 0.89 to 0.98) for all five measurement methods in healthy contralateral hips.

Conclusion

We showed that femoral neck version is asymmetrically decreased in unilateral SCFE, and that differences increase when including the femoral head's center. Thus, to assess the full extent of an SCFE deformity, femoral version measurements should consider the position of the displaced epiphysis. The prevalence of femoral retroversion was high in patients with SCFE and increased when using proximal anatomic landmarks. Since the range of femoral version angles was wide, femoral version cannot be predicted in a given hip and must be assessed individually. Based on these findings, we believe it is worthwhile to add evaluation of femoral version to the diagnostic workup of children with SCFE. Doing so may better inform surgeons as they contemplate when to use isolated offset correction or to perform an additional femoral osteotomy for SCFE correction based on the severity of the slip and the rotational deformity. To facilitate communication among physicians and for the design of future studies, we recommend consistently reporting the applied measurement technique.

### Development and validation of a mobile application for measuring femoral anteversion in patients with cerebral palsy [^b91f4c67]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent developmental disorders caused by nonprogressive disturbances occurring in the immature brain of a developing fetus or infant. Increased femoral anteversion is a common deformity in patients with CP. It results in in-toeing gait, and femoral derotation osteotomy is commonly performed to treat this problem. Therefore, accurate measurement of femoral anteversion is essential for preoperative planning and good surgical outcomes.

Femoral anteversion can be measured by physical examination, 2-dimensional (2D)/3-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and the EOS system. Even though physical examination has proven to be a reliable and valid tool, imaging methods are still widely used as a compensatory tool because they have the merits of visualization and objectivity. Measurement using CT is an intuitive, reliable, and valid method, but the potential adverse effects of radiation have become an issue of concern, especially in the pediatric population, as children are more susceptible to the effects of radiation. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used as an alternative to CT, but it has several drawbacks including increased cost, time, possible motion artifacts, and the need for anesthesia in children. A low-dose biplanar x-ray technology (EOS; EOS Imaging, Paris, France) using 2 orthogonal radiographic images has been developed to reduce the radiation dose.–Several studies have reported excellent concurrent validity of the EOS system for measuring femoral anteversion.–However, this system requires another apparatus, the cost of which is high, and the area occupied by it is substantial. Therefore, purchasing an EOS system only for 3D reconstruction may not be appropriate in some hospitals or countries.

The use of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has become widespread. Moreover, the specifications of mobile devices can be improved and upgraded rapidly; they can, therefore, be considered comparable to the specifications of various medical devices.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and validate a mobile application that can reconstruct a 3D model of the femur from conventional radiographic images, and does not need a calibrated apparatus such as EOS. In terms of validation, we focused on the measurements of femoral anteversion in this study.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits – hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association [^92d0cff8]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) pathoanatomy and functional impairments — The proximal femur's angle of inclination is normally 120° to 125° in the adult population, and femoral torsion has a normal range between 14° to 18° of anteversion. In OA of the hip the entire joint structure and function is affected, with joint capsular changes creating limitation in hip joint range of motion (ROM); the hip abductor muscles progressively weaken in the later stages of hip OA, which may create a Trendelenberg gait pattern over time, and clinicians must not overlook the function of the hip muscles at different hip positions, for example the gluteus medius functions as an abductor when at 0° of flexion (standing) but an internal rotator at 90° of flexion (sitting).

### The effect of anteversion on femoral component stability assessed by radiostereometric analysis [^2895317c]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2002). Low credibility.

Internal rotation of a femoral stem within the femur, with posterior migration of the femoral head (PHM) relative to the femur, is an important mode of failure. The relationship between anteversion and rotational stability for the Exeter (Howmedica International Ltd, London, UK) and Charnley Elite (DePuy International Ltd, Leeds, UK) stems was investigated using radiostereometric analysis (RSA). For the Elite, there was a significant (P = 0.01) correlation between anteversion and PHM, whereas for the Exeter, there was no significant correlation (P = 0.6). Increasing anteversion of the Elite was associated with decreasing PHM and increased stability. Of stems, 20% of the Elite and none of the Exeter were classified as having reduced rotational stability because their PHM was > 2 SDs from the mean. All reduced rotational stability implants had anteversion substantially < 20 degrees. Polished collarless tapered stems such as the Exeter seem to have enhanced rotational stability. For conventional stems, increasing anteversion increases stability. It is recommended that these stems are anteverted 20 degrees.

### Postoperative femoral component rotation and femoral anteversion after total knee arthroplasty in patients with distal femoral deformity [^53334210]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2013). Low credibility.

We asked whether total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with distal femoral deformity (DFD) would change femoral component rotation (FCR) and investigated the correlation between DFD and femoral anteversion (FA). 75 patients were divided into two groups according to the preoperative posterior condylar angle (PCA); group A without DFD (PCA < 7°), group B with DFD (PCA > 7°). We evaluated the different angles on the CT scan: (1) PCA, (2) angle between the line which is perpendicular to the Whiteside's line and PCL (WLP), and (3) FA. The mean FCRs were external rotation of 0.21°+2.75° in group A and internal rotation of 4.48°+2.51° in group B (P = 0.001). The mean preoperative and postoperative FAs were similar in group A but were significantly different in group B (P = 0.035). DFD resulted in excessive internal rotation of the femoral component. There was a secondary decrease in FA in patients with DFD.

### A morphometric study of normal and varus knees [^87d8c629]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The major findings of this study were that, for varus knees, some reference axes and surface features are significantly different to normal knees. For the femur, there was less femoral anteversion in varus knees. In the tibia, the tubercle (and tibial tubercle axis) was externally rotated in varus knees and there was a medial tilt of the tibial plateau in the coronal plane. Axes were also identified that were not significantly different in varus and normal knees. On the femur these were the anatomical transepicondylar axis, posterior condylar axis and Whiteside's line and, on the tibia, the posterior condylar axis and condylar center axis.

The presence of less femoral anteversion in varus knees when compared to normal knees is not surprising. Normal femoral version has been reported to be varied between 10° and 20° with the clear evidence of increased anteversion causing internal rotation of the knee, which is closely associated with increasing valgus deformity of the knee. Similarly, retroversion causes external rotation of the knee, is associated with varus deformity and has been shown to be closely related to the development of OA in adults. The varus knee group in the study all presented with OA of the medial side, and this has also been shown to be related to external rotation of the knee. Bretin et al. showed that the tibiofemoral joint center of force moves medially with external femoral malrotation, and this has been further confirmed by finite element studies by Papaioannou et al. who showed increased compressive forces in the medial compartment of the knee joint with decreasing anteversion. Thus, a statement on the predisposition of femurs with less femoral version angles and varus alignment leading to subsequent medial OA of the knee can be made.

### Femoral derotation osteotomy in adults for version abnormalities [^f57c1406]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, hip pain and deterioration can be caused by a variety of deformities, acting either alone or in combination. There can be considerable overlap with acetabular dysplasia, hip impingement, and neck-shaft abnormalities, while femoral version may be diminished, normal, or excessive. It is important to identify all the deformities present to ensure the best chance of success after hip preservation surgery. Version abnormalities of the hip, often overlooked, must be assessed because of the damage caused by these deformities. A closed, subtrochanteric derotation osteotomy of the femur is a safe and effective procedure to treat either femoral retroversion or excessive anteversion. Excellent or good results were obtained in 93%, with a statistically significant improvement in the mHHS, despite the need for subsequent implant removal in more than two-thirds of the patients. Failures may occur in patients with genetic defects associated with abnormal collagen or bone density.

### Femoral anteversion measured by the surgical transepicondylar axis is a reliable parameter for evaluating femoral rotational deformities in patients with patellar dislocation [^e0a442a0]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To verify whether femoral anteversion measured by the surgical transepicondylar axis (S-FA) is a reliable parameter for evaluating femoral rotational deformities and to provide an indication for derotational distal femoral osteotomy (DDFO) in patients with patellar dislocation.

Methods

Ninety patients with recurrent patellar dislocation and 90 healthy individuals were enrolled. The S-FA, the femoral anteversion measured by posterior condylar reference line (P-FA), the length of posterior femoral condyles, and the posterior condylar angle (PCA) were assessed by CT images. The unpaired t test and Pearson correlation analysis were conducted. Receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic capacity of the parameters. The pathological value of the measurements was determined, and a binary regression model was established.

Results

The S-FA and P-FA were greater in the study group (14.2 ± 7.7° and 19.7 ± 7.3°, respectively) than in the control group (7.2 ± 8.0° and 12.2 ± 8.2°, respectively) (P < 0.001). The lateral/posterior condyle was shorter in patients with patellar dislocation (21.2 ± 2.5 mm) than in healthy individuals (23.5 ± 2.7 mm) (P = 0.001). The P-FA was correlated with PCA in the study group (P < 0.001). The S-FA and P-FA had AUCs of 0.734 and 0.767 for patellar dislocation, respectively. The pathological values of the S-FA and P-FA were 20.4° and 25.8°, respectively. The S-FA revealed a significant OR of 10.47 (P = 0.014) for patellar dislocation.

Conclusion

The S-FA is a reliable parameter for identifying femoral rotational deformities in patients with patellar dislocation. DDFO is recommended when a pathological S-FA (> 20.4°) is presented.

### Anteversion angle measurement in suspected torsional malalignment of the femur in 3-dimensional EOS vs computed tomography – A validation study [^4b3fbb8b]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Computed tomography (CT) scan is the standard for assessment of femoral torsion. This observational study was conducted to evaluate the comparability of the EOS radiation dose scanning system (EOS imaging, Paris, France) and the CT scan in patients with suspected torsional malalignment of the femur.

Methods

Patients with suspected torsional malalignment of the femur were included in a study for surgical planning. The primary endpoint was to compare the 3-dimensional radiological (EOS) imaging system with the CT scan to determine femoral anteversion (AV) angle. Three independent raters performed measurements. Comparability of CT scan and EOS values was assessed by Pearson correlation, t test, interobserver reliability, and intraobserver reliability (Cronbach alpha).

Results

About 34 femora were examined. Interobserver reliability/intraobserver reliability was 0.911 of 0.955 for EOS and 0.934 of 0.934 for CT scan. EOS system revealed an AV angle of 12.2° ± 10.0° (-15.0° to 32.0°). CT examinations showed an AV angle of 12.6° ± 9.2° (-3.2° to 35.6°). About 11 hips featured physiological AV, 14 hips showed decreased AV (< 10°) or retroversion (< 0°), and 9 hips showed increased AV (> 20°). Overall, a strong Pearson correlation of τ = 0.855 and a highly significant correlation in the t test for both methods was seen. In patients with decreased AV, retroversion, or increased AV, Pearson correlation only resulted in a moderate/low correlation of τ = 0.495 and τ = 0.292. The t test showed no significant correlation at malrotation.

Conclusion

In torsional malalignment, EOS does not have correlation with CT measurements. In contrast to CT scan, EOS allows femoral torsion measurement independent of legs' positioning.

### Can turned inward patella predict an excess of femoral anteversion during gait in spastic diplegic children? [^cd625cd2]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Determining patellar orientation in the transverse plane during observational gait analysis is a fundamental aspect of physical examinations. Many physicians consider that an abnormal position of the patella in the transverse planes is only explained by a rotational abnormality of the proximal femur.

Methods

A total of 188 spastic diplegic children with cerebral palsy were reviewed (376 lower limbs). The physical examination included observation of patellar orientation at midstride and measuring femoral anteversion (FA). All patients also underwent 3-dimensional (3D) computerized gait analysis of pelvic and hip rotation kinematics.

Results

Observational gait analysis and videotapes found 103 children (206 lower limbs) with inturned patella at midstance. Kinematic data from 3D gait analysis showed that the visual impression of turned inward patella was erroneous in 48 limbs. Of the remaining 158 lower limbs, 117 (74%) exhibited excessive FA and 41 (26%) did not. Of the 117 with excessive FA, kinematics showed only 66 (56%) with excessive internal hip rotation (with or without excessive internal pelvic rotation). Of the 41 lower limbs without excessive FA, 25 were explained by excessive internal pelvic rotation and 16 were explained by excessive internal hip rotation (isolated spasticity and/or contracture of internal rotator muscles). Turned inward patella was caused by isolated excessive internal pelvic rotation in 48%, excessive internal hip rotation in 35% (including 44 cases with excessive FA and 12 cases with isolated spasticity and/or contracture of internal hip rotators), and excessive internal hip rotation combined with excessive internal pelvic rotation in 17%.

Conclusions

Excessive FA was not the only cause of turned inward patella gait and could not explain this gait anomaly by itself. Excessive internal pelvic rotation was the most frequent cause of turned inward patella gait.

### Postoperative radiograph of the hip arthroplasty: what the radiologist should know [^f9b3c13d]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The vertical centre of rotation

The vertical centre of rotation (Fig. 10) is defined by the distance between the centre of the femoral head and the transischial tuberosity line. Ideally, this distance should be equal to that of the contralateral hip, mimicking normal anatomy.

The acetabular inclination

The acetabular inclination (Fig. 11) is the angle between the articular side of the acetabular cup and the transverse axis. Measurement of this angle can be done by drawing a line through the medial and lateral margins of the cup and measuring the angle with the transischial tuberosity line. The normal range of inclination is between 30 and 50°. Smaller angles provide a stable hip but a reduced abduction. Greater angles are associated with greater risk of hip dislocation.

Fig. 11
The acetabular inclination is measured by drawing a line through the medial and lateral margins of the cup (line E) and measuring the angle with the transverse pelvic axis (line D). The femoral stem positioning should be aligned with the longitudinal axis of the shaft (line F = normal, longitudinal axis of the shaft)

Femoral stem positioning

Ideally, the position of the femoral stem (Fig. 11) on an AP view should be seen in neutral alignment with the longitudinal axis of the femoral shaft, and the tip situated in the centre of the shaft. Many studies have shown that failure of the femoral stem is associated with varus malpositioning. The femoral component of a resurfacing arthroplasty should be placed in a relative valgus position of 5°–10° (Fig. 12).

Fig. 12
Normal valgus positioning of the femoral stem in a resurfacing arthroplasty (line H) compared with the longitudinal axis of the femoral neck (line G)

The acetabular anteversion

The acetabular anteversion is defined on a lateral view by the angle between the acetabular axis and the coronal plane (Fig. 13). Normal value ranges from 5° to 25° anteversion as this allows adequate flexion of the hip. Acetabular retroversion predisposes to hip dislocation.

Fig. 13

The acetabular anteversion is defined by the angle between the acetabular axis (line I) and the coronal plane (line J). In this patient, the angle measures approximately 25° (normal range between 5°–25°)

### Impact of the femoral head position on moment arms in total hip arthroplasty: a parametric finite element study [^feb738c8]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although the importance of accurate femoral reconstruction to achieve a good functional outcome is well documented, quantitative data on the effects of a displacement of the femoral center of rotation on moment arms are scarce. The purpose of this study was to calculate moment arms after nonanatomical femoral reconstruction.

Methods

Finite element models of 15 patients including the pelvis, the femur, and the gluteal muscles were developed. Moment arms were calculated within the native anatomy and compared to distinct displacement of the femoral center of rotation (leg lengthening of 10 mm, loss of femoral offset of 20%, anteversion ± 10°, and fixed anteversion at 15°). Calculations were performed within the range of motion observed during a normal gait cycle.

Results

Although with all evaluated displacements of the femoral center of rotation, the abductor moment arm remained positive, some fibers initially contributing to extension became antagonists (flexors) and vice versa. A loss of 20% of femoral offset led to an average decrease of 15% of abductor moment. Femoral lengthening and changes in femoral anteversion (± 10°, fixed at 15°) led to minimal changes in abductor moment arms (maximum change of 5%). Native femoral anteversion correlated with the changes in moment arms induced by the 5 variations of reconstruction.

Conclusion

Accurate reconstruction of offset is important to maintaining abductor moment arms, while changes of femoral rotation had minimal effects. Patients with larger native femoral anteversion appear to be more susceptible to femoral head displacements.

### Correction of anteversion in skeletally immature patients: percutaneous osteotomy and transtrochanteric intramedullary rod [^492a3695]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

There has been reluctance by some surgeons to accept antegrade femoral nailing in children and adolescents due to concerns about producing iatrogenic osteonecrosis or growth disturbance of the femoral neck. Others believe that with the recent advent of pediatric transtrochanteric intramedullary nails, femoral fracture and osteotomy fixation may now safely be accomplished using these devices. Extrapolating from experience treating mature patients, the senior author (P.S.) has adopted the technique of percutaneous femoral osteotomy and transtrochanteric intramedullary fixation in skeletally immature patients as a standard approach for the correction of anteversion, combining this with concomitant surgery as indicated.

Methods

With the institutional review board approval, we reviewed our experience using the Phillips intramedullary rod (EBI/Biomet, Inc, Warsaw, Ind), to secure femoral osteotomies in a series of 30 patients with 40 femoral osteotomies (10 bilateral). The etiologies of anteversion included idiopathic and neuromuscular. There were 10 boys and 20 girls, ranging in age from 8 to 16 years and in weight from 32 to 60 kg. Additional surgical bony and soft tissue procedures were combined as indicated. These included supramalleolar osteotomy, hindfoot stabilization, tendon lengthening or transfers, and hemiepiphysiodesis in select patients. Two of the femoral rotational corrections were combined with shortening.

Results

Despite early mobilization without casts, each osteotomy healed primarily in an average of 3 months, and the complication rate was exceedingly low. One patient had removal of a loose distal interlocking screw at 6 weeks postinsertion. By that time, he had formed good callus and had rotational stability; thus, the outcome was not compromised. Importantly, we have not observed osteonecrosis, growth disturbance of the femoral neck, or limb length discrepancy resulting from this treatment method.

Conclusions

In the skeletally immature patient, femoral anteversion can safely be corrected using the Phillips/Biomet antegrade locked intramedullary rod, placed through a transtrochanteric approach; growth disturbance has not been encountered. This device is well tolerated, with a low complication rate. Compared with alternative techniques, recuperation is rapid and fixation problems seen with plates or crossed pins/spica are largely circumvented. The advantages include quadriceps sparing, minimal blood loss, and the use of a load-sharing, low-profile implant.

Level Of Evidence

IV (retrospective, clinical).

### Comparison of native anatomy with recommended safe component orientation in total hip arthroplasty for primary osteoarthritis [^f09f1552]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The adverse consequences of impingement, dislocation, and implant wear have stimulated increasing interest in accurate component orientation in total hip arthroplasty and hip resurfacing. The aims of the present study were to define femoral and acetabular orientation in a cohort of patients with primary hip osteoarthritis and to determine whether the orientation of their native hip joints corresponded with established recommendations for implantation of prosthetic components.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated a consecutive series of 131 preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with primary end-stage hip osteoarthritis (fifty-seven male and seventy-four female patients; mean age, sixty years). Patients were positioned according to a standardized protocol. Accounting for pelvic tilt, three-dimensional acetabular orientation was determined in the anatomical reference frame. Moreover, three-dimensional femoral version was measured. Differences in native anatomy between male and female patients were assessed with use of nonparametric tests. Native anatomy was evaluated with reference to the "safe zone" as described by Lewinnek et al. and to a "safe" combined anteversion of 20° to 40°.

Results

In the entire cohort, the mean femoral anteversion was 13° and the mean acetabular anteversion was 19°. No significant differences in femoral, acetabular, or combined (femoral and acetabular) anteversion were observed between male and female patients. The mean acetabular inclination was 62°. There was no significant difference in acetabular inclination between female and male patients. We did not observe a correlation among acetabular inclination, acetabular anteversion, and femoral anteversion. Ninety-five percent (125) of the native acetabula were classified as being within the safe anteversion zone, whereas only 15% (nineteen) were classified as being within the safe inclination zone. Combined anteversion was within the safe limits in 63% (eighty-three) of the patients. However, only 8% (ten) of the cases in the present cohort met the criteria of both "safe zone" definitions (that of Lewinnek et al. and combined anteversion).

Conclusions

Acetabular anteversion of the osteoarthritic hip as defined by the native acetabular rim typically matches the recommended component "targets" for cup insertion. There was no specific relationship among native acetabular inclination, acetabular anteversion, and femoral anteversion. Neither native acetabular inclination nor native combined anteversion appears to be related to current implant insertion targets.

Clinical Relevance

The present findings of native acetabular and femoral orientation in patients with primary hip osteoarthritis support intraoperative component positioning for total hip arthroplasty.

### Prediction of postoperative stem anteversion in crowe type II / III developmental dysplasia of the hip on preoperative two-dimensional computed tomography [^9866ede6]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative planning is fundamental for total hip arthroplasty. This study investigated the optimal femoral neck level for measuring femoral anteversion to predict postoperative stem anteversion in developmental dysplasia of the hip and determined the predictive role of average anteversion based on the sagittal 3-point fixation.

Methods

Sixty-two Crowe type II/III dysplastic hips that underwent total hip arthroplasty were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative anteversion was measured via 2-dimensional computed tomography. Anterior and posterior cortex anteversions were measured at 6 levels of the proximal femur. Femoral anteversion at each level was calculated. Average anterior (lesser trochanter) and posterior cortex anteversions (femoral neck) were calculated based on the sagittal 3-point fixation.

Results

From the lesser trochanter to head-neck junction, femoral anteversion decreased gradually from more to less than stem anteversion. For hips with femoral neck height ≥ 10 mm, femoral anteversion at the 10-mm level above the lesser trochanter proximal base showed no significant difference with stem anteversion, with a good correlation for the single-wedge and an excellent correlation for the double-wedge stem. Average anterior (lesser trochanter proximal base) and posterior cortex anteversions (femoral neck at 10 mm above the lesser trochanter proximal base) showed no significant difference from stem anteversion, with excellent correlations.

Conclusion

For Crowe type II/III hips with femoral neck height ≥ 10 mm, the 10-mm level above the lesser trochanter proximal base is an optimal choice for measuring femoral anteversion to predict postoperative stem anteversion. The average of anterior cortex anteversion at the lesser trochanter and posterior cortex anteversion at the femoral neck has a predictive role.

### Risk factors for nonunion after femoral rotational osteotomy for idiopathic anteversion and retroversion in adolescents [^bde8bee5]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lower extremity rotational abnormalities can cause difficulty with ambulation, patellofemoral pain and instability, hip and ankle pain, as well as differences in self-image in children and adolescents. Rotational osteotomies of the femur to correct these torsional differences have been shown to improve function, pain, and self-image. There are no studies to date evaluating risk factors for nonunion after femoral rotational osteotomies in children and adolescents.

Methods

Patients 10 to 18 years old treated with femoral rotational osteotomy fixed with intramedullary nailing for idiopathic anteversion and retroversion over a 15-year period were included. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for patient characteristics, laterality, concomitant tibia osteotomy, nail material, interlocking screw construct, and radiographic measurements, including osteotomy location and canal fit. Patients with nonunion were compared with those who fully healed.

Results

In this study of 203 femoral rotational osteotomies in 118 adolescent patients, the total incidence of nonunion was 10/203 for a rate of 4.9%. Overall complication rate was 6.9%. Univariate analysis of patient factors revealed that patients who were older, had a higher weight, and higher BMI were at higher risk of nonunion. The use of static interlocking screws and a lower canal fit ratio were also associated significantly with nonunion. Multivariate stepwise linear regression found relative canal fit (P = 0.003) and interlock configuration (P = 0.003) to be significant, and causal modeling identified significant factors related to nonunion as older age, static interlock type, and lower canal fit.

Conclusions

Nonunion after femoral osteotomy is associated with higher age, weight, and BMI as well as use of static interlocking screws and lower canal fit ratio. Surgeons can use this information to risk stratify and counsel patients undergoing this procedure. Surgical techniques to minimize the chance of nonunion include use of dynamic interlocking screws and maximizing the canal fit ratio.

### Assessment of femoral antetorsion with MRI: comparison of oblique measurements to standard transverse measurements [^f84586fd]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Abnormal femoral antetorsion is associated with the development of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). Anatomically correct antetorsion measurements are performed on transverse MR images over the proximal and distal femur, but some authors use alternative measurements on oblique images parallel to the femoral neck axis. We set out to assess the relationship between these two measurement methods and to obtain reference values for oblique measurements in patients with FAI and healthy control subjects. We also evaluated whether the oblique measurements could be used to predict the standard transverse measurements.

Subjects and Methods

MRI data of 126 individuals, 63 asymptomatic volunteers and 63 patients with FAI (age 20–50 years), were included in this prospective study. Two readers independently assessed antetorsion with oblique measurements and standard transverse measurements. Differences between subgroups were compared with the unpaired t test. Trigonometric calculations were used to predict standard antetorsion measurements on the basis of oblique measurements. Interobserver agreement and Bland-Altman plots were calculated.

Results

Reference values for assessing femoral antetorsion with the oblique method were established, with mean (± SD) values of 9.4° ± 7.9° (reader 1) and 9.8° ± 8.4° (reader 2) for patients and 9.2° ± 8.4° (reader 1) and 9.6° ± 9.1° (reader 2) for asymptomatic volunteers. The oblique method generated smaller antetorsion values than the standard transverse method (p < 0.001), with an average difference of 3.5° ± 3.2° for reader 1 and 3.6° ± 3.5° for reader 2. Differences between predicted antetorsion values based on oblique measurements and standard measurements were minimal: 0.1° ± 2.9° (p = 0.62) for reader 1 and 0.3° ± 3.3° (p = 0.29) for reader 2. Interobserver agreement was high for all antetorsion measurements (intra-class correlation coefficient, 0.945–0.977).

Conclusion

Oblique measurements of femoral antetorsion were smaller than standard transverse measurements, but they can be used to accurately predict standard measurements.

### Cam morphology is associated with increased femoral version: findings from a collection of 1, 321 cadaveric femurs [^b76b4f7a]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate the relationship between femoral version (FV) and α angle (AA) in a large osteological collection of human femurs.

Methods

The University of Iowa-Stanford osteological collection was used to evaluate the research aims. To measure FV and AA, axial photographs of the proximal femurs were taken, referenced from the posterior condylar axis. FV and AA measurements were obtained using ImageJ software, and the relationship between FV and AA was assessed with repeated-measures analysis of variance and generalized linear models. A P value of < .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

A total of 1321 cadaveric femurs (666 left and 655 right) in 721 cadavers were examined. The average AA for all femurs was 47.8° ± 10.9°, and the average FV for all femurs was 8.53° ± 8.09°. Overall, 191 femurs (14.5%) exhibited cam morphology (AA ≥ 60°). Of the 721 cadavers, 600 had both femurs available for side-to-side comparison. The average FV of femurs with cam morphology was significantly higher than that of femurs without cam morphology (11.70° ± 8.82° vs. 7.99° ± 8.82°, P < .001). Linear regression analysis demonstrated that increased AA was significantly correlated with increased FV (β ± standard error of the mean = 0.21 ± 0.02, P < .0001).

Conclusion

In a large osteological collection of human femurs, a significant positive relationship between AA and increasing FV was identified.

Clinical Relevance

FAI and hip impingement morphology are more complex than cam or pincer morphology. Cam morphology with high femoral anteversion may allow for normal or near-normal hip mechanics without impingement, and this may partially explain the high rates of asymptomatic cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) morphology in active and general populations. Given the multiple morphological factors implicated in the development of FAI syndrome, these findings warrant further investigation.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^c77f1b26]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Femoral and acetabular version and the McKibbin Index — biomechanical implications and normal range are summarized as follows: Excessive femoral retroversion leads to increased hip external rotation (ER) range of motion (ROM) and decreased hip internal rotation (IR) ROM. Increased femoral anteversion may increase the risk of instability by stressing the anterior capsule, whereas reduced femoral anteversion may increase the risk for anterior impingement by decreasing femoroacetabular clearance during flexion, particularly with flexion and IR, raising risk for labral injury and later hip osteoarthritis (OA). The McKibbin Index is a summary measurement of femoral and acetabular version with normal values ranging from 20° to 50°.

### Editorial commentary: hip arthroscopy evolution and causes of failure [^04aef161]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Hip arthroscopy use has grown as a result of expanding indications; improved imaging including higher resolution magnetic resonance imaging with stronger magnetic fields and the advent of 3-dimensional computed tomography revealing the nuances of hip joint morphology; increased specialized training; improvements in instruments and implants; a record of successful outcomes; and increased understanding of microinstability, focal acetabular undercoverage or occult dysplasia, indications for labral reconstruction and capsular plication, and, most of all, femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, the leading diagnosis for which hip arthroscopy is performed, in the orthopaedic community as well as the general medical and athletic communities. We now know that labral repair results in better outcomes than labral debridement, and evidence suggests that capsule closure leads to better long-term success. Osteoarthritis and its correlate, advanced age, result in inferior survivorship after hip arthroscopy, which is unsurprising; hip preservation surgery is not designed to treat irreparable cartilage damage. Association of female sex with hip arthroscopy failure requires additional investigation. More females undergo hip arthroscopy than males, and females initially present with greater disability. Females tend to have smaller alpha angles, greater femoral and acetabular anteversion, and lower center edge angles than males, consistent with increased prevalence of hip dysplasia. Thus surgeons indicating females for hip arthroscopy should be aware of atypical locations of cam lesions, borderline dysplasia, or ligamentous laxity, all of which must be appropriately respected at the time of surgery. With all of the improvements we have made in techniques, patient diagnosis and surgical indications, and our overall understanding of complex anatomy and a technically challenging surgery, we can speculate that our long-term survivorship will only improve. I await with interest the long-term outcomes we will see 10 years from today, with the addition of insight from patient-reported outcome measures to answer these questions with greater certainty.

### Two or more impingement and / or instability deformities are often present in patients with hip pain [^213d8bb5]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Damage to the hip can occur due to impingement or instability caused by anatomic factors such as femoral and acetabular version, neck-shaft angle, alpha angle, and lateral center-edge angle (CEA). The associations between these anatomic factors and how often they occur in a painful hip are unclear but if unaddressed might explain failed hip preservation surgery.

Questions/Purposes

We determined (1) the influence of sex on the expression of impingement-related or instability-related factors, (2) the associations among these factors, and (3) how often both impingement and/or instability factors occur in the same hip.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 170 hips (145 patients) undergoing MR arthrography of the hip for any reason. We excluded 58 hips with high-grade dysplasia, Perthes' sequelae, previous surgery, or incomplete radiographic information, leaving 112 hips (96 patients). We measured femoral version and alpha angles on MR arthrograms. Acetabular anteversion, lateral CEA, and neck-shaft angle were measured on pelvic radiographs.

Results

We observed a correlation between sex and alpha angle. Weak or no correlations were observed between the other five parameters. In 66% of hips, two or more (of five) impingement parameters, and in 51% of hips, two or more (of five) instability parameters were found.

Conclusions

Patients with hip pain frequently have several anatomic factors potentially contributing to chondrolabral damage. To address pathologic hip loading due to impingement and/or instability, all of the anatomic influences should be known. As we found no associations between anatomic factors, we recommend an individualized assessment of each painful hip.

### Reliable method for avoiding malrotation deformity after intramedullary nailing of comminuted femur fractures: clinical validation of a previously described technique [^75e6b91b]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate a previously described technique using the inherent anteversion of intramedullary nail (IMN) to avoid malrotation in comminuted femur fractures and describe the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an alternative method for assessing postoperative femoral version.

Design

Prospective consecutive cohort study.

Setting

Level I trauma center.

Patient/Participants

Twenty-five consecutive patients with comminuted femur fractures (Winquist III/IV, OTA/AO 32-B/32-C) treated by a single surgeon with IMN between September 1, 2011, and February 28, 2015.

Intervention

IMN on a fracture table with intraoperative femoral version set by the inherent version of the implant. All patients received a postoperative computed tomography (CT) or MRI to assess femoral version.

Main Outcome Measurements

Mean difference in postoperative femoral anteversion (DFA) between injured limb and uninjured limb as measured by CT or MRI. Mean difference in postoperative femoral version of the injured femur from the inherent version of the implant (12 degrees) was measured with CT or MRI.

Results

The mean postoperative DFA was 9.1 ± 5.6 degrees. Postoperative DFA greater than 15 degrees was found in 2 (8.0%) patients. Mean difference in postoperative version of the injured femur from the inherent 12 degrees of the implant was 7.1 ± 5.4 degrees. Patients tolerated MRI studies well.

Conclusions

Our previously described technique using the inherent anteversion of an IMN is effective and leads to a very low rate of malrotation, even in highly comminuted fractures. The technique is particularly useful in treating bilateral femur fractures. MRI can be used safely and effectively to assess anteversion after fixation of femur fractures.

### Diaphyseal derotational osteotomy with intramedullary fixation for correction of excessive femoral anteversion in children [^bad190aa]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2005). Low credibility.

Nearly all children with femoral anteversion spontaneously remodel by age 8. Femoral derotational osteotomies are performed in older children with persistent excessive femoral anteversion when children or adolescents are limited in activities of daily living or sports. Procedures for correction of the anteversion vary, and no one procedure has been shown to be superior. Since 1997 the authors have corrected idiopathic excessive femoral anteversion thorough a diaphyseal osteotomy with fixation using a rigid intramedullary pediatric femoral nail. The purpose of this study was to describe the technique and results of this new technique. A retrospective study was conducted of all femoral derotational osteotomies performed with a pediatric femoral nail in 13 consecutive patients and 21 affected limbs. All patients complained preoperatively of frequent tripping during sports and activities of daily living. The mean preoperative rotation included internal rotation of 77 degrees and external rotation of 15 degrees. Standing AP radiographs of all patients were obtained at final follow-up. All patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically at a minimum of 1 year after surgery. All patients noted improvement in the ability to participate in activities without tripping. No patient limped at final follow-up. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. Healing of the osteotomy was present at a mean of 6 weeks. All osteotomies healed in anatomic alignment. Mean final hip rotation included internal rotation of 40 degrees and external rotation of 57 degrees. No patient had substantial changes of valgus or femoral neck narrowing at final follow-up. Femoral derotational osteotomy with fixation using a small-diameter rigid intramedullary nail placed through the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter is a safe, accurate, and effective method of correcting excessive femoral anteversion in symptomatic children.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^9a1b7d79]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Femoral neck abnormalities — inclination and version are characterized by an angle of inclination of 125°, with angulations above 130° described as coxa valga and those below 120° coxa vara. Femoral version refers to the positional relationship between the proximal femoral neck and distal femoral condyles in the transverse plane, and excessive femoral anteversion is characterized by an increased amount of hip IR range of motion (ROM) and decreased hip ER ROM.

### Development and validation of a mobile application for measuring femoral anteversion in patients with cerebral palsy [^9e4aaddd]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

The mobile application newly developed in this study has some advantages over the EOS system. First, the application only requires mobile devices and conventional radiographs to visualize a 3D image of the femur. However, the validity and reliability of this method are comparable to those of EOS. Second, the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction with the SSM depends on the subjects used therein. The range of femoral anteversion is limited in the SSM as it uses only typical or healthy subjects. However, the mobile application was developed from an SSM using 54 CP patients who showed substantial variation in femoral anteversion and coxa valga. The mobile application, therefore, could cover anteversion from 6 to 62 degrees in this study. Third, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study investigating the validity and reliability of the EOS system in CP patients with severe deformity of the proximal femur. Fourth, the use of the EOS system requires patients to stand still for 10 seconds. Most patients with Gross Motor Function Classification System level IV to V and some with Gross Motor Function Classification System level III are therefore not suitable candidates for EOS imaging. However, our application needs only the AP and LAT radiograph with patient in any position.

In conclusion, the measurement of femoral anteversion with the mobile application showed excellent validity and reliability in patients with CP. Furthermore, the newly developed mobile application can be easily used with conventional radiographic equipment, and incorporated into existing clinical protocols. Therefore, anyone with a smartphone or tablet can reconstruct the 3D femur shapes in their hospitals without any additional apparatus. We believe that the newly developed mobile application in this study is an appropriate technology for assessing femoral anteversion. In the future, we expect to expand the application for use in 3D reconstruction of the tibia and spine.

### Femoral anteversion change is associated with ischiofemoral impingement after total hip arthroplasty: a retrospective CT evaluation [^6b1346e5]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Calculation of femoral anteversion on axial CT images. The angle was defined by lines that were drawn through the prosthesis neck and the center of the prosthesis head (a) as well as through the posterior tangent connecting the most distal points of the femoral condyles (b). For calculating the femoral anteversion, two angle measurements were taken using a horizontal line (G ′) as a fixed reference for the femoral neck and femoral condyle axis. The resulting angles were then added or subtracted, depending on whether they were oriented in the same or opposite direction

For the calculation of FO, CT images were adjusted utilizing multiplanar reformation along the axes of the prosthesis shaft in the axial and sagittal plane (Fig. 3). FO was then calculated as the distance between the center of rotation of the femoral head and a line bisecting the long axis of the femur. For anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis obtained before surgery, the same measurement method was conducted and the FO difference between pre-and post-surgical images was calculated. A magnification marker was available for all radiographs to prevent measurement inconsistencies. Patients were categorized into three groups according to the current literature: (1) patients with an FO decrease greater than 5 mm, (2) patients with a restored FO between −5 mm and +5 mm, and (3) patients with an FO increase greater than 5 mm.

For calculation of femoral offset on CT images, these were adjusted utilizing multiplanar reformation along the axes of the prosthesis shaft in the axial and sagittal plane (a, b). Subsequently, a line was drawn along the femoral shaft (G ′), intersecting the most prominent point of the greater trochanter. Femoral offset (double-arrow) was then calculated as the distance between the femoral head center of rotation and a line bisecting the femoral long axis (c). The same method for calculation of the femoral offset (double-arrow) was applied for pre-surgical radiographs of the pelvis (d)

### Malalignment sign on knee magnetic resonance imaging: a new predictor for excessive femoral anteversion in patients with patellar dislocation [^5eeab538]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the clinical relevance of the newly identified malalignment sign in predicting excessive femoral anteversion in patients with patellar dislocations.

Methods

A total of 55 patients with patellar dislocation who underwent surgical treatment between 2016 and 2019 were included in this study. Femoral anteversion, tibial torsion, and the femorotibial index were measured via a CT scan. The malalignment sign on the knee MRI was defined as a malalignment between the lateral side of the intercondylar fossa of the femur and the lateral intercondylar eminence of the tibial plateau.

Results

A positive malalignment sign was observed in 36 of the 55 patients. Increased femoral anteversion was significantly correlated with the number of frames with a positive malalignment sign (r = 0.511, P < 0.001). The value of femoral anteversion was significantly greater in the group with a positive malalignment sign (P = 0.02). For a femoral anteversion value of 32°, the sensitivity and specificity of the malalignment sign reached the maximal level of 89.5% and 47.2%, respectively.

Conclusion

Increased femoral anteversion correlated significantly with a positive malalignment sign on knee MRI. However, tibial torsion did not affect the malalignment sign. A positive malalignment sign is evidence for femoral derotation osteotomy.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV.

### Femoral anteversion change is associated with ischiofemoral impingement after total hip arthroplasty: a retrospective CT evaluation [^7261e4c1]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The first major finding of this study was that IFI occurred significantly more often in THA patients with a higher postoperative FA, and especially with a larger FA change. The main etiology of pain in patients with IFI is attributed to the mechanical compression of the quadratus femoris muscle by narrowing of the ischiofemoral space, which is caused by various factors, including congenital conditions (e.g. coxa valga, developmental dysplasia of the hip), acquired deformities (e.g. severe osteoarthritis), and iatrogenic causes such as THA. In THA, quadratus femoris entrapment due to a decrease of the ischiofemoral space can be severe, as the postoperative anteversion angles of the femur exhibit a significant variability. Additionally, biomechanical factors such as abductor insufficiency (e.g. due to degenerative or iatrogenic partial tear) can contribute to a "dynamic" mechanical conflict as a consequence of increased hip adduction. These biomechanical considerations offer a plausible explanation for the association between higher FA and IFI. However, the current understanding of the influence of FA change following THA is limited. This knowledge gap becomes particularly relevant when considering the variability of postoperative FA, which is influenced by factors such as stem design and cementation, with the greatest variability observed in patients with cementless THA as in the present study. It is worth noting that a rotational adjustment of the stem during surgery is better achieved with cemented stems because the liquid cement allows for a degree of rotation both during and after the complete placement of the stem. In everyday clinical practice, the surgeon often positions relative to the condylar plane of the femur by eye adhering to a "safe zone" as described by Lewinnek et al. However, the use of mechanical insertion devices, intraoperative fluoroscopy, or imageless navigation has been advocated for a more precise component placement. The high predictive power of FA change observed in this study therefore underpins the importance of a correct stem placement along with the use of preoperative CT imaging for THA, suggesting that restoring preoperative FA levels may aid in minimizing the occurrence of postoperative IFI.

### A morphometric study of normal and varus knees [^9b26c6df]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the study was to investigate varus and normal knee morphologies to identify differences that may affect knee replacement alignment or design for varus knees.

Methods

Computed tomography scans of varus and normal knees were analyzed, and geometric shapes, points and axes were fit to the femur and tibia independently. These points were then projected in the three anatomical planes to measure the variations between the two groups.

Results

In the femur, varus knees had less femoral anteversion (p < 0.0001) and a larger medial extension facet (p < 0.05) compared with normal knees. In the tibia, the tubercle was found to be externally rotated in varus knees (12°), with a significant increase in the coronal slope (p = 0.001) and the extension facet angle (p = 0.002).

Conclusions

The study highlighted the differences and similarities found between the two groups, which raises awareness on changes required during surgical intervention and component placement or design for a varus knee. This is particularly relevant for the design of patient-specific instrumentation and implants.

Levels of evidence

Diagnostic study, Level III.

### Femoral anteversion change is associated with ischiofemoral impingement after total hip arthroplasty: a retrospective CT evaluation [^dc3a895a]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The number of total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures has increased worldwide due to the rising life expectancy, making it one of the most commonly performed orthopedic procedures. Most patients experience good pain relief and restoration of hip function after surgery. Nevertheless, a subset of patients experience persistent or even newly emerging hip pain after surgery.

Hip pain after THA can be caused by various factors such as aseptic loosening, instability, infection, periprosthetic fracture, or penetrating acetabular screws. Lateral hip pain occurs frequently after THA and is denoted as greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) in the current literature. GTPS is experienced by approximately 4–17% of patients following THA and is believed to result either from iatrogenic damage to the tendons of the hip abductors and short external rotators or from degenerative abductor tendon changes potentially affecting the subgluteal bursae, resulting in an inflammatory reaction. Ischiofemoral impingement (IFI) manifests as buttock and groin pain and originates from a soft-tissue compression of the quadratus femoris muscle between the lesser trochanter and the ischial tuberosity.

Although surgical and demographic factors, such as surgical approach, cup overhang, and female sex, have been recognized as possible causes of GTPS after THA, the role of the femoral offset change (FO) has been investigated in only a limited number of studies, and these studies have produced conflicting results. On the other hand, higher femoral anteversion (FA) after THA is suspected to be associated with IFI, but it is not known whether this association is also present with the now common anterior surgical approach. Furthermore, the effect of changing FA on hip pain following THA has not yet been reported. In light of this data gap, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of FA and FO change as measured on CT images on the occurrence of IFI and GTPS in patients after undergoing anterior-approached THA.

### Development and validation of a mobile application for measuring femoral anteversion in patients with cerebral palsy [^4f83dbc3]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Computed tomography (CT) provides benefits for 3-dimensional (3D) visualization of femur deformities. However, the potential adverse effects of radiation exposure have become a concern. Consequently, a biplanar imaging system EOS has been proposed to enable reconstruction of the 3D model of the femur. However, this system requires a calibrated apparatus, the cost of which is high, and the area occupied by it is substantial. The purpose of this study was to develop a mobile application that included a new method of 3D reconstruction of the femur from conventional radiographic images and to evaluate the validity and reliability of mobile the application when measuring femoral anteversion.

Methods

The statistical shape model, graph-cut algorithm, and iterative Perspective-n-Point algorithm were utilized to develop the application. The anteroposterior and lateral images of a femur can be input using the embedded camera or by file transfer, and the touch interface aids accurate contouring of the femur. Regarding validation, the CT scans and conventional radiographic images of 36 patients with cerebral palsy were used. To evaluate concurrent validity, the femoral anteversion measurements on the images reconstructed from the mobile application were compared with those from the 3D CT images. Three clinicians assessed interobserver reliability.

Results

The mobile application, which reconstructs the 3D image from conventional radiographs, was successfully developed. Regarding concurrent validity, the correlation coefficient between femoral anteversion measured using 3D CT and the mobile application was 0.968 (P < 0.001). In terms of interobserver reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient among the 3 clinicians was 0.953.

Conclusions

The measurement of femoral anteversion with the mobile application showed excellent concurrent validity and reliability in patients with cerebral palsy. The proposed mobile application can be used with conventional radiographs and does not require additional apparatus. It can be used as a convenient technique in hospitals that cannot afford a CT machine or an EOS system.

Level III-diagnostic.

### Valgus hip with high antetorsion causes pain through posterior extraarticular FAI [^93390308]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Valgus hips with increased antetorsion present with lack of external rotation and posterior hip pain that is aggravated with hip extension and external rotation. This may be the result of posterior femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).

Questions/Purposes

We asked whether (1) the range of motion (ROM); (2) the location of anterior and posterior bony collision zones; and (3) the prevalence of extraarticular impingement differ between valgus hips with increased antetorsion compared with normal hips and hips with idiopathic FAI.

Methods

Surface models based on CT scan reconstructions of 13 valgus hips with increased antetorsion, 22 hips with FAI, and 27 normal hips were included. Validated three-dimensional collision detection software was used to quantify the simulated hip ROM and the location of impingement on the acetabular and the femoral sides.

Results

Hips with coxa valga and antetorsion showed decreased extension, external rotation, and adduction, whereas internal rotation in 90° of flexion was increased. Impingement zones were more anteroinferior on the femur and posteroinferior on the acetabular (pelvic) side; and the zones were more frequently extraarticular, posterior, or to a lesser degree anterior against the inferior iliac spine. We found a higher prevalence of extraarticular impingement for valgus hips with increased antetorsion.

Conclusions

Valgus hips with increased antetorsion predispose to posterior extraarticular FAI and to a lesser degree anteroinferior spine impingement.

### Femoral anteversion change is associated with ischiofemoral impingement after total hip arthroplasty: a retrospective CT evaluation [^b4d4dc84]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has the following limitations: First, even though we included a large cohort of 197 patients with postoperative CT examinations, postoperative IFI or GTPS was comparatively rare and only present in 22 patients. Second, the majority of postoperative CTs were performed due to complications after hip pain. However, we have made an effort to exclude all patients with identifiable causes of hip pain and only included patients in whom the clinical and radiological diagnosis of IFI and GTPS were concordant. Finally, establishing a correlation between the clinical identification of IFI and GTPS and their radiologic diagnosis remains challenging, as even asymptomatic individuals may exhibit signs of these conditions without experiencing symptoms.

### Don't order radiographs or advise bracing or surgery for a child less… [^52f3e0ab]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Mild in-toeing is usually a physiologic phenomenon reflecting ongoing maturation of the skeleton. Metatarsus adductus, femoral anteversion, and tibial torsion all contribute to in-toeing and tend to improve with growth. Simply monitoring gait for continued improvement at normal well child examination intervals is adequate until the age of seven or eight unless there is severe tripping and falling or asymmetry. It is not possible to alter the natural evolution using physical therapy, bracing or shoe inserts.

### Femoral anteversion is related to tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance in patients with patellar dislocation [^f4465895]. Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the potential relationship between the tibial tubercle-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance and the femoral anteversion of different segments of the femur in patients with patellar dislocation.

Methods

A total of 60 patients with a diagnosis of patellar dislocation were included in our study. Patients with previous knee surgeries, previous fractures, or lack of necessary radiologic examinations were excluded from our study. The data of computed tomography scanning within a week before the surgery was used to measure the TT-TG distance, total anteversion, proximal anteversion, diaphyseal anteversion, distal anteversion, and tibial torsion. All the data were obtained from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) workstation. The Pearson correlation analysis was performed to confirm the potential relationship between TT-TG distance and femoral anteversion of different segments. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess the interobserver reliability of measurements.

Results

The TT-TG distance was significantly correlated with the diaphyseal anteversion (r = -0.305, P = 0.008) and distal anteversion (r = 0.365, P = 0.004). The total anteversion was associated with proximal anteversion (r = 0.392, P = 0.02) and diaphyseal anteversion (r = 0.631, P < 0.001). The intraclass correlation coefficient showed the measurements of included parameters were presented with excellent agreement.

Conclusion

Our study showed that patients with high diaphyseal anteversion and distal anteversion tend to had a higher TT-TG distance but the value of total and proximal femoral anteversion were independent of the value of TT-TG distance.
