## Question

Oroantral communication in of the tooth

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about oroantral communication (OAC): its definition, etiology, risk factors, diagnosis, complications, and management, including differences between acute and chronic scenarios and considerations for special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the path from acute OAC to chronic oroantral fistula (OAF). Then, I should verify the etiologies and risk factors, including imaging predictors. Next, I will review diagnostic methods, including clinical maneuvers and imaging. After that, I need to assess complications, especially odontogenic sinusitis and implant-related issues. Finally, I will outline management strategies for acute and chronic cases, including flap choices, adjunctive techniques, and multidisciplinary care, and close with special considerations and a concise algorithmic summary.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. Oroantral communication is an abnormal perforation between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus, most commonly after extraction of posterior maxillary teeth. If it persists beyond roughly 48–72 hours and epithelializes, it becomes an oroantral fistula, which is a chronic pathologic tract that will not heal spontaneously and requires surgical closure [^1148JL2L] [^111he7jG].

> I need to check the etiologies carefully. The most common cause is extraction of maxillary molars, particularly first molars, due to proximity of roots to the sinus floor. Other causes include implant placement, sinus augmentation, orthognathic surgery, trauma, cyst or tumor removal, and radiation therapy, with some cases arising spontaneously in medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) or osteoradionecrosis contexts [^1148JL2L] [^114mV3nV] [^112XYjVW] [^114LLsbW] [^115PcfBC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about radiographic "risk". I initially thought that root protrusion into the sinus on periapical films would predict OAC, but wait, I should verify that. A recent cohort suggests that on periapical imaging, root protrusion is not significantly associated with intraoperative OAC, whereas CBCT-demonstrated discontinuity of the sinus floor is associated with OAC (OR ≈ 2.9), so CBCT is advised when protrusion is present but may be unnecessary if only overlap is seen. I should also consider that deeper impaction of maxillary third molars increases perforation risk during removal, and that prior sinus surgery or pathology can predispose to OAC, so I need to ask about those histories preoperatively [^111xJHBt].

> Next, I should review how to diagnose OAC at the chairside. Let me think about the basics: inspect the socket for a dark cavity, probe gently to assess depth and bony continuity, and perform a Valsalva maneuver to detect an air leak. A positive Valsalva supports the diagnosis and helps gauge defect size, though I should avoid forceful probing that could enlarge the defect or push debris into the sinus [^111zjv2v] [^116zn1Xm]. I need to ensure I document size because management often stratifies by defect diameter, with smaller defects (< 3–5 mm) sometimes managed conservatively, whereas larger defects generally require surgical closure [^1148JL2L] [^111TUoKo].

> I will now examine imaging indications. Panoramic radiographs can screen for root-sinus relationships, but CBCT is superior for defining the exact size and location of the bony defect, excluding retained roots or foreign bodies, and detecting sinus pathology; if CBCT shows sinus floor discontinuity, the risk of OAC is higher, which should prompt a lower threshold for surgical closure and sinus evaluation [^111xJHBt] [^114a6Er8]. But wait, what if there is concurrent sinus disease? In that case, I should coordinate with otolaryngology for endoscopic assessment and drainage planning to avoid persistent infection undermining repair [^1157Q5KW].

> Let me consider complications next, because they drive urgency. Persistent OAC/OAF permits bacterial contamination of the sinus, leading to odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, which accounts for a substantial proportion of maxillary sinusitis and may be underrecognized; typical features include foul smell, facial pain, and purulence, and anaerobes are commonly isolated, supporting an odontogenic source when present [^114mV3nV] [^116uu487] [^112rdEin]. I should double-check for foreign bodies or displaced implants in the sinus, as these perpetuate infection and require retrieval, often endoscopically, before definitive fistula closure [^1157Q5KW] [^111sH1E9].

> Now, I need to outline acute OAC management. Immediate goals are to prevent contamination, stabilize the clot, and close the defect based on size and local factors. For small defects (≤ 3–5 mm), options include PRF membranes or an attachable oral wound dressing, which can be faster and less invasive than flaps; a randomized trial showed similar 30-day closure rates across OWD, gauze, and PRF, with shorter procedure time for OWD, and PRF series report high success with less pain and swelling compared with buccal advancement flaps in acute settings [^111TUoKo] [^111zjv2v] [^116adtk3]. For larger defects or when soft tissue quality is poor, I should favor a well-vascularized flap such as a buccal advancement or palatal rotational flap, and I must treat any sinus infection concurrently to reduce failure risk [^112csJnX] [^1157Q5KW].

> For chronic OAF, I should confirm that epithelialized tracts will not heal spontaneously and require formal surgical closure. Buccal advancement and palatal island flaps remain workhorses, with reported success rates around 86–97% depending on technique and infection control; double-layered closures and the buccal fat pad (BFP) are valuable alternatives, especially for larger defects or compromised local tissue, and long-term series support BFP durability with low recurrence when properly executed [^112csJnX] [^114rQj58] [^113pNWXn] [^114g3mfr]. Wait, let me verify the role of infection: the presence of active maxillary sinusitis at follow-up markedly increases recurrence risk, so I should ensure sinus drainage and culture-directed antibiotics before definitive closure, and consider combined endoscopic sinus surgery when disease is significant [^111T9Gnd] [^1157Q5KW].

> I should review adjunctive and emerging techniques with a cautious lens. Titanium mesh combined with endoscopic sinus surgery has been described for complex or recurrent cases, providing mechanical support and guiding regeneration, though mesh exposure can occur and staged removal may be needed; bony press-fit grafts can close defects and restore bone, and novel palatal submucosal flaps aim to minimize vestibular shortening and prosthetic interference; experimental biodegradable polyurethane foam has shown feasibility but remains investigational with variable success and a risk of sinusitis, so I should reserve it for select cases and ensure close follow-up [^115D9mZC] [^1145ZWwB] [^116yC8M1] [^116zETgv] [^111vm1CA].

> But wait, what if the patient needs implant rehabilitation? I need to ensure sinus membrane integrity and separate oral and sinus mucosa to avoid tearing during augmentation; simultaneous OAF closure with sinus floor elevation can reduce procedures and treatment time, with the lateral window approach offering more augmentation at the cost of greater early postoperative symptoms, whereas a transalveolar approach is less invasive when residual bone height exceeds about 5 mm; careful sequencing and membrane management are critical to avoid infection and graft failure [^1151Yt9E] [^1114dVJa] [^112XaYFq]. I should confirm that tapered, shorter implants can still perform well in augmented posterior maxilla after OAF repair when bone quality and volume are optimized [^1127JzDY].

> Special populations require tailored planning. In irradiated bone, I must anticipate poor healing and higher complication rates; coordination with radiation oncology to understand dose fields, consideration of hyperbaric oxygen where indicated, and meticulous soft tissue management are essential, and definitive reconstruction may require advanced flaps or staged grafting to mitigate fistulation risk [^115PcfBC] [^111GGKyY]. In MRONJ, oroantral or oronasal communications can occur and may necessitate conservative debridement, infection control, and staged reconstruction; imaging helps stage disease and plan interventions that balance infection eradication with tissue preservation [^114LLsbW] [^1145LmSR]. In medically complex or immunosuppressed patients, I should involve the medical team early, optimize systemic factors, and favor reliable, well-vascularized flaps such as BFP to maximize success and minimize recurrence [^115k54Xg] [^113pNWXn].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I will double-check each step against the evidence. Preoperatively, assess risk with clinical history and imaging; if CBCT shows sinus floor discontinuity or prior sinus disease, plan for a lower threshold for surgical closure and coordinate ENT if needed. Intraoperatively, if an OAC is recognized, document size, avoid aggressive irrigation or probing, and choose closure based on defect size and tissue quality: PRF or OWD for ≤ 3–5 mm, and a buccal or palatal flap or BFP for larger defects. Postoperatively, prescribe antibiotics with oral flora coverage when sinus contamination is suspected, enforce strict Valsalva precautions, and arrange close follow-up; if symptoms of sinusitis persist, obtain CBCT and consider endoscopic sinus surgery before declaring failure of the closure [^111xJHBt] [^116zn1Xm] [^111TUoKo] [^113pNWXn] [^1157Q5KW].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure that every OAC is managed with attention to size, timing, infection, and patient factors, because delays or incomplete treatment convert acute communications into chronic fistulas with substantial morbidity. A size-based, infection-controlled, flap-selection strategy — supported by appropriate imaging and multidisciplinary care — optimizes closure rates and reduces recurrence, enabling predictable functional and prosthetic rehabilitation when needed [^111T9Gnd] [^111A1AaU] [^1157Q5KW].

Oroantral communication (OAC) is an **abnormal connection between the oral cavity and maxillary sinus** [^111xJHBt], most often due to extraction of maxillary molars or premolars, implant surgery, or trauma [^1148JL2L]. It presents with **nasal regurgitation, foul taste, and recurrent sinus infections** [^113kbvvT]; diagnosis relies on clinical signs and imaging (panoramic, CBCT) [^114a6Er8] [^111xJHBt]. Immediate closure within 48 hours is critical to prevent chronic fistula and sinusitis [^1146CQi5]; options include buccal advancement, palatal flaps, buccal fat pad, or PRF, chosen by defect size and tissue quality [^114VPsus] [^111TUoKo]. Management must address infection, foreign bodies, and patient factors (smoking, diabetes) to reduce recurrence [^111T9Gnd] [^111A1AaU].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

OAC most commonly results from **iatrogenic or pathological causes**:

- **Tooth extraction**: Especially maxillary first molars/premolars due to close root-sinus proximity [^111NtHaW].
- **Implant surgery**: Sinus lift or implant placement violating the sinus floor [^111d2vwV].
- **Trauma**: Maxillofacial injuries disrupting the sinus floor [^1148JL2L].
- **Pathology**: Periapical infection, cysts, or tumors eroding the sinus floor [^1134L6BK].

Risk factors include **long or divergent roots, sinus pneumatization, operator inexperience, smoking, diabetes, and immunosuppression** [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with OAC typically present with the following **signs and symptoms**:

- **Nasal regurgitation**: Liquids or air passing into the nose when eating or drinking.
- **Foul taste or halitosis**: Due to sinus drainage into the oral cavity.
- **Recurrent sinus infections**: Persistent or recurrent maxillary sinusitis [^116uu487].
- **Nasal discharge**: Purulent or serous discharge from the nose.
- **Visible defect**: A hole or depression at the extraction site communicating with the sinus [^111zjv2v].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Accurate diagnosis relies on **clinical examination and imaging**:

- **Clinical examination**: Direct visualization of the defect, nasal blowing test (Valsalva maneuver), and probing of the socket [^111zjv2v].
- **Imaging**: Panoramic radiographs, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), and computed tomography (CT) scans to assess the size and extent of the communication [^115D9mZC] [^111xJHBt].

---

## Complications

If left untreated, OAC can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Chronic oroantral fistula**: Persistent epithelialized tract between the oral cavity and sinus [^111he7jG].
- **Chronic maxillary sinusitis**: Persistent sinus infection due to continuous contamination from the oral cavity [^112WXJmW].
- **Foreign body entrapment**: Displacement of teeth, implants, or other materials into the sinus [^112LC8VY].
- **Mucosal pathologies**: Development of sinonasal polyps or other mucosal lesions [^111aLKR9].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **size of the defect, duration, presence of infection, and patient factors**. Immediate closure within 48 hours is recommended to prevent chronic fistula formation [^111he7jG]:

| **Defect size** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Small (< 3 mm) | - Conservative management <br/> - Observation <br/> - Spontaneous closure likely [^111NtHaW] |
| Medium (3–5 mm) | - Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) <br/> - Buccal advancement flap <br/> - Palatal rotational flap [^111TUoKo] [^116adtk3] |
| Large (> 5 mm) | - Buccal fat pad flap <br/> - Double-layered closure <br/> - Combined endoscopic and intraoral approaches [^114g3mfr] [^114rQj58] [^115rFUg9] |

---

Adjunctive measures include **antibiotic therapy, sinus irrigation, and removal of foreign bodies or infected tissue** [^116uu487] [^112qMRor].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

The prognosis of OAC is **generally favorable** with appropriate management [^114q1BLF]. Recurrence can occur due to **infection, inadequate closure, or patient factors** such as smoking or diabetes [^111T9Gnd]. Reported recurrence rates vary from 10% to 20%, emphasizing the importance of meticulous surgical technique and postoperative care [^notfound].

---

Oroantral communication is a preventable and treatable complication of maxillary tooth extraction and implant surgery. Early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and **timely intervention** are essential to prevent chronic complications and ensure successful outcomes [^112WXJmW].

Background

Oroantral communication (OAC) can be defined as a pathologic space created between the maxillary sinus and the oral cavity. This communication and subsequent formation of a chronic oroantral fistula is a common complication often encountered by oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Although various techniques have been proposed in published studies, long-term successful closure of oroantral fistulas is still one of the most difficult problems confronting the surgeon working in the oral and maxillofacial region. The decision of which treatment modality to use is influenced by many factors, such as the amount and condition of tissue available for repair, the size and location of the defect, the presence of infection, the time to the diagnosis of the fistula.

Objective

To evaluate an alternative technique for the treatment of oro-antral fistula, using a combined therapeutic ear nose and throat/intraoral approach.

Methods

Twelve consecutive patients affected by complicated OAC were included in this study. The protocol consisted of: clinical, endoscopic, and radiological preoperative evaluation (panoramic tomogram and computed tomography); systemic antibiotic and steroid therapy for 2 weeks before surgery; one-stage surgical procedure consisting of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery technique associated with the closure of the OAC by a titanium mesh and a mucoperiosteal flap; postoperative antibiotic and cortisone-based therapy. A titanium mesh was used to obtain an optimal support and stabilization of soft tissues. Follow-up consisted of weekly clinical evaluation during the first month, a clinical evaluation at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 months and a nasal endoscopy at 3, 8, 24 weeks after surgery. A second surgical step took place to remove the mesh, after a period of healing, which went from 6 to 18 months. Samples were harvested from the surgical site after mesh removal for histological analysis.

Results

At 1 month follow-up, in 10 patients of 12, the Valsalva manoeuvre was negative, same result at the 3rd month follow-up, although in 11 of 12 patients. In 5 of 12 patients, the mesh was exposed. The histological analysis confirmed the formation of a pseudo-periosteum layer. One patient failed because the mesh lost its stability. The patient was operated again 8 months later and new mesh was fixed into place.

Conclusion

The current study showed that one-stage, combined endoscopic and intraoral approach represents a feasible and minimally invasive procedure for the long-term effective treatment of chronic complicated OACs. The main advantage of the use of a titanium mesh to guide the regeneration is that it assures a predictable healing, mechanic scaffold, tissues stability and allows a possible following oral rehabilitation.

### Nonsurgical closure of oroantral communications with a biodegradable polyurethane foam: a pilot study in rabbits [^111nSJAM]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Surgical closure of oroantral communications (OACs) has several disadvantages. An animal study was performed to test whether OACs can be closed nonsurgically with a biodegradable polyurethane (PU) foam.

Materials and Methods

In 6 rabbits, an OAC was created on both sides of the maxilla. Three rabbits were used to evaluate the animal model by applying a surgical treatment on 1 side and by leaving the other defects untreated. In the 3 other rabbits, OACs were closed with PU foam. Wound healing was evaluated clinically and histologically.

Results

The surgically treated defects healed without complications. The untreated defects showed complicated and delayed healing. Healing of the foam-treated OACs was dependent on the type of foam that was used.

Conclusions

The rabbit is a suitable animal model for OAC investigations. It is possible to close an OAC with a biodegradable PU foam. Further research is needed to show the most suitable composition of the PU for this purpose.

### Toothache in adolescents, adults, and older adults with No immediate access to definitive dental treatment [^1179tAuH]. ADA (2024). High credibility.

Guideline panel good practice statements — applicability and prescribing safety — advise clinicians to "counsel patients that they should expect some pain and the analgesics should make their pain manageable", and that these recommendations "only apply to settings in which definitive dental treatment is not immediately available". The panel "recommends clinicians thoroughly review the patient's medical and social history (including illicit and recreational drug use) and current medications and supplements to avoid overdose and adverse drug–drug interactions", and to "follow the principle of minimum effective dosage to achieve pain relief and avoid the routine use of delayed (i.e., just-in-case prescription for breakthrough pain) opioid prescriptions". Additional guidance includes, "If an NSAID alone or in combination with acetaminophen fails to provide adequate pain relief, and if opioids are prescribed, counsel patients regarding appropriate storage and disposal", to "review the state's prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) when available", and that if a patient is "already receiving opioids to manage chronic pain (i.e., long–term use of opioids), clinicians should prioritize the use of nonopioid analgesics (i.e., first–line analgesic therapy)". It also states, "Special care should be taken when prescribing opioids to a patient with a substance use disorder, including communication with patient's other healthcare providers".

### Endoscopic repair of persistent oroantral communications using the caldwell-luc approach [^115RR3D9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

In this article, a novel endoscopic technique used to close oro-antral fistulas will be described. In the technique described here, 24 cases were surgically treated between May 2011, and November 2014. Under endonasal endoscopic examination following partial inferior uncinectomy, the natural ostium of the maxillary sinus was identified; through this tract, a curved aspirator was advanced into the sinus. If present, we extracted endoscopically tissues causing obliteration of the ostium through the Caldwell-Luc antrostomy, taking care to preserve the integrity of the natural ostium. In the technique described here, endoscopic examination using the Caldwell-Luc approach, the inside of the maxillary sinus is explored fully, existing infection and polyps are eliminated locally, and natural patency of the maxillary sinus ostium can be achieved. The graft used to obliterate the oroantral fistula can be easily harvested from the bone of the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus by accessing the surgical entry tract.

### Use of pedicled nasoseptal flap for pathologic oroantral fistula closure [^1148JL2L]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Oroantral fistula (OAF) is a pathologic, epithelialized communication between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus. OAF most commonly results from posterior maxillary tooth or molar extraction owing to proximity of the dental roots to the maxillary antrum and the thinness of the adjacent antral floor. It also can arise secondary to implant and orthognathic surgeries, cyst and tumor removal, dental infection, trauma, or as a sequela of radiation therapy. Communications larger than 5 mm are less likely to heal spontaneously and can epithelialize, forming an OAF. When locoregional flaps and grafts are not ideal or have failed, but primary OAF closure is mandated, surgical options are unclear. This report describes a novel method for autologous tissue flap coverage from the nasal septum, pedicled off the posterior septal artery, for successful extension to, and closure of, OAFs.

### The modified caldwell-luc approach in retrieval of accidentally displaced root into the maxillary sinus [^1129aZ5y]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This clinical study presents a case of root displacement into the maxillary sinus that is associated with oroantral communication. A modified Caldwell-Luc procedure was performed successfully for the retrieval of the displaced root from the maxillary sinus. The aim of this article was to highlight the principles and advantages of the modified approach in the management of such a case compared with the standard Caldwell-Luc approach.

### A study of two novel techniques for one-stage closure of chronic oroantral fistula and sinus floor lift [^114xvaM1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose:

This study aimed to compare two novel techniques for chronic oroantral fistula (OAF) closure combined with maxillary sinus floor elevation.

Materials and Methods:

Ten patients who had implant installation needs but suffered from a chronic OAF were enrolled in the study from January 2016 to June 2021. The technique applied involved OAF closure and simultaneous sinus floor elevation by either a transalveolar or lateral window approach. Bone graft material evaluation results, postoperative clinical symptoms and complications were compared between the two groups. Student's t -test and χ² test were used to analyze the results.

Results:

In this study, 5 patients with a chronic OAF were treated with the transalveolar approach (group I), and 5 were treated with the lateral window approach (group II). The alveolar bone height was significantly higher in group II than in group I (P ＜0.001). The pain at 1 day (P = 0.018) and 3 days (P = 0.029) postoperatively and facial swelling at 7 days (P = 0.016) postoperatively were obviously greater in group II than in group I. There were no severe complications in either group.

Conclusions:

The techniques combined OAF closure with sinus lifting to reduce surgical frequency and risks. The transalveolar approach resulted in milder postoperative reactions, but the lateral approach could provide more bone volume.

### The evaluation of objective and subjective fate of teeth in the mandible fracture line and the management – A center's experience [^113p1Rby]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Maxillofacial fracture is a common clinical issue, especially in accidents, traffic accidents, fall damage, etc. The treatment of maxillofacial area fractures is still regarded as an important topic in clinical research till now. Top of the most heated debating critical topics in this field is mainly related to the preservation or removal choice of the existing teeth in or near the mandibular fracture line and its further treatment, it may be highly related to the overall treatment effectiveness with the tooth extraction or preservation decision. No matter if it happens in teenagers or adults, fractures in the tooth-bearing areas in the mandible also show the risk of communication with the oral cavity through the periodontal ligament or tooth socket which may lead to severe infection and results. It should be a concern that apart from the treatment of fracture, more should be paid to attention when it made troubles, it could lead to such as the tooth in the fracture line may progress to various results. This may result in pulp necrosis, root fracture or surface exposure, tooth subluxation or avulsion, etc. Furthermore, the previous existing disease related to the fracture line cross-linked tooth, such as pulp or other periodontal troubles, could be severely aggravated much advanced after the bone fracture. The key point may come from the infection treatment and complications. Take the third molar as an example, usually, it is highly concern as it is tightly connected to mandibular angle fracture, and still, the fate of the tooth can be complicated, especially combined with a cited fracture with high risks, also, sometimes it could be a key factor in the decision of the further treatment design and outcome hint. – However, still many other situations may be related to tooth fate and patients' subjective evaluations.

### Closure of oroantral communications with bichat's buccal fat pad [^113pNWXn]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of the pedicled buccal fat pad for the closure of oroantral communications (OACs) and to describe our experience with this surgical procedure.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective review of 161 patients treated at the University Hospital for Cranio-Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery in Vienna, Austria, from 2000 to 2005, with the diagnosis of an OAC was performed. All defects were closed by application of a buccal fat pad. Data were obtained from chart review, a compiled database, and clinical follow-up and included the location of the defect, the cause of the OAC, the modality of anesthesia, intraoperative complications, any complications during the process of wound healing, and any late adverse effects.

Results

The buccal fat pad for closure of an OAC was successfully used in 161 patients at our department. In 12 patients (7.5%), the closure of the OAC was insufficient, and a second operation was necessary. Excluding all severe and complicating cases such as tumor-related defects or previously treated cases, the overall success rate for closure of the OAC was nearly 98%. No late complications occurred, and all patients were free of pain or any limitations after the 6-month follow-up period.

Conclusions

According to the recommendations and anatomic limitations reported in published studies and discussed in the present report, the application of the buccal fat pad is a safe and reliable procedure for closing an OAC.

### Functional rehabilitation with anatomic reconstruction of oroantral fistula with lateral approach of sinus elevation surgery [^111he7jG]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Oroantral fistula (OAF), defined as an epithelized pathologic communication between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus, develops when an oroantral communication (OAC) has remained unclosed for 48 to 72 hours or longer. To close an OAF, infections within the maxillary sinus, such as sinusitis, must be treated through sinus irrigation, medication, or sinus surgery. In addition, physical closure using a local flap is required, so various techniques have been proposed for this purpose. This study introduces an innovative approach for closing OAF utilizing xenogenic bone grafts and the buccal fat pad, grounded in advanced surgical techniques for sinus floor augmentation, as illustrated through 2 clinical cases. This method not only optimizes conditions for implant placement in patients requiring implant-supported restorations but also preserves the buccal vestibular depth, thereby minimizing the necessity for vestibuloplasty with free gingival grafts. From a prosthodontic perspective, this technique represents a highly impactful and refined strategy for achieving effective OAF closure.

### Orthognathic surgery and orthodontics: inadequate planning leading to complications or unfavorable results [^112JadTT]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Complications in orthognathic surgery are commonly a result of inadequate preoperative planning and communication between the surgeon and orthodontist. Unfavorable outcomes can often be avoided when overall treatment goals along with a surgical and orthodontic plan are developed and agreed upon by the orthodontist, surgeon, and patient before the start of active tooth movement or any surgical procedures. Continuous evaluation of the patient's progress throughout treatment and subsequent communication between the surgeon and orthodontist are recommended to prevent frequent errors, such as inadequate dental decompensation, poor appliance selection or management, and occasional contraindicated orthodontic elastic traction or tooth movements.

### Obliteration of recurrent large dentigerous cyst using bilateral buccal fat pad sling flaps [^116ZSgnX]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Dentigerous cyst (DC), also known as follicular cyst, is an odontogenic cyst with fluid accumulation between the crown and enamel organ of an unerupted tooth, pushing the crown away from the alveolar bone. The patients with DC in the maxillary sinus should be evaluated thoroughly by extraoral and intraoral examinations, proper diagnostic imaging procedures, and pathologic examination to avoid misdiagnosis of maxillary sinusitis. The standard treatment for DC in the maxillary sinus is often removed by Caldwell-Luc approach. Furthermore, marsupialization or functional endoscopic sinus surgery may be performed because of the size, location of the cysts, or the age of the patients. Sometimes, DC recurred and it made contour deformity. The buccal fat pad (BFP) was mentioned for the first time by Heister in 1732 and better described by Bichat in 1802. Egyedi was the first to report use of the BFP in oral reconstruction for the closure of oroantral and oronasal communications, and Tideman et al showed there was no need to cover BFP by a skin graft when used for defects of oral cavity. So, the authors report our experience with the bilateral pedicled sling BFP flap for intraoral reconstruction after larger recurrent DC removal and describe advantages, operative procedure, and possible complications of the DC.

Imaging — staging

Staging of MRONJ is important for treatment decisions and for communication between clinicians.
While stages 1 and 2 are determined based on the clinical findings, imaging is essential to classify MRONJ as stage 0 and stage 3 of the AAOMS scale: ○ MRONJ stage 0 is diagnosed when there are asymptomatic non-specific clinical signs, symptoms of local inflammation, or symptoms without evidence of necrotic bone, in a patient with a history of BMA use. Radiologic findings such as an irregular pattern of bone trabeculation with foci of sclerosing or rarefaction, or thickening of the lamina dura, may support a diagnosis of stage 0 MRONJ. ○ MRONJ stage 3 is diagnosed when the MRONJ extends beyond the alveolar bone, presents as a pathologic fracture, manifests with an extraoral fistula, or involves an oro-antral/nasal communication. Imaging may identify these features and upgrade the diagnosis to stage 3.

Imaging — monitoring

As part of the healing process, the necrotic bone may gradually separate from the normal surrounding alveolar bone and eventually exfoliate.
Periodic radiographs may enable assessment of the involved site for early signs of sequestrum formation, such as the presence of well-demarcated borders of necrotic bone. The rearrangement of bone next to the sequestrum can often be observed on radiographs before there is clinical evidence of a detached sequestrum.
The selection of the specific imaging technique is determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the advantages and disadvantages of each technique (Table 1), while attempting to use the least radiation exposure.
If deterioration is suspected based on the clinical presentation, radiographs may confirm worsening of MRONJ by demonstrating extended involvement of bone and surrounding structures. Extension of the area of necrosis may be seen on imaging and not be appreciated on examination alone.

Imaging — treatment decisions

Imaging is a critical tool in preparation for maxillofacial surgery with CT and CBCT being used routinely to plan the resection and reconstruction.
Imaging may demonstrate proximity of the MRONJ to anatomical structures that carry a high risk for post-surgical complications such as post-operative neuralgia, neuropathy, or oro-antral/nasal communication. In such cases, the radiograph may guide a conservative treatment approach.
3D imaging may confirm a detached sequestrum which suggests feasibility for sequestrum removal. Likewise, 3D imaging may assist in estimating the risk for post-surgery fracture.
CT studies showing signs of periosteal reaction were correlated with lower rates of MRONJ healing, and therefore may assist with treatment decisions.

Endocrine considerations with immune checkpoint inhibitors — According to the literature, patients treated with ICI may develop adrenal insufficiency; thus, the potential need for supplemental steroids during stressful dental/oral procedures should be communicated between the dental and medical team. If adrenal insufficiency exists, dental practitioners should prepare for adrenal crisis as an emergency during dental treatment, and these modifications may be needed after the cessation of the immunotherapy, in case of late development of irAEs or persistent irAEs.

### Palatal perforation due to spontaneous medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^116i5inV]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is most commonly precipitated by surgical procedures, such as tooth extraction or dental implant placement. However, spontaneous cases without apparent inducing factors have also been reported, typically involving regions of bony prominence covered by thin mucosa. This report describes a rare case of spontaneous palatal osteonecrosis in an elderly osteoporotic patient that progressed to an oro-nasal fistula without evident anatomic vulnerability or local trauma. The patient's history of prolonged antiresorptive therapy and poorly controlled diabetes likely contributed to disease development. Through this unusual case, we aim to discuss potential etiological factors with a review of the literature.

### Endoscopic sinus surgery in sinus-oral pathology [^1116Anbr]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Oral surgery is compounded by safe and well-known techniques and presents a low rate of complications. When the superior alveolar ridge is approached, surgery may result in oroantral fistula or tooth or implant dislocation in maxillary sinus. Those conditions lead to development of the maxillary sinusitis that, if underestimated, may evolve in orbital cellulitis and cerebritis or cerebral abscess. Our work aimed to compare the surgical techniques suitable for treatment of those complications and define the better surgical strategy.

Methods

Between 2005 and 2010, 55 patients, presenting with displaced or migrated oral implants in the paranasal sinuses, with oroantral communication or with paranasal sinusitis of odontoiatrogenic origin, were visited and referred for treatment in the Maxillofacial Surgery Department of the University of Rome "La Sapienza". Surgical treatment consists of one of the following procedures: functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS); intraoral approach to the sinus with Caldwell-Luc technique; and oroantral fistula closure with a local flap, alone or combined with FESS.

Results

The study group consisted of 55 patients: 28 female and 27 male patients aged 43 to 78 years (mean, 60 years). All had undergone oral surgery before our first visit: 17 patients had a prosthetic implant surgery (3 lateral-approach sinus augmentation and 15 implant placement). Seventeen patients had tooth extractions, 7 did root canal treatments, and 14 had sinus maxillary augmentation.

Conclusions

Functional endoscopic sinus surgery has slowly taken the place of the Caldwell-Luc technique in treating odontogenic maxillary sinusitis. Advantages of FESS are the less invasivity, the preservation of sinus anatomy and physiology, the reduction of recovery time, and oral rehabilitation without loosening efficacy compared with the previous transoral approach.

### Common evolutionary origin of acoustic communication in choanate vertebrates [^114Tj3uk]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

A challenge to test the hypothesis of a common origin of acoustic communication among some actinopterygian lineages and choanates will be understanding how the morphological transformations involved in the transition to choanates affected the mechanisms of sound production. Palaeontological data and phylogenetic reconstructions are the most common approaches applied to shed light on the evolutionary transformation of traits. However, to date, palaeontological data that are key to a robust resolution of the origins of acoustic communication among actinopterygians and sarcopterygians are missing. This raises a number of additional questions, but of particular importance: is the acoustic communication of choanates an innovation homologous to the acoustic communication based on the swim bladder observed in fishes? If so, did acoustic communication first appear among actinopterygians or in the event that precedes them — such as in the transition from 'protochordates' (~550 mybp, 5)? Integrative comparative studies of embryological development, physiology of vocal apparatus and of vocal neural architecture across brain regions combined with gene expression among taxa will be helpful to trace the evolution of acoustic behaviour among vertebrates. The common ancestral origin of acoustic communication provides further justification for the use of choanate animals as models in the study of the origins of human language and speech.

### Tooth extractions prior to chemoradiation or bioradiation are associated with weight loss during treatment for locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer [^116Dwr9w]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that tooth extractions contribute to significant weight loss during treatment. Since bodyweight maintenance is important for completing planned oncological treatment and for supporting the recovery phase, further weight loss caused by tooth extractions should be minimized or avoided as much as possible. More careful consideration of teeth removal prior to CRT/BRT seems appropriate but demands close communication with the HNC team. As RT protocols and thus the doses to the tooth-bearing part of the jaws vary widely, interdisciplinary consultation with the radiation oncologist is highly recommended in order to reduce the risk of ORN due to potential oral sources of infection.

This study prompts further investigation into the adverse effects of tooth extractions and disruption of the masticatory system. That, along with the current improvements in RT techniques, may fuel the discussion to review and deescalate the current tooth extraction protocols aimed at reducing the risk of ORN.

### Oroantral communication after segmental Le fort I osteotomy [^112XYjVW]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Segmental Le Fort I osteotomy is a very versatile technique for correcting mainly transverse discrepancies of the maxilla. However, there are possibilities of intraoperative and intraoperative complications. This article reports a case of oral-antral communication after maxillary segmentation with intraoperative identification and correction using the rotation of the palatal flap. The surgeon needs to know such possible complications when performing the technique to identify and correct them promptly to avoid further sequelae to the patient.

### Prevention and management of osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy: ISOO-MASCC-ASCO guideline [^111GGKyY]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) research and communication priorities emphasize further study of rehabilitative dental implants in irradiated bone and the need for rigorous trials and predictive tools, noting that "HBO has been a longstanding standard of care in the management of ORN with poorly designed trials to support it"; specific statements include that "the use of dental implants in irradiated bone warrants further investigation with well-designed studies", that "New research, including RCTs and prospective multicenter trials, on systemic and surgical treatment is warranted", and that "The Expert Panel encourages the creation of predictive tools for the development, grading, and staging of ORN, such as bone turnover markers and genetic markers"; it also states that "Drugs such as bone-modifying agents have been associated with medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw" and calls for "large, prospective, multicenter, observational studies of risk, outcomes, and cost of ORN for various treatment strategies". Communication guidance highlights that "Clinician and patient communications are extremely important", that "Patients will typically interact with a variety of clinical personnel over many years", and that patients "need the assurance that there are resources, both for the short and long term, that they can access", while cautioning that "Many patients discontinue treatment and/or their 3- to 5-year follow-ups believing that there is no hope for the conditions they are experiencing".

### Single-cell and spatially resolved interactomics of tooth-associated keratinocytes in periodontitis [^116uXR4N]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Using the DEG data, the "reactome" of diseased keratinocytes further suggested active immune roles for these cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c). To understand this comprehensively, we used CellPhoneDB (see Methods) to investigate relative cell-cell communication patterns of Tier 3-level cell identities via receptor-ligand pairs (Fig. 1i; Supplementary Data 2). We found expected fibroblast-vasculature and fibroblast-immune interactions. As predicted, we also discovered many interactions between SK/JKs and many other cell types, suggesting regional epithelia-stromal-immune communication axes in periodontitis. While some other keratinocytes are predicted to signal to other cell types in disease states, this occurs prominently for SK/JKs compared to other keratinocytes, melanocytes, and Merkel cells. Overall, this focused our investigation on understanding these tooth-associated keratinocytes in health and disease states.

### Tapered submerged implants in an augmented posterior maxilla after oroantral fistula closure [^1127JzDY]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Dental implantation in the posterior maxilla is challenging due to anatomic proximity to the sinuses, relative bone quality, and pre-existing sinus diseases. An oroantral fistula (OAF) acts as a pathologic pathway of bacteria and can cause sinus infections and complicate dental implant management. Bony augmentation between the sinus floor mucosa and the oral mucosa at the OAF closure site is another critical consideration. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the sequential patient management protocol from surgical closure of OAF and bone grafting to implant installation. The authors also aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of dental implants in the augmented posterior maxilla. A retrospective study was designed for patients receiving the tapered bone-level dental implants in the posterior maxilla after OAF closure performed by a single surgeon at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Seoul National University Dental Hospital, by applying specific inclusion criteria. Implant survival was determined by the presence of a functioning implant in the oral cavity at the time of assessment. In total, 13 implants were installed in 4 OAF patients with different etiologies. The method of OAF closure differed according to OAF cause and size. Three patients underwent concomitant modified endoscopic sinus surgery. Two patients underwent autogenous bone grafting from the ramus and symphysis, and 2 patients received sequential allogeneic onlay bone grafting. Implant survival was not affected by the type of graft material. The implant survival rate was 100%. An implant diameter of 4 mm (92.3%) and an implant length of 7 mm (69.23%) were most common. Careful separate sinus membrane and oral mucosa closure with sequential bone grafting between ensures stable and predictable outcomes for subsequent implantations. The tapered submerged implants, particularly the 7-mm length, can be reliably installed in the augmented posterior maxilla after OAF closure.

### Primary molar with chronic periapical abscess showing atypical presentation of simultaneous extraoral and intraoral sinus tract with multiple stomata [^114jyDWz]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

The drainage of sinus tract either intraorally or extraorally depends on various factors such as the location of the involved tooth, position of the tooth's apex to muscular attachments, virulence of the bacteria, decreased immunity of the host and least resistance provided by the structures underlying it.

The chronic endodontic infection that will drain through an intraoral communication to the gingival surface is known as intraoral sinus tract. Surface opening of the sinus tract is known as stomata. Intraoral sinus tract usually has a single stoma. However, multiple draining sinuses either intraorally or extraorally apart from dental infection can also be seen in case of chronic suppurative osteomyelitis.

Sinus tracts of odontogenic origin occurring extraorally presents a diagnostic challenge because of their distant location from the underlying source of infection and absence of any dental symptoms. These cutaneously discharging sinuses can appear as a papule or nodule with purulent discharge and their common site of location is on the chin, cheek, submandibular area and on rare occasion in the nasal region with mandibular teeth as more common source of infection than maxillary teeth. All of which further makes the diagnosis difficult for the clinician.

Furthermore, the chronicity of the lesion has often been worsened by the misdiagnosis, which could create significant effects on the facial aesthetics due to undesirable treatment such as frequent biopsies and antibiotics use resulting in the scarring of the skin. Therefore, thorough dental examination must be carried out for proper evaluation of all chronic draining sinus tracts of orofacial region.

Maintenance of primary teeth before normal exfoliation is necessary for the development of arch form, aesthetics, function, mastication and normal eruption of permanent teeth. Primary molars with a chronic discharging sinus can be preserved by carrying out a non-vital pulpectomy procedure. Pulpectomy is a procedure indicated for primary tooth that involves creation of an access to the root canal system followed by thorough cleaning, shaping and disinfection of the root canals, and then finally obturating the root canals using a resorbable root filling material. Once the causative factors related to the formation of the sinus tract are removed, the stoma and the sinus tract will close within several days.

The following case report describes successful management of primary molar with both intraoral and extraoral sinus tracts by pulpectomy using calcium hydroxide paste initially for two consecutive weeks followed by use of an antibiotic dressing consisting of a mixture of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and clindamycin as an intracanal medicament before obturation with resorbable sealer.

### Tooth agenesis and orofacial clefting: genetic brothers in arms? [^114SAcbo]. Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Mutations in WNT3 are well-known causes of syndromic tetra-amelia with CLP (OMIM# 273395), but the disruption of this gene has recently also been described as involved in non-syndromic OFC with TA (Table 2; Supplementary Table 4) (Yao et al; Mostowska et al.). Interestingly, Menezes et al. identified a significant association between a marker located close to WNT3 gene in the group of patients affected by bilateral CL/P and agenesis of the lateral incisors. Specifically, this point mutation (rs142167, personal communication) is located in the intronic sequence of NSF, a gene flanking WNT3 and encoding a transporter involved in the vesicle-mediated trafficking within the Golgi cisternae (UniProt). However, since the effect of this mutation via NSF or through the close WNT3 gene is still not clear, further investigations are needed. In the same gene family, WNT5A has been reported by Person et al. as the causative gene of autosomal Robinow syndrome (ADRS) (OMIM# 180700) and in a recent update Roifman et al. described TA as a typical feature and CLP as a less common phenotype. Furthermore, mutations in other canonical WNT signaling-related genes have been shown to cause either TA with or without OFCs or other associated disorders, such as AXIN2, playing an important role in the regulation of β-catenin stability in the cytoplasm, and LRP6 functioning as a transmembrane co-receptor of Frizzled proteins (EntrezGene; Sarkar and Sharpe; Bodine and Komm). For LRP6, its role in lip formation and odontogenesis has been studied in mice and in patients (Song et al; Massink et al; Ockeloen et al.) while the role of AXIN2 is not yet fully defined although its involvement in embryogenesis and oncogenesis is clear. Intriguingly, a pathogenic AXIN2 mutation has been described as causative for both TA and cancer development in a Finnish family where the TA phenotype segregated with colorectal cancer predisposition (Lammi et al.). In a case–control study including 500 patients with non-syndromic OFC and 500 unrelated controls, an AXIN2 polymorphism (Table 1, Supplementary Table 4) showed association (rs7591, p = 0.01) with the co-occurrence of unilateral right CL/P with TA, stimulating the interest in this gene that may be involved in both pathogenic processes (Letra et al.).

### Closure of oroantral fistula with buccal fat pad flap and endoscopic drainage of the maxillary sinus [^1175nBxj]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Oroantral fistula (OAF) is a pathologic communication between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus. It is usually associated with maxillary sinusitis, where drainage of sinus infection is a mandatory step during closure of the fistula. The flap used for closure of OAF should be tension free, broadly based and well vascularized. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of closure of OAF using buccal fat pad (BFP) flap with concomitant endoscopic middle meatal antrostomy for maxillary sinus drainage. Nineteen patients with chronic OAF were included in the study. Closure was performed using BFP with endoscopic middle meatal antrostomy. Preoperative and postoperative assessments were carried out. Patients were followed up for at least 1 year postoperatively. Complete closure of all OAFs was achieved with no recurrence or dehiscence. In conclusion, closure of OAF with BFP flap and concomitant endoscopic drainage of the maxillary sinus through the middle meatus is an effective, easy, and simple method. It has a high success rate with no effect on the vestibular depth or mouth opening.

### Maxillofacial and neck trauma: a damage control approach [^115cxEyP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Initial casualty assessment determines whether the airway is patent and protected, and if breathing is present and adequate. Normal speech may suggest that the airway is patent, at least for the time being, while wheezy breathing usually indicates partial airway obstruction by the tongue and hoarseness or stridor usually suggests a laryngeal cause for airway obstruction. The oral cavity must be thoroughly cleared, visualized and inspected under proper lighting, taking care not to extend or rotate the neck. Blood, loose and fractured teeth, foreign bodies, dirt and mucus are meticulously removed. The midface and mandible are inspected for structural integrity and the anterior neck inspected for penetrating wounds. Crepitus upon palpation of the neck may suggest airway injury or communicating pneumomediastinum. Diminished breath sounds on auscultation may result from atelectasis, pneumothorax, hemothorax or pleural effusion. Wheezing and dyspnea may imply lower airway obstruction, agitation may represent hypoxia at tissue level and cyanosis indicates arterial blood hypoxemia. Suprasternal, supraclavicular or intercostal retractions may be indicative of respiratory muscle fatigue. In the severely ill or unconscious trauma patient, protective airway mechanisms may be impaired or lost, predisposing the patient to aspiration of foreign bodies, loose teeth, bone fragments, secretions, blood and gastric contents. Clearing the airway is the first step in airway management. The chin-lift with head-tilt maneuver opens the airway, but should be avoided in any patient with a potentially unstable cervical spine injury. The jaw thrust without head-tilt maneuver may be performed while maintaining cervical spine alignment and should be utilized in such instances. Between 2–4% of patients suffering from maxillofacial fractures resulting from blunt trauma, have concomitant cervical spinal fractures, and 10–12% have cervical ligamentous injuries. Oral or nasopharyngeal airway devices can establish a temporary nonsurgical secure airway in a spontaneously breathing patient, but they do not provide definitive airway protection against aspiration. Nasal airways should not be placed in cases of midface and craniofacial injuries, as they can inadvertently be introduced into the cranial vault in skull base injuries. They are commonly used in semiconscious patients who do not tolerate the oropharyngeal airway, or when the oropharyngeal airway is obstructed (trismus, wiring of teeth etc.). The oropharyngeal airway is designed to thrust the tongue off the posterior pharyngeal wall, thus providing an air channel and suction conduit through the oral cavity. In a conscious patient with an active gag reflex it is contraindicated, as it may stimulate vomiting, laryngospasm and agitation. They are useful in assisting bag-valve-mask ventilation in patients with respiratory failure. All patients with significant blunt trauma to the head or face are at risk for cervical spine injury. Careful consideration for the existence of an unstable spinal injury must be maintained throughout the process of securing the airway. Inadvertent mobilization of the neck of a patient with an unstable cervical spine injury can lead to permanent neurologic injury or death. Accordingly, trauma casualties, particularly with head and neck injuries, are transported with adequate spinal immobilization. An effective approach to airway management with possible cervical spine injuries is rapid sequence intubation with inline spinal immobilization. Pharmacologically paralyzing the patient reduces the risk of patient movement during intubation attempts, improves airway visualization, and facilitates subsequent endotracheal intubation. An alternative airway securing system (surgical airway) should be ready at hand before paralyzing the patient in the event that endotracheal intubation is not possible, but must be used only as last resort, when conservative airway management techniques fail. A definitive airway requires an endotracheal tube (ETT) or tracheostomy tube in the trachea with the cuff inflated, secured in place, and attached to an oxygen-enriched ventilation device. The reasons for securing a definitive airway include: 1) Failure of ventilation or oxygenation; 2) inability to maintain or protect an airway; 3) potential for patient status deterioration; 4) facilitation of patient management during evacuation and transport. The preparation for endotracheal intubation includes: adequate suction, oxygen flow mask, airway management sets (including alternative airway devices such as cricothyroidotomy and tracheostomy), pharmacological agents, a ventilator and monitoring equipment. Ideally, the patient should be preoxygenated with 100% high-flow oxygen to enable several attempts at intubation without need for intermittent bag-valve-mask ventilation. Cardiac monitoring, blood pressure monitoring and pulse oximetry (as well as end-tidal CO₂ monitoring, if available) are mandatory for all patients.

Fig. 6
Patients' voice. A Patient with a history of a well-differentiated carcinoma of the soft palate with posterior extension treated with radiochemotherapy (2012). The patient consulted after 10 years of erratic dental care. She arrived at our specialized consultation with advanced, untreated periodontitis associated with extensive ORN of the maxilla requiring inferior maxillectomy. The links between the two conditions were not determined. The patient had consulted five different practitioners who were unable to provide a solution for her painful teeth presenting severe mobility. She felt "abandoned" and was in considerable psychological distress. B Patient in remission from a squamous cell carcinoma of the left lingual junction area treated with surgery and radiochemotherapy (2018). At the first consultation, the patient broke down in tears when he was informed that a specialized team was going to take charge of him. Apart from his medical team, he had never met a dentist familiar with HNCs and thought he was in a unique situation that no one knew about. C Patient with a history of a right posterior pelvi-mandibular cancer treated with surgery and radiochemotherapy. She had a limited mouth opening and had seen four dentists in private practices who were unable to treat her. In the absence of any viable solution, the clinical situation worsened over the years, with recurrent infectious episodes due to tooth 46, which was necrotic. This dental infection caused an extraoral fistula which was treated by extracting the causal tooth under general anesthesia. She broke down and cried profusely when the team of specialists took charge of her case because she thought she would never find a solution

By recognizing the specific challenges faced by HNC patients in maintaining oral health, healthcare professionals can strive for improved patient outcomes and enhanced quality of life. In contrast to the current race for diagnostic and therapeutic innovations, this work proposes to optimize a dimension (oral healthcare) that has been well described for decades, through communication and knowledge transfer. It will allow to explore the intricacies and advantages of a targeted and consistent oral healthcare management.

### Wnt-directed CXCL12-expressing apical papilla progenitor cells drive Tooth root formation [^113QY5gW]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The tooth root is a critical component of the tooth, embedded in the socket and connected to the surrounding alveolar bone through the periodontal ligament. The tooth root transmits mechanical forces to the surrounding bone and maintains the function of the periodontium, which is composed of the cementum on the root surface, the periodontal ligament, and the alveolar bone, constituting the socket wall. The tooth root associated with the periodontal attachment apparatus is a unique feature of higher vertebrates, including mammals, in which a stable form of a tooth was adopted. The periodontal attachment is at least in part enabled by the cementum, which provides the insertion site of the periodontal ligament fiber connecting the tooth root to the bone. A structurally sound tooth root and its supporting structure are essential for the tooth to perform its fundamental function in mastication for efficient energy intake, speech, and esthetics for efficient communication and growth of the lower face.

The practicing oral and maxillofacial surgeon treating patients with oroantral communication (OAC)/oroantral fistulas should be familiar and competent with the various treatment options available. Multiple techniques are available from purely soft tissue flaps, which have proved to be successful over time, to a combination of hard tissue grafts (autologous, alloplastic, or allograft), which can prove to be useful with the increased demand for implant restorations. Although different procedures have proved to be successful, all are premised on the treatment of any underlying sinusitis, which is associated with a higher risk of recurrent OAC.

### Maxillary sinus disease of odontogenic origin [^112WXJmW]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Odontogenic sinusitis is a well-recognized condition and accounts for approximately 10% to 12% of cases of maxillary sinusitis. An odontogenic source should be considered in patients with symptoms of maxillary sinusitis who give a history positive for odontogenic infection or dentoalveolar surgery or who are resistant to standard sinusitis therapy. Diagnosis usually requires a thorough dental and clinical evaluation with appropriate radiographs. Common causes of odontogenic sinusitis include dental abscesses and periodontal disease perforating the Schneidarian membrane, sinus perforations during tooth extraction, or irritation and secondary infection caused by intra-antral foreign bodies. The typical odontogenic infection is now considered to be a mixed aerobic-anaerobic infection, with the latter outnumbering the aerobic species involved. Most common organisms include anaerobic streptococci, Bacteroides, Proteus, and Coliform bacilli. Typical treatment of atraumatic odontogenic sinusitis is a 3- to 4- week trial of antibiotic therapy with adequate oral and sinus flora coverage. When indicated, surgical removal of the offending odontogenic foreign body (primary or delayed) or treatment of the odontogenic pathologic conditions combined with medical therapy is usually sufficient to cause resolution of symptoms. If an oroantral communication is suspected, prompt surgical management is recommended to reduce the likelihood of causing chronic sinus disease.

### The buccal fat pad for closure of oroantral communication [^114pp4dN]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The buccal fat pad (BFP) is a well-established tool in oral and maxillofacial surgery and its use has proved of value for the closure of oroantral communications. Oroantral communication may be a common complication after sequestrectomy in "bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws". The authors report a clinical case of a 70-year-old female patient in bisphosphonate therapy presented with right maxillary sinusitis and oroantral communication after implants insertion. The BFP was used to close the defect. The patient had an uneventful postoperative healing without dehiscence, infection, and necrosis. The authors postulate that the primary closure of the site with BFP may ensure a sufficient blood supply and adequate protection for an effective bone-healing response to occur.

The article provides an in-depth review focused on diagnosing oral surgery-related complications that may cause odontogenic sinusitis (ODS). It emphasizes the importance of evaluating patients with prior oral surgical procedures to determine whether the prior procedure is an ongoing infectious source of the ODS. Specifically, diagnostic evaluations will be described for detecting oroantral communications and fistulas, dental implant dislocation or protrusion, and whether implants and graft placed in maxillary sinuses are infected. It highlights the role of different oral examination techniques, optimal imaging modalities, and the importance of otolaryngologic collaboration to evaluate for infectious ODS.

### Long-term effectiveness of the pedicled buccal fat pad in the closure of a large oroantral fistula [^114g3mfr]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study evaluated the long-term effectiveness of the pedicled buccal fat pad (BFP) in the closure of a large oroantral fistula (OAF).

Materials and Methods

Twenty-five consecutive patients with OAFs larger than 5 mm were treated with a pedicled BFP. They were followed clinically and radiographically for 10 years after surgery to monitor the durability and effectiveness of the pedicled BFP in the closure of the OAF.

Results

The procedure was successful in all patients. The healing process was satisfactory, with no breakdown or liquefaction necrosis postoperatively. No complications were observed during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

The results of this study support the view that the use of the pedicled BFP is a durable, straightforward, convenient, and reliable method for the treatment of a large OAF.

### Oro-nasal communication [^112DtPVB]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Breach in the palatal vault leading to an abnormal communication between oral and nasal cavity is known as oro-nasal communication. It is an uncommon presentation in day-to-day clinical practice except in some patients of cleft lip and palate. Etiology may be congenital or acquired. Alveolar and palatal cleft defects are the most common etiological factor. The acquired causes may be trauma, periapical pathology, infections, neoplasms, postsurgical complications, and radio and chemo necrosis. Clinical features like nasal regurgitation of food, defective speech, fetid odor, bad taste, and upper respiratory tract and ear infection are associated with oro-nasal communication. Management depends upon the size and site of defect, age of patient, and associated comorbidity. The definitive management is always surgical. Two layered closure provides greater support and stability and reduces the risk of failure. Palatal rotational flaps are suitable for smaller defects. The other local flaps are buccal mucosal flap, tongue flap, and facial artery myomucosal flap. Temporoparietal galeal flap, turbinate flap, free radial forearm flap, and scapular flap have also been successfully used for closure of oronasal communication. Newer procedures like the use of bone morphogenic protein, acellular dermal matrices, human amniotic membrane, and distraction osteogenesis have been tried successfully. The rate of recurrence is high. Unsuccessful surgical attempts and larger defects associated with compromised medical conditions are better managed nonsurgically with obturator incorporating the missing teeth.

### Is an attachable oral wound dressing effective at closing an acute oroantral communication? [^111TUoKo]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

An oroantral communication (OAC) is an acute opening after tooth extractions in the posterior maxilla that requires immediate closure. The search for a noninvasive and cost-effective OAC treatment method remains ongoing.

Purpose

This study assessed the effect of oral wound dressing (OWD) on acute OACs of 2–5 mm and compared it with suturing sterile gauze (SG) and plasma-rich fibrin (PRF).

Study Design, Setting, and Sample

A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted at the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Erciyes University. The sample included patients aged > 18 years, a 2–5 mm wide OAC without previous maxillary sinus pathology or surgical operation.

Predictor Variable

The primary predictor variable was the closure method used: OWD, SG, or PRF. OWD is a new produced and commercially available product that has been used for closure of oral wounds after periodontal or surgical interventions.

Main Outcome Variable

The primary outcome variable was OAC closure on postoperative day 30. The secondary outcomes were procedure duration and the pain scores of postoperative days 1, 3, and 7.

Covariates

The covariates were age and sex.

Analyses

Quantitative variables were compared between groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Qualitative variables were analyzed between groups using the Pearson's χ² test. Results with a P value < .05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

This study included 60 patients (30 females and 30 males). Clot formation was uneventful on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7 in all patients. OAC closure was successful in all patients on postoperative day 30. The success rate of OAC closure did not differ significantly between groups (P > .05). The surgical procedure duration was significantly shorter in the OWD group (1.2 ± 0.41 min) than in the SG (5.75 ± 0.97 min) and PRF (19.65 ± 2.74 min) groups (P < .001). Verbal analog scale scores differed significantly among the OWD (1.05 ± 1.43), SG (4.35 ± 2.85), and PRF (2.5 ± 1.82) groups on postoperative day 1 (P < .001).

Conclusion and Relevance

OWD is a less invasive and practical method for closing OACs.

### Modern management of oroantral fistula… [^117G3vGv]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

MANY chronic oroantral fistulas treated in the past could have been prevented had certain steps been taken immediately after their occurrence. There is a necessity for improvement in the manner in which these lesions are managed. It is the purpose, therefore, of this paper to outline those modern measures which have proved most successful in the treatment of this condition. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the past four years I have treated 41 patients with oroantral fistulas. Of these 12 had so-called acute fistulas and 29 had chronic fistulas. In all but 6 the condition represented the result of extraction of diseased teeth which opened the antral floor. Of these remaining 6 patients, 3 had chronic fistulas caused by a dentigerous cyst eroding into the maxillary sinus. A fourth patient was a Marine lieutenant with a single fistula which resulted from a gunshot wound received in hand to hand fighting at. BARTON RT. MODERN MANAGEMENT OF OROANTRAL FISTULA.

### Closure of large oroantral communication using coronoid process pedicled on temporalis muscle flap: a new alternative approach [^115Zq1hK]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Proximity of maxillary molar teeth roots to the maxillary sinus floor can potentiate oroantral communication (OAC) after extraction. Considering the defect size and situation, surgical treatment may become essential. Surgical treatment modalities are variable and would be indicated in special clinical circumstances. In this article, a chronic case of OAC with a size of 25 × 15 mm² in a 30-year old man with history of heavy smoking and drug abuse was treated with combination of buccal fat pad (for covering sinus floor), coronoid process pedicled on temporalis flap, and mucosal closure. There was no complication during and after operation. Short- and long-term follow-up revealed success of this novel technique despite the patient's poor compliance.

### Single-cell and spatially resolved interactomics of tooth-associated keratinocytes in periodontitis [^1123SVQ8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

With potential keratinocyte-adaptive and keratinocyte-innate axes identified, we next plotted predicted interactions between basal and SB JKs and SKs to understand cell-cell communication changes at the individual gene level for innate and adaptive populations. In the innate plots, JK signaling to macrophages, neutrophils, and type 1 classical dendritic cells (cDC1s) dramatically increased; communication by GM KCs decreased. JK basal cell signaling decreased; differentiated SB cell signaling generally increased (Fig. 6c). In the adaptive plots, basal JK and GM KC receptor-ligand signaling also decreased, with most differentiated/SB signaling to natural killer T (NK T), tissue-resident memory T (TRM), gamma delta T (gd T), and cytotoxic T cells. We observed little change in basal/SB SK signaling (Fig. 6d).

We quantified the confidence of receptor-ligand interaction between tooth-associated keratinocytes and immune cells. MIF, associated with periodontal disease progression, was a ligand (via CXCR4 and CD44/CD74) in both the innate and adaptive analyses; predicted interactions for MIF were strongest in JKs for neutrophils, macrophages, and NK and gd T cells (Fig. 6e). We also found decreases in several innate and adaptive cell interactions between structural markers (Fig. 6f; Supplementary Data 2). Overall, basal JK interactions decreased, suggesting these cells are especially affected in periodontitis; however, why these keratinocytes might be affected — and the significance of the remaining interactions — over nearby cells remained unclear.

### Management of orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: interdisciplinary consensus-based recommendations [^1118sPzd]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis is a frequent manifestation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). TMJ arthritis often occurs early in the JIA disease course, and the inflammatory process and related orofacial signs and symptoms can persist into adulthood. Occasionally, TMJ arthritis is the only manifestation of JIA. Early TMJ arthritis may be asymptomatic, but many patients experience orofacial symptoms, orofacial dysfunction, and a decrease in quality of life as the disease progresses. In skeletally immature patients, TMJ arthritis can interfere with facial growth and development, resulting in dentofacial deformity.

Management of the orofacial manifestations of TMJ arthritis requires an interdisciplinary care team which includes pediatric rheumatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthodontics, radiology, pediatric dentistry, specialists in orofacial pain and jaw function, and others. In 2019, consensus‐based terminology specific to JIA‐associated TMJ arthritis was introduced. Standardization of terminology provides a platform for communication among the many healthcare providers involved in the integrative care of this condition, facilitates research, and may improve outcomes.

Management of TMJ arthritis varies widely in different regions and healthcare systems; interdisciplinary consensus‐based recommendations to guide clinical decision‐making and standardize care are necessary. The objectives of this project were to develop interdisciplinary recommendations for management of orofacial manifestations of JIA and to create a future research agenda related to TMJ arthritis management in JIA.

### A study of two novel techniques for one-stage closure of chronic oroantral fistula and sinus floor lift [^112XaYFq]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Ten patients were treated with simultaneous OAF closure and sinus elevation; 5 underwent treatment via the transalveolar approach, and 5 underwent treatment via the lateral window approach. The mean age was 36.00 ± 13.60 years in group I and 37.60 ± 10.26 in group II.

In all cases, OAF closure and alveolar bone reconstruction were successful. Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, shows that after 6 months, the alveolar bone height in group II was significantly higher than that in group I (P ＜0.001), which was because more bone graft material could be placed in the OAF site via the lateral window approach. Implant installation was performed approximately 6 to 8 months after sinus elevation, and the bone graft was found to be stable enough for implant placement in all cases.

The pain at 1 day (P = 0.018) and 3 days (P = 0.029) postoperatively was obviously greater in group II than in group I because the surgical trauma of the lateral window approach was more severe; additionally, facial swelling at 7 days (P = 0.016) postoperatively was also more severe. The score on the full PoSSe scale was significantly higher in group II (P = 0.018), but there were no notable differences in subscale scores, except for that of the appearance parameter (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

Shortening of the vestibular depth was found in 3 cases, but it did not jeopardize prosthetic rehabilitation. There were no cases of infection, OAF recurrence or nerve impairment in either group (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1). No implant failures were noted after loading for 8 to 20 months, and only minimal marginal bony resorption was observed.

### Repair of oroantral fistulas using free bone and mucoperiosteal flaps after endoscopic removal of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus [^113kbvvT]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oroantral fistula (OAF) refers to a pathological connection between the oral cavity and maxillary sinus. It may lead to symptoms that include purulent mucus, nasal congestion, facial swelling, bad breath, and nasal regurgitation of food, all of which negatively impact patients' quality of life.

Objective

This study presents a novel approach for OAF repair using a 2-layered structure composed of free bone and a mucoperiosteal flap obtained from the medial wall of maxillary sinus.

Materials and Methods

Ten OAF patients who underwent repair using this method were retrospectively reviewed between August 2015 and June 2022.

Results

The extraction of maxillary molars was the most common cause of OAF. The size of the fistulas ranged from 1×2 mm to 5×8 mm. Nine of the 10 patients achieved successful OAF closure following the initial operation using the 2-layer structure composed of free bone and mucoperiosteal flag. One patient was lost to follow-up. The 9 patients were observed for 6 months to 1 year, and they exhibited no obvious complications or recurrence.

Conclusion

The use of free bone and mucoperiosteal flag from the medial wall of maxillary sinus through an endoscope was effective for OAF repair.

### Oroantral communications: clinical efficacy of a double-layered technique with / without the palatal connective tissue flap: a superiority, single-center, university-based randomized clinical trial [^114rQj58]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical results of combining a pedicle connective palatal flap coupled with the trapezoid buccal flap against the buccal flap alone in the closure of the oroantral fistula. Individuals with oroantral communication were consecutively included and eventually randomly allocated into 2 groups. In the group test, oroantral fistula was treated with the association of a buccal flap with a pedicle palatal connective tissue flap; in group control, a classic buccal sliding flap was performed. Patients' outcomes were recorded at 48 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month after surgery for assessment of primary (success rate) and secondary endpoints, such as experienced pain, discomfort, and complications. The success rate was 96.6% for the test group and 86.6% for the control group. No significant difference between the 2 groups could be observed regarding discomfort and pain. More pronounced pain was detected in the test group during the early healing period. This surgical procedure was demonstrated to be successful, with a high success rate and low patient discomfort.

### A study of two novel techniques for one-stage closure of chronic oroantral fistula and sinus floor lift [^111NtHaW]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Oroantral fistula (OAF) is a complication of oral surgery that most commonly occurs after the extraction of maxillary molars, especially first maxillary molars. Smaller communications less than 5 mm in diameter may close spontaneously, but larger defects or those with maxillary sinusitis always develop to chronic OAF and demand proper surgical closure. Surgical techniques for OAF closure include advancing or rotating intraoral soft tissue flaps, e.g. from the buccal mucosa, palatal mucosa, and buccal fat pad.

Frequently, there is insufficient alveolar ridge in the posterior maxilla because of alveolar bone loss after tooth extraction, maxillary sinus pneumatization, infection or anatomical factors. Usually, patients who present with an OAF could also suffer from bone deficiency in the posterior maxillary area. Therefore, for those patients who have require dental implants, simply covering the OAF with soft tissue is insufficient, especially in cases of large communications with bone defects. Bone augmentation should also be taken into consideration.

In clinical situations where not enough bone is available in the posterior maxilla, maxillary sinus floor elevation has been demonstrated to be an effective solution. There are two approaches for maxillary sinus floor elevation: the lateral window approach and the transalveolar approach. Lateral approach sinus floor elevation is usually recommended in cases of severe bone deficiency with a residual bone height less than 4 to 5 mm, while the transalveolar approach is a less invasive method used in patients with a residual bone height of greater than 5 mm. Both techniques aim to gain bone volume by elevating the Schneiderian membrane to create space for the housing of an implant of desirable dimensions.

Most clinicians prefer to repair the OAF first and then later perform alveolar bone grafting. However, the routine soft tissue closure of an OAF would lead to major problems in maxillary sinus floor elevation, as it causes fusion of the Schneiderian membrane and the oral mucosa, which makes it easy to tear the sinus membrane while elevating it. Several researchers have reported OAF closure by grafting autogenous bone from the iliac spine, chin area or zygomatic bone. – Conventional sinus floor elevation was performed several months later, after waiting for the denuded sinus side of the bone graft to heal secondarily through sinus membrane migration. Nevertheless, the denuded sinus surface of the graft might increase the risk of infection, leading to bone augmentation failure. Moreover, an additional donor site was required to acquire autogenous bone, which was relatively invasive. Furthermore, subsequent conventional sinus elevation prolonged the total treatment duration and surgical procedures.

### Multiple myeloma and pulmonary aspergillosis: dental treatment prior to chemotherapy and management of post extraction complications [^115k54Xg]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

This case study discusses the dental management of a patient with a history of multiple myeloma and pulmonary aspergillosis, whom was referred to a hospital-based dental service for urgent dental review. The patient had received a dental assessment in primary care prior to commencement of chemotherapy and had four teeth extracted without complications. However, following the commencement of chemotherapy, he presented with a significant infection associated with two of his wisdom teeth resulting in extraction. Despite atraumatic extraction, the upper right wisdom tooth socket developed an oroantral fistula. A multidisciplinary team approach was required to enable effective patient management in this complex patient regarding myeloma, aspergillosis and the medications used including bisphosphonates and chemotherapy. It highlights the higher risk of oral complications that can arise in myelosuppressed patients and emphasises the need to identify potential sources of dental infection prior to the commencement of chemotherapy.

### Intraoral herniation of a sinonasal polyp: an underreported complication of maxillary extraction? [^111aLKR9]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the present study was to increase awareness of an underreported surgical complication by presenting the relevant findings of cases of herniated oroantral sinonasal polyp (OASNP) identified from our biopsy service and from previously reported cases.

Materials and Methods

The present study was a retrospective descriptive case series with a review of the reported data. Cases of OASNP were identified from our biopsy service, and the clinical, radiographic, surgical, and demographic information was retrieved. Previously reported cases of OASNP were also reviewed.

Results

We identified 14 cases of OASNP in our biopsy service and an additional 10 reported cases. Overall, OASNP was more prevalent in males (71%). The age range was 19 to 85 years (overall mean, 46.6 years; median, 43.5 years). OASNP typically presented as a red polypoid mass that was frequently pedunculated with a smooth or granular surface. The lesions were located on the maxillary alveolus in the molar region. The most commonly implicated tooth was a maxillary first molar (74%). In some cases, the OASNP had been mistaken for a tumor or pyogenic granuloma. Almost all were at least 1 cm in the greatest dimension, with 43% measuring at least 2 cm in size, and 1 lesion reaching 5 cm in diameter. The reported period for development of the lesion ranged from 2 days to 5 years, with 60% developing within 2 months of the extraction. All lesions had undergone surgical excision. Antibiotic use and surgical closure of the oroantral communication had been described for some of the cases.

Conclusions

The results from our study suggest that herniation of a sinonasal polyp through an oroantral defect could be an underreported complication of maxillary exodontia. Additional research would help to enhance our knowledge and understanding of this interesting condition.

### A study of two novel techniques for one-stage closure of chronic oroantral fistula and sinus floor lift [^1114dVJa]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The present study introduced and compared two novel techniques for simultaneous OAF closure and maxillary sinus floor elevation, which reduced the number of surgical procedures, the total treatment time and the risk of infection. The transalveolar approach resulted in fewer postoperative reactions, while the lateral approach provided greater bone augmentation. The findings of the study indicate that these techniques could be valuable for alveolar bone reconstruction and dental implant restoration for patients with an OAF.

### Epidemiology of odontogenic sinusitis [^114mV3nV]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Odontogenic sinusitis (ODS) is more common than historically thought, representing 25% to 40% of all maxillary sinusitis. Due to a lack of widely accepted diagnostic criteria and a specific international diagnostic code, a true overall prevalence is unknown. ODS may be caused by either a multitude of infectious dental pathologies or complications after dental procedures. The most common dental etiologies causing ODS are apical periodontitis (endodontic) and oroantral communication or fistula after dental extraction. Less commonly, ODS can evolve after dental implant or maxillary sinus bone grafting surgeries, infection of odontogenic cysts, or advanced periodontitis.

### Maxillary third molar: patterns of impaction and their relation to oroantral perforation [^111yhATT]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objectives of this study were to examine 1) the patterns of the impacted maxillary wisdom tooth and 2) the proximity of the impacted maxillary wisdom tooth to the maxillary sinus in relation to oroantral perforation during the removal of a maxillary wisdom tooth.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective study reviewed the clinical records and dental pantomograms of patients who underwent the removal of maxillary wisdom teeth under general anesthesia over a 6-month period. Using a modified version of the Archer classification of impacted maxillary wisdom teeth, types of impaction were classified according to depth, angulation of impaction, and proximity to the floor of the sinus. Clinical records showed the occurrence of oroantral perforation.

Results

In total, 845 maxillary wisdom teeth were removed; 66.8% were by routine extraction and 33.2% were removed surgically. The most common type of impaction was vertical followed by mesioangular. Most impacted teeth were at the level between the occlusal and cervical level of the adjacent second molar. Only 7 of the 278 excised wisdom teeth produced an oroantral perforation. Only 0.9% of all cases with a close sinus approximation showed an oroantral perforation. Statistical analysis with the Fisher exact test showed statistically significant associations of depth of impaction (P < .001), eruption status (P = 0.001), and long-axis position (P < .001) to the occurrence of an oroantral perforation. Sinus approximation showed no association with the occurrence of an oroantral perforation (P = 1.000).

Conclusion

The depth of impaction of the maxillary wisdom tooth is a possible predictor of the possibility of oro-antral perforation if removal of the tooth is required. Due to the limitation of the radiograph, it is not a reliable to use radiographic close proximity of the sinus to predict the occurrence of oro-antral perforation when the maxillary wisdom tooth is removed.

### Presence of anaerobic bacteria and symptoms supports diagnosis of odontogenic sinusitis [^112rdEin]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The present study aimed to investigate the diagnostic indicators of odontogenic sinusitis other than computed tomography (CT) findings and the history of dental treatment such as detected bacteria and symptoms.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of 87 patients who underwent surgery for unilateral sinusitis between 2016 and 2020 (n = 87). Patients with cysts and fungal sinusitis were excluded from the study. We analyzed the relationship between the presence/absence of CT findings such as periapical lesions and oroantral fistulas; anaerobic bacteria; and symptoms in patients with unilateral sinusitis.

Results

There was a significant correlation between the detection of anaerobes and CT findings. Peptostreptococcus sp. Prevotella sp. Streptococcus anginosus group, and Fusobacterium sp. were the most commonly isolated species. Detection of these anaerobic bacteria supports the diagnosis of odontogenic sinusitis. Moreover, ODS often present with symptoms, such as a foul smell and facial pain.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that not only the presence of CT findings such as PAL and OAF, but the detection of anaerobic bacteria, and the presence of any symptoms may aid in the diagnosis of ODS.

### Closure of oroantral communication with plasma-rich fibrin membrane [^1146CQi5]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Oroantral communication (OAC) is the opening between the maxillary sinus and oral cavity. It may cause oroantral fistula or maxillary sinusitis if left untreated. The surgical closure of the OAC within 48hours was recommended to avoid the complications like sinus infections. The aim of this study is to evaluate the treatment of OACs with plasma-rich fibrin (PRF) which is safe and easy to implement in the OACs. This study was conducted with the patients, who required the treatment of the OAC, which was developed after the posterior maxillary tooth extraction in the Dental and Maxillofacial Department of the Faculty of Dentistry in Adnan Menderes University. Plasma-rich fibrin membranes were inserted in layers into the tooth socket so that they covered the OAC. Then these membranes were fixated with the sutures to the surrounding gingiva. Antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1000mg), analgesic (dexketoprofen trometamol and/or paracetamol), and oral rinse (0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate) agents were prescribed to all patients. The patients were examined in the 3rd and 7th days and 2 months after the operation. All patients tolerated PRF perfectly, and the soft tissue recovery was completed without any problem. Full epithelization was observed in the defect area in all patients. The OAC did not relapse in any patient. Plasma-rich fibrin technique is a simple and effective method, which can be used in the treatment of OACs with a diameter of 5mm or less with a low risk of complications.

### Double-layered closure of chronic oroantral fistulas using a palatal rotational flap and suturing of the sinus membrane perforation: is it a successful technique? [^112qMRor]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chronic oroantral fistulas (OAFs) are a challenging problem in oral and maxillofacial surgery, and the treatment success rate of OAFs is as low as 67%. Thus, the double-layered closure has been described. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the simplicity and effectiveness of using a palatal rotational flap and suturing of the sinus membrane perforation as a new technique for double-layered closure.

Materials and Methods

A prospective case series study was performed in patients who had chronic OAFs and were treated at Al-Zahraa Hospital from 2010 to 2013. The following demographic and clinical data were collected: age, gender, location of defect, size, etiology, signs and symptoms, postoperative healing, and complications. Under local anesthesia, fistulectomy and sinus irrigation were performed to control sinusitis. Under general anesthesia, the oral side of the fistulous tract was sutured with a purse suture. A palatal flap was reflected and sutured to the buccal tissue.

Results

Twelve patients 19 to 51 years old were enrolled in this study. All patients tolerated the surgical procedures; all surgical wounds healed uneventfully without recurrence.

Conclusion

Double-layered closure of OAFs is a straightforward, convenient, and successful technique that provides stable, strong, and double-sealed closure of chronic OAFs.

### The use of platelet-rich fibrin for immediate closure of acute oroantral communications: an alternative approach [^111zjv2v]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Currently, the buccal advancement flap, palatal rotational flap, and buccal fat pad techniques are frequently used to close an oroantral communication (OAC). In this study, platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) clots were used for immediate closure of acute OACs after extraction of posterior maxillary molars. Acute oroantral perforations larger than 3 mm in diameter in 21 patients were treated uneventfully using PRF clots. None of the patients had systemic diseases or symptoms of sinus disease. After tooth extraction, the diagnosis of acute OAC was examined by the Valsalva maneuver (compressing the nostrils with the fingers and then blowing out air). After detection of an air leak, a modified ball burnisher instrument 3 mm in diameter was used to determine whether the perforation was larger than 3 mm. The postextraction socket of the tooth was cleaned with sterile physiologic saline solution and the cavity was filled with PRF. PRF clots were sutured to the gingiva to prevent them from migrating to the sinus and for stabilization. On the seventh day of follow-up, healthy granulation tissue was observed; during the third week of follow-up, epithelialized oral mucosa was detected at the extraction site in all cases. The use of PRF enables the closure of OACs without primary flap closure or any other surgical interventions. Thus, the use of PRF for immediate closure of acute OACs will make the treatment of OACs less traumatic and easier and will eliminate the need for special surgical expertise.

### Management of a maxillary sinus foreign body (dental bur) [^112LC8VY]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Metal foreign bodies are occasionally found in the paranasal sinuses. Often they result from the escape of material through an oroantral fistula or from trauma. Rarely, they occur as a complication of a dental procedure. A literature review revealed only four other reports of iatrogenic dental bur lodgment in the maxillary sinus, all of which are in the dental literature. Otolaryngologists, who might be required to deal with this complication, must be knowledgeable about its management. In this article we describe a patient who was referred to our otolaryngology department for management of a retained dental bur in the maxillary sinus. We also review two treatment options — an endoscopic and an open surgical approach — for the removal of sinus foreign bodies.

### Imaging of odontogenic sinusitis [^114a6Er8]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The aetiological relationship between dental disease and procedures and mucosal disease within the maxillary sinus has received extensive attention in the recent otolaryngological and dental literature. In contrast, the concept of an odontogenic cause for sinusitis is not well appreciated by radiologists. Review of the maxillary dentition, the alveolar process, and the relationship of the tooth roots to the floor of the maxillary sinus should be an integral part of interpretation of imaging of the paranasal sinuses. The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and imaging features of rhinogenic and odontogenic sinusitis are discussed and compared. Clinical definitions of rhinosinusitis are explained and the huge impact on healthcare of this disease is briefly discussed. Periapical inflammatory lesions, post-extraction oroantral communication, and procedures used to augment the alveolar process prior to placement of dental implants are the commonest causes of odontogenic sinusitis. Current estimates are that an odontogenic cause for maxillary sinusitis is present in 25–40% of cases. The incidence of odontogenic sinusitis is rising, extension outside the maxillary sinus is common, and the diagnosis is often delayed, resulting in inappropriate and failed treatment. Differentiation of rhinological and odontogenic causes of sinusitis is usually difficult on clinical grounds and imaging plays a key role in the distinction.

### Is CBCT helpful in estimating the risk for oroantral communication during maxillary posterior Tooth extraction? [^111xJHBt]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Oroantral communication (OAC) is a perforation between the oral cavity and maxillary sinus, commonly occurring after maxillary posterior tooth extraction. The role of imaging in identifying high-risk cases remains unclear.

Purpose

The study aimed to estimate the association between periapical and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging with OAC exposure during maxillary posterior tooth extraction and evaluate the necessity of CBCT in clinical decision-making.

Study Design, Setting, and Sample

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Wuhan University Stomatological Hospital (August 2022 to August 2024), including patients with maxillary posterior teeth near the sinus who had both periapical and CBCT imaging. The exclusion criteria included contraindications to extraction, maxillary anomalies, prior sinus surgery, incomplete imaging, or untreated sinusitis on CBCT.

Predictor Variables

The predictor variable in this study was the radiographic risk of OAC. For periapical images, pertinent findings were overlap between the root apex and the cortical border of the maxillary sinus floor and protrusion of the root apex into the sinus cavity. For CBCT, pertinent findings were the presence of either intact or disrupted bony continuity of the maxillary sinus floor as observed in sagittal or coronal views. Risk was defined as the presence or absence of these radiographic findings.

Outcome Variable

The primary outcome was the intraoperative occurrence of OAC, which is defined as the formation of an abnormal perforation between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus during tooth extraction.

Covariates

The covariates were sex, age, and tooth.

Statistical Analyses

χ² or Fisher's exact test was used. ORs with 95% CIs evaluated associations. P < .05 was significant.

Results

The sample was composed of 69 subjects with a mean age of 40.3 years (SD: 16.6) and 41 (59.4%) were male. There were 5 (7.2%) cases of OAC. On periapical imaging, the radiographic risk factor was not statistically significantly associated with OAC (P > .05). On CBCT imaging, continuity defects were associated with OAC (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 2.1 to 4.1, P = 0.0072).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this study suggest that maxillary sinus floor bone continuity defects were associated with OAC; root protrusion on periapical radiographs is not. CBCT is advised when protrusion is present but unnecessary if only overlap is seen.

### Surgical treatment of oroantral fistulas: a clinical study of 23 cases [^112csJnX]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Oroantral communication can be defined as a pathologic space created between the maxillary sinus and the oral cavity. This communication and subsequent formation of a chronic oroantral fistula is a common complication often encountered by oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Although various techniques have been proposed in published studies, long-term successful closure of oroantral fistulas is still one of the most difficult problems confronting the surgeon working in the oral and maxillofacial region. The decision of which treatment modality to use is influenced by many factors, such as the amount and condition of tissue available for repair, the size and location of the defect, the presence of infection, the time to the diagnosis of the fistula, and, even, the surgeon's past experience. In the present study, 23 patients with a chronic oroantral fistula who underwent surgical correction at Istanbul University Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery from 2002 to 2009 were included. The fistulas were treated with a buccal advancement flap in 10 patients and a palatal island flap in 13 patients. The advantages, limitations, and complications of each technique are discussed.

### Primary closure of oroantral communication using pedicled buccal fat pad following maxillary cyst enucleation [^1138TVwz]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) is a clinically aggressive developmental odontogenic cyst with a high recurrence rate as 62%. Oroantral communication (OAC) is a gateway through the maxillary sinus and the oral cavity, which, if not treated, will develop into oroantral fistula or chronical sinus diseases. Different methods for closure of OAC were described but only few of them have common usage. In recent years, the use of a pedicled buccal fat pad (BFP) in closure of large oroantral defects has been become popular. In our patient, the OAC resulted from the surgical removal of OKC was closed with BFP.

### Single-cell and spatially resolved interactomics of tooth-associated keratinocytes in periodontitis [^111xSGXL]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 6
Cell–cell communication between keratinocytes and immune cells is predicted to occur through innate and adaptive cell-specific programs.

a CellChat was used to understand cell signaling pathways in health and disease considering tooth-associated keratinocytes (basal versus suprabasal; SB and junctional versus sulcular keratinocytes; JK/SKs). Circle plots highlight the significant receptor-ligand interactions between any cell populations, including same-cell type signaling interactions (i.e. JK-JK, SK-SK, etc.). The proportion of interactions increased across more detailed immune cell type annotations (Tier 4 annotations; see Supplementary Fig. 6). b Relative information flow in health and disease showed a preference for cell adhesion (NECTIN, COLLAGEN, JAM, LAMININ) and other pathways such as APP, CXCL, and MIF pathways. In disease, more preference for cell signaling pathways is preferred, such as TGFB, TIGIT, CCL, CD45, and EGF. Value of 0 red signifies the pathway is not enriched in periodontitis; value of 100 red signifies highly enriched. Innate (c) and adaptive (d) immune cell communication was measured gene-by-gene using a chord diagram for visualizing cell-cell communication. e, f Dot plots showed upregulated signaling pathways in periodontitis at the level of predicted receptor–ligand interactions (y-axis) based on tooth-associated keratinocytes (x-axis). Innate cells appeared to potentially interact with junctional keratinocytes (JK) via CD99-CD99, CD99-PILRA, GAS6-AXL, and MIF-(CD74 + CXCR4/CD44).

### The modified caldwell-luc approach for treating odontogenic maxillary sinusitis without need for functional endoscopic sinus surgery: a retrospective study [^114YiBbp]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Odontogenic maxillary sinusitis is a common inflammatory condition resulting from the violation of the Schneiderian membrane by conditions arising from the dentoalveolar unit, which includes teeth, their supporting structures, and adjacent tissues. This study aims to evaluate a modified surgical approach for treating this condition.

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to measure the frequency of retreatment of maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin following treatment with a modified Caldwell-Luc approach, which involves accessing the maxillary sinus through the canine fossa without creating a counter-opening in the inferior nasal meatus.

Study Design, Setting, Sample

This retrospective cohort study included 82 cases (83 sinuses) with odontogenic sinusitis treated surgically with the modified Caldwell-Luc technique at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Poriya Medical Center, between 2014 and 2021. Patients with nonodontogenic sinusitis were excluded.

Predictor Variable

Anatomic findings defined as the presence or absence of ostiomeatal complex abnormalities and oroantral communication, as identified through clinical examination and computed tomography imaging.

Main Outcome Variables

The need for retreatment, defined as the requirement for functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) due to persistent signs and symptoms of maxillary sinusitis after the modified Caldwell-Luc procedure, including facial pain/pressure, nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, or radiographic evidence of persistent sinus opacification on computed tomography scan, lasting more than 4 weeks despite appropriate medical management.

Covariates

Covariates included demographic data (age, sex [male/female as identified at birth]), smoking status, etiologies of odontogenic sinusitis, and surgical conditions.

Analyses

Descriptive statistics, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to estimate the probability of remaining FESS-free over time. The level of statistical significance was set at P < .05.

Results

The sample was composed of 82 patients (83 sinuses) with a mean age of 52.3 years (SD 13.5), and 47 (56.6%) were male. Dental implantation and sinus augmentation procedures were the most common etiologies of odontogenic sinusitis (50.6%). The median follow-up time was 6.03 months (interquartile range: 2.57 to 10.93 months). The incidence rate of FESS requirement was 2.64 per 100 person-months of follow-up. The FESS-free frequency was 89.2% (95% CI: 80.4 to 94.4%). The Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated the probability of remaining FESS-free at 12 months to be 89.1% (95% CI: 79.8 to 94.4%). Patients with ostiomeatal complex abnormalities had an HR of 2.25 (95% CI: 0.47 to 10.84, P = 0.31) for requiring FESS, while those with oroantral communication had an HR of 1.85 (95% CI: 0.46 to 7.39, P = 0.38).

Conclusion and Relevance

The modified Caldwell-Luc procedure was effective in treating the majority of odontogenic sinusitis cases. FESS may be necessary in a small percentage of cases with persistent symptoms. Further research is needed to identify predictors for FESS requirement. Of note, we recommend that oral and maxillofacial surgery surgeons review sinusitis cases with a FESS surgeon before performing the modified Caldwell-Luc procedure creating the opportunity for simultaneous or closely timed procedures when necessary.

### Double-layered closuring to repair an oroantral fistula using septal cartilage and buccal fat pad [^115yxitV]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Oroantral fistula (OAF) is a pathological connection between the maxillary sinus and oral cavity, and it usually occurs after tooth extraction. Proper repair of OAF is important for the prevention of recurrences. The present case offers a technique of OAF repair using septal cartilage and buccal fat pad for the repair of the defect after excision of fistula tract. This double-layered closure is a new technique that could be used to repair chronic OAF.

Patient and clinician communication in head and neck radiation therapy — patients should be informed of the essential protective role of saliva against tooth decay and sensitivity and should be educated about the potential impact of nonsurgical treatment on salivary gland function; patients undergoing radiation therapy may experience xerostomia and hyposalivation beginning the first weeks of radiation therapy, may experience a gradual improvement upon completion of therapy with the degree of recovery dependent on the extent and total radiation dose to the salivary glands, yet most patients are unfortunately left with some degree of permanent salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia.

### Chronic oroantral fistula: combined endoscopic and intraoral approach under local anesthesia [^115rFUg9]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the outcome of combined surgical treatment of oroantral communications associated with chronic maxillary sinusitis.

Patients and Methods

8 consecutive patients affected by complicated oroantral fistula were included in the study. The protocol consisted of: clinical, endoscopic and radiological preoperative evaluation (panoramic tomogram and computed tomography); systemic antibiotic and steroid therapy 2 weeks before surgery; one-stage surgical procedure under local anaesthesia consisting in uncinectomy with enlargement of the osteomeatal complex through endoscopic nasal approach associated with the closure of the oroantral communication by means of a mucoperiosteal flap; postoperative antibiotic and cortisone-based therapy. Follow-up consisted of weekly clinical evaluation during the first month, and nasal endoscopy at 3, 8 and 24 weeks after surgery.

Results

After surgical treatment, all patients were symptom-free and had no endoscopic and radiological evidences of maxillary sinusitis at the 6-month follow-up. No recurrent oroantral fistulas were found.

Conclusions

The current prospective study showed that a one-stage, combined endoscopic and intraoral approach under local anaesthesia represents a feasible and minimally invasive procedure for the long-term effective treatment of chronic complicated oroantral communications. Moreover, it represents an easily applicable approach also in outpatient clinics with minor patient discomfort.

### A study of two novel techniques for one-stage closure of chronic oroantral fistula and sinus floor lift [^114LUknf]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In this article, two novel techniques for chronic OAF closure with simultaneous sinus floor elevation are presented, with the particular aim of achieving the dual goal of simultaneous communication repair and bone augmentation to overcome the previous limitations in treating OAF patients with the need for dental implantation. In addition, the effects of the two techniques were compared.

### Retrospective study on the treatment outcome of surgical closure of oroantral communications [^111T9Gnd]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

A retrospective cohort study concerning the surgical closure of oroantral communications (OACs) was carried out to facilitate a comparison between treatment outcomes of conventional surgical treatment and new strategies for closure of OACs. Data were statistically analyzed to gather insight into possible predictor variables of recurrent OAC.

Patients and Methods

A cohort of patients treated for an OAC from 2004 through 2008 was reviewed. Recorded data included patient age and gender, location and duration of OAC, method of removal of the (pre)molar, presence of maxillary sinusitis, disturbed wound healing, and surgical treatment method. Data analysis included descriptive and multivariate logistic regression analyses with recurrence of OAC as the outcome variable.

Results

In total, 308 patients were included in the sample, of which 28 patients (9.1%) required a second intervention to repair an OAC. Of these 28 patients, 4 patients needed a third intervention, making the total number of recurrent OACs 32 (10.4%). In most cases (60.7%), a buccal advancement flap according to the method of Rehrmann was used to close the perforation. Multivariate regression analysis showed a 15 times higher risk of recurrence with maxillary sinusitis at follow-up.

Conclusions

Overall results of the study showed that OACs recur in about 1 of 10 patients and requires a second intervention after surgical closure. New strategies should therefore result in an equal or better treatment outcome to be considered a suitable treatment option. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the presence of maxillary sinusitis at follow-up is an important determinant of the treatment outcome of OAC repair.

### Treatment of oroantral fistula… [^116zn1Xm]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

WALLNER LJ. TREATMENT OF OROANTRAL FISTULA. AMA Arch Otolaryngol. 1952; 55: 666–670. doi: 10.1001/archotol.1952.00710010681003 IT IS THE intention of this article to discuss the problems in the treatment of oroantral fistulas and to re-present an operation for their closure that has not received the recognition it deserves. Alveolar fistulas may be divided into two types: the acute, or those of recent origin; and the chronic, or those of long duration. ACUTE OROANTRAL FISTULA. Extraction of one of the upper molar teeth is the usual cause of acute oroantral fistulas. They are therefore first seen by the dentist, although the rhinologist may be consulted to help care for the sinus complication. Rhinologists are fairly well agreed regarding the management of the acute condition, as mentioned in Barton's1a summary.

The fundamentals of treatment of acute oroantral fistulas include adequate antimicrobial therapy, preferably penicillin; no manipulation through the fistula (which includes no probing, no packing into the antrum, and no irrigation of the antrum Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Novel palatal submucosal flap technique for oroantral fistula repair [^116yC8M1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Oroantral fistula (OAF) is a pathological communication between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus, most commonly resulting from maxillary molar extractions. While traditional surgical techniques such as buccal advancement or palatal flaps have demonstrated efficacy in achieving closure, they may lead to complications including vestibular shortening, mucosal tension, and interference with prosthetic rehabilitation. This case report presents a novel technique for OAF closure involving the mobilization of palatal submucosal tissue anchored to the buccal bone, thereby eliminating the need for buccal flap advancement. Applied in 2 male patients with postextraction OAF, the method preserved soft tissue architecture, reduced surgical morbidity, and facilitated future prosthetic planning. Both patients exhibited complete closure without recurrence or significant postoperative complications. This approach offers a minimally invasive, anatomically respectful, and prosthetically favorable alternative to conventional OAF repair techniques.

### Skin involvement of medication-related osteonecrosis of jaws in an immunocompromised, bisphosphonate-treated patient [^114LLsbW]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of MRONJ is still unclear. Nonetheless, excess inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone remodeling, resulting in ischemia and sclerosis of bone, has been suggested as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.

The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons has suggested the diagnostic criteria for MRONJ on the basis of pharmacologic history, clinical manifestation, and radiologic features.MRONJ can be diagnosed when the patient has been or is being treated with antiangiogenic or antiresorptive drugs, and when the bone in the maxillofacial area is exposed or has not healed after more than 8 weeks without a history of radiation therapy in the head and neck or metastasis in the jaw.

The staging system of MRONJ by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons is as follows: stage 1, necrotic exposed bone without infection and symptoms; stage 2, necrotic exposed bone with infection and pain; and stage 3, stage 2 plus other complications such as pathologic fracture, extraoral, oroantral, or oronasal communication, or necrosis beyond the alveolar bone area. In the present case, we think that severe untreated MRONJ resulted in skin involvement because progressive osteonecrosis can cause a cutaneous fistula as well as oroantral communication. Because MRONJ can be accompanied by skin manifestations, dermatologists should be familiar with MRONJ and suspect the disease in a patient with compatible features and predisposing factors. According to previous reports, MRONJ is more likely to affect the mandible (73%) than the maxilla (22.5%); however, it can appear in both jaws (4.5%). Dermatologists should be aware that skin manifestations of MRONJ may appear in the cheeks as well as the submental area.

### Learnability of the LAHSHAL classification for oral clefts: results of an international webinar [^1171vL1g]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Orofacial clefts are among the most common congenital anomalies worldwide. They arise when the growing facial complex fails to fuse or differentiate properly during early fetal development. The prevalence of orofacial clefting worldwide is estimated to be between 3.4 to 22.9 per 10,000 live births, depending on geographic region, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. – In the case of non-syndromic clefts, which occur more often than syndromic clefts, these anomalies are thought to be of multifactorial etiology, with contributions from both genetic and environmental factors.

Orofacial clefts may have significant consequences throughout a patient's lifetime that may potentially impact quality of life. Depending on the cleft type, children born with orofacial clefts may encounter various difficulties beyond their initial surgical repair, such as speech, hearing, dentofacial development, and psychosocial problems. Long-term and multidisciplinary follow-up and treatment are therefore required. –

Orofacial clefts are heterogeneous in presentation and in subsequent impact on the patient. A proper description and classification of the cleft type and severity is thus important to be able to study the long-term consequences of the condition on the physical, emotional, and social development of the patient, and the outcomes of treatment.

Classification of oral clefts ensures consistent communication among healthcare providers and researchers. The ideal system for the classification of oral clefts would be one that is straightforward, precise and with a high intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. Currently, such a system does not exist.

Over the past 100 years, numerous classification systems for clefts have been proposed, based on anatomy and embryology, each offering a variety of ways to describe the location and extent of the cleft.– These systems were developed to improve clinical communication and treatment planning; however, the numerous classification systems available have spawned a myriad of problems. This has resulted in the inability of cleft specialists to communicate efficiently between cleft teams and hospitals because of a lack of a widely accepted system. Furthermore, it hinders the compilation of big data in a standardized form for research and epidemiological studies. The lack of consistency also makes comparison of clinical outcomes through institutions and countries difficult, thus limiting global improvements in cleft services.

### Treatment of oroantral fistulas using bony press-fit technique [^1145ZWwB]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the bony press-fit technique in closing oroantral communications (OACs) and oroantral fistulas (OAFs) and in identifying potential intraoral donor sites.

Patients and Methods

Ten patients, 4 with OACs and 6 with OAFs, were treated with autogenous bone grafts using the bony press-fit technique. In 9 patients, dental extractions caused OACs or OAFs; in 1 patient, an OAC appeared after cyst enucleation. Donor sites included the chin (3 patients), buccal exostosis (1 patient), maxillary tuberosity (2 patients), ramus (1 patient), and the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus (3 patients). The preoperative evaluation of the patients, surgical technique, and postoperative management were examined.

Results

In all 10 patients, a stable press fit of the graft was achieved. Additional fixation methods were not needed. In 2 patients, mucosal dehiscence developed, but healed spontaneously. In 2 patients, dental implant surgery was performed in the grafted area.

Conclusion

Treatment of 10 patients with OACs or OAFs was performed, with a 100% success rate. The bony press-fit technique can be used to safely close OACs or OAFs, and it presents some advantages compared with other techniques.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^115xWHme]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Headache

Another source of nonodontogenic toothaches and orofacial pains may present as a disturbance of the trigeminovascular system. Migraine is commonly thought of as a headache that is unilateral and that causes pain behind the eye, neck, and cranium; however, migraine headaches can also present in the lower part of the face, particularly in the teeth.–It is very important that the orofacial pain clinician is aware of the possibility of this localization in addition to the clinical features that a migraine presents to avoid misdiagnosis as an odontogenic toothache or other type of orofacial pain, leading to improper management.

Primary headaches, such as migraine and TTH, are also disorders mediated by the trigeminal system that can be chronic and disabling, affecting over 15% of the US population at any one time and costing the US economy over $19.6 billion a year. Migraine is a primary disorder of the brain explained as a neurovascular disorder in which neural events result in meningeal blood vessel dilation, which results in further nociceptive activation of the trigeminovascular system. The pathophysiology of migraine is still not completely understood, but it is known that key anatomical peripheral and central structures are involved. The trigeminovascular system consists of the dura mater that surrounds the meninges and spinal cord, the dural meningeal blood vessels (cranial vasculature), and the innervations of these structures provided by the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve and its afferent connection to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) in the central nervous system, in addition to a reflex connection from the trigeminal nucleus to the parasympathetic outflow to the cranial vasculature through the superior salivatory nucleus.

### Interventions for treating oro-antral communications and fistulae due to dental procedures [^114VPsus]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

An oro-antral communication is an unnatural opening between the oral cavity and maxillary sinus. When it fails to close spontaneously, it remains patent and is epithelialized to develop into an oro-antral fistula. Various surgical and non-surgical techniques have been used for treating the condition. Surgical procedures include flaps, grafts and other techniques like re-implantation of third molars. Non-surgical techniques include allogenic materials and xenografts. This is an update of a review first published in May 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of various interventions for the treatment of oro-antral communications and fistulae due to dental procedures.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 23 May 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2018, Issue 4), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 23 May 2018), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 23 May 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. We also searched the reference lists of included and excluded trials for any randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs evaluating any intervention for treating oro-antral communications or oro-antral fistulae due to dental procedures. We excluded quasi-RCTs and cross-over trials. We excluded studies on participants who had oro-antral communications, fistulae or both related to Caldwell-Luc procedure or surgical excision of tumours.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials. Two review authors assessed trial risk of bias and extracted data independently. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included only one study in this review, which compared two surgical interventions: pedicled buccal fat pad flap and buccal flap for the treatment of oro-antral communications. The study involved 20 participants. The risk of bias was unclear. The relevant outcome reported in this trial was successful (complete) closure of oro-antral communication. The quality of the evidence for the primary outcome was very low. The study did not find evidence of a difference between interventions for the successful (complete) closure of an oro-antral communication (RR 1.00, 95% Cl 0.83 to 1.20) one month after the surgery. All oro-antral communications in both groups were successfully closed so there were no adverse effects due to treatment failure. We did not find trials evaluating any other intervention for treating oro-antral communications or fistulae due to dental procedures.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low quality evidence from a single small study that compared pedicled buccal fat pad and buccal flap. The evidence was insufficient to judge whether there is a difference in the effectiveness of these interventions as all oro-antral communications in the study were successfully closed by one month after surgery. Large, well-conducted RCTs investigating different interventions for the treatment of oro-antral communications and fistulae caused by dental procedures are needed to inform clinical practice.

### Dental pathophysiology of odontogenic sinusitis: oral surgical complications [^111d2vwV]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The article explores the understudied pathophysiology of odontogenic sinusitis (ODS) development as a result of oral surgical complications such as oroantral communication (OAC) or fistula (OAF), maxillary sinus bone grafting, and dental implantation. A temporary OAC presents most often after dental extraction, especially with posterior maxillary teeth, though can happen with any oral surgical intervention. Maxillary sinus augmentation can also cause ODS, and while the pathophysiology is incompletely understood, it may be related to OAC/OAF formation or bone graft infection. Dental implants may also lead to ODS either via displacement into the sinus, partial protrusion into the sinus, or peri-implantitis.

### A study of two novel techniques for one-stage closure of chronic oroantral fistula and sinus floor lift [^112auiaX]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Sinus floor elevation through the crestal approach has been recommended for patients with more than 5 mm of residual bone height. This approach is regarded as less invasive than the lateral approach. Nevertheless, the major shortcoming is that it is a blind technique that lacks the ability to confirm whether the sinus floor is intact and without perforations. The lateral approach is widely suggested in cases of a residual bone height less than 4 to 5 mm. On the other hand, Schneiderian membrane perforation was found to occur more frequently when dealing with a smaller initial ridge height due to technical difficulties. – In the present study, the postoperative clinical symptoms of the crestal approach were less severe than those of the lateral approach. Obviously, greater augmentation was achieved through the lateral approach, as shown in our results. Therefore, it seems reasonable and safer to suggest OAF closure simultaneously with lateral approach sinus floor elevation in patients with a residual ridge height less than 4 mm. When the residual height is greater than 5 mm, transalveolar approach sinus elevation is better to reduce surgical trauma and postoperative responses.

A limitation of this study is the small sample size, which should be expanded for further research. Another limitation is the relatively short follow-up duration. Nevertheless, it is safe to conclude that these two novel techniques could achieve good clinical results and merit wide use.

### Prosthetic treatments for patients with oronasal communication [^115LdS4M]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The prosthetic treatments play a role in the rehabilitation of patients with congenital and acquired cleft palate. To prepare the surgical field and/or correct inevitable sequelae of the surgery, the rehabilitation with obturator prosthesis is an auxiliary or complementary treatment to surgical treatments. In cases where the surgical treatment is contraindicated, the prosthetic rehabilitation becomes a definitive treatment. The denture is planned and fabricated according to each patient. Therefore, the aim of this study was to discuss the prosthetic rehabilitation performed in patients with oronasal communication.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: imaging and clinical laboratory tests in the diagnosis and management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^1145LmSR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Imaging — staging in medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) states that staging of MRONJ is important for treatment decisions and for communication between clinicians. While stages 1 and 2 are determined based on the clinical findings, imaging is essential to classify MRONJ as stage 0 and stage 3 of the AAOMS scale. MRONJ stage 0 is diagnosed when there are asymptomatic non-specific clinical signs, symptoms of local inflammation, or symptoms without evidence of necrotic bone in a patient with a history of BMA use, and radiologic findings such as an irregular pattern of bone trabeculation with foci of sclerosing or rarefaction, or thickening of the lamina dura, may support a diagnosis of stage 0 MRONJ; MRONJ stage 3 is diagnosed when the MRONJ extends beyond the alveolar bone, presents as a pathological fracture, extraoral fistula, or involves an oro-antra/nasal communication, and imaging may identify these features and upgrade the diagnosis to stage 3.

### The heritability of vocal tract structures estimated from structural MRI in a large cohort of Dutch twins [^112YXL1M]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

While it is very difficult to translate these anatomical findings into their effects on voice idiosyncrasies and speech articulation, our results may offer intriguing windows into the complex relationships between genes, environment, cultural practices, and language (Dediu; Dediu et al.). Recent work has shown that the precise shape of vocal tract structures may affect the speech of individuals (either as pathological productions (Kummer), or as idiosyncrasies and normal variation (Dediu and Moisik)), and may even result in differences between languages (Moisik and Dediu). The nasal cavity may affect the production of nasal consonants (such as "m" and "n") and nasalised vowels (such as "on" in French), but little is currently known about the influence of its detailed anatomy on speech. A smaller nasopharynx seems to be associated with a high incidence of Chronic Otitis Media (COM) in children (Maw et al.), and it has been suggested that a high incidence in COM among Australian Aborigene children, resulting in widespread partial hearing loss among them, explains certain typologically rare properties of the Australian languages, such as an absence of fricatives and the presence of many place of articulation distinctions (Butcher). The jaws and dentition are probably implicated in the production of labiodental sounds (such as "f" and "v" in English) through their effects on bite (Blasi et al; Everett and Chen). While this effect was established at the cross-cultural level, and is driven by in vivo changes during development (and beyond) due to variation in the mechanical properties of food ("soft" versus "hard", broadly representative for the agricultural and the hunter-gathering subsistence strategies, respectively), it is interesting to also consider the genetic factors subtending variation in their shape, dimensions, and inter-relationships, and their responses to the properties of food. However, by far the best studied are the effects of the hard palate dimensions and shape on speech production: for example, these affect the general articulatory variability during speech (Brunner et al.), the production of vowels (Dediu et al.), and of the North American English "r" (Dediu and Moisik), and the alveolar ridge may affect clicks (Moisik and Dediu). Most of these examples start from inter-individual variation, but assume that this is patterned between populations, and that these patterns are relatively stable at the scale of language change, i.e. for several generations (Dediu et al.). Such patterning and stability can be due to persistent environmental and cultural factors (such as climate or subsistence strategies), but genetics is also expected to contribute.

### The spectrum of orofacial clefting [^111CUokt]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Describe the differing types of congenital clefting defects that extend outward from the perioral region. 2. Define the sites of anatomical disruption and deformities that these types of facial clefts cause. 3. Describe the cause and incidence, if known, of orofacial clefts and their inheritance/transmission risks.

Background

Clefts of the orofacial region are among the most common congenital facial defects. The clinical presentation is usually that of a lateral cleft of the lip through the philtrum with or without extension through the palatal shelves. However, atypical forms of clefts with lip involvement also occur in a variety of patterns, some of which are embryologically predictable; others are not.

Methods

An overview of the embryology, cause, and incidence of this diverse and interesting group of congenital orofacial clefts is presented.

Results

Clefts involving the lateral upper lip; median upper lip; and oblique facial, lateral facial, and median mandibular regions are reviewed.

Conclusions

This review of orofacial malformations describes clefting anomalies that emanate from the mouth and lips. As the causes of orofacial clefts are better understood, it is becoming clear that a complex interplay between genetic and environmental variables causes these clefts. Future study of orofacial clefts will require increasingly sophisticated methods of elucidating these subtle interactions.

### Prevention and management of osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy: ISOO-MASCC-ASCO guideline [^115PcfBC]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) — determinants of full thickness segmental resection and reconstructive outcomes — show high surgical success, with multiple single-institution series reporting success rates at 90%, and multi-institution cohorts reporting free flap outcomes in ORN including 260 patients with a free flap success rate of 92%, 49 patients with 92% flap success, and 76 patients with total flap loss observed in 4% of patients; the most common complications were wound site infection, metal exposure, and fistulation, which ranged from 20%–47%. There is consensus in the literature that the most advanced cases of ORN require definitive segmental resection, and the Panel describes full thickness ORN as disease extent whereby removal of all necrotic bone is likely to result in oroantral or oronasal defect in the maxilla or pathological fracture in the mandible.

### Oral health in patients with history of head and neck cancer: complexity and benefits of a targeted oral healthcare pathway [^115BSeSF]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for Patients and Dentists

Knowledge of the pathology and its consequences is important for optimal prevention and diagnosis. Dentists with experience of HNC patients will be better trained to detect early clinical signs of ORN, which may be too often confused with dental pathologies (Fig. 3). Tooth extractions appear to be a significant risk factor, and numerous surgical protocols for the prevention of ORN have been described in the literature. Although there is no consensus regarding any of them, it is reasonable to consider that extractions should be carried out by dentists or oral surgeons who have experience with HNC patients and who will correctly assess the risks. On the other hand, effective communication with the radiotherapist is essential to know the radiation dose received for each dental sector in order to properly assess the risk of ORN.

### Appropriate implant rehabilitation in patients with iatrogenic oroantral fistula and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis [^115dFQc9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Oroantral fistula (OAF) is the most common etiology for odontogenic maxillary sinusitis that can be caused by tooth extractions, failed maxillary sinus lifts, bone grafts, and poor positioning of dental implant fixtures. A 52-year-old man presented with an OAF and maxillary sinusitis after implant placement and bone grafting. The authors treated the patient with modified endoscopic sinus surgery to obtain OAF closure and provided dental implant placement procedures afterward. The authors also treated 8 other similar cases with favorable outcomes. In this study, the authors report the know-how of implant placement procedures in patients with OAF and maxillary sinusitis.

### The heritability of vocal tract structures estimated from structural MRI in a large cohort of Dutch twins [^115zHfVy]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

There are even fewer studies looking at not-externally visible measures or measures not related to the face, they use very different methodologies and samples, and the picture they paint is also complex (see, for example, (Lundström and McWilliam; Martínez-Abadías et al; Chi et al; Šešelj et al; Švalkauskienė et al; Šidlauskas et al.)). Again, it seems that some facial measures tend to have the highest heritabilities, while structures of the vocal tract seem to have relatively low-to-moderate heritabilities. For example, Chi et al. report heritabilities for mandibular length (0.24), mandibular width (0.30), maxillary width (0.47), the distance from the hyoid bone to the retropogonion (0.36; but not for other hyoid distances), and the size of the oropharyngeal space (0.31); Šešelj et al. report moderate heritabilities for maxillary and mandibular measures; Šidlauskas et al. report that the heritability of the shape of the mandible is higher than for its size; Švalkauskienė et al. look at dental arches and find that widths at the back have lower heritabilities than at the front, that the upper jaw has higher heritabilities than the lower, and that length and width seem independent; finally, Martínez-Abadías et al. found that there are 6 "phenotypic modules" (oro-nasal, molar, orbital, zygomatic-pterygoid, neurocranial vault, and basicranium) with low-to-moderate heritabilities (0.0–0.43). Likewise, various measures of anatomical structures of the vocal tract, such as the teeth (and face) (Hughes et al.), the upper airways (Patel et al.), and the hard palate (Shapiro; Riquelme and Green) may be more similar in MZ than DZ twins. Moreover, various characteristics of the voice that may be affected by anatomy and physiology (e.g. the motor control of the vocal tract), such as the fundamental frequency (Przybyla et al; van Gysel et al; Debruyne et al.), seem to be more similar in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins (Forrai and Gordos; Nolan and Oh). Here, our findings extend these earlier reports; in that we focus specifically on not-externally visible aspects of the vocal tract. In particular, we found notable heritabilities for the shape and size of the basicranium and the nasal cavity, the length of the hard palate, the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the vocal tract (but less so for its width and shape), the width, shape, and relative position of the mandible, and the position of the hyoid/larynx.

### Multilevel animal societies can emerge from cultural transmission [^11189EoM]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

This is the case in our simulations: when whales were more prone to learn the most common coda types from those who already had similar coda repertoires, clans of social units with distinct acoustic repertoires emerged and matched the pattern observed empirically. Increasing behavioural homogeneity with some peers, and so reinforcing social differentiation and cultural boundaries between subsets of the population, can be particularly striking in sympatric large toothed whale societies. As with Pacific sperm whales, killer whales (Orcinus orca) can display remarkable intrapopulation behavioural segregation, seemingly marked by an intricate system of pulsed calls for communication. These calls can change over space and time, but tend to do so in a way that preserves the differences between pods, suggesting that acoustic signals can allow pods to distinguish themselves.

### Management of oral surgery-related complications [^1157Q5KW]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

This article reviews the optimal management of oroantral fistulas, implants protruding into the maxillary sinus, implants completely displaced into the sinus(es), and infected bone grafts used for sinus augmentation. For each scenario, multidisciplinary management strategies will be considered based on whether there is concurrent infectious odontogenic sinusitis. A multidisciplinary approach with oral surgeons and otolaryngologists is often mandatory to ensure optimal therapeutic outcomes.

### Endoscopic surgical treatment of chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin [^111sH1E9]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin (CMSDO) is a common disease that requires treatment of the sinusitis as well as of the odontogenic source. We present our surgical experience performing contemporary treatment of the odontogenic source and endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) in patients with CMSDO.

Patients and Methods

Seventeen patients with CMSDO underwent contemporary treatment of the odontogenic source and ESS. Five patients presented chronic oroantral fistula (OAF); 5 patients presented odontogenic cysts occupying the maxillary sinus; 2 patients had inflammatory cysts of the molars; 2 patients had maxillary sinus infection secondary to peri-implantitis; 3 patients had foreign bodies pushed through the root canal into the sinus. The first surgical step was the treatment of the odontogenic source. The second step was ESS with opening and calibration of the maxillary natural ostium.

Results

Foreign bodies were extracted from the sinuses through the endonasal approach. No major complications after ESS were observed. The average time for ESS was ± 25 minutes. Good distant results without symptoms and complete closure of the fistula were obtained in all patients.

Conclusion

When significant sinus disease is found, an endoscopic approach to drainage in all of the involved sinuses can promote predictably successful closure of OAF. The endoscopic approach to chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin is a reliable method associated with less morbidity and lower incidence of complications.

### Autism spectrum disorders and childhood caries: a comprehensive mendelian randomization study [^113roHuT]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a representative disorder of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), is a complex developmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social communication, repetitive behaviors, and, often, restricted interests. With onset typically occurring in children and adolescents, ASD represents a diverse range of conditions that can vary significantly in severity and manifestation. This neurodevelopmental disorder is deeply rooted in the intricate workings of the brain, and clinical studies have consistently revealed its strong genetic heterogeneity, indicating that multiple genetic factors contribute to its development. Childhood caries, commonly referred to as dental cavities or tooth decay, is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in children. It can be categorized into primary teeth caries (affecting deciduous teeth) and permanent teeth caries (affecting adult teeth). The clinical presentation of childhood caries typically includes visible signs of tooth decay such as white spots, brown or black discoloration, and cavitation of the teeth. Symptoms may include pain, sensitivity, or difficulty in eating, especially when the decay reaches an advanced stage. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in preventing further complications such as infections and potential tooth loss.

While remarkable progress has been made in understanding and supporting individuals with ASD, the disorder still poses significant challenges. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States has released findings indicating that the prevalence of ASD among children aged 0–8 years has risen from 1 in 54 in 2018 to 1 in 36 in 2020. Most research studies have indicated that children with ASD exhibit poorer oral hygiene and gum health compared to the general population. Additionally, one of the primary characteristics of individuals with ASD is inflexibility, poor communication skills, and repetitive behavior. Changes in the oral environment or oral diseases can potentially trigger sudden outbursts of anger in these individuals. Poor oral hygiene can lead to various issues, including sleep disorders. Dental treatment for individuals with ASD often requires anesthesia, which poses a significant economic burden on the families of these individuals.

### Treatment of oroantral fistula: experience with 27 cases [^1134L6BK]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review patients with chronic oroantral and oronasal fistula who underwent surgical correction.

Material and Methods

Twenty-seven patients with chronic oroantral and oral fistula who underwent surgical correction in the Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery between 1968 and 2001 were reviewed retrospectively.

Results

Local mucosal flaps were used for surgical correction. The underlying factors were tooth extraction in 13 patients (48%), tumor in 5 (18.5%), osteomyelitis in 3 (11%), Caldwell-Luc procedure in 2 (7.5%), trauma in 2 (7.5%), dentiginous cyst in 1(3.7%), and correction of septal perforation in 1 (3.7%). Among the fistulas, 23 were oroantral, 3 were oroantronasal, and 1 was oronasal, respectively. Two patients required revisional repairment. The surgical procedure failed in 1 diabetic patient and 3 patients with prior history of external radiotherapy.

Conclusion

Tooth extraction was the most common etiologic factor, and malignancy should be excluded in all patients. The outcome may not be satisfactory in patients with systemic disease and in patients with history of radiotherapy. Multiple surgical interventions may be necessary only on rare occasions.

### Comparison of the clinical outcomes of buccal advancement flap versus platelet-rich fibrin application for the immediate closure of acute oroantral communications [^116adtk3]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of buccal advancement flap surgery to platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) application for the closure of acute oroantral communications (AOACs). In 36 patients, following the extractions of posterior maxillary teeth, AOACs which were larger than 3mm diameter were detected. In group A, PRF clots were used in 21 patients and group B, classic buccal advancement flap was used in 15 patients. Baseline variables such as pain, the analgesic doses are taken, and swelling was assessed preoperatively. These were also examined on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 7, and patients were seen again in the 3rd week. In group A, statistically significant reduction was examined (P < 0.05) in pain and the analgesic doses are taken (sum of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 7th days on days 1 and 2) (PRF). The swelling was also significantly less in group A (P < 0.05). The mean duration did not differ between the groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, both methods were successful for the immediate closure of AOACs. However, a lesser amount of pain and no swelling observed with the use of PRF clots for the immediate closure of AOACs compared to buccal advancement flap surgery.

### Feasibility of conical biodegradable polyurethane foam for closure of oroantral communications [^111vm1CA]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the feasibility of a conically shaped biodegradable polyurethane (PU) foam for closure of oroantral communications (OACs).

Patients and Methods

In 10 consecutive patients, fresh OACs (present for < 24 hours) were closed with PU foam. Standardized evaluations were performed at 2 and 8 weeks after closure of the OAC. Success was considered permanent closure of the OAC.

Results

No complications were observed in 7 of the 10 patients. Of the other 3 patients, 1 developed a maxillary sinusitis that was successfully managed with antibiotics and the OAC recurred in 2 patients.

Conclusions

Permanent closure of the OAC using PU foam was accomplished in 8 of 10 patients. The results obtained in the present study were more favorable than in a previous feasibility study. Therefore, the alterations in the treatment protocol were maintained for additional research of this new and straightforward treatment strategy. In general, closure of OACs with biodegradable PU foam is feasible and has the potential to make surgical treatment unnecessary for a large number of patients with OACs.

### A study of two novel techniques for one-stage closure of chronic oroantral fistula and sinus floor lift [^1151Yt9E]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

For the maxillary sinus floor elevation procedure, it is better for the sinus membrane to be intact without any signs of acute inflammation. OAF closure with a solitary soft tissue flap before implant restoration leads to a high risk of mucosal injury during augmentation due to the matting of the sinus membrane and the oral mucosa. Moreover, soft tissues closure are unfavorable for bone regeneration, whereas modern dental implants require sufficient bone at the implantation site. Therefore, in OAF repair, simultaneous orifice closure, sinus floor elevation and alveolar bone reconstruction should be considered to provide a foundation for subsequent dental implant rehabilitation.

The residual sinus membrane is discontinuous in the OAF area, which may cause infection. The key factors for successful sinus floor elevation combined with OAF closure are infection control and sinus membrane continuity recovery. In the present study, 4 patients demonstrated severe maxillary sinusitis at the first visit. After drainage from the oroantral communication for several months as well as the administration of appropriate antibiotics, active infection in the sinus could be controlled. Some patients still had local thickening of the sinus membrane, which was considered to be a hyperplastic response because of the previous inflammation and the communication with the oral cavity. However, as shown in the results, the local hyperplasia recovered to normal after OAF closure, and bone augmentation was not jeopardized.

### Closure of oroantral communications using biodegradable polyurethane foam: a feasibility study [^116zETgv]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of biodegradable polyurethane (PU) foam for closure of oroantral communications (OACs).

Patients and Methods

Ten consecutive patients with OACs (existing < 24 hours) were treated with PU foam. Standardized evaluations were performed at 2 weeks and 8 weeks after closure of the OAC.

Results

In 5 patients, the OACs were closed successfully without complications. Three patients developed sinusitis, which was conservatively managed with antibiotics in 2 cases. In 1 case the sinus was reopened for irrigation, after which a buccal flap procedure was performed. In 2 patients the OAC recurred and was surgically closed with a buccal flap after thorough irrigation.

Conclusion

In this feasibility study, closure was achieved in 7 of the 10 patients without further surgical intervention. Complications of the procedure using PU foam may be related to the fit of the foam in the socket and the size of the perforation. In general, closure of OACs with biodegradable polyurethane foam is feasible and has the potential to spare a large number of patients with OACs a surgical procedure. Furthermore, in case the treatment with PU foam fails to close the OAC, the attending physician can always fall back on the standard surgical procedure.

### Sinusitis of odontogenic origin [^116uu487]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Odontogenic sinusitis is a well-recognized condition and accounts for approximately 10% to 12% of cases of maxillary sinusitis. An odontogenic source should be considered in individuals with symptoms of maxillary sinusitis with a history of odontogenic infection, dentoalveolar surgery, periodontal surgery, or in those resistant to conventional sinusitis therapy. Diagnosis usually requires a thorough dental and clinical evaluation including appropriate radiographs. The most common causes of odontogenic sinusitis include dental abscesses and periodontal disease that had perforated the Schneidarian membrane, irritation and secondary infection caused by intra-antral foreign bodies, and sinus perforations during tooth extraction. An odontogenic infection is a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection, with anaerobes outnumbering the aerobes. The most common isolates include anaerobic streptococci and gram-negative bacilli, and Enterobacteriaceae. Surgical and dental treatment of the odontogenic pathological conditions combined with medical therapy is indicated. When present, an odontogenic foreign body should be surgical removed. Surgical management of oroantral communication is indicated to reduce the likelihood of causing chronic sinus disease. The management of odontogenic sinusitis includes a 3- to 4-week course of antimicrobials effective against the oral flora pathogens.
