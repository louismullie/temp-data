## Question

Vp shunt impaired flow

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate suspected impaired flow in a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the initial bedside assessment and its limitations. Next, I will review first-line imaging and its diagnostic performance. After that, I need to examine advanced or adjunctive diagnostics, including thermal flow evaluation, shuntography, and ultrasound-based methods. Then, I should consider special scenarios like slit ventricle syndrome and infection. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm and highlight key takeaways with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability, because symptoms of VP shunt malfunction are notoriously nonspecific and overlap with many pediatric and adult conditions. Headache, vomiting, lethargy, and irritability are common, but their predictive value is limited, and drowsiness or altered mental status carries the strongest signal for obstruction in children, though even that is imperfect and must be interpreted in context [^84609453] [^3c272d10]. I should double-check that the baseline risk of malfunction is substantial, with pediatric failure rates up to 50% over several years and adult rates around 16% over 6 years, which justifies a low threshold for evaluation but also underscores the need for efficient, evidence-based testing strategies [^3d5e422c].

> Next, I should review the initial bedside assessment and its pitfalls. Wait, let me verify the role of pumping the shunt reservoir and palpating the valve. While these maneuvers can suggest patency, they are subjective, operator-dependent, and can be misleading, so they should not be used in isolation to rule out malfunction [^4ef9993c]. I need to ensure I document neurologic status, fontanelle tension in infants, and any signs of infection such as erythema or tenderness along the tubing, because these findings meaningfully shift pretest probability and guide urgency [^aae0aa65].

> I will now examine first-line imaging, starting with a shunt series, because it is fast, widely available, and highly specific for mechanical issues like disconnection, fracture, or migration. Hold on, I should verify the sensitivity; pooled estimates show sensitivity around 14–53% but specificity near 99%, so a positive shunt series essentially confirms a mechanical problem and should trigger neurosurgical consultation without delay [^3c299d10]. But wait, what if the shunt series is negative? Does that exclude malfunction? No, it does not, and I should not anchor on a normal shunt series when clinical suspicion remains high [^3c299d10].

> Next, I should review head CT, because ventricular enlargement compared with baseline is a key radiographic sign of underdrainage. Let me consider the evidence: in a prospective pediatric series, every patient with ventricles larger than their baseline had a proven blocked shunt, yet sensitivity varies widely across studies and some obstructions occur without ventriculomegaly, so a normal CT does not rule out malfunction and must be interpreted with prior imaging in hand [^84609453] [^3c299d10]. Hold on, I should verify the limitation again: in long-standing shunted patients, reduced ventricular compliance can mask enlargement despite elevated intracranial pressure, so a normal CT cannot safely exclude obstruction when the clinical picture is concerning [^2f82fb44].

> Now, I need to check advanced or adjunctive diagnostics that can reduce uncertainty. Thermal flow evaluation is a noninvasive, operator-blinded test that detects CSF flow in shunts; in a large multicenter study, TFE-only had 100% sensitivity as a rule-out test and outperformed imaging in that specific role, suggesting that when flow is detected in a low-risk patient, imaging may be deferred and discharge considered with close follow-up [^ff206291] [^9d5b8fc4]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the micropumper enhanced accuracy, but the blinded trial actually showed no advantage and even suggested false reassurance when the micropumper forced flow across partial obstructions, so TFE-only is preferred in the emergent setting [^093072ba] [^9d5b8fc4]. I should confirm that TFE is best integrated with clinical judgment and other data, not used as a standalone arbiter of shunt function [^b78d4dc6].

> Let me consider radionuclide shuntography when mechanical dysfunction is suspected but standard imaging is inconclusive. Shuntography can localize obstruction to proximal, valve, or distal segments and guide targeted revision rather than complete system replacement, with contemporary series suggesting meaningful clinical utility and relatively low infection risk when performed properly, though protocols vary and expertise matters [^25056095] [^01b42f36]. I should double-check that shuntography is particularly helpful in iNPH patients with delayed deterioration, where mechanical complications are common and often missed by static imaging alone [^25056095].

> I will now examine ultrasound-based approaches, including superb microvascular imaging and point-of-care ultrasound, which are promising for detecting low-velocity CSF flow noninvasively. Let me verify feasibility data: SMI can visualize flow after reservoir compression and may enable rapid bedside assessment, while POCUS protocols using peak velocity cutoffs show high negative predictive value for obstruction, though standardization and larger validation cohorts are still needed before routine adoption [^1e729c7b] [^3aed4071]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these modalities should complement, not replace, established pathways pending further evidence [^2b2c8c7e].

> But wait, what if the ventricles are slit and the patient has headaches? Slit ventricle syndrome can mask obstruction because ventricles fail to dilate despite elevated pressure, so I need to ensure I maintain a high index of suspicion and obtain a shunt series even when CT is unrevealing. Case-based evidence shows that disconnection or valve issues can be uncovered on shunt series and confirmed with invasive monitoring, leading to targeted revision and symptom relief [^cea37bdb]. I should confirm that this is especially relevant in adults with complex pediatric hydrocephalus histories [^cea37bdb].

> Next, I should review infection considerations, because infection can present with nonspecific symptoms and confound the picture. New headache, nausea, lethargy, or mental status change, with or without fever, should prompt evaluation for shunt infection; if suspected, I need to obtain CSF cultures and consider blood cultures, and if abdominal symptoms are present, abdominal ultrasound or CT can identify loculated collections at the distal catheter tip [^aae0aa65] [^b37554b7]. Hold on, I should verify culture practices: hold CSF cultures for at least 10 days to catch slow-growing organisms like Propionibacterium acnes, and culture shunt components if hardware is removed for suspected infection [^f3fe85f0].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway while acknowledging uncertainties. In a symptomatic patient, I should start with a focused neurologic exam and shunt reservoir assessment, then obtain a shunt series and a head CT compared with baseline when feasible. If the shunt series is positive, I proceed to neurosurgical consultation for revision. If CT shows new ventriculomegaly, I likewise escalate to surgical evaluation. If both are negative but suspicion remains high, I should add TFE to rule out obstruction, recognizing that detected flow supports a functioning shunt and may allow deferral of further imaging in carefully selected low-risk patients with close follow-up. If doubt persists, shuntography or ultrasound-based flow assessment can help localize the problem and guide targeted therapy [^3c299d10] [^ff206291] [^25056095] [^3aed4071]. I need to ensure I document shared decision-making, especially when considering discharge without definitive imaging, and provide clear return precautions.

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and correct any overstatements. First, no single noninvasive test is both highly sensitive and specific for shunt malfunction, so a multimodal approach anchored to clinical judgment is essential. Second, TFE is a valuable rule-out tool in low-risk patients with detected flow, but it should not replace imaging when clinical risk is high or when prior imaging is unavailable. Third, shunt series remains the most specific test for mechanical failure, and a positive result should trigger immediate surgical consultation. Fourth, slit ventricle physiology can obscure classic radiographic signs, so a normal CT does not exclude obstruction when the clinical picture is compelling. Fifth, emerging ultrasound and 4D flow MRI techniques are promising but require further validation before routine use [^3c299d10] [^ff206291] [^25056095] [^cea37bdb] [^3aed4071] [^26dc9ce3].

VP shunt impaired flow refers to **reduced or blocked CSF movement** through the shunt system, most often due to obstruction, kinking, or valve malfunction. It presents with **nonspecific symptoms** such as headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and visual changes, and can lead to rapid neurologic deterioration if not treated promptly [^3d5e422c]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion plus imaging** (CT/MRI for ventricular size, shunt series for mechanical issues) [^3c299d10] and, when needed, shunt tap or radionuclide shuntography to confirm flow [^25056095]. Immediate neurosurgical evaluation is essential; management includes shunt revision, replacement, or alternative CSF diversion (e.g. ETV) [^3ce97c84] based on the cause and patient factors [^d0b5a910].

---

## Pathophysiology and causes

Impaired flow in VP shunts arises from **mechanical, biological, or functional** factors:

- **Obstruction**: Proximal catheter blockage by choroid plexus, blood, or proteinaceous debris; distal catheter blockage by omentum, adhesions, or pseudocysts [^f0679059] [^0c601862].
- **Mechanical failure**: Catheter disconnection, kinking, migration, or valve malfunction [^4534b771] [^f260345a].
- **Infection**: Shunt infection causing inflammation, debris, and biofilm, leading to obstruction [^ec615417].
- **Overdrainage**: Excessive CSF removal causing slit ventricles, poor catheter position, and intermittent obstruction [^e6232d22].

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms of impaired VP shunt flow are **nonspecific** and reflect raised intracranial pressure:

- **Headache**: Often progressive, worse in the morning, relieved by lying down [^notfound].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Especially in the morning [^notfound].
- **Lethargy, irritability, altered mental status**: Particularly in children [^4534b771].
- **Visual disturbances**: Diplopia, blurred vision, or transient visual loss [^63a69f2d].
- **Seizures**: Less common but possible [^4534b771].
- **Signs of infection**: Fever, erythema along the shunt tract, or abdominal pain [^aae0aa65].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **multimodal approach** is required to confirm impaired flow:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Role and accuracy** |
|-|-|
| Clinical assessment | Essential but nonspecific; drowsiness is the strongest predictor of shunt block in children [^84609453] [^3c272d10] |
| CT/MRI | Assesses ventricular size vs baseline; sensitivity ~53–100%, specificity ~27–98% [^3c299d10] [^9cc589f0] |
| Shunt series (X-ray) | Detects disconnection, migration, kinking; high specificity, low sensitivity [^3c299d10] [^4534b771] |
| Shunt tap | Assesses proximal flow and opening pressure; invasive but informative [^4ef9993c] |
| Radionuclide shuntography | Confirms flow from ventricle to peritoneum; detects partial obstructions [^25056095] [^8dcb2979] |
| Thermal flow evaluation (TFE) | Noninvasive, high sensitivity as a rule-out test for obstruction [^ff206291] [^9d5b8fc4] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **cause and severity**:

- **Immediate stabilization**: Elevate head of bed, administer mannitol or hypertonic saline for elevated ICP, and arrange urgent neurosurgical consultation [^notfound].
- **Surgical intervention**: Shunt revision (replace blocked component), shunt replacement, or conversion to alternative CSF diversion (e.g. ETV) [^3ce97c84] [^d0b5a910].
- **Infection management**: Systemic antibiotics and complete shunt removal if infection is confirmed [^notfound].
- **Programmable valves**: Allow noninvasive pressure adjustments to address overdrainage or underdrainage [^d0b5a910].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies with the **cause, timeliness of intervention, and patient factors**. Early recognition and treatment improve outcomes; delays risk permanent neurologic injury or death [^5943678e]. Complications include persistent hydrocephalus, neurologic deficits, infection, and repeated surgeries [^1d3b564e].

---

VP shunt impaired flow is a **critical complication** requiring rapid recognition and multidisciplinary management. Early, accurate diagnosis and prompt neurosurgical intervention are essential to prevent irreversible neurologic harm.

Introduction

Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt implantation is the standard treatment for patients suffering from hydrocephalus, a condition of excess accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricular space. The main reason for hydrocephalus is an obstruction of normal CSF flow, which makes it a serious and life-threatening neurological disorder. First symptoms are heterogeneous and include cognitive decline, incontinence, and reduced vigilance. Subsequently, it can cause severe damage to the brain by increased intracranial pressure and consecutive ischemia.

VP shunt placement is a simple and effective neurosurgical procedure, established in 1960s. The shunt system allows drainage of excess CSF to regulate intracranial pressure by diversion of the fluid in the peritoneal space. Shunt implantation was first performed using thin elastic tubes, which subcutaneously extend to the peritoneal space. Most shunt systems are equipped with a pump reservoir and a valve in order to allow flow control and prevent reflux. Once a patient has a shunt system implanted, he/she usually remains dependent on the system for life.

In case patients with a VP shunt system present with acute symptoms of hydrocephalus in an acute setting, occlusion of the VP shunt system has to be excluded in order to plan further clinical treatment, potentially leading to surgical revision of the VP shunt system. The evaluation of the patient requires high clinical expertise, as acute symptoms are unspecific, including headache and vomiting. Additionally, rapid evaluation is mandatory, as unresolved shunt malfunction can quickly become life-threatening. The diagnosis of shunt obstruction and the localization of the obstruction site are still lacking adequate mechanical instrumentation. Upon hospital admission, patients showing clinical signs of shunt obstruction undergo investigations using ionizing radiation, invasive tests, and open surgical exploration, bearing several risks including the danger of possible brain damage. In the first year following implantation, up to 40% of patients need repeated surgery, and 10% will additionally undergo surgery annually after the first year. Possible reasons for shunt dysfunction include improper shunt placement, disconnection of shunt segments, breakage of the shunt catheter, and infection, component malfunction, and obstruction by accumulation of cellular materials mainly in the ventricular catheter.

### Continuous, noninvasive wireless monitoring of flow of cerebrospinal fluid through shunts in patients with hydrocephalus [^3d5e422c]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydrocephalus is a common and debilitating condition caused by the excess production or impaired resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain. Causes include congenital malformations, intracerebral hemorrhage, infection, trauma, and tumors. The condition can occur in nearly all age groups from infantsto elderlypatients, with the latter group particularly susceptible to idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). Hydrocephalus affects over 1 million people in the United States alone. In nearly all cases, the treatment involves surgical implantation of a pressure-regulated silicone tube assembly, known as a 'shunt', that drains excess fluid away from the cerebral ventricles to a distal absorptive site, such as the peritoneum. Unfortunately, shunts suffer from extremely high failure rates, up to 50%, in pediatric populations and 16% in adults, over 6-years.

The symptoms of shunt failure are identical to those of hydrocephalus and are highly non-specific, including headaches, nausea, and drowsiness. These vague symptoms coupled with the inability of convenient, direct measurement of shunt patency frustrate straightforward diagnoses. As a result, patients commonly undergo a range of diagnostic procedures, including evaluating the size of the cerebral ventricles with computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), evaluation for disconnection or fracture of the shunt tubing with X-ray imaging, known as a 'shunt-series'. All such procedures represent indirect measures and they suffer from a combination of low accuracy, high costs, radiation exposure, and in the case of MRIs in pediatric patients, the need for anesthesia. More direct measures of shunt patency include nuclear medicine "shunt function" studies where a radionucleotide tracer is directly injected into the shunt system, but this procedure can be painful, and it can introduce infection into the shunt, and it is poorly suited to pediatric populations. Similarly, lumbar puncture tests also rely on hollow needles to collect spinal CSF for the assessment of pressure and viral infections. In some cases, patients are simply admitted to the hospital for long-term observation or they undergo exploratory surgeries to definitively rule out shunt malfunction. Overall, the management and treatment of patients with shunted hydrocephalus costs the U.S healthcare system over $2 billion annually, and the condition results in an impaired quality of life for both patients and their caregivers – due to the near-constant uncertainty associated with the potential for shunt failure.

BACKGROUND

Children with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt for obstructive hydrocephalus can present acutely with symptoms of shunt blockage and any delay in diagnosis results in serious complications including death. A new onset neurological sign should be investigated urgently, but being aware of potential non-serious causes could avoid unnecessary neurological interventions from a diagnostic dilemma.

Ventricular shunts are commonly employed to treat children with hydrocephalus. Complications from shunts are common and can present with a variety of signs and symptoms. This pair of reviews discusses the common findings in patients with shunt malfunction, including physical examination and imaging findings. Part I of the series discusses obstruction and mechanical failure of shunts; Part II discusses overdrainage, loculation, and abdominal complications of shunts.

Assessment of treated hydrocephalus

Follow-up after third ventriculostomy

Phase-contrast and 3D-DRIVE sequences have high confidence in the assessment of the flow through the floor of the third ventricle with proper identification of ventriculostomy malfunction (Fig. 19, Additional file 3: Video S3). Along with the presence of flow void across the floor of the third ventricle, quantitative analysis by measuring overflow amplitude (systolic stroke volume plus net diastolic stroke volume) was found to be a reliable indicator for functional assessment of third ventriculostomy. A high value of more than 75 mm³ indicates effective operation with patient improvement. A decrease of stroke volume during follow-up could indicate ventriculostomy malfunction and clinical deterioration.

Follow-up after ventriculoperitoneal shunt

The diagnosis of shunt malfunction depends mainly on CT of the cranium along with clinical symptoms (headache, vomiting, altered sensorium, feeding difficulty, and fever). However, clinical symptoms are often vague with equivocal radiological findings, in addition to the burden of frequent radiation exposure. Ventricular enlargement compared to prior examinations is the primary sign for shunt malfunction. However, shunt failure can occur without definite ventriculomegaly. Secondary signs of acute shunt malfunction include transependymal permeation of CSF and pericatheter edema. Subgaleal fluid collections can be encountered (Fig. 20). Rapid brain MRI protocols have been utilized based on single-shot T2-WI. Recently, it was documented that phase-contrast sequence can be useful in the assessment of functional status of the VP shunt through velocity measurements across the shunt tube.

### Management of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^6f35962c]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Gait instability, urinary incontinence, and dementia are the signs and symptoms typically found in patients who have normal pressure hydrocephalus. Estimated to cause no more than 5 percent of cases of dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus often is treatable, and accurate recognition of the clinical triad coupled with radiographic evidence most commonly identifies likely responders. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography typically demonstrates ventricular dilation with preservation of the surrounding brain tissue. The abnormality in normal pressure hydrocephalus occurs secondary to an abnormality in fluid removal, leading to an increase in ventricular size and encroachment of enlarged ventricles on adjacent brain tissue. The pressure exerted on the cerebral parenchyma by immense fluid-filled cavities deforms white matter tracts, instigating gait abnormalities and incomplete control of the bladder, as well as difficulties in processing incoming stimulation and in producing expeditious responses. Signs and symptoms often occur as sequelae to an imbalance between the expected ongoing production of cerebrospinal fluid and continuous efflux. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is used to relieve excess ventricular fluid not absorbed by normal physiologic channels. Multiple studies have explored various techniques to identify patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus in an effort to predict likely benefit from shunting. However, the effectiveness of cerebrospinal fluid diversion has never been proven in a randomized controlled trial comparing use of a shunt versus no shunt.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunt block: what are the best predictive clinical indicators? [^84609453]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the predictive value of symptoms, signs, and radiographic findings accompanying presumed ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt malfunction, by comparing presentation with operative findings and subsequent clinical course.

Methods

Prospective study of all 53 patient referrals to a paediatric neurosurgical centre between April and November 1999 with a diagnosis of presumed shunt malfunction. Referral pattern, presenting symptoms and signs, results of computed tomography (CT) scanning, operative findings, and clinical outcome were recorded. Two patient groups were defined, one with proven shunt block, the other with presumed normal shunt function. Symptomatology, CT scan findings, and the subsequent clinical course for each group were then compared.

Results

Common presenting features were headache, drowsiness, and vomiting. CT scans were performed in all patients. Thirty seven had operatively proven shunt malfunction, of whom 34 had shunt block and three shunt infection; 84% with shunt block had increased ventricle size when compared with previous imaging. For the two patient groups (with and without shunt block), odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals on their presenting symptoms were headache 1.5 (0.27 to 10.9), vomiting 0.9 (0.25 to 3.65), drowsiness 10 (0.69 to 10.7), and fever 0.19 (0.03 to 6.95). Every patient with ventricular enlargement greater than their known baseline had a proven blocked shunt.

Conclusions

Drowsiness is by far the best clinical predictor of VP shunt block. Headache and vomiting were less predictive of acute shunt block in this study. Wherever possible CT scan findings should be interpreted in the context of previous imaging. We would caution that not all cases of proven shunt blockage present with an increase in ventricle size.

### Failure of cerebrospinal fluid shunts: part II: overdrainage, loculation, and abdominal complications [^c78b6c70]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Complications from cerebrospinal fluid shunts are common and can present with a variety of signs and symptoms. In this second part of a two-part review, shunt overdrainage, loculation of the ventricular system in patients with shunts, and abdominal complications related to ventriculoperitoneal shunts are discussed. Familiarity with these types of shunt failure is essential for neurologists and pediatricians because they are often the first to evaluate and triage these children.

### The role of shuntography in diagnosis of mechanic complications after implantation of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a retrospective clinical evaluation [^25056095]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) of the elderly remains an enigmatic disease. Internal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion is established as the standard therapy, but in cases of poor outcome after ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) or secondary deterioration, it can be difficult to differentiate between non-responders and patients with mechanical shunt dysfunction. Thus, every neurosurgeon is familiar with the trade-off between wait and see, non-invasive diagnostics, invasive functional diagnostics, or even revision surgery. Sufficient diversion of CSF is the main task of the VPS in the management of the disease "hydrocephalus". In well-functioning VPS therapies, the clinical symptoms of iNPH such as gait disturbance, short-term memory disorder, and incontinence (Hakim triad), but also headaches and dizziness, are potentially reversible. Several types of shunts are available but those with abdominal lead are implanted most often. Typically, the VPS consists of three components: the proximal catheter (ventricular catheter), shunt valve, and the distal catheter (abdominal drainage tube). All of these segments of the shunt may interfere with the viability of the VPS due to obstruction or disconnection which can lead to a complete failure. As a result, under-drainage of CSF may occur in the case of obstruction with clinical deterioration of gait disturbance or incontinence, or over drainage in disconnection with the leading symptom of headache. Several studies have shown that more than 30% of patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus develop a mechanical complication due to obstruction of the VPS during the first year after shunt implantation. Only half of the newly implanted VPS function adequately during the second year, and less than one third works until the tenth year without revision. Clinical symptoms as well as assessments of internal and external CSF spaces on cranial imaging can signal shunt dysfunctions. However, these signs are not specific for mechanical complications in the course of the VPS therapy. In cases when the cause of a patient's clinical worsening is not evident, functional contrast-enhanced shuntography may be helpful. Mirfakhraee first described contrast medium-assisted shuntography in 1985. However, literature on experiences with shuntography is scant and mainly consists of studies with small case numbers. There are no guidelines for shuntography nor protocols for the procedure or consensus on image interpretation, which severely limits its' clinical validity. This retrospective cohort study aimed to analyze contrast-enhanced shuntography by a quantitative method and to evaluate its' clinical value for decision-making in patients with suspected VPS dysfunction. In addition, this study elaborates on a workflow for indicating, conducting, and interpreting shuntographies.

### The effectiveness of various CSF diversion surgeries in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^aa24ee21]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a progressive neurological syndrome characterised by gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence concomitant with dilated cerebral ventricles under normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. The prevalence of iNPH is estimated to be between 10 and 22 per 100,000, and this is markedly increased within specific, often vulnerable patient subgroups, such as those residing in extended-care facilities. CSF diversion shunts are considered the gold-standard treatment for iNPH. Several shunt options exist, including ventriculoperitoneal (VP) which is widely favoured, lumboperitoneal (LP), that sees significant usage in certain regions and, in fewer cases, ventriculoatrial (VA) shunts. Endoscopic third-ventriculostomy (ETV) is a suggested alternative proposed to work through systolic CSF outflow in the subarachnoid space, although the efficacy of this is disputed. Despite improvements in iNPH diagnostic imaging and CSF dynamics assessment, the precise magnitude of therapeutic benefit from CSF diversion procedures is yet to be fully elucidated with varied success reported. Moreover, shunt surgeries are associated with significant complications, including infections and intracranial haematomas, the incidences of which are inconsistent across reports.

Diagnosing iNPH further complicates management due to the absence of a definitive test. Guideline statements, that is the 2021 Japanese guidelines and the 2005 American–European guidelines, diverge on several factors, including age limits and parameter thresholds to differentiate iNPH from other neurodegenerative conditions. Variability in interpreting these criteria may lead to diverse diagnostic practices and therefore shunt surgery suitability, which, in turn, may impact treatment outcomes among studies.

Recent years have seen a notable expansion in evidence for CSF shunting, and to a lesser extent, ETV in iNPH patients. This growing dataset provides an opportunity to re-evaluate the effectiveness of these surgical interventions. Moreover, advancements in patient selection methodologies, enriched by clinical tests and radiological assessments, have improved the identification of candidates most likely to benefit from shunt surgery. The latest consensus guidelines further highlight this by advocating for a nuanced diagnostic algorithm and the use of CSF biomarkers to predict surgical outcomes, ensuring that interventions are tailored to those with the greatest potential for improvement.

Considering these developments, this systematic review and meta-analysis seeks to update the existing literature and additionally evaluate the temporal trends in CSF surgery efficacy. By integrating the most current research, we aim to report the relative benefits and risks of surgical CSF diversion techniques in the management of iNPH.

### Diagnostic modalities to determine ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3c299d10]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt malfunction is an emergency. Timely diagnosis can be challenging because shunt malfunction often presents with symptoms mimicking other common pediatric conditions.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine which commonly used imaging modalities; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), X-ray Shunt series or Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter (ONSD) ultrasound, are superior in evaluating shunt malfunction.

Inclusion Criteria

patients less than 21 years old with symptoms of shunt malfunction. We calculated the pooled sensitivity, specificity, Likelihood Ratios (LR+, LR-) using a random-effects model.

Results

Eight studies were included encompassing 1906 patients with a prevalence of VP shunt malfunction of (29.3%). Shunt series: sensitivity (14%-53%), specificity (99%), LR+ (23.2), and LR- (0.47–0.87). CT scan: sensitivity (53%-100%), specificity (27%-98%), LR+ (1.34–22.87), LR- (0.37). MRI: sensitivity (57%), specificity (93%), LR+ (7.66), and LR- (0.49). ONSD: sensitivity (64%), specificity (22%-68%), LR+ (4.4–8.7), LR- (0.93). A positive shunt series, CT scan, MRI, or ONSD has a post-test probability of (23%-84%). A normal shunt series, CT scan, MRI, or ONSD results in a post-test probability of (7%-31%). A positive shunt series results in a post-test probability of 80%, which is equivalent to the post-test probability of CT scan (23–84%) and MRI (83%).

Conclusion

Despite the low sensitivity, a positive shunt series obviates the need for further imaging studies. Prompt referral for neurosurgical intervention is recommended. A negative shunt series or any result (positive or negative) from CT, MRI, or ONSD will still require an emergent neurosurgical referral.

### Neuroimaging of ventriculoperitoneal shunt complications in children [^4534b771]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The ventriculoperitoneal shunt is the mainstay of treatment for hydrocephalus. Despite its widespread use and safety record, it often malfunctions due to complications such as obstruction, breakage, migration and infection. This necessitates a systematic approach to diagnosing the etiology of shunt failure. Any evaluation should begin with an appraisal of the patient's symptoms. In acute malfunction, nausea, vomiting, irritability, seizures, headache, lethargy, coma and stupor are seen. In chronic malfunction, neuropsychological signs, feeding pattern changes, developmental delay, decline in school performance, headaches and increased head size are often seen. The next step in evaluation is a CT scan of the head to evaluate ventricular size. Prior imaging studies should be obtained for comparison; if the ventricles have enlarged over time, shunt malfunction is likely. If there is no such increase or dilation in the first place, other diagnoses are possible. However, "slit ventricle syndrome" should also be considered. When prior imaging is not available, pumping the reservoir, a radionuclide shuntogram, a shunt tap or even surgical exploration are options. The goals of this paper are to provide an algorithm for evaluating shunt malfunction and to illustrate the radiographic findings associated with shunt failure.

IDSA 2017 healthcare-associated ventriculitis/meningitis — cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts and drains recommendations state that new headache, nausea, lethargy, and/or change in mental status are suggestive of CSF shunt infection (strong, moderate). Erythema and tenderness over the subcutaneous shunt tubing are suggestive of CSF shunt infection (strong, moderate). Fever, in the absence of another clear source of infection, could be suggestive of CSF shunt infection (weak, low). Symptoms and signs of peritonitis or abdominal tenderness in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, in the absence of another clear etiology, are indicative of CSF shunt infection (strong, moderate). Symptoms and signs of pleuritis in patients with ventriculopleural shunts, in the absence of another clear etiology, are indicative of CSF shunt infection (strong, moderate). Demonstration of bacteremia in a patient with a ventriculoatrial shunt, in the absence of another clear source of bacteremia, is evidence of CSF shunt infection (strong, moderate). Demonstration of glomerulonephritis in a patient with a ventriculoatrial shunt is suggestive of CSF shunt infection (weak, low).

### Delayed symptom progression after ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement for normal pressure hydrocephalus [^b34423d4]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is generally treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS), with improved symptoms in the majority of patients. We performed a retrospective chart review study in order to describe patterns of, and risk factors for, delayed symptom progression after initially successful VPS placement. 69 consecutive patients underwent VPS placement for NPH, and were followed for a minimum of 12 months postoperatively. 55 patients (80%) had objective improvement in their NPH symptoms after surgery. Of these, 27 patients (49%) developed delayed deterioration of at least one of their NPH symptoms, at a mean of 28.3 months postoperatively (range, 3–77). 1 of the 27 patients was found to have shunt malfunction; 19 had specific clinical or imaging evidence of shunt function. 6/19 patients had transient improvement in their symptoms (lasting 30 days or more) after adjustment of their programmable shunt valves (32%), although symptoms in all of these patients later worsened. During a mean follow up period of 44.4 months (range, 15–87), 12 patients (44%) received other neurological diagnoses felt to at least partially explain their symptoms. Increased patient age was associated with likelihood of delayed symptom progression. We conclude that delayed symptom progression is common after VPS placement for NPH, including after initial symptom improvement; that symptom progression can often be temporarily palliated by shunt valve pressure adjustment; and that older patients are more likely to experience delayed symptom progression. We suggest that patients and their families be counselled accordingly before surgery.

### Diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive thermal evaluation of ventriculoperitoneal shunt flow in shunt malfunction: a prospective, multi-site, operator-blinded study [^608d70df]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Data Collection

All clinical and research team members at each site were blinded to TFE results until study completion. Blinding was ensured by modifying the tablet computers so that they did not allow access to raw data or test results.

A preimaging determination of the likelihood of progression to shunt revision surgery (unlikely/not unlikely) for each subject was made by the first attending physician to examine the patient, in most cases an ED physician (79% ED; 21% NS). This assessment was based on the physician's unstructured clinical judgment, considering clinical history and physical examination alone and codified as a categorical response.

The reference standard for shunt failure was shunt revision surgery with visually confirmed shunt obstruction within 7 d of TFE. All decisions to progress to surgery were based on clinical decision-making protocols currently in place at each center. Determination of shunt obstruction at surgery was made by the attending neurosurgeon when any of 4 observations occurred: a disconnected shunt, a complete lack of observable flow, proximal catheter flow less than 2 drops in 20 s, or complete distal obstruction when checked with a manometer.

Final radiologist interpretations were used to classify neuro-imaging results as "not enlarged" if the ventricular size was unchanged or decreased, or "enlarged" if the size was greater than in the most recent baseline study.

Patients' charts were reviewed 7 d after presentation to confirm clinical progression, and all clinical information was recorded on a case report form for each patient. A total 7-d follow-up was chosen to avoid missing patients presenting initially with sub-acute obstruction, but whose signs and symptoms progressed within a time-frame that is clinically sensible to attribute the original presentation to the shunt obstruction.

Data Handling

TFE results were uploaded to the device manufacturer blind to any clinical information, who then forwarded them to a contract research organization (CRO; ACI Clinical, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania). Case report forms with clinical information for each subject were uploaded independently by the sites to the CRO.

### Superb microvascular ultrasound is a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool to assess a ventriculoperitoneal shunt system function: a feasibility study [^2f82fb44]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) dysfunctions represent a true emergency, conceivably terminating lethally. VPS have a high failure rate up to 40% within the first year after initial implantation and up to 98% within the next 10 years. The most common complications are infections and mechanical dysfunction. Symptoms indicating this serious condition oftentimes vary extensively from headache, nausea and emesis to coma and death. Correspondingly, patients may deteriorate rapidly with far-reaching aftermaths. Importantly, 10% of all fatalities in children with implanted VP-shunts are due to a shunt dysfunction. In order to rule out VPS malfunction, multimodal emergency cranial imaging is necessary to evaluate e.g. ventricular size. Plain radiographic shunt series exclude disconnections or malposition and assess the valve setting in case of programmable systems. Elevated intraventricular pressure without ventriculomegaly can be found in long-term VPS patients with long-term inserted VPS leading to a reduced ventricular compliance with no or minimal change of the width of the ventricular system in cranial imaging despite elevated intracranial pressure. This possibility in a rapidly deteriorating symptomatic patient along with the absence of ventriculomegaly calls for explorative surgery and VPS revision. This may cause frustration of patients as well as physicians as revision surgery is associated with an high rate of subsequent VPS dysfunctions and infections. Hence, a strong call for reliable, predominantly non-invasive diagnostic tools has ascended recently. Being on the front burner, ultrasound (US) especially the contemporaneous advanced devices and techniques such as measuring of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), enables to steer coincident trend in diagnostics and treatment. Notably, none of these modern non-invasive methods available is embodied in the current standards of care yet. Using these in a preoperative diagnostic approach, especially as a bundle of non-invasive diagnostic procedures available may substantially expedite already very demanding time-consuming task and thus ameliorate patient outcomes in a real-world setting. Utilizing one of the contemporary advanced US techniques available, the aim of this feasibility study was to measure the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the VPS system using US with a special focus on low velocity flow after compressing the reservoir chamber in asymptomatic patients regardless of the indication of VPS implantation. This technique may spare future surgical explorations when comparing the current value to the patients' baseline.

Cerebrospinal fluid diversion has become the mainstay treatment in hydrocephalus for over 50 years. As the number of patients with ventricular shunt systems increases, neurointensivists are becoming the first-line physicians for many of these patients. When symptoms of a shunt malfunction are suspected and access to a neurosurgeon is limited or delayed, workup and temporizing measures must be initiated. The article highlights the functional nuances, complications, and management of current programmable shunt valves and their MRI sensitivity.

### Safety and efficacy of gravitational shunt valves in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a pragmatic, randomised, open label, multicentre trial (SVASONA) [^9cebc094]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is the only variant of dementia disorders possibly treatable by neurosurgical intervention. iNPH is a neurodegenerative condition clinically characterised by gait ataxia, urinary incontinence and memory disturbance (the so-called Hakim's triad).

In contrast with other types of dementia, ataxia represents an early and possibly pathognomic sign of iNPH. Neuroimaging typically shows dilated ventricles in the absence of increased intracranial pressure. Current pathophysiological models attribute iNPH to a complex dysfunction of cerebral blood flow with accompanying changes in CSF physiology rather than a simple imbalance of liquor production and resorption.

The precise epidemiology of iNPH in industrialised countries remains to be defined. Data from Norway suggest an overall 5 year incidence of 1.1/100 000, which may increase to 30.2/100 000 in subjects over 65 years of age.

Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt surgery is a widely established intervention for iNPH although there is no conclusive evidence from controlled trials demonstrating superior outcomes of VP shunting over possible alternative treatment options (eg, endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), or even watchful waiting). In the Hydrocephalus Association Survey 2003–2005, patients who underwent surgery had a non-significant reduction in the relative risk (RR) of dependent living compared with non-operative management (14/185 vs 6/66, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.08). While more shunt patients reported improved health related quality of life, they required heightened care compared with endoscopic third ventriculostomy patients.

VP shunting carries the risk of overdrainage complications, such as hygroma and subdural bleeding, which may cause severe headaches and nausea, subsequently demanding revision surgery.

### Diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive thermal evaluation of ventriculoperitoneal shunt flow in shunt malfunction: a prospective, multi-site, operator-blinded study [^f66f0b97]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the demonstrated utility of TFE as a rule-out test, patients who are clinically classified as low risk for shunt malfunction and have flow detected by TFE may be strongly considered for discharge without neuro-imaging (Figure 5, terminus I). With greater caution, patients categorized by clinicians as high-risk but with a negative imaging result (ventricles not enlarged) may potentially be discharged without further invasive testing or inpatient observation following detection of flow on TFE, and advised to follow-up in clinic (Figure 5, terminus IV). However, this determination would require further study to account for prior patterns of malfunction in such patients. Conversely, patients who have enlarged ventricles on neuro-imaging have a high likelihood of requiring surgical shunt revision (Figure 5, termini III and VI). Retrospective application of this decision tree to our sample demonstrated a substantial reduction in number of imaging scans and exposure to ionizing radiation, uncomfortable invasive tests, and admissions for observation (Figure 5, inset). Less clear are the decision paths where flow is not detected by TFE in the absence of ventriculomegaly (Figure 5, termini II and V).

These approaches to integrating TFE may be considered as possible improvements in care; however, any guidelines on the use of TFE in the clinical management of acute shunt malfunction would require further studies to stratify these groups. As always, providers should employ any and all measures to make the best judgment about the functionality of a shunt.

METHODS

Study Design and Patient Selection

Ten pediatric tertiary care centers participated in this prospective blinded study between April 2013 and March 2016. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each participating site. Informed consent was obtained prior to performing TFE, and patients were informed that test results would not be made available to the clinical team nor to the patient or family.

Target enrollment was calculated estimating a prevalence of 25% true obstruction in the study populationand a benchtop TFE sensitivity of 98%. A total of 85 true positives were needed to provide 80% power to reject that TFE sensitivity is < 90% if the true sensitivity ≥ 97.5%, with an alpha level of 0.05 (nQuery Advisor 6.01, Statistical Solutions, Cork, Ireland). Assuming an attrition rate of 10%, total sample size was 378 subjects, and the protocol rounded up to 400 consecutive series of patients between 3 and 29 yr of age presenting to the neurosurgery (NS) clinic or ED with symptoms sufficient to warrant routine diagnostic testing for potential shunt failure. Patients with multiple catheters, edema over the shunt, catheters not palpable over the clavicle, or where testing would interfere with clinical care, were excluded from the study.

Repeat patients were enrolled as incident cases of possible shunt malfunction if the interval separating presentations was greater than 1 mo, or if a surgical intervention happened in the interim. The 1-mo period had been identified as sufficient, on the basis of experience and prior investigations, to demonstrate any true worsening of clinical status if there had been a slowly progressive case of true shunt obstruction in instances of suspected malfunction.

For all CSF diversion surgeries, a favourable outcome (defined as an improvement on a scoring scale measured before and after surgery) was observed in 74% of patients (95% CI: 70–78%). Stratification by treatment type found positive outcomes in 75% of patients (95% CI: 70–78%) after VP shunting, 75% (95% CI: 70–80%) after VA shunting, 70% (95% CI: 52–83%) after LP shunting, and 69% (95% CI: 58–78%) after ETV (Fig. 3). The overlap between confidence intervals indicates a lack of difference between the pooled estimates.

### Noninvasive CSF shunt patency evaluation by superb microvascular imaging [^2b2c8c7e]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The evaluation of possible acute VP shunt dysfunction poses a significant challenge in clinical routine, despite technical advances in clinical imaging. Clinicians have to evaluate whether a VP shunt system is obstructed or not in symptomatic patients immediately to decide whether surgical revision of the VP shunt system is indicated or not, in order to avoid severe complications and potential fatality. Additionally, the localization of the obstruction site is a further diagnostic challenge in clinically symptomatic VP shunt patients.

Previous studies evaluated the role of Duplex US for the evaluation of shunt patency. Although this noninvasive approach is promising, it is of limited use in a daily clinical routine setting, as no standards are available regarding the regions of measurement and the possibly low flow rates with expectably significant variation in flow velocity. Up to now, there have been several proposals for the use of US in the evaluation of patency of CSF shunt systems. Hartman et al. proposed the use of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to evaluate the flow in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunt systems. However, the application of microbubbles in the venous system is a more invasive procedure and more costly in comparison to SMI. This technique requires an ultrasound machine being equipped with a specific software package for visualization of the contrast media. Further investigations are needed to compare the accuracy of different US techniques in the clinical setting. Furthermore, the role of US in the evaluation of VP shunt system dysfunction has been compared directly to the application of radioactively labeled substances, performing radionuclide imaging of ventriculoperitoneal shunt systems. However, radionuclide imaging exposes the patient to a significant radiation burden and requires nuclear medicine facilities, which are not readily available. In addition, nuclear medicine imaging requires more time than an US investigation. Furthermore, radionuclide imaging has a limited technical resolution as well as limited resolution regarding the specificity of the tracer distribution and the minimal detectable amount of radiation.

### Continuous-flow shunt for treatment of hydrocephalus due to lesions of the posterior fossa [^bbc4e2ec]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Object

Management of hydrocephalus caused by expansive lesions of the posterior fossa is complicated by two main drawbacks of shunt devices: sudden decompression and overdrainage. The ventriculoperitoneal (VP) continuous-flow (CF) shunt is characterized by a peritoneal catheter with an internal diameter of 0.51 mm that promotes continuous drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at its production rate. The authors have previously demonstrated in adult patients with hydrocephalus that sudden decompression and overdrainage are absent when this shunt is used; here they report the findings of a prospective study in which the goal was to test the performance of this shunt in patients with severe hydrocephalus due to lesions of the posterior fossa.

Methods

During a 5-year period, 103 patients with severe hydrocephalus caused by lesions of the posterior fossa were treated by placement of a VP shunt. In 53 of these patients (control group) a shunt and valve system was surgically implanted and in 50 patients a CF shunt was implanted. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 2 years after surgery. Shunt revision or change was necessary in 21 patients (40%) with conventional shunts and in four patients (8%) with the CF shunt (p < 0.003). Signs of overdrainage were observed in 18 patients (34%) in the control group, four of whom had ascending transtentorial herniation; this complication was not seen in patients with the CF shunt.

Conclusions

The CF shunt had a low rate of dysfunction and an absence of complications caused by overdrainage, which were frequently associated with the control shunts. The hydrodynamic properties of the CF shunt make it effective, even in severe cases of hydrocephalus caused by lesions of the posterior fossa.

### Diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive thermal evaluation of ventriculoperitoneal shunt flow in shunt malfunction: a prospective, multi-site, operator-blinded study [^b60ea43a]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

New to this study is a specific preimaging question about the likelihood, in the opinion of the first evaluating attending physician, of the patient progressing to surgery based on clinical gestalt. Attending physicians evaluated patients on presentation in advance of any diagnostic testing. Thermal testing showed a high sensitivity in patients deemed "unlikely" to require shunt revision surgery for their symptoms. In this cohort, TFE+MP correctly identified all 15 patients with obstruction seen at surgery. TFE+MP compared favorably as a rule-out test to imaging; however, risk stratification did not affect sensitivity and NPV for TFE only, which were already 100%.

There are significant gaps in the literature, and little to no evidence-based guidelines on the appropriate management of suspected shunt malfunction. In this setting, it is common to evaluate patients with suspected shunt malfunction with imaging and other more invasive testing. Entry into this study, too, required sufficient clinical suspicion that additional diagnostic evaluation, almost always radiographic testing, would be pursued. However, patients in the "unlikely" group who also had a flow-detected result on TFE had a very low probability of needing shunt revision surgery. This finding suggests that clinicians may consider the use of TFE to confirm their clinical impression and, therefore, spare patients imaging and other invasive testing. This would not only help reduce costs, but more importantly, in the case of computed tomography, reduce repeated exposure ionizing radiation.

### Long-term risk of shunt failure after brain tumor surgery [^4c67356d]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Recently, Hosainey et al. studied risk factors of early VP shunt failure after brain tumor surgery and found that patients with pre-existing, non-treated HC prior to craniotomy had a significantly shorter shunt-free period before definitive shunting compared to those without pre-craniotomy HC. Interestingly, in the current study, shunted patients who had HC prior to craniotomy had significantly longer shunt survival (Figs. 3 and 4). This indicates that in patients with distinct pathologies and profoundly deranged CSF dynamics in the early postoperative course after brain tumor surgery, early VP shunting may serve as "prophylaxis" against further CSF disturbances in the future and hence give prolonged shunt longevity due to early "normalized" hydrodynamics by shunting. The median shunt longevity was 457.5 days and 21.5 days for those with and without untreated HC pre-craniotomy, respectively (Figs. 3 and 4). In the literature, median shunt survival times range from 19 days in the short term up to 20.1 years in the long term. However, these studies were not limited to brain tumor patients and include a plethora of underlying conditions. Early changes to CSF dynamics as a result of overloading venous outflow and CSF pathway obstruction caused by disease burden have been described in the literature. Further neuronal cell death may also ensue if the disease process is left untreated. This requires early VP shunt insertion in order to normalize intracranial processes and avoid brain damage caused by a disrupted hydrocephalic state. Nonetheless, another plausible explanation may be that although some patients with pre- and post-craniotomy HC underwent shunting in the early postoperative course, they might have experienced spontaneous resolution of their hydrocephalic condition in the long-term period. Therefore, a "silent" shunt obstruction may have ensued, making them effectively shunt independent, wherefore a shunt obstruction would be unnoticed due to lack of signs and symptoms.

### Ventriculo-peritoneal shunting devices for hydrocephalus [^dbb9c805]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydrocephalus is a common neurological disorder, caused by a progressive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the intracranial space that can lead to increased intracranial pressure, enlargement of the ventricles (ventriculomegaly) and, consequently, to brain damage. Ventriculo-peritoneal shunt systems are the mainstay therapy for this condition, however there are different types of shunt systems.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and adverse effects of conventional and complex shunt devices for CSF diversion in people with hydrocephalus.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2020 Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2020); Embase (Elsevier) (1974 to February 2020); Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS) (1980 to February 2020); ClinicalTrials.gov; and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials of different types of ventriculo-peritoneal shunting devices for people with hydrocephalus. Primary outcomes included: treatment failure, adverse events and mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened studies for selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Due to the scarcity of data, we performed a Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) incorporating GRADE for the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six studies with 962 participants assessing the effects of standard valves compared to anti-syphon valves, other types of standard valves, self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves and external differential programmable pressure valves. All included studies started in a hospital setting and offered ambulatory follow-up. Most studies were conducted in infants or children with hydrocephalus from diverse causes. The certainty of the evidence for most comparisons was low to very low. 1. Standard valve versus anti-syphon valve Three studies with 296 randomised participants were included under this comparison. We are uncertain about the incidence of treatment failure in participants with standard valve and anti-syphon valves (very low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with standard valves (range 0 to 1.9%) and anti-syphon valves (range 0 to 2.9%) (low certainty of the evidence). Mortality may be similar in those with standard valves (0%) and anti-syphon valves (0.9%) (RD 0.01%, 95% CI -0.02% to 0.03%, low certainty of the evidence). Ventricular size and head circumference may be similar in those with standard valves and anti-syphon valves (low certainty of the evidence). None of the included studies reported the quality of life of participants. 2. Comparison between different types of standard valves Two studies with 174 randomised participants were included under this comparison. We are uncertain about the incidence of treatment failure in participants with different types of standard valves (early postoperative period: RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.27; at 12 months follow-up: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.92, very low certainty of the evidence). None of the included studies reported adverse events beyond those included under "treatment failure". We are uncertain about the effects of different types of standard valves on mortality (range 2% to 17%, very low certainty of the evidence). The included studies did not report the effects of these interventions on quality of life, ventricular size reduction or head circumference. 3. Standard valve versus self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valve One study with 229 randomised participants addressed this comparison. The incidence of treatment failure may be similar in those with standard valves (42.98%) and self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves (39.13%) (low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with standard valves (range 0 to 1.9%) and those with self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves (range 0 to 7.2%) (low certainty of the evidence). The included study reported no deaths in either group in the postoperative period. Beyond the early postoperative period, the authors stated that nine patients died (no disaggregated data by each type of intervention was available, low certainty of the evidence). The included studies did not report the effects of these interventions on quality of life, ventricular size reduction or head circumference. 4. External differential programmable pressure valve versus non-programmable valve One study with 377 randomised participants addressed this comparison. The incidence of treatment failure may be similar in those with programmable valves (52%) and non-programmable valves (52%) (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.24, low certainty of the evidence). The incidence of adverse events may be similar in those with programmable valves (6.19%) and non-programmable valves (6.01%) (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.15, low certainty of the evidence). The included study did not report the effect of these interventions on mortality, quality of life or head circumference. Ventricular size reduction may be similar in those with programmable valves and non-programmable valves (low certainty of the evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Standard shunt valves for hydrocephalus compared to anti-syphon or self-adjusting CSF flow-regulating valves may cause little to no difference on the main outcomes of this review, however we are very uncertain due to the low to very low certainty of evidence. Similarly, different types of standard valves and external differential programmable pressure valves versus non-programmable valves may be associated with similar outcomes. Nevertheless, this review did not include valves with the latest technology, for which we need high-quality randomised controlled trials focusing on patient-important outcomes including costs.

### Bradycardia without hypertension: is It a common clinical presentation of ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction in pediatric patients? [^ad06d791]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mechanical shunting of cerebrospinal fluid is an effective treatment for hydrocephalus. Some studies suggest that bradycardia without hypertension may also be observed in ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt malfunction; however, in our experience, this is not a common presenting sign.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether bradycardia without hypertension was a common sign in patients presenting to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with a VP shunt malfunction.

Methods

A retrospective observational study, from May 2006 to April 2015, which included a random sample of children admitted to the ED with clinical features suggestive of possible VP shunt malfunction. Control patients were defined as those who arrived at our ED with suspected VP shunt malfunction that was later ruled out on further workup.

Results

A total of 65 patients were included in this study. A significantly greater number of patients with a confirmed shunt pathology presented with vomiting (P = 0.01) and lethargy/apathy (P = 0.01). In the control group, a significantly greater number of patients presented with fever (P = 0.004) and seizures (P = 0.02). The number of patients presenting with bradycardia was not significantly different between the shunt pathology and control groups (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Bradycardia is not a common presentation in patients with VP shunt malfunction. Bradycardia is often recognized as a significant sign; however, it is one of the last presenting signs. Educating patients about the early signs must be considered as part of the treatment for VP shunt malfunction.

A 27-year-old female patient presented with chronic spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea. She had deformity and weakness on the left side since childhood. Imaging examinations demonstrated hemi-hydranencephaly with a nearly complete absence of the right cerebral hemisphere, which was replaced with a membranous sac filled with CSF. She was accompanied with a frontal midline tumor containing lipids. After ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the CSF rhinorrhea completely ceased and no direct repair of the CSF fistula was necessary. The ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedure changes the CSF flow dynamics and releases the intracranial pressure, which may be a simple and effective procedure for CSF rhinorrhea in hemi-hydranencephaly.

### Pituitary enlargement in patients with cerebrospinal fluid drainage due to ventricular shunt insertion: know the condition and do not mistake for adenoma [^1f4bc292]. Pituitary (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The U.S. American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing is well known for his meticulous research and treatment in the field of pituitary pathologies. It is less well known, that he also made important contributions to the treatment of congenital and childhood-acquired hydrocephalus, a condition known since antiquity and, until some decades ago, associated with a dismal prognosis. He was the first to note, that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was produced by the choroid plexus and proposed a variety of methods for temporary and permanent CSF drainage in his young hydrocephalic patients However, up to the 1950s, all developed shunt systems were hampered by a high failure rate, mostly due to insufficient implant materials. With the combined invention of artificial valves and silicone for shunt catheters around 1960, a worldwide therapeutic breakthrough in hydrocephalus treatment was achieved. Many patients with insufficient CSF drainage were all of a sudden enabled to survive this formally lethal condition and lead independent lives, albeit at the cost of a myriad of complications such as shunt infection or disconnection. Moreover, especially before the advent of programmable valves, many of the implanted shunt systems led to CSF overdrainage, a condition that can remain clinically asymptomatic or become apparent by orthostatic headache, pain or stiffness of the neck, nausea, diplopia, or, at worst, the development of subdural hematomas.

Working in a large neurosurgical department, we made the experience on several occasions that patients with hydrocephalus treated by ventriculo-peritoneal (v.-p.) shunting in childhood or young adulthood were referred years later to our department for neurosurgical evaluation of suspected pituitary pathology such as pituitary adenoma. However, we found this tentative diagnosis, usually raised first by the radiologists, who evaluated MRI images of these shunted patients, not to be accompanied by any other clinical, biochemical or radiological signs (apart from pituitary enlargement) supporting the diagnosis of pituitary neoplasia. We, therefore, assumed the diagnosis of adenoma or other pituitary pathology to be a diagnostic pitfall, supported by the observation that the pituitary gland has been shown to change in size in different states of CSF pressure. In order to look into this matter more systematically, we conducted a retrospective, explorative study of pituitary size and morphology in patients with hydrocephalus and radiological markers of high CSF drainage treated after birth or in childhood by v.-p. shunting.

Clinical Utility of TFE: Moving Toward Integration Into Standard of Care

Given these results and the better performance of neuro-imaging as a rule-in test for shunt obstruction, we believe that TFE, as with many diagnostic tests, is best used in conjunction with clinical judgment and other diagnostic data and not considered a standalone test for shunt malfunction. We can envision the integration of TFE into routine clinical evaluation of suspected shunt malfunction, as depicted in one possible decision tree shown in Figure 5. The results shown apply only to this retrospective dataset, but the outline of the decision tree suggests means by which TFE can enhance current clinical options.

FIGURE 5.
Clinical utility of TFE as a rule-out test. Given the demonstrated utility of TFE as a rule-out test, we can envision the integration of TFE into routine clinical evaluation of suspected shunt malfunction in conjunction with clinical judgment and other diagnostic data, as depicted in one possible decision tree shown here. The proposed algorithm was then applied post hoc to the pooled study sample. A complete dataset (TFE result, neuro-imaging result, and preimaging clinical impression) was available for 345 patients. The dark wedges represent the proportion of patients with confirmed obstruction at surgery, and the area of the circle represents the total number of patients at each respective node. Absolute numbers are given at the bottom of each circle. The numerical data shown in the figure apply only to this study population, but the outline of the decision tree suggests means by which TFE can enhance current clinical options. Terminus I: patients who are clinically classified as low risk for shunt malfunction and have flow detected by TFE may be strongly considered for discharge without imaging. Terminus IV: with greater caution, patients categorized by clinicians as high-risk preimaging but without enlarged ventricles may potentially be discharged without further invasive testing or inpatient observation following detection of flow on TFE and advised to follow-up in clinic. However, this determination would require further study to account for prior patterns of malfunction in such patients. Termini III and VI: conversely, patients who have enlarged ventricles on imaging have a high likelihood of requiring surgical shunt revision. Termini II and VI: these decision paths, in which flow is not detected by TFE in the absence of ventriculomegaly, are less clear, and additional large sampled studies will be required to further resolve these groups. INSET: if the decision pathway shown had been prospectively applied to the study group, imaging might have been avoided in "unlikely" patients with flow confirmed, and invasive testing and admissions for observation might have been avoided in a number of other patients with confirmed shunt flow. Validation with a prospective dataset will be needed to precisely determine the actual savings. These approaches to integrating TFE may be considered as possible improvements in care; however, any guidelines on the use of TFE in the clinical management of acute shunt malfunction would require further studies. As always, providers should employ any and all measures to make the best judgment about the functionality of a shunt.

### Cerebrospinal fluid flow and vorticity in hydrocephalus on 4-dimensional flow MRI [^26dc9ce3]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

In midlife hydrocephalus with marked ventricular enlargement, CSF dynamics often deviate from normal physiological patterns. In obstructive hydrocephalus, CSF stagnation typically results from aqueductal obstruction or stenosis. By contrast, communicating hydrocephalus is characterized by excessive oscillatory flow and turbulence within the third and 4Vs. These abnormal patterns — marked by strong vortices and rapid currents — may disrupt CSF circulation, impair hormonal signaling, and contribute to symptoms such as sleep disturbances and cognitive dysfunction. These observations suggest that failure of CSF dynamics plays a central role in the pathophysiology of both obstructive and communicating forms of midlife hydrocephalus. 4D flow MRI provides valuable insight into these dynamic abnormalities, complementing structural imaging and potentially explaining the variable outcomes of surgical interventions. Incorporating both preoperative and postoperative CSF flow assessments using 4D flow MRI into clinical practice may improve diagnostic precision and support the development of physiology-based, individualized treatment strategies.

Generalizability

Midlife hydrocephalus is distinguished by lateral ventricular enlargement without accompanying sulcal narrowing or periventricular compression, making diagnosis and management particularly challenging. Recognizing CSF dynamics failure — whether due to aqueductal blockage or excessive intraventricular turbulence — may help explain the condition's clinical heterogeneity. By integrating 4D flow MRI into the diagnostic workflow, clinicians can identify patient-specific flow disturbances and make more informed treatment decisions, such as choosing between ETV and VPS. This approach not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but may also lead to novel therapeutic strategies targeting CSF dynamics, representing a potential paradigm shift in the clinical management of hydrocephalus.

### Value of biomarkers in the prediction of shunt responsivity in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus [^84eb8614]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a neurodegenerative disorder of unclear etiology, characterized by Hakim's triad: cognitive impairment (dementia), gait disturbances, and urinary incontinence. These symptoms, which frequently occur in the elderly population, often overlap with the symptoms of"other"neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease and other (pre)senile dementias. Distinguishing NPH from"other"dementias is crucial in determining whether a patient could benefit from a surgical procedure — ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement or not. Extensive evaluation of responsiveness to VP shunting, which consisted of a stepwise cerebrospinal fluid diagnostic assessment including tap test (TT), lumbar infusion test (LIT), and evaluation of the effects of external lumbar drainage placement (ELD) is currently considered a gold standard. This procedure is highly invasive, time consuming and caries a risk of meningitis. Search for other less invasive approaches to predict patient responsiveness to ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement is therefore of a high clinical interest. Elevated levels of biochemical markers of neuronal damage have been associated with various central nervous system pathologies. The most studied markers include Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL), Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE), S100 protein, and tau protein, beta- amyloid Aβ1–40, Aβ42, GFAP and others.

Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) and Neurofilament Heavy Chain (NfH)

Neurofilaments (Nfs) are cylindrical proteins found exclusively in neuronal cytoplasm. Elevated levels of Nfs have been observed in response to axonal damage in the central nervous system (CNS) due to inflammatory, neurodegenerative, traumatic, or vascular causes, especially in older individuals. The concentration of NfL in cerebrospinal fluid is higher in patients with neurological disorders compared to healthy controls. Similar findings have been reported regarding NfL levels in serum. The role of NfL as a biomarker has been established in conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), atypical parkinsonian disorders (APD), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is a stronger correlation observed between NfL levels and ALS compared to NfH, although the role of NfH has not been as extensively established yet.

### In vivo characterization of biochemical variants of amyloid-β in subjects with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change [^1ca920f2]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates and intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (HP τ), i.e. Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change (ADNC), are the hallmark lesions of AD. During the progression of the disease, the proteins are seen in different brain regions following predisposed neuroanatomical regions, causing a progressive neurodegeneration, leading to cognitive impairment. During the last two decades, several groups have been able to detect Aβ and HP τ, by applying immunohistochemical (IHC) methods in stereotactic, cortical, brain biopsies from patients surgically treated for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH).

iNPH is a neurological disease in elderly, caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, which causes progressive hydrocephalus and presents with gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment. Currently, the only treatment strategy implemented in patients with iNPH is a surgical ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (VPS) insertion, which can alleviate the symptoms by normalizing the CSF flow. During the VPS surgery, one tip of the shunt is placed into the frontal horn of the right ventricle and the other in the peritoneal cavity. Both catheters are connected to a shunt valve controlling the CSF pressure. While preparing the shunt channel, some neurosurgeons have taken a diagnostic brain biopsy from the area of the shunt channel, i.e. right frontal lobe. Detection of ADNC by applying IHC method in these samples, from the frontal cortex, suggests at least low to intermediate level of ADNC in the brain, according to international consensus criteria. The presence of ADNC, associated with poor shunt response, has been reported to indicate poorer prognosis and eventual progression to full blown AD. When a postmortem (PM) analysis has been carried out on brains obtained from subjects with a clinical diagnosis of iNPH, it has been observed that a substantial number of subjects display varying degrees of ADNC. The early signs of neurodegeneration, especially synaptic loss, seen in AD, were also observed in a cohort of subjects with iNPH. All of the above implies that iNPH seems to be a reliable model of AD.

### The role of shuntography in diagnosis of mechanic complications after implantation of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a retrospective clinical evaluation [^b4b257e7]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This retrospective cohort study included a total of 49 patients with iNPH who underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting in an urban center of maximum care between 2000 and 2020. All patients showed secondary clinical worsening suspicious of mechanical complications of the VPS. Clinical symptoms of the patients, change of ventricular width on follow-up cranial imaging, and obstruction or disconnection of the VPS documented by shuntography were analyzed. The need for revision operations or for changes of the valve-pressure settings was also recorded (Fig. 1). Kiefer score was used as a good clinical outcome parameter and was recorded before shuntography and subsequent specific treatment.

### Noninvasive CSF shunt patency evaluation by superb microvascular imaging [^1e729c7b]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Occlusion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt system is a potentially life-threatening complication in patients suffering from hydrocephalus. However, there is no imaging established as standard approach in this acute setting. In the present study, we evaluate the use of superb microvascular imaging for investigation of the patency of ventriculoperitoneal shunt systems. Simulation of low flow rates of cerebrospinal fluid through a small diameter CSF shunt system was performed in a dedicated phantom in order to proof the principle of superb microvascular imaging (SMI) being feasible for the measurement of slow CSF flow through the dedicated CSF shunt system. SMI is able to detect low flow rates in CSF shunt systems effectively and fast. Visualization of a Duplex ultrasound flow and Doppler wave pattern in the VP shunt system after the reservoir has been pressed confirms patency. SMI is an effective method for evaluating CSF shunt patency and diagnosing shunt obstruction. This bears the potential to facilitate evaluation of clinically symptomatic VP shunt patients in an acute setting. Further evaluation of ultrasound flow patterns is granted.

### Diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive thermal evaluation of ventriculoperitoneal shunt flow in shunt malfunction: a prospective, multi-site, operator-blinded study [^093072ba]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our earlier report, which did not involve operator blinding, pointed to the utility of thermal detection as a "rule-out" test for obstructive shunt malfunction. It also raised several questions, including replicability and generalizability of the findings in a blinded, emergent setting. Using a large, multi-site, prospective, operator-blinded clinical study design, we tested acutely symptomatic pediatric and adolescent patients who presented to the ED and neurosurgical clinic, and who concurrently received routine diagnostic evaluation. The present study confirms and extends the results of the single center study: thermal detection of shunt flow may be an effective confirmatory test to support an initial clinical impression of a functioning shunt in the management of chronically shunted patients, and the results are generalizable to a broader population of patients being evaluated at pediatric EDs.

The prediction of non-progression to surgery when TFE confirms flow, either with or without the micropumper, was the most robust and compelling finding in this study. These results compare favorably to those for neuro-imaging, both in the same patients and in other studies, and support our earlier findings that the true utility of TFE may lie in correctly identifying patients presenting with suspected shunt malfunction symptoms who do not require immediate surgical intervention.

The results from TFE+MP and TFE-only (Figure 2 A and 2B) indicate that there is no advantage to using the micropumper in an emergent clinical setting. In fact, TFE+MP showed flow in seven cases in which the shunts were significantly occluded at the time of surgery. Perhaps micropumper action forces flow across an obstruction that would otherwise prevent passage of sufficient CSF under physiological conditions. For purposes of screening patients for shunt obstruction in emergent settings, it is therefore reasonable to recommend performing TFE with the double ice application (TFE only) and without the micropumper.

### Subcutaneously obstructed ventriculoperitoneal shuntogram [^e7c8b710]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A 65-year-old man presented with headache, altered mental status, and somnolence. The patient had a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt revised a month earlier. A CT of the head was performed, which demonstrated interval development of hydrocephalus compared with the prior examination done at the time of the shunt revision. Further evaluation of the VP shunt dynamics was obtained through a radionuclide shuntogram using 99mTcO4. The shuntogram demonstrated passage of the radiotracer down the VP shunt tubing. This case illustrates the utility of radionuclide shuntogram in demonstrating an unusual cause of hydrocephalus after VP shunt placement.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion for the treatment of refractory perilymphatic fistula [^b0aa2dbf]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Object

The goal of this study was to provide preliminary data regarding clinical and functional outcome, including postoperative morbidity, related to ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt insertion for refractory perilymphatic fistula.

Methods

The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of seven consecutive patients who had undergone VP shunt insertion for medically and surgically refractory perilymphatic fistula between 1996 and 2004. Patients were also contacted by telephone and asked to assess retrospectively their symptomatic improvement, changes in functional status, and changes in work status following shunt placement. Preoperative and postoperative functional statuses were assessed using a standardized instrument. In each patient, preoperative opening pressure was measured via lumbar puncture. Pressures ranged from 160 to 300 mm H₂O, with a mean of 241 mm H₂O. All patients reported significant improvement in symptom severity following surgery. Two patients reported complete resolution of symptoms. Three patients were able to resume full-time work. Clinically significant improvement in functional status was noted in six of seven patients. All patients would recommend the procedure to others in a similar situation.

Conclusions

Data in this study suggest that some patients with disabling vertigo, tinnitus, and headache due to perilymphatic fistula, whose conventional medical and surgical therapies have failed to produce a cure, benefit from VP shunt insertion. The authors hypothesize that VP shunt placement blunts intracranial pressure increases, which would cause secondary elevations in perilymphatic fluid pressure. Shunt insertion reduces perilymph leakage into the middle ear and may permit closure of the fistula.

### The effectiveness of various CSF diversion surgeries in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d0b5a910]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The sustained improvement in clinical symptoms over extended follow-up periods in this study was somewhat unexpected, given previous findings of a diminishing long-term effect of CSF diversion surgery. This sustainment may be due to most long-term studies being conducted in large-volume tertiary centres with stringent follow-up protocols that could lead to favourable surgical outcomes. However, up to 20% of patients experience secondary deterioration several years after initial improvement, known as 'late shunt non-responders'. This phenomenon is likely due to shunt dysfunction and the progression of neurodegenerative disease, which remains poorly described. The advancement and wider use of adjustable shunt valves have allowed for the 'titration' of optimal CSF flow, addressing secondary deterioration in some individuals.

Our stratified results reveal similar efficacy across different CSF diversion surgeries, with effectiveness generally around 69–75% and overlapping confidence intervals. This was based on improvement proportion, with insufficient head-to-head studies for direct comparisons. Since normal-pressure hydrocephalus was first described in 1965, guidelines have advocated for CSF shunting but no specific surgical procedure. Nevertheless, VP shunt placement is the most common iNPH treatment modality worldwide.LP shunts, historically less favoured due to high failure rates and CSF overdrainage, are currently more common in Japan and other regions to minimise the risk of intracranial complications. Several studies previously reported the safety and non-inferior effectiveness of LP shunts compared to VP shunts, and our analysis supports the notion that we cannot definitively suggest one over the other with similar outcomes observed. Although, regional biases do exist, with most LP studies originating from East Asia and VP studies conducted in Europe or North America. Different diagnostic thresholds are present, with European studies tending to have a lower average age of iNPH patients. Additionally, the higher prevalence of obesity and cardiovascular disease comorbidities in Europe and North America impacts shunt success as well as iNPH disease prognosis.VA shunts, that place the distal catheter in the right cardiac atrium, can be an effective alternative and reduce operative time but are generally only considered when VP shunting is not feasible, such as in patients with abdominal adhesions. Neurosurgeons tend to avoid VA shunts based on reports of severe haematological and cardiopulmonary complications, although these are largely based on paediatric studies with limited adult data. A 2017 study by Hung et al. found that among iNPH patients, VA shunts significantly reduced shunt obstruction and surgery revisions compared to VP shunts, with no cardiopulmonary complications observed. However, more definitive, updated studies are needed to confirm this complication profile. Hence, the ultimate choice of which shunt should be chosen depends on local surgical expertise and patient characteristics until definitive evidence emerges.

### Transient ventriculomegaly in a child presenting with hypernatremia. case report [^b9bfde8d]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

The authors present the case of a 3-year-old girl with a history of myelomeningocele repair, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement for hydrocephalus, and shaken baby syndrome who presented in a hypernatremic state as a result of dehydration. At the time of presentation, the patient had experienced a 1-week-long history of diarrhea associated with antibiotic agents used to treat a coexisting pyelonephritis. On admission, the patient exhibited signs and symptoms of dehydration and was discovered to have profound hypernatremia with a serum sodium level of 180 mmol/L. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed ventricular enlargement compared with previous imaging findings. A shunt tap revealed intracranial hypotension with good proximal flow. The child was treated for her hypernatremic state, and her neurological condition returned to baseline level. Subsequent CT scans of the head demonstrated a return of the ventricular system to its premorbid size. On the basis of the initial radiographic presentation and subsequent evaluation, the authors hypothesize that the ventricular enlargement was a result of hypernatremia. The signs and symptoms were similar to those found in patients with a VP shunt obstruction; however, a shunt tap revealed intracranial hypotension and excellent proximal flow. To the authors' knowledge, there has not been a radiographically documented case of reversible ventricular enlargement associated with hypernatremia.

### Headache and focal neurologic deficits… [^37796f28]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 A 37-year-old woman presented with progressively worsening headache. She had no headache history, and initial evaluation revealed hydrocephalus of unclear etiology. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed with improvement. However, her headache returned and she developed neurologic deficits. Imaging studies demonstrated multiple cystic lesions in the posterior fossa. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid studies were unrevealing and a biopsy of the cystic lesions was performed. The clinical approach, differential diagnosis, and neuropathological findings are discussed. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed with clinical resolution of her symptoms and radiographic improvement. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis at the time of the procedure revealed no cells, normal protein and glucose levels, and negative bacterial cultures. The patient's symptoms resolved until 6 months later, when she developed an occasional headache. She reported no visual symptoms, nausea, or vomiting.

Her headache was holocephalic, without positional effects, and easily relieved with ibuprofen. A noncontrast head CT revealed no intracranial pathology, stably decompressed ventricles, and appropriate VP shunt placement. There was mass effect with marked compression of the inferior cerebellum and vermis, fourth ventricle, medulla, and upper cervical cord. The cystic fluid was of the same signal intensity as CSF. There was no evidence of diffusion restriction. One cyst showed a T2-isointense internal nodular structure. This woman's presentation with new-onset daily headache that worsened with recumbency and was associated with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and gait impairment suggests increased intracranial pressure. The temporal course of the illness implies a subacute process.

Her initial neuroimaging revealed hydrocephalus with panventricular enlargement without any evidence of an obstructing mass lesion, suggesting a process affecting the subarachnoid spaces or CSF absorptive surfaces. Despite VP shunt placement, her headaches progressively worsened. The onset of associated nuchal rigidity suggests meningeal irritation. She also developed diplopia, dysarthria, bifacial weakness, and a depressed level of consciousness, suggesting dysfunction at the level of the pons including the facial nuclei and possibly the reticular activating system. Dual expression of CK7 and CK20 is consistent with a metastatic adenocarcinoma arising from the upper gastrointestinal tract or pancreaticobiliary system. 11.

### The role of shuntography in diagnosis of mechanic complications after implantation of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a retrospective clinical evaluation [^01b42f36]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Diagnosing a shunt malfunctions is a challenge. The incidences of shunt obstructions after implantations of a VPS increase over time. In contrast to previous studies, the present study identified obstruction of the VPS as a major mechanical complication in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus. Subclinical infections of the CNS and as a result increased protein contents with higher viscosity might be a reason for obstruction of the shunts. Other causes could be material failures such as defective valves and subclinical minor peritoneal inflammations with occlusion of the distal catheter. All the more it was important to establish an elegant, minimally invasive, and safe method for diagnosing shunt dysfunctions in this patient population. In an experienced team of neurosurgeons and radiologists, shuntographies take only about 15 min in clinical practice. The low infection rate and the straight-forward information in cases of obstructed or disconnected VPS profile speak in favor of contrast-enhanced shuntography. The high level of reliability of contrast-enhanced shuntography suggests that this simple method provides clinically reliable information about the patency of shunt systems. Neurosurgical follow-up is essential to determine if and why a patient's clinical condition deteriorates after shunt placement in patients with iNPH. According to the present study in almost every fourth patient a pathological shuntogram with signs of a mechanical complication can be anticipated. This result is of great importance for strict follow-up and management of these patients who always need surgical therapy. So far contrast-enhanced shuntography is standard of care in every neurosurgical clinic. Doctors might avoid to use this method because of their lack of experience. If mechanical shunt dysfunction is suspected, the VPS can be visualized on plain radiographs to exclude disconnections; obstructions can therefore not be detected. The most common consequence of such diagnostics is the replacement of the complete VPS. Shuntography also allows selective visualization of the location of a potential mechanical problem in the path of the VPS. This is a major advantage of this diagnostic procedure, since it is not always necessary to replace an entire VPS system, but only its "defective" part. The present work showed that about 60% of the patients would be exposed to unnecessary revision surgeries and associated complications. Other studies evaluating unnecessarily revised VPS systems do not exist at this time. On average shunt infections occur in up to 8% of cases. Shunt infections are always a definitive reason for revision surgery. However, literature also reports infection rates of up to 12%, especially in combination of shunt exposure and intraoperative functional testing of the shunt in cases of suspected mechanical complications. The latter approach is a widely used method. Contrast-enhanced shuntography however is a simple and effective method with a low-infection rate (2% of cases) to assess the patency of VPS in patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus and suspected mechanical complications. Therefore, it seems advisable to carry out a contrast agent-assisted shuntography before any revision surgery in order to localize mechanical problems more accurately and thus reduce the duration of revision surgeries and postoperative infection rates. In contrast to an alternative method of using radionuclides for shuntography, contrast-enhanced shunt imaging shows better spatial–temporal resolution, allowing focused local surgical revision. In our collective clinical outcome of those patients after revision surgery due to a pathological shuntogram and those patients after conservative therapy due to an inconspicuous shuntogram showed no significant difference. On the one hand, this could be attributed to the relatively small number of cases for sufficient statistical evaluation. On the other hand, surgical elimination of the obstruction in the shunt system is only one side of the coin. Complementary treatment of patients postoperatively (physiotherapy, educational measures, supportive medication) as well as close neurosurgical follow-up is probably just as important and the fundaments during exclusively conservative therapies in patients with persisting or recurrent symptoms after VPS placement.

### Beneficial effect of siphoning in treatment of adult hydrocephalus… [^302e50a1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

After determination of a patent VP shunt and a low normal ICP, each patient was treated using a modified protocol of Pang and Altschuler. 24 First, a long-tunneled ventriculostomy was performed. The existing shunt was either removed or disconnected. In patient 4, the pressure-volume index25 was measured in the operating room. A small, unilateral subdural effusion formed during treatment in patient 2, as recognized by the CT imaging protocol, which prompted the placement of a subdural catheter connected distal to the valve at the time of VP shunt placement. This subdural effusion immediately disappeared after surgery. Our experience with 4 patients suggests that reduction in ventricular size by induced ventricular hypotension was a necessary and effective treatment for their condition. This cause-and-effect relationship suggests that the effectiveness of standard VP shunts in some patients with adult hydrocephalus is derived from the siphoning effect of CSF drainage.

The effect of shunt siphoning has been ignored, concentrating instead on reducing elevated ICP. Several studies17-19 documented that, in patients harboring standard differential pressure valve shunts, intracranial hypotension is encountered in every case once the patient is placed in an upright position. Because the hydrostatic pressure gradient is large compared with valve opening pressures, significant negative ventricular pressures are encountered, even with the use of high-pressure valves. we speculate that treatment failure in these patients by standard shunting methods can occur for at least 2 reasons. The common feature in these patients is that a sufficiently negative ventricular pressure is not reached or is not present for an adequate duration to produce a reduction in ventricular size. As demonstrated by patients 2 and 4, sustained negative pressures lower than −28 cm H₂O were necessary to achieve a reduction in ventricular size.

Such pressures are uncommonly achieved in patients with a VP shunt17-19, 28. Based on known postural changes of ICP after placement of a differential pressure valve VP shunt, 17 it is clear that a sustained intracranial hypotension state cannot be maintained after discharge from the hospital. It is then reasonable to question why a "normalized" ventricular size state continued during delayed follow-up. We hypothesize that this is caused by a change in ventricular compliance that accompanies the reduction in ventricular size. Results of experimental studies24, 31, 32.

### Diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive thermal evaluation of ventriculoperitoneal shunt flow in shunt malfunction: a prospective, multi-site, operator-blinded study [^10475410]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Current diagnostic techniques used for evaluating ventriculoperitoneal shunt patency and function rely on either repeated exposure to ionizing radiationor invasive procedures such as shunt taps, radionuclide studies, and lumbar punctures. Unfortunately, these techniques have limited diagnostic accuracy in the emergency department (ED) setting and often lead to hospital admissions for observation. It is well documented that true shunt failures often occur in the absence of ventriculomegalyand, conversely, that asymptomatic ventriculomegaly may require no intervention. Given that clinical manifestations of shunt obstruction are often non-specific, neurosurgeons sometimes disagree about the need for operative intervention. There is a need for accurate non-invasive methods for assessing shunt function to decrease unnecessary ED resource utilization, procedures, and hospitalizations, as well as to augment clinical decision-making in the management of chronically shunted patients.

ShuntCheck III® (NeuroDx Development, Yardley, Pennsylvania) is an FDA-approved thermal flow evaluation (TFE) system used to detect and potentially quantify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in shunts. Open-label studies have reported that TFE accurately predicts CSF flow in shunts. A recent paper demonstrated that a modified TFE protocol with 2 ice-pack applications and a micropumper (MP) predicts non-progression to shunt revision surgery with a high percentage of patients in whom flow was detected not having shunt malfunctionand may therefore hold significant clinical value as a rule-out test. However, it was unclear if diagnostic accuracy was improved by the micropumper or the second ice application, whether TFE could reliably be used in an emergent, high-pressure clinical setting, and whether clinical risk stratification of the study population prior to TFE could improve the diagnostic performance. Additionally, the study was unblinded and lacked an outcome measure that would not be influenced by TFE or other testing. To replicate prior findings in a larger population, we therefore performed a multicenter, blinded, prospective study in acutely symptomatic patients who received routine diagnostic evaluation for shunt malfunction. In this study, we compare the accuracy of 2 TFE protocols to that of neuro-imaging in identifying surgically confirmed obstruction within 7 d of presentation and hypothesize that both are non-inferior to neuro-imaging.

### Innovative application of point of care ultrasound in assessing ventriculo-peritoneal shunt patency [^1a17e9d4]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

CSF diversion is the standard treatment for patients with hydrocephalus. The most common method is the ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt, which carries the risk of complications such as obstruction. If not diagnosed promptly, these complications can be fatal and cause irreversible damage. Current diagnostic methods for shunt malfunction, including MRI and CT scans, visualize the ventricles' morphology to indirectly assess shunt patency. Radionuclide shunt patency studies, which directly assess shunt function, are costly, invasive, and time-consuming. -

Ultrasound can be used as a diagnostic tool to evaluate the functioning of a VP shunt postplacement, offering several advantages over MRI, CT, and radionuclide studies. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been shown to be cost-effective, noninvasive, therapeutically valuable, and highly reliable diagnostically. A study by Pokhrel et aldemonstrated the use of POCUS for the rapid diagnosis and early management of VP shunt functionality in 17 patients.

Using POCUS, we can study the flow of CSF through the shunt tube on compressing the reservoir, both proximal and distal to the reservoir, and measure the free fluid (CSF) in the pelvis. An increase in optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) can help diagnose raised intracranial pressure (ICP), which could indicate shunt obstruction. This novel concept led us to conduct a study to analyze the efficacy of POCUS in assessing VP shunt patency. We developed a standardized protocol for evaluating VP shunt patency and compared it with standard imaging modalities. If found reliable, this study could establish POCUS as a stand-alone test for determining shunt patency in patients who have undergone VP shunt placement.

### Ventriculoatrial shunt versus ventriculoperitoneal shunt: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^dd61bfc2]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is usually the primary choice for cerebrospinal fluid shunting for most neurosurgeons, while ventriculoatrial shunt (VAS) is a second-line procedure because of historical complications. Remarkably, there is no robust evidence claiming the superiority of VPS over VAS. Thus, we aimed to compare both procedures through a meta-analysis.

Methods

Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, the authors systematically searched the literature for articles comparing VAS with VPS. The included articles had to detail one of the following outcomes: revisions, infections, shunt-related mortality, or complications. In addition, the cohort for each shunt model had to encompass more than 4 patients.

Results

Of 1872 articles, 16 met our criteria, involving 4304 patients, with 1619 undergoing VAS and 2685 receiving VPS placement. Analysis of revision surgeries showed no significant difference between VAS and VPS (risk ratio [RR] = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.9–1.34; I² = 84%, random effects). Regarding infections, the analysis also found no significant difference between the groups (RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.36–1.25; I² = 74%, random effects). There was no statistically significant disparity between both methods concerning shunt-related deaths (RR = 2.11, 95% CI: 0.68–6.60; I² = 56%, random effects). Included studies after 2000 showed no VAS led to cardiopulmonary complications, and only 1 shunt-related death could be identified.

Conclusion

Both methods show no significant differences in procedure revisions, infections, and shunt-related mortality. The literature is outdated, research in adults is lacking, and future randomized studies are crucial to understand the profile of VAS when comparing it with VPS. The final decision on which distal site for cerebrospinal shunting to use should be based on the patient's characteristics and the surgeon's expertise.

### How should we treat long-standing overt ventriculomegaly in adults (LOVA)? A retrospective cohort study [^2f095bf9]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Surgical success rates and follow-up

82.4% of patients experienced a clinical improvement after surgery (Table 2). This was a permanent improvement in 82.9% (n = 63), and transient in 17.1% (n = 13, symptom benefit lasting for a mean of 23.7 months, with symptoms returning to pre-surgery levels). There was no difference in the success rates for both ETV and VP shunt groups (82.1% vs 85.7%, p = 0.812) (Fig. 3).

Table 2
Treatment outcomes for patients undergoing surgical intervention

ETV endoscopic third ventriculostomy, VPS ventriculoperitoneal shunt

ETV resulted in a clinical improvement and reduction in ventricular size in 81.3% of cases, and clinical improvement with no reduction in ventricular size in 82.1% of cases (Fig. 3). At 1-year post follow-up, 75.0% (n = 63) had symptom resolution after an ETV, and 72.6% (n = 61) of ETV treated patients had symptom resolution at last follow-up.

Twenty-two patients (24.2%) had symptom recurrence after surgery. Twenty of these patients went onto have repeat surgery, with fourteen patients being treated with VP shunt (two replacing a previous VPS, twelve after unsuccessful ETV), and six with an ETV (repeat ETV in four patients, after failed VPS in two patients). Of these, fifteen improved (75.0%). The improvement seen after repeat surgery was similar in the ETV group compared to the VPS group (100% vs 57.1%, Fischer's exact test = 0.055). Two patients had a third surgery — one patient had two unsuccessful VP shunts that were later converted to a ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt, and one patient had a VP shunt that required revision due to valve blockage, followed by symptom recurrence, then an ETV, with subsequent symptom resolution. No patients were lost to follow-up, and 41.7% (n = 74) were discharged from routine monitoring by the end of the study period.

### Predictors of ventriculoperitoneal shunt pathology [^e1a95ecf]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt pathology remains a dilemma in patients with nonspecific constitutional signs and symptoms. Eosinophilia has been described in association with shunt infection and malfunction. Our purpose was to further define the relationship of eosinophilia and shunt pathology and to determine other predictors of VP shunt infection and malfunction.

Methods

Records of all patients admitted with a suspected VP shunt infection or malfunction were reviewed. The following data were abstracted: age; reason for and age at initial shunt placement; number of revisions; date of last revision; history of fever or vomiting; ventricular fluid cell count; differential and culture; complete blood count and differential; need for shunt revision or replacement; and use of antibiotics. After exclusion of patients admitted for initial shunt placement, the remainder were divided into three groups: those with shunt infection; those with shunt malfunction; and those without documented infection or malfunction.

Results

Of 12 patients with shunt infection and 69 with shunt malfunction, 2 and 11, respectively, had eosinophilia defined as ≥ 5%. The presence of eosinophilia had a 96% positive predictive value for shunt pathology and raised the pretest probability of pathology from 84% to a post test probability of 96%. The combination of fever history and ventricular fluid neutrophils > 10% had a 99% specificity for shunt infection, had a 93 and 95% positive and negative predictive value, respectively, and raised the pretest probability of infection from 12% to a posttest probability of 92%.

Conclusions

In patients suspected of having a VP shunt malfunction, the presence of ≥ 5% eosinophils in the ventricular fluid indicates shunt pathology. The combination of fever and ventricular fluid neutrophils > 10% is predictive of shunt infection.

### Magnetic resonance imaging flow void changes after cerebrospinal fluid shunt in post-traumatic hydrocephalus: clinical correlations and outcome [^050c2511]. Neurosurgical Review (2006). Low credibility.

The assessment of the flow-void in the cerebral aqueduct of patients with post-traumatic hydrocephalus on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation could concur the right diagnosis and have a prognostic value. We analysed prospectively 28 patients after a severe head injury (GCS ≤ 8), with radiological or clinical suspicion of post-traumatic hydrocephalus and a fast flow-void signal in the cerebral acqueduct on T2-weighted and proton density MRI. Twenty-two patients were shunted (n = 19) or revised (n = 3). Six patients were followed-up without surgery. Twenty out of 22 shunted patients (91%) showed variable reduction of the fast flow-void. Eighteen of the operated patients (82%) presented a significant clinical improvement at 6-month follow-up. All patients (n = 2) who had no change of the fast flow-void after surgery did not clinically improve. The six non-shunted patients did not present any clinical or radiological improvement. In head-injured patients, fast flow-void in the cerebral aqueduct is diagnostic for post-traumatic hydrocephalus and its reduction after ventriculo-peritoneal shunt is correlated with a neurological improvement. In already shunted patients, a persistent fast flow-void is associated with a lack of or very slow clinical improvement and it should be considered indicative of under-drainage.

### Slit ventricle syndrome [^e6232d22]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Slit ventricle syndrome (SVS) is a complication after ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) or cystoperitoneal shunt(CPS), mostly due to excessive drainage of cerebrospinal. The disease is most often seen in children and has a complex pathogenesis. Clinical manifestations are mainly intermittent headache, slow refilling of the shunt reservoir, and slit-like ventricles on imaging. Surgery is the main treatment. We present a 22-year-old female patient with a previous 14-year history of CPS. The patient recently presented with typical symptoms but her ventricular morphology was normal. We performed VPS after diagnosis of SVS. After the surgery, the patient's symptoms improved and her condition was stable.

### In vitro testing of explanted shunt valves in hydrocephalic patients with suspected valve malfunction [^ec615417]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Implantation of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (VPS) is the most widely used neurosurgical procedure to treat patients with hydrocephalus. However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt failure, predominantly from infection and shunt catheter obstruction, remains a persistent problem. Reported five-year shunt survival rates for first-time shunt implantations are as low as 53.1%. Up to 25% of patients suffering from idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) develop primary deterioration after VPS implantation within the first year. Furthermore, about 20% of patients develop secondary deterioration following initial improvement after VPS implantation within two to four years. Gutowski et al. proposed a sophisticated algorithm for shunt management to reduce the rate of secondary deterioration from 20 to 15%. However, about 60% of these patients remained secondary non-responders, although in 27% a shunt revision was performed. If revision surgery is required for reasons other than infection, neuroimaging is considered helpful in identifying the exact location of a presumed obstruction or leakage along the shunt system. Besides head computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess ventricle size and catheter placement, shunt series are performed to search for breaks, disconnections, or catheter migration. When this standard work-up fails to show structural explanation for a clinically suspected shunt malfunction, contrast-enhanced shunt series ("shuntography") may be used as an adjunct diagnostic procedure. In rare cases, however, even extended neuroimaging does not yield a cause for shunt malfunction in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Then, the valve itself as the origin of the shunt malfunction may come to the fore. The aim of our study was to clarify whether in patients requiring shunt revision, without a final yield in prior diagnostics, the valve itself might contribute to the malfunction of the shunt system or not.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction presenting with pleuritic chest pain [^0bb8d817]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts are widely used for treating hydrocephalus. These devices are prone to malfunction with up to 70% requiring revision. Shunt infection and obstruction comprise the majority of malfunctions and usually present dramatically. However, rare presentations occur.

Methods/Results

We report a rare case of VP shunt malfunction presenting with pleuritic chest pain. A 13-year-old girl with a VP shunt placed at birth for congenital hydrocephalus presented on multiple occasions with pleuritic chest pain, cough, and fever. She was diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection and discharged home. She returned with respiratory compromise, and chest x-ray depicted the shunt catheter in the pleural space with an associated pleural effusion and infiltrate. The patient fully recovered with intravenous antibiotics, thoracentesis, and placement of a new shunt system.

Conclusions

VP shunt malfunction usually presents with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and/or infection. However, unusual presentations of malfunction may occur with signs and symptoms which appear unrelated to the shunt. Thus, all patients with VP shunts warrant a comprehensive evaluation.

### Cerebral microcirculation mapped by echo particle tracking velocimetry quantifies the intracranial pressure and detects ischemia [^5943678e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hydrocephalus involves abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation in the brain ventricles. Affecting 1.1‰ of infants, it is the leading cause for brain surgery in newborns and results in long-term neurologic disabilities in up to 78% of patients. Intracranial hypertension and ventriculomegaly are major complications of hydrocephalus, which could lead to compromised cerebral blood flow (CBF), brain ischemia, inflammation, secondary neurovascular damage, and brain herniation. Aimed at alleviating the elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), the most common treatment consists of CSF diversion to another anatomical location outside of the central nervous system via an invasive ventricular shunt. The clinical decision for this surgical intervention relies primarily on computed tomography (CT) depicting ventriculomegaly following clinical symptomatology. Unfortunately, by the time of radiographic diagnosis of ventriculomegaly, the ICP is often elevated significantly, and the brain tissue is at risk of ischemia and irreversible brain damage. Compounding the difficulty of early diagnosis and intervention, medical or surgical, is the fact that some patients have an elevated ICP without ventricular enlargement –. Therefore, a brain CT is often not sensitive enough to detect an elevated ICP and ongoing ischemia, placing the infant at risk for permanent brain damage. Hence, there is a dire need for other techniques that could guide timely treatment.

### Evaluation of the ventriculocholecystic shunt-an overview of present practice in adult and pediatric hydrocephalus [^46e583ba]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

In the context of hydrocephalus, there are a multitude of therapeutic options that can be explored in order to improve patient outcomes. Although the peritoneum is the current elected clinical solution, various receptacles have been utilized when experiencing contraindications. Along with the ventriculoatrial or ventriculopleural, the ventriculocholecystic shunt was also described as an alternative. In order to make a decision on a place for drainage, the surgeon must be knowledgeable on details from modern literature. The main target of this review was to summarize the currently available information on this topic and assess the status of the gallbladder as a viable option for cerebrospinal fluid diversion.

### Diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive thermal evaluation of ventriculoperitoneal shunt flow in shunt malfunction: a prospective, multi-site, operator-blinded study [^ff206291]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Thermal flow evaluation (TFE) is a non-invasive method to assess ventriculoperitoneal shunt function. Flow detected by TFE is a negative predictor of the need for revision surgery. Further optimization of testing protocols, evaluation in multiple centers, and integration with clinical and imaging impressions prompted the current study.

OBJECTIVE

To compare the diagnostic accuracy of 2 TFE protocols, with micropumper (TFE+MP) or without (TFE-only), to neuro-imaging in patients emergently presenting with symptoms concerning for shunt malfunction.

METHODS

We performed a prospective multicenter operator-blinded trial of a consecutive series of patients who underwent evaluation for shunt malfunction. TFE was performed, and preimaging clinician impressions and imaging results were recorded. The primary outcome was shunt obstruction requiring neurosurgical revision within 7 d. Non-inferiority of the sensitivity of TFE vs neuro-imaging for detecting shunt obstruction was tested using a prospectively determined a priori margin of −2.5%.

RESULTS

We enrolled 406 patients at 10 centers. Of these, 68/348 (20%) evaluated with TFE+MP and 30/215 (14%) with TFE-only had shunt obstruction. The sensitivity for detecting obstruction was 100% (95% CI: 88%-100%) for TFE-only, 90% (95% CI: 80%-96%) for TFE+MP, 76% (95% CI: 65%-86%) for imaging in TFE+MP cohort, and 77% (95% CI: 58%-90%) for imaging in the TFE-only cohort. Difference in sensitivities between TFE methods and imaging did not exceed the non-inferiority margin.

CONCLUSION

TFE is non-inferior to imaging in ruling out shunt malfunction and may help avoid imaging and other steps. For this purpose, TFE only is favored over TFE+MP.

### Cerebrospinal fluid flow and vorticity in hydrocephalus on 4-dimensional flow MRI [^73dbbbe7]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

The pathophysiology of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by cerebral aqueduct obstruction or stenosis, as well as communicating hydrocephalus with oscillating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and vortices in the third ventricle (3V), remains unclear. In addition, clear criteria for selecting between ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) and endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) have yet to be established. This study aimed to investigate the utility of 4-dimensional flow MRI for assessing CSF dynamics to enhance our understanding of hydrocephalus pathophysiology and guide treatment selection.

METHODS:

Using 4-dimensional flow MRI (velocity encoding = 5 cm/s), we evaluated CSF dynamics before and after VPS and ETV in patients with obstructive and communicating hydrocephalus, focusing on velocity vectors, streamlines, and vorticity.

RESULTS:

In obstructive hydrocephalus due to cerebral aqueduct obstruction, we initially expected a complete absence of CSF circulation in the 3V and cerebral aqueduct before ETV. However, slow flow was observed around the foramen of Monro and even within the obstructed aqueduct. After ETV, rapid CSF flow with vortex formation was observed in the 3V. In obstructive hydrocephalus, while VPS reduced ventricular size, it did not enhance CSF movement in the 3V. In communicating hydrocephalus with third ventricular floor ballooning, rapid CSF flow and abnormal vortices in the 3V persisted after ETV; however, these abnormalities were mitigated by VPS.

CONCLUSION:

These findings suggest that both CSF stagnation and abnormal vortices in the 3V contribute to the pathophysiology of obstructive and communicating hydrocephalus. Therefore, treatment strategies should prioritize interventions that optimize CSF flow dynamics.

### Epidermal electronics for noninvasive, wireless, quantitative assessment of ventricular shunt function in patients with hydrocephalus [^0cca78e7]. Science Translational Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Hydrocephalus is a common and costly neurological condition caused by the overproduction and/or impaired resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The current standard of care, ventricular catheters (shunts), is prone to failure, which can result in nonspecific symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Current diagnostic tools for shunt failure such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radionuclide shunt patency studies (RSPSs), and ice pack-mediated thermodilution have disadvantages including high cost, poor accuracy, inconvenience, and safety concerns. Here, we developed and tested a noninvasive, skin-mounted, wearable measurement platform that incorporates arrays of thermal sensors and actuators for precise, continuous, or intermittent measurements of flow through subdermal shunts, without the drawbacks of other methods. Systematic theoretical and experimental benchtop studies demonstrate high performance across a range of practical operating conditions. Advanced electronics designs serve as the basis of a wireless embodiment for continuous monitoring based on rechargeable batteries and data transmission using Bluetooth protocols. Clinical studies involving five patients validate the sensor's ability to detect the presence of CSF flow (P = 0.012) and further distinguish between baseline flow, diminished flow, and distal shunt failure. Last, we demonstrate processing algorithms to translate measured data into quantitative flow rate. The sensor designs, fabrication schemes, wireless architectures, and patient trials reported here represent an advance in hydrocephalus diagnostics with ability to visualize flow in a simple, user-friendly mode, accessible to the physician and patient alike.

### Use of CSF infusion studies to unblock occluded hydrocephalus ventricular shunt catheters: a preliminary report of two patients [^7c361655]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Two patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts presented with symptoms of raised intracranial pressure indicative of possible shunt malfunction. During investigation, to eliminate this possibility, cerebral spinal fluid infusion studies were performed, which indicated proximal occlusion of the shunts in both cases. Retrograde flush of the ventricular catheter was performed during temporary compression of the siphon-control device, a manoeuvre which blocks distal flow. After the use of this technique, both patients' symptoms improved and they have remained symptom-free for over 2years. This case report validates the role that infusion studies can play in clearing a blocked ventricular catheter shunt.

### Symptomatic vaginal enterocele associated with malfunctioning ventriculoperitoneal shunt and cerebrospinal ascites [^0c601862]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Abdominal pseudocyst formation is a rare adult complication associated with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. Presenting symptoms are primarily abdominal and include distention, pain and anorexia, and secondarily neurological with signs and symptoms of shunt malfunction. We describe a case of VP shunt-related pseudocyst formation presenting as symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse with stage 4 enterocele 4 years after VP shunt placement. The patient's vaginal enterocele enlarged and became more symptomatic as intra-abdominal cyst formation expanded. Symptomatic relief of pelvic floor symptomatology including resolution of exteriorized prolapse was established by conservative measures and eventual VP shunt revision and removal. VP shunt malfunction may present as symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse and may require shunt removal or revision for resolution of symptoms.

### Rethinking the indications for the ventriculoperitoneal shunt tap [^4ef9993c]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Object

Tapping of a suspected malfunctioning ventriculoperitoneal shunt is usually easy, sometimes informative, but also potentially misleading. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a shunt evaluation protocol that does not involve direct shunt tapping except in rare and specific cases.

Methods

The authors adopted a protocol for shunt evaluation that involves shunt tapping only in selected cases of suspected infection or in patients with noncommunicating hydrocephalus and equivocal computed tomography (CT) findings of shunt infection. They then reviewed the clinical characteristics and surgical findings in 373 consecutive assessments of 155 pediatric patients who were evaluated for shunt malfunction and/or infection by using this protocol between January 2003 and December 2005.

Results

Mental status change and headache were the symptoms most concordant with shunt malfunction, but no symptom had a predictive value much better than 50%. Follow-up CT scans demonstrated enlarged ventricles in 72 of 126 cases of shunt revision. Among those with obstruction but without remarkable CT changes, 8 patients had evidence of distal obstruction on x-ray "shunt series" consisting of skull, chest, and abdominal radiographs, and 5 had obvious symptoms that rendered further testing unnecessary; 38 cases of obstruction were diagnosed based on elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture (mean 34.7 cm H₂O). A shunt tap was required in only 8 cases (2%).

Conclusions

The authors have shown that it is possible to evaluate the majority of ventricular shunt malfunctions without tapping the device. Because it is possible to diagnose shunt obstruction correctly by other means, the shunt tap may not be obligatory as a routine test of the device's patency.

### Repeated lumbar or ventricular punctures in newborns with intraventricular haemorrhage [^99b4ce4d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although in recent years the percentage of preterm infants who suffer intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) has reduced, posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) remains a serious problem with a high rate of cerebral palsy and no evidence-based treatment. Survivors often have to undergo ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) surgery, which makes the child permanently dependent on a valve and catheter system. This carries a significant risk of infection and the need for surgical revision of the shunt. Repeated removal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by either lumbar puncture, ventricular puncture, or from a ventricular reservoir in preterm babies with IVH has been suggested as a treatment to reduce the risk of PHH development.

Objectives

To determine the effect of repeated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removal (by lumbar/ventricular puncture or removal from a ventricular reservoir) compared to conservative management, where removal is limited to when there are signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), on reduction in the risk of permanent shunt dependence, neurodevelopmental disability, and death in neonates with or at risk of developing posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH).

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 24 March 2016), Embase (1980 to 24 March 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 24 March 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs.

Selection Criteria

RCTs and quasi-RCTs that compared serial removal of CSF (via lumbar puncture, ventricular puncture, or from a ventricular reservoir) with conservative management (removing CSF only when there were symptoms of raised ICP). Trials also had to report on at least one of the specified outcomes of death, disability, or shunt insertion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted details of the participant selection, participant allocation and the interventions. We assessed the following outcomes: VPS, death, death or shunt, disability, multiple disability, death or disability, and CSF infection. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Four trials (five articles) met the inclusion criteria of this review; three were RCTs and one was a quasi-RCT; and included a total of 280 participants treated in neonatal intensive care units in the UK. The trials were published between 1980 and 1990. The studies were sufficiently similar regarding the research question they asked and the interventions that we could combine the trials to assess the effect of the intervention. Meta-analysis showed that the intervention produced no significant difference when compared to conservative management for the outcomes of: placement of hydrocephalus shunt (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.26; 3 trials, 233 infants; I² statistic = 0%; moderate quality evidence), death (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.44; 4 trials, 280 infants; I² statistic = 0%; low quality evidence), major disability in survivors (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.18; 2 trials, 141 infants; I² statistic = 11%; high quality evidence), multiple disability in survivors (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 2 trials, 141 infants; I² statistic = 0%; high quality evidence), death or disability (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 2 trials, 180 infants; I² statistic = 0%; high quality evidence), death or shunt (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11; 3 trials, 233 infants; I² statistic = 0%; moderate quality evidence), and infection of CSF presurgery (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.67; 2 trials, 195 infants; low quality evidence). We assessed the quality of the evidence as high for the outcomes of major disability, multiple disability, and disability or death. We rated the evidence for the outcomes of shunt insertion, and death or shunt insertion as of moderate quality as one included trial used an alternation method of randomisation. For the outcomes of death and infection of CSF presurgery, the quality of the evidence was low as one trial used an alternation method, the number of participants was too low to assess the objectives with sufficient precision, and there was inconsistency regarding the findings in the included trials regarding the outcome of infection of CSF presurgery.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence that repeated removal of CSF via lumbar puncture, ventricular puncture or from a ventricular reservoir produces any benefit over conservative management in neonates with or at risk for developing PHH in terms of reduction of disability, death, or need for placement of a permanent shunt.

### Innovative application of point of care ultrasound in assessing ventriculo-peritoneal shunt patency [^3aed4071]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study introduces a novel method for assessing the patency of VP shunts that can be effectively performed in an outpatient setting. This approach enables the early identification of potential shunt dysfunction before clinical deterioration occurs. By using sonographic predictors with high NPV, clinicians can accurately rule out shunt nonpatency using these straightforward, noninvasive measurements.

Our team has been dedicated to systematically using POCUS for evaluating and monitoring neurosurgical intensive care unit patients, as previously detailed by Pokhrel et al. In that study, we used sonographic parameters to form a preliminary assessment of shunt functionality, facilitating rapid diagnosis, and subsequent management. In this study, we further expanded on this method by correlating additional sonographic parameters with shunt nonpatency, calculating cutoff values, and determining their sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive value, and NPVs.

Previous studies have used ultrasound to study CSF flow, but these methods were invasive. For example, Hartman and colleaguesin 2015 quantitatively measured CSF flow in a shunt by injecting a solution of gas-filled microbubbles through a shunt catheter. They then analyzed the velocity profiles generated by the bubbles. Although this method could determine the presence of flow or flow rates in the range of 0.006–0.09 mL/min with reasonable certainty, it carries risks owing to its invasive nature, including the potential for infection from introducing a foreign substance into the shunt system.

By contrast, our study is completely noninvasive. We measure the flow rate by observing changes in the waveform upon pressing the shunt chamber, eliminating the risk of introducing infection. Furthermore, by using peak velocity as a parameter instead of calculating the volume per minute, our method reduces the time required for adjusting insonation or drawing graphs of waveforms. This study is the first in the published literature to provide cutoff values for CSF flow velocity within the shunt tube during chamber compression, below which the odds of shunt obstruction are statistically significant.

### Validating a clinical prediction rule for ventricular shunt malfunction [^3c272d10]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to validate a published ventricular shunt clinical prediction rule for the identification of children at low risk for ventricular shunt malfunction based on the absence of 3 high-risk clinical predictors (irritability, nausea or vomiting, and headache).

Methods

We identified children aged 21 years and younger with a ventricular shunt who presented between 2010 and 2013 to a single pediatric emergency department (ED) for evaluation of potential shunt malfunction. We defined a ventricular shunt malfunction as obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid flow requiring operative neurosurgical intervention within 72 hours of initial ED evaluation. We applied this ventricular shunt clinical prediction rule to the study population and report the test characteristics.

Results

We identified 755 ED visits for 294 children with potential ventricular shunt malfunction. Of these encounters, 146 (19%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 17%-22%) had a ventricular shunt malfunction. The ventricular shunt clinical prediction rule had a sensitivity of 99% (95% CI, 94%-100%), specificity of 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%), and negative predictive value of 95% (95% CI, 82%-99%). Two children with a ventricular shunt malfunction were misclassified as low risk by this clinical prediction rule.

Conclusions

Ventricular shunt malfunctions were common. Although children classified as low risk by the ventricular shunt clinical prediction rule were less likely to have a shunt malfunction, routine neuroimaging may still be required because exclusion of ventricular shunt malfunction may be difficult on clinical grounds alone.

### Suprapineal recess: an alternate site for third ventriculostomy? Case report [^8b2414a3]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

This 30-year-old woman presented with clinical symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension and Parinaud syndrome secondary to ventriculoperitoneal shunt dysfunction. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed gross triventricular hydrocephalus with a large suprapineal recess due to aqueductal stenosis. Using an endoscopic approach, a ventriculostomy was performed within the floor of the dilated suprapineal recess. Following this procedure the patient experienced alleviation of all her neurological symptoms and signs. Postoperative MR imaging and cerebrospinal fluid flow studies demonstrated a functioning ventriculostomy. The anatomy of the suprapineal recess and its suitability for endoscopic ventriculostomy are discussed.

### Slit-ventricle syndrome masking shunt disconnection in adulthood [^cea37bdb]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A male in his 20s was referred to the neurosurgical service with headaches, vomiting and personality changes. He had a previous history of bilateral ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts and bitemporal decompressive surgery for neonatal intraventricular haemorrhage. There were appearances of slit-ventricles on his CT head scan typically associated with adequate cerebrospinal fluid drainage and normal intracranial pressure (ICP), which ordinarily will have limited further investigation. However, an X-ray shunt series demonstrated a right shunt disconnection at the neck and ICP monitoring confirmed raised ICP with poor brain compliance. He underwent revision of the right VP shunt with distal catheter replacement. Postoperatively, his symptoms, ICP and brain compliance improved. This case highlights the value of obtaining shunt series in patients presenting with symptoms of shunt obstruction regardless of a normal CT head. It emphasises awareness of slit-ventricle syndrome in adult patients with shunts, particularly those with complex childhood hydrocephalus.

### In vitro testing of explanted shunt valves in hydrocephalic patients with suspected valve malfunction [^f260345a]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Past and future

Failure of CSF shunt of up to 50% at two years after implantation remains a persistent problem. Shunt obstruction and infection remain the predominant causes, whereas the valve itself is reported to be the site or cause of malfunction in the range of 2 to 3%. Although the exact reasons remain unclear, our study supports reduced long-term-stability followed by clinically relevant flow alterations even in the current generation of different types of shunt valves. If patients with implanted VPS present with disputable and less specific symptoms, unchanged ventricles in imaging and without diagnostics showing an adequate correlate, valve malfunction should be considered. Recently, Dias et al. reported on a software based shunt infusion study (SIS) with promising results, as it was deemed possible to prove or rule out VPS malfunction without the necessity of radiation exposure or surgery. Although it does not allow for differentiation between valve obstruction and distal catheter obstruction, it would be of great clinical interest, whether shunt valves with defined characteristics (obstructive equals ICP plateau > 5 mmHg and borderline equals ICP plateau ≤ 5 mmHg above critical shunt pressure) exhibit correlating flow patterns in an in-vitro-setup like ours. This could be the subject of further studies. Furthermore, test series over a long time-period should be established to consider mechanical, chemical or iatrogenic influences on shunt valves to get closer to the cause of valve malfunction.

### Cerebrospinal fluid flow and vorticity in hydrocephalus on 4-dimensional flow MRI [^9cc81589]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Case 4: Juvenile Communicating Hydrocephalus Initially Treated With VPS

A 21-year-old woman had been experiencing intermittent headaches and vertigo for the past 5 years. Because her headaches worsened, she developed left lower limb motor impairment and balance disturbances, ultimately leading to difficulty walking. She was admitted to the hospital as an emergency, and brain MRI revealed marked enlargement of all ventricles from the lateral to the 4V, along with a flow void sign in the 3V and foramina of Monro, downward ballooning of the third ventricular floor, and abnormal dilation of both the cerebral aqueduct and the foramen of Magendie. After an initial diagnosis of communicating hydrocephalus, she was referred to our institution. 4D flow MRI showed violent oscillating flow and multiple vortices in the third and 4Vs. In addition to a large clockwise vortex in the 3V, another counterclockwise vortex was observed in the downward protrusion of the third ventricular floor (Figure 5 A- 5 F and Video 8). Based on our experience with case 3, we selected VPS as the first-line treatment without performing a CSF tap test. Three months later, her symptoms improved markedly, and she returned to work within a year. Post-VPS 4D flow MRI demonstrated a slight decrease in ventricular size, persistence of third ventricular floor ballooning, and the near-complete disappearance of the counterclockwise vortex in the downward protrusion of the third ventricular floor due to reduced CSF flow velocity from the cerebral aqueduct into the 3V (Figure 5 G- 5 L, Videos 9 and 10).

### CSF tap test-obsolete or appropriate test for predicting shunt responsiveness? A systemic review [^85960b0c]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is no accurate test for diagnosing normal pressure hydrocephalus or for screening for patients who will benefit from shunt surgery. Additional tests, such as cerebrospinal fluid tap test (CSF-TT), are often used in practice to provide further predictive value in detecting suitable patients for shunting. We performed a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the CSF-TT's effect on the outcome of main symptoms and on validity parameters in screening patients suitable for shunting.

Methods

In February 2015 we searched electronic databases from their inception to the current date, using the following key words: normal pressure hydrocephalus, idiopathic normotensive hydrocephalus, shunt operation, CSF tap test, predictive value, validity. The search retrieved 8 articles explicitly addressing the topic.

Results

There was a very high positive predictive value of CSF-TT: 92% (range from 73% to 100%) but a low negative predictive value: 37% (18%-50%). Also, the CSF-TT has high specificity: 75% (33%-100%) but average sensitivity: 58% (26%-87%). The overall accuracy of the test was 62% (45%-83%).

Conclusions

This systematic review did not provide unambiguous validity of the CSF-TT in the screening of patients for shunting. The validity of the CSF-TT is good for patient inclusion for shunting due to the fact that the positive response to the test is very reliable. Unfortunately, the negative response to the test does not reliably make these patients ineligible for shunting. Further studies are needed to improve and standardize the methodology in order to optimize the detection power of the test.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunt failure causing myelopathy in a patient with bilateral jugular vein occlusion. case report [^f2751f7e]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2007). Low credibility.

The authors describe the case of a 36-year-old woman with bilateral internal jugular vein occlusion, hydrocephalus, and Dandy-Walker variant who presented with myelopathy that was ultimately attributed to ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt failure. Computed tomography (CT) angiography of the head and neck revealed epidural venous engorgement within the cervical spine, greater that 50% narrowing of the C2-5 spinal canal, and compression of the cervical spinal cord. After successful shunt revision, postoperative CT angiography revealed decreased venous engorgement as well as decompression of the cervical spinal cord, and the patient's myelopathy improved. This case represents a fascinating clinical presentation of VP shunt failure, highlighting the physiological importance of the external jugular pathways involved in cerebral venous drainage.

### Diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive thermal evaluation of ventriculoperitoneal shunt flow in shunt malfunction: a prospective, multi-site, operator-blinded study [^9d5b8fc4]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Use of a thermal flow detection device may help rule out a shunt malfunction and may be particularly useful in patients where the clinical impression is that shunt malfunction is unlikely. In such patients with thermally detected shunt flow, ventricular imaging may be unnecessary, and a decision to avoid invasive tests or admission for observation may be obviated. The use of a micropumper device to enhance flow did not improve the diagnostic accuracy in this situation.

### Long-term risk of shunt failure after brain tumor surgery [^e1ecce6f]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgical resection of brain tumors is considered to be the primary choice of treatment for patients with debilitating neurological symptoms. The efficacy of craniotomy for brain tumors has been well established with regard to quality of life and prolongation of life. Although the primary aim may be to cure disease or restore neurological function, risks of surgery such as infection, bleeding, surgical morbidity and mortality, neurological deficits, and changes to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics leading to hydrocephalus (HC) and subsequent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt dependency remain significant concerns to the neurosurgeon.

VP shunt insertion is the most commonly performed procedure for treatment of HC as it provides an immediate and effective diversion of accumulated CSF in the brain due to changes in CSF dynamics. Even though the main goal of shunting is to provide relief of intracranial pressure and improve symptoms, shunt failures remain a considerable challenge. Although studies of shunt failures with respect to the congenital conditions in the pediatric population, hemorrhage-related HC, idiopathic conditions, and infections have been published, reports on risks of long-term shunt longevity after brain tumor surgery remain scarce in the literature.

In this large population-based study of all adult patients who underwent brain tumor surgery from a well-defined geographical region spanning a period of 10 years, we primarily wished to determine the 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year shunt failure rates in order to determine shunt longevities in the long-term period after craniotomy for brain tumors. The secondary endpoint was to identify possible risk factors of reduced long-term shunt longevity.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^8c784edf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

CM hydrocephalus — monitoring and temporizing measures: In an asymptomatic patient with CM who has radiologic evidence of hydrocephalus, medical treatment alone should be continued with serial imaging obtained every 3–6 months until stability has been determined. In the presence of typical symptoms that reflect increased intracranial pressure (ICP), placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is very likely to be necessary, and this may carry as high as a 12.5-fold increased mortality in patients with CM. Placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD) should be considered as a temporizing measure to control elevated pressure; an EVD provides a means to measure ICP, obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for serial analysis, and drain CSF to decrease ICP, although it is unlikely that the typical patient with CM would achieve CSF sterility with an EVD. There are a variety of shunt systems including set pressure valves and adjustable valves, with no evidence in the literature to suggest superiority of one type of system over the other, and although some neurosurgeons are reluctant to perform shunting when the CSF is actively infected, there is no real evidence that expeditious shunting imposes undue risks and the dangerous effects of prolonged increased ICP greatly exceed the theoretical potential of an infectious nidus at the end of the catheter.

### Safety of pregnancy and delivery with shunted hydrocephalus [^bcb25ff3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This retrospective and multicenter cohort study was approved by the institutional review board at Boston Children's and Brigham and Women's Hospital, and patient consent was waived given its retrospective nature. Our reporting methods following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

In a retrospective multicenter cohort study, a clinical research repository of obstetrical deliveries from 1989 to 2023 was queried. Patients with a billing code for childbirth, medical record mention of a CSF shunt (ie, ventriculoperitoneal [VP]), and hydrocephalus were identified. Eligibility was confirmed if shunt placement occurred before pregnancy, and a delivery note was available.

Data on prenatal and postnatal neurosurgical and obstetrical outcomes through 6 months post partum, including shunt-related symptoms, revisions, obstetrical complications, delivery characteristics, and infant outcomes were extracted. Safety, as defined in this study, pertained to the absence of shunt-related complications and adverse patient- or infant-related outcomes. Univariate comparisons using the Wilcoxon rank sum and Fisher exact tests assessed factors associated with shunt failure. R version 4.2.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing), and statistical significance was set at P < .05. Data were analyzed from June 2022 to January 2024.

### Treatment of hydrocephalus in adults by placement of an open ventricular shunt [^ac1ad17e]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Object

Ventricular shunt placement is the neurosurgical procedure most frequently associated with complications. Over the years, it has been a growing concern that the performance of most shunting devices does not conform to physiological parameters. An open ventriculoperitoneal (VP) bypass with a peritoneal catheter for which the cross-sectional internal diameter was 0.51 mm as a distinctive element for flow resistance was evaluated for use in the treatment of adult patients with hydrocephalus.

Methods

During a 2-year period, open shunts were surgically implanted in 54 adults with hydrocephalus; conventional shunts were implanted in 80 matched controls. Periodic evaluations were performed using neuroimaging studies and measures of clinical status. All patients were followed from 12 to 36 months. 18.5 ± 4 months for patients with the open shunt and 19.1 ± 8.1 months for controls (mean ± standard deviation). The device continued to function in 50 patients with the open shunt (93%) and in 49 controls (61%: p < 0.001). The Evans index in patients with the open shunt was 0.33 ± 0.09 throughout the follow up. No cases of infection, overdrainage, or slit ventricles were observed: the index in controls was 0.28 ± 0.08; 60% of them developed slit ventricles. During the follow-up period occlusion occurred in four patients with the open shunt (7%) and in 31 controls (39%: p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The daily cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage through the open VP shunt is close to 500 mL of uninterrupted flow propelled by the hydrokinetic force generated by the combination of ventricular pressure and siphoning effect. It complies with hydrokinetic parameters imposed by a bypass connection between the ventricular and peritoneal cavities as well as with the physiological archetype of continuous flow and drainage according to CSF production. The open shunt is simple, inexpensive, and an effective treatment for hydrocephalus in adults.

### Transient binocular visual loss: a rare presentation of ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction [^63a69f2d]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors report the case of a 27-year-old male with ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) for hydrocephalus presenting with episodic transient binocular visual loss (TBVL) and headache. Complete physical, bedside shunt examination and funduscopy were unremarkable. Laboratory investigation, shunt series and imaging studies failed to reveal any acute abnormalities. Interrogation of the shunt system identified a valve malfunction which was corrected with resultant symptomatic relief and the patient was discharged home in stable condition. VPS malfunction occurs secondary to infection or mechanical failure such as obstruction, tubing fracture, shunt migration and over drainage. Resultant raised intracranial pressure leads to symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting and gait abnormalities. Visual defects including blindness has been occasionally reported from shunt malfunction. Rare complications include cerebrospinal fluid oedema, colonic perforation, paraparesis and parkinsonism. TBVL due to shunt malfunction remains an uncommon presentation and requires a high index of clinical suspicion while evaluating these patients.

### CSF-oma identification with nuclear medicine shunt-o-Gram [^8dcb2979]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

A nuclear medicine shunt-o-gram is used to evaluate ventriculoperitoneal shunt patency and dispersion of radiotracer into the peritoneal cavity. A 73-year-old man presented with worsening memory, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. Shunt-o-gram revealed antegrade flow through the tubing and spillage into the peritoneal cavity without dispersion. CT confirmed a CSF-oma. Symptoms resolved after CSF-oma resection. Normal passage of radiotracer through the shunt without normal dispersion into the peritoneal cavity along with CT imaging correctly identified a CSF-oma. This is an unexpected complication of a shunt. Correct diagnosis on imaging likely saved this patient from unnecessary complete shunt revision.

### Reframing the clinical phenotype and management of cryptococcal meningitis [^bd57c799]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Neurosurgical involvement/raised ICP

Raised ICP is a sign of disease severity, associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This appears to be driven by distinct pathophysiological processes in people living with HIV and non-HIV CM. Aggressive management of raised ICP improves patient outcomes. Box 3 defines key terms pertaining to CSF dynamics with important therapeutic implications. Figure 7 outlines our suggested approach to raised ICP management in CM.

Box 3
Working definitions for key neurosurgical terms

Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) — a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure exceeding 20 cm H₂O at time of lumbar puncture in the left lateral position.
Ventriculomegaly — an increase in ventricular dimensions on neuroimaging/pathological analysis, which frequently occurs as a compensatory response to raised ICP.
Hydrocephalus — a disturbance in CSF dynamics that commonly manifests as a dyad of clinical features of raised ICP and radiological evidence of ventriculomegaly.

Figure 7
Raised ICP management in cryptococcal meningitis. CM, cryptococcal meningitis; ICP, intracranial pressure; LD, lumbar drain; LP, lumbar puncture; SOL, space occupying lesion.

Treatment options for raised ICP and hydrocephalus in CM include serial therapeutic LPs; temporary external CSF diversion through lumbar drain or external ventricular drain insertion; or definitive CSF diversion with tunnelled ventricular shunts. While there are various forms of shunt surgery, ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion is the most widely practised in CM. In skilled hands, this is a routine procedure, but it requires designated theatre space and neurosurgical expertise. Long-term cumulative risks of shunt obstruction also mandate long-term neurosurgical follow-up. In low-income settings, lumbar drain insertion can be performed at the bedside by surgical associates without postgraduate neurosurgical training. Lumbar drain insertion allows short-term, safe, continuous drainage of larger volumes of CSF than LP (up to 200 mL CSF/day vs 30 mL/day with LP) and lumbar drain-related infection is uncommon, even in low-resource settings.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America's clinical practice guidelines for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis [^f3fe85f0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis — culture recommendations state that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures are the most important test to establish the diagnosis (strong, high). If initial CSF cultures are negative in patients with CSF shunts or drains with suspected infection, it is recommended that cultures be held for at least 10 days to identify organisms such as P. acnes (strong, high). If a CSF shunt or drain is removed in patients suspected of having infection, cultures of shunt and drain components are recommended (strong, moderate), whereas if a CSF shunt or drain is removed for indications other than infection, cultures of shunt or drain components are not recommended (strong, moderate). Blood cultures are recommended in patients with suspected ventriculoatrial shunt infections (strong, high) and may be considered in patients with ventriculoperitoneal and ventriculopleural shunts (weak, low). Single or multiple positive CSF cultures with CSF pleocytosis and/or hypoglycorrhachia, or an increasing cell count, and clinical symptoms suspicious for ventriculitis or meningitis, is indicative of CSF drain infection (strong, high). CSF and blood cultures in selected patients should be obtained before the administration of antimicrobial therapy; a negative CSF culture in the setting of previous antimicrobial therapy does not exclude healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis (strong, moderate).

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^bb619085]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus — predictors and testing: Predictors of success included elevated R0, impaired cerebral blood flow reactivity to acetazolamide (by SPECT), and positive response to either external lumbar drainage or repeated lumbar punctures. Age may not be a prognostic factor, and data are insufficient to judge efficacy of radionuclide cisternography or aqueductal flow measurement by MRI. Clinicians should inform patients with iNPH with elevated R0 and their families that they have an increased chance of response to shunting (Level B).

### Review of theories into the pathogenesis of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^f84321c1]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Figure 1
Demonstration of radiographic features of NPH. (A) Axial CT head demonstrating Evans index of 0.44; (B) Coronal CT head demonstrating acute callosal angle of 40.4° with DESH; (C) Sagittal CT head demonstrating cingulate sulcus sign (white arrows). DESH, disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus; NPH, normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Confirmatory testing includes lumbar puncture (LP), with normal opening pressures (5–18 mm Hg), with an improvement in symptoms following large volume LPs (tap test) highly suggestive of the diagnosis.

The definitive treatment for NPH patients is CSF diversion via shunt placement, with subsequent symptomatic improvement noted in up to 84% of patients. This improvement in clinical symptoms from shunting, particularly gait and cognitive symptoms, allows for differentiation from other progressive conditions with similar presentations, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Binswanger's disease. These clinical improvements can be sustained for years following shunt placement, with gait demonstrating the most marked and sustained symptomatic improvement for 75%–87% of patients. Even for NPH patients requiring shunt revision for shunt malfunction or infection, 74%–93% of patients in the literature have demonstrated long-term improvements in symptomatology following revision surgery.

The underlying pathophysiology of NPH has been of great interest over the years, with various theories presented to account for the underpinnings of its peculiar clinical presentation. While various theories have been proposed since Adams et al's findings to account for the symptomatology and pathophysiology of NPH, a definitive theory of pathogenesis is still lacking. We believe that this stumbling block in understanding the pathophysiology of NPH stems from the larger issue that the existing paradigm of the Monro-Kellie pressure-volume model, from which our fundamental understanding of hydrocephalus is derived, insufficiently accounts for many of the clinical and experimental characteristics associated with different forms of hydrocephalus. There are a myriad of biological processes implicated in NPH, ranging from arteriosclerosis, and impaired blood flow, to impairments in the glymphatic pathway, to disturbances in the distribution of intracranial pulsatility. In this manuscript, we review the various underlying pathophysiological mechanisms underlying NPH and attempt to amalgamate these mechanisms to account for the clinical and radiographic manifestations of this condition.

### Shunt overdrainage syndrome: review of the literature [^3956bc27]. Neurosurgical Review (2018). Low credibility.

Shunt overdrainage in patients with hydrocephalus still represents a challenge for neurosurgeons, in part due to the lack of agreement or uniformity concerning the entity. Important problems exist relating to the real incidence of the entity, its definition, classification, and the pathophysiological theories behind the various treatment strategies proposed. Recent reports have suggested that the evidence about overdrainage and its consequences is not so robust as presumed. Consequently, the topic requires more detailed examination. In this review, we comment on all the main facets related with shunt overdrainage.

### Cerebrospinal fluid diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^55439897]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Here, we investigated the diagnostic value of AD biomarkers in the iNPH population and found that correction factors cannot compensate for the effect of iNPH on CSF AD biomarkers. Applying the correction yielded a high specificity with almost no sensitivity but using cutoffs for the general population had even lower sensitivity. One possible explanation is that in patients shunted because of iNPH, AD is still in the early stage compared with the usual timing of an AD diagnosis reliant on clinical symptoms only. Aβ 1–42 levels decrease as AD progresses, while t-Tau and P-Tau 181 levels increase. The decline in Aβ 1–42 is considered to be the result of aggregation of Aβ plaques, whereas increased tau can be seen as a sign of neuronal damage. This pattern might explain why even though biomarker levels are generally reduced in iNPH, amyloid levels in iNPH patients with AD pathology were higher than in our AD control group. For t-Tau and P-Tau 181, this effect appeared to be less pronounced. Another possible explanation for this difference is that the clearance mechanism of Aβ 1–42 differs in the context of iNPH with AD when compared with non-comorbid AD. A possible explanation for this is difference between white matter lesions between AD and iNPH, which may affect CSF flow in iNPH patients. Although, these changes may also be caused by impaired CSF flow. Genome mapping has revealed that Aβ 1–42 and P-Tau 181 levels are mainly associated with different genetic loci, hinting at independent pathological processes and potentially explaining the different behavior of these biomarkers in iNPH. That study further identified a potential overlap in genetic etiology for tau levels and ventricular volume.

### Ventriculopleural shunt: review of literature and novel ways to improve ventriculopleural shunt tolerance [^18bf8f5b]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion is among the most commonneurosurgical procedures that are performed worldwide. It is estimated thatapproximately 30,000 ventriculostomies are performed annually in the United States. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt malfunction rate within the first year of initialimplantation has been reported to be as high as 11–25%. In patients with abdominaladhesions, infections or multiple failed VP shunts, another bodily compartment shouldbe utilized as a substitute for the peritoneal cavity for distal shunt catheter placement. Ventriculopleural (VPL) shunting for hydrocephalus was first introduced by Heile in1914. Since the inception of this idea, VPL shunts have been utilized in select patientswith varying degrees of success. There have been a number of case reports andseries documenting unique complications with VPL shunting, with pleural effusion andpneumothorax being the most common complications. In our review article, we soughtto review the development of VPL shunting, pleuropulmonary physiology, insertiontechniques for VPL shunt, complications associated with VPL shunts, and uniquestrategies to improve VPL shunt tolerance.

### Should ventriculoatrial shunting be the procedure of choice for normal-pressure hydrocephalus? [^a1750278]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Ventriculoatrial (VA) shunting is rarely used for patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), likely due to surgeon technical preference and case reports indicating cardiopulmonary complications. However, these complications have typically been limited to adults in whom VA shunts had been placed when they were children. Few studies have directly compared VA shunting to ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting in cases of NPH.

Methods

The authors retrospectively analyzed all NPH patients treated by a single surgeon at their center from January 2002 through December 2011. Thirty patients were treated with VA shunts (14 male) and 157 with VP shunts (86 male). The patients' mean age (± SD) at surgery was 73.7 ± 9.4 years for VA shunting and 76.0 ± 8.2 years for VP shunting; the median durations of follow-up were 42.0 months (IQR 19.2–63.6 months) and 34.2 months (IQR 15.8–67.5), respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

Results

Perioperative and postoperative complications for VA and VP shunting cohorts, respectively, included distal revision (2.7% vs 6.6%, p = 0.45), proximal revision (2.7% vs 2.5%, p = 0.97), and postoperative seizure (2.7% vs 1.5%, p = 0.62). Shunt drainage-related subdural hematomas/hygromas developed in 8.1%/27.0% of VA shunt-treated patients versus 6.6%/26.4% of VP shunt-treated patients (p = 0.76/0.98) and were nearly always successfully managed with programmable-valve adjustment. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (1.5%) and shunt infection (2.0%) were only observed in those who underwent VP shunting. Of note, no cardiovascular complications were observed in any patient, and there were no cases of distal occlusion of the VA shunt.

Conclusions

The authors found no significant differences in complication rates between VA and VP shunting, and VA shunting was not associated with any cardiopulmonary complications. Thus, in the authors' experience, VA shunting is at least as safe as VP shunting for treating NPH.

### Cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement for pseudotumor cerebri-associated intractable headache: predictors of treatment response and an analysis of long-term outcomes [^22f321ff]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Object

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts effectively reverse symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri postoperatively, but long-term outcome has not been investigated. Lumboperitoneal (LP) shunts are the mainstay of CSF shunts for pseudotumor cerebri; however, image-guided stereotaxy and neuroendoscopy now allow effective placement of a ventricular catheter without causing ventriculomegaly in these cases. To date it remains unknown if CSF shunts provide long-term relief from pseudotumor cerebri and whether a ventricular shunt is better than an LP shunt. The authors investigated these possibilities.

Methods

The authors reviewed the records of all shunt placement procedures that were performed for intractable headache due to pseudotumor cerebri at one institution between 1973 and 2003. Using proportional hazards regression analysis, predictors of treatment failure (continued headache despite a properly functioning shunt) were assessed, and shunt revision and complication rates were compared between LP and ventricular (ventriculoperitoneal [VP] or ventriculoatrial [VAT]) shunts. Forty-two patients underwent 115 shunt placement procedures: 79 in which an LP shunt was used and 36 in which a VP or VAT shunt was used. Forty patients (95%) experienced a significant improvement in their headaches immediately after the shunt was inserted. Severe headache recurred despite a properly functioning shunt in eight (19%) and 20 (48%) patients by 12 and 36 months, respectively, after the initial shunt placement surgery. Seventeen patients without papilledema and 19 patients in whom preoperative symptoms had occurred for longer than 2 years experienced recurrent headache, making patients with papilledema or long-term symptoms fivefold (relative risk [RR] 5.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–17.8; p < 0.01) or 2.5-fold (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.01–9.39; p = 0.05) more likely to experience headache recurrence, respectively. In contrast to VP or VAT shunts, LP shunts were associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of shunt revision (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5–4.3; p < 0.001) due to a threefold increased risk of shunt obstruction (RR 3, 95% CI 1.5–5.7; p < 0.005), but there were similar risks between the two types of shunts for overdrainage (RR 2.3, 95% CI 0.8–7.9; p = 0.22), distal catheter migration (RR 2.1, 95% CI 0.3–19.3; p = 0.55), and shunt infection (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.3–13.2; p = 0.75).

Conclusions

Based on their 30-year experience in the treatment of these patients, the authors found that CSF shunts were extremely effective in the acute treatment of pseudotumor cerebri-associated intractable headache, providing long-term relief in the majority of patients. Lack of papilledema and long-standing symptoms were risk factors for treatment failure. The use of ventricular shunts for pseudotumor cerebri was associated with a lower risk of shunt obstruction and revision than the use of LP shunts. Using ventricular shunts in patients with papilledema or symptoms lasting less than 2 years should be considered for those with pseudotumor cerebri-associated intractable headache.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) shunt and diagnostic procedure risks — Shunting is associated with significant cost and potential morbidity and mortality, with one review reporting a pooled mean shunt complication rate of 38% and an overall combined rate of permanent neurologic deficit and death of 6%. Another publication reported mortality rates between 5% and 15% for the shunting procedure. In the recently reported SINPHONI multicenter trial, 22% of patients implanted with a VP shunt required shunt revisions. The prolonged lumbar drainage diagnostic procedure is associated with a risk of meningitis and death of 1.8%–6.9% and 0.2%, respectively, and several more recent studies describe complication rates of 15% to 28%.
