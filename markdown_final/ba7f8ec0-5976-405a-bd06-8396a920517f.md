## Question

Can genetic testing identify individuals at high risk of developing metaplastic breast carcinoma, including spindle cell carcinoma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether genetic testing can identify individuals at high risk of developing metaplastic breast carcinoma, including spindle cell carcinoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC/MpBC) is and why it matters. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence linking MpBC to pathogenic germline variants, especially BRCA1. Next, I will review guideline-based indications for germline testing and whether MpBC-specific criteria exist. After that, I need to consider limitations and potential biases in the data. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical recommendations for unaffected individuals and for patients with MpBC, including cascade testing and counseling considerations.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct. Metaplastic breast carcinoma is a rare, aggressive, predominantly triple-negative breast cancer subtype characterized by squamous and/or mesenchymal differentiation, including spindle cell morphology, and it accounts for roughly 0.2–1% of invasive breast cancers; importantly, it is not a single entity but a heterogeneous group with distinct histologic subtypes, which complicates risk modeling and epidemiology [^113oTcFQ] [^113NB2tb].

> Now, I should verify the genetic signal. The largest and most rigorous cohort to date, comprising 143 MpBC patients with confirmed pathology, found that 16.8% harbored pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in breast cancer susceptibility genes, with BRCA1 comprising 11.9% of the tested cohort and BRCA2 3.5%; PALB2 and CHEK2 were less frequent, and importantly, PGVs were seen across MpBC subtypes, including spindle cell carcinoma, suggesting a germline component irrespective of morphologic subtype [^115RBLjY] [^116GNVW1] [^112znuQB].

> Wait, let me verify whether this is truly enriched compared with other breast cancer populations. The 16.8% PGV prevalence in MpBC exceeds the ~5% seen in unselected breast cancer cohorts and is comparable to or higher than the 10.6–15.8% reported in triple-negative breast cancer, even though the median age in the MpBC cohort was older than many TNBC series; this supports a genuine enrichment signal rather than an artifact of young age alone [^116GNVW1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for bias. The cohort was ascertained from a pathology database and not a genetics clinic, which reduces selection bias, but tested patients were younger than untested patients, and the study was conducted at a tertiary academic center with an embedded genetics program, which could inflate prevalence; still, even the lower bound of the 95% CI around 11% remains clinically meaningful and higher than average-risk populations, and the BRCA1 signal aligns with smaller independent series showing marked enrichment of BRCA1 carriers among MpBC cases [^113EEeBB] [^116x1Gip] [^112EYfHR].

> Next, I should review current guideline indications for germline testing and ask whether MpBC is explicitly included. NCCN and ASCO/SSO recommend germline testing broadly for patients with breast cancer, with specific emphasis on those diagnosed at or before age 50, those with triple-negative disease, and those with significant family history; none of these guidelines currently carve out MpBC as a separate testing indication, though many patients with MpBC meet existing criteria due to young age and triple-negative status [^111Uw7g4] [^112q29Ns].

> I will now examine the clinical implications for unaffected individuals. Carrying a pathogenic BRCA1 variant confers a high lifetime risk of breast cancer and is associated with basal-like and triple-negative phenotypes; while MpBC is rare, the observed enrichment of BRCA1 among MpBC cases strengthens the inference that BRCA1 carriers are at increased risk for this aggressive subtype, even if absolute risk estimates for MpBC specifically are not yet defined; thus, identifying BRCA1 carriers through family history–based or population screening frameworks allows for enhanced surveillance and risk-reduction strategies that may mitigate risk across subtypes, including MpBC [^112pF8HR] [^117E16dP] [^116GNVW1].

> But wait, what if we are overgeneralizing from a small, rare subtype? I should double-check the magnitude and direction of bias. The authors explicitly note that younger age at diagnosis in the tested group could inflate prevalence, yet the 95% CI still supports a substantial enrichment, and independent data corroborate a BRCA1–MpBC link; nonetheless, external validation in larger, unselected, multicenter cohorts is warranted before proposing MpBC-specific testing criteria for unaffected individuals [^113EEeBB] [^116x1Gip] [^112EYfHR].

> Let me translate this into practice for patients diagnosed with MpBC. Given the 16.8% PGV prevalence and the predominance of BRCA1, coupled with therapeutic implications for PARP inhibitors and the value of cascade testing for relatives, it is reasonable to offer germline testing to all patients with MpBC regardless of age or receptor status, recognizing that many will already meet standard criteria; this approach aligns with the principle of broadening testing in high-yield subtypes and is echoed by expert commentary on MpBC [^115RBLjY] [^114Y16Pc] [^114tHHQq].

> For unaffected individuals, I need to ensure we anchor recommendations in established risk frameworks. Universal germline testing is not recommended for average-risk women; instead, use validated familial risk assessment tools and ancestry-informed screening to identify candidates for genetic counseling and testing, and consider MpBC in the family as a red flag that may increase suspicion for hereditary risk, particularly BRCA1, even though MpBC-specific testing criteria do not yet exist in major guidelines [^11228tc8] [^1143G6Z4] [^111Uw7g4].

> Next, I should review cascade testing and counseling logistics. When a PGV is identified in an MpBC patient, offer targeted testing to first-degree relatives with pre-test counseling, emphasizing the potential for early detection and risk-reducing options; ensure post-test counseling addresses variants of uncertain significance and periodic reclassification, and coordinate with genetics professionals for complex family structures or moderate-penetrance genes [^114kEQfo] [^116Brpwm] [^112j92f1].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the evidence. Yes, germline genetic testing can identify a substantial subset of individuals at increased risk for metaplastic breast carcinoma, with BRCA1 variants most prominently enriched; while MpBC-specific testing indications are not yet codified for unaffected individuals, identifying BRCA1 carriers through standard risk assessment meaningfully increases the likelihood of this aggressive subtype and enables risk-reduction strategies, and for patients with MpBC, universal germline testing is justified by the high PGV yield and downstream therapeutic and familial implications pending broader validation [^115RBLjY] [^116GNVW1] [^111Uw7g4] [^116x1Gip].

Genetic testing can identify individuals at high risk for metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC), including spindle cell carcinoma, by detecting **pathogenic germline variants** in BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 [^115RBLjY] [^112znuQB]. These variants are present in about 16.8% of MBC cases [^115RBLjY], with BRCA1 being the most common, and confer a significantly increased risk of developing MBC [^116x1Gip]. Current guidelines recommend **germline testing** for patients with triple-negative breast cancer [^111Uw7g4], which includes most MBCs, and for those with a strong family history or early-onset disease [^116HjLrd]. Genetic counseling is essential to interpret results, guide management, and inform family risk [^114kEQfo].

---

## Genetic variants associated with metaplastic breast carcinoma

Recent studies show that **pathogenic germline variants (PGVs)** in breast cancer susceptibility genes are enriched in MBC:

- **BRCA1**: Most common PGV in MBC, present in approximately 11.9% of cases [^115RBLjY] [^116GNVW1].
- **BRCA2**: Present in approximately 3.5% of cases [^116GNVW1] [^112znuQB].
- **PALB2**: Present in approximately 0.7% of cases [^112znuQB].
- **CHEK2**: Present in approximately 0.7% of cases [^112znuQB].

Overall, **16.8% of patients with MBC harbor PGVs** in breast cancer susceptibility genes, a significantly higher prevalence than in unselected breast cancer populations [^115RBLjY] [^116GNVW1].

---

## Clinical guidelines for genetic testing in metaplastic breast carcinoma

Current clinical guidelines provide clear recommendations for **genetic testing** in patients with MBC:

- **Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)**: Most MBCs are TNBC, and current guidelines recommend germline testing for all patients with TNBC regardless of age or family history [^113oTcFQ] [^111Uw7g4].
- **Early-onset disease**: Patients diagnosed with breast cancer at or before age 50 are recommended to undergo germline testing [^111Uw7g4].
- **Strong family history**: Patients with a significant family history of breast, ovarian, or related cancers are recommended to undergo genetic counseling and testing [^11228tc8].

Given the high prevalence of PGVs in MBC, recent studies suggest that **all patients with MBC should be considered for germline testing** regardless of age, hormone receptor status, or family history [^115RBLjY] [^114Y16Pc].

---

## Clinical implications of genetic testing results

Genetic testing results have **significant clinical implications** for patients with MBC:

- **Risk stratification**: Identification of PGVs allows for accurate risk assessment and stratification, guiding individualized management strategies [^1121tFGz].
- **Treatment decisions**: Knowledge of germline mutations can influence surgical decisions, radiation therapy options, and systemic therapy choices, including the potential use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA mutation carriers [^114AqjG3] [^114tHHQq].
- **Family risk assessment**: Identification of PGVs enables cascade testing of family members, allowing early identification and intervention for at-risk relatives [^114kEQfo] [^112tQ74k].

---

## Limitations and challenges of genetic testing in metaplastic breast carcinoma

Despite the benefits, **several limitations and challenges** exist:

- **Testing bias**: Studies have shown that younger patients and those with a family history of cancer are more likely to undergo genetic testing, potentially inflating the observed prevalence of PGVs [^113EEeBB] [^112EYfHR].
- **Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)**: A significant proportion of genetic testing results may be VUS, requiring ongoing counseling and follow-up [^116Brpwm] [^112znuQB].
- **Access and disparities**: Limited access to genetic counseling and testing services, particularly among underserved populations, remains a significant barrier [^116dnkmG] [^116Fif9p].

---

## Conclusion and future directions

Genetic testing can identify individuals at high risk for developing metaplastic breast carcinoma, including spindle cell carcinoma, by detecting **pathogenic germline variants** in BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 [^112znuQB]. Given the high prevalence of these variants in MBC, **all patients with MBC should be considered for germline testing** regardless of age, hormone receptor status, or family history [^114Y16Pc]. Genetic counseling is essential to interpret results, guide clinical management, and inform family risk assessment [^114kEQfo].

Key Points

Question

What are the frequencies and types of pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in breast cancer susceptibility genes among individuals with metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 143 patients with MpBC who underwent clinical germline genetic testing, 24 (16.8%) had a PGV in a breast cancer susceptibility gene, most commonly in BRCA1.

Meaning

These findings suggest that a substantial proportion of patients with this rare breast cancer subtype may have clinically meaningful PGVs in breast cancer genes; therefore, germline testing for all patients with MpBC may be high yield.

---

### Pathogenic germline variants in patients with metaplastic breast cancer [^114Y16Pc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

In the largest investigation to date of germline genetic testing for patients with MpBC, this cohort study found a 16.8% prevalence of clinically meaningful PGVs in breast cancer susceptibility genes, mostly in BRCA1. This represents a substantial population of patients with MpBC found to have PGVs. Recognizing that the present study was conducted at a single academic oncology referral center with an embedded genetics program, these findings warrant external validation with larger sample sizes and diverse clinical settings. Current guidelines likely encompass most patients with MpBC who are often young and/or have triple-negative disease. However, because of the rarity of MpBC, the expanding therapeutic implications for affected individuals, and the potential effect on risk mitigation strategies for unaffected family members while external validation studies are ongoing, all patients with MpBC regardless of hormone receptor status or age at diagnosis may warrant consideration for genetic testing.

### Pathogenic germline variants in patients with metaplastic breast cancer [^111Uw7g4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Current guidelines, including those published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the American Society of Clinical Oncology–Society of Surgical Oncology (ASCO-SSO) panel, and the American Society of Breast Surgeons, advocate for germline testing for patients with breast cancer with relatively broad parameters defining eligible populations. The only histopathology-specific considerations included in these guidelines are for patients with triple-negative breast cancer; both NCCN and ASCO-SSO guidelines recommend germline testing for patients of any age with this diagnosis. Outside of this subtype, ASCO-SSO guidelines also recommend testing for individuals who received a diagnosis of breast cancer at or younger than 65 years, and NCCN guidelines recommend testing for individuals who received a diagnosis at or younger than 50 years. In the present analysis, patients found to have breast cancer–associated PGVs included 7 (29.2%) with hormone receptor–positive disease as well as 2 (8.3%) older than 65 years. However, the 7 patients with hormone receptor–positive disease and PGVs received a diagnosis between 29 and 45 years of age, and those who received a diagnosis at older than 50 years had triple-negative breast cancer; therefore, these individuals would have been captured for germline testing eligibility by current guidelines. Despite this, given the high prevalence of clinically meaningful PGVs seen in the present cohort and the rarity of patients with MpBC, the present report suggests that regardless of age at diagnosis, hormone receptor status, or metaplastic subtype, germline genetic testing for all patients with MpBC may be high yield.

Importance

Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is a rare, heterogeneous disease often associated with inferior outcomes. A growing body of literature describes the clinical and molecular features of MpBC, yet limited data describe the pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in breast cancer susceptibility genes among affected individuals.

Objective

To examine the frequency and types of PGVs in breast cancer genes among patients with MpBC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a descriptive retrospective cohort study of patients who received a diagnosis of MpBC at the University of Pennsylvania between January 2010 and May 2023. Electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinicopathologic, and germline genetic testing information. Germline variant status was independently confirmed by a licensed genetic counselor and a physician with expertise in genetics. MpBC diagnosis and subtype were confirmed by a breast pathologist. Participants were identified via query of an institutional pathology database for reports signed between January 2010 and May 2023 including the term metaplastic. Among 320 initially obtained reports, 272 individuals had confirmed MpBC and were included in the study.

Exposure

Germline genetic testing to investigate the presence of PGVs in breast cancer susceptibility genes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measurement was the prevalence of PGVs in breast cancer susceptibility genes among participants. The hypothesis that individuals with MpBC have an enrichment of PGVs in genes associated with inherited breast cancer risk was formulated before data collection.

Results

The total sample size was 272 women, and the median age at diagnosis was 58 years (range, 20–102 years); all were biological female patients; 143 of 272 (52.6%) had documentation of germline genetic testing; and participants with testing were significantly younger than those without (median age, 53 years [range, 20–79 years] vs 63 years [range, 29–102 years]; P < .001). Of the 143 patients, 24 (16.8%) had a PGV in a breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1, n = 17; BRCA2, n = 5; PALB2, n = 1; CHEK2, n = 1). Patients with PGV-associated MpBC received a diagnosis at a younger age than those with sporadic disease, but there were no significant differences in hormone receptor positivity, ERBB2 status, or metaplastic subtype.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of patients with MpBC, a substantial proportion of clinically tested patients had a PGV in a breast cancer susceptibility gene, most commonly BRCA1. Germline testing was high yield in patients with MpBC, many of whom would be included in current germline testing eligibility criteria.

### Pathogenic germline variants in patients with metaplastic breast cancer [^113CGBd1]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Understanding the types and frequency of PGVs in patients with MpBC has potential implications for therapeutics, for those affected by cancer and for identification of unaffected carriers of PGVs in cancer predisposition genes. We present, to our knowledge, the largest reported dataset of patients with MpBC who underwent germline genetic testing to describe the prevalence and types of PGVs in breast cancer susceptibility genes.

### Metaplastic breast cancer and BRCA1: first strong evidence of a link [^115gkaf1]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

In this issue Corso et al. have carried out the first reasonable sized germline series of testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 in metaplastic breast cancer. Their headline rate of 56% for BRCA1 is extremely high, but caution is necessary in translating this to all metaplastic cancers as there is likely a strong testing bias.

Metaplastic breast cancers are a heterogenous group of invasive breast cancers which share differentiation toward squamous or mesenchymal-appearing elements. The reported incidence of metaplastic breast cancer can vary from approximately 0.2 to 1.0% of breast cancers depending on their definition and have an incidence rate of 0.6–1.0 per 100,000 women per year in the United States inferring a lifetime risk of less than 1 in 1000. Assessment by intrinsic subtypes of 28 metaplastic breast tumours found the majority were claudin-low or basal-like intrinsic subtypes with most being triple negative. Metaplastic breast cancer has a poorer prognosis compared to other breast cancer pathologies possibly due to greater propensity to haematogenous spread rather than lymphatic, in contrast to Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) of no special type. Previous reports of treatment have also shown lower response rates to chemotherapy than would be expected for TNBC, perhaps suggesting a lower 'BRCAness' phenotype. Up until now there has been no comprehensive assessment of more than a handful of metaplastic breast cancers for germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2. A previous report of exome sequencing of 30 metaplastic breast cancers with paired normal tissue did not report any mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, although the genes were not specifically mentioned and it is possible, they excluded germline variants as they were primarily reporting somatic changes.

### Molecular alterations in metaplastic breast carcinoma [^115T6Cbh]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is a rare and heterogeneous subtype of breast carcinoma with a generally poor outcome, and few therapeutic options once disease recurs or progresses. Metaplastic carcinomas of the breast are usually of a larger size at diagnosis, with less frequent nodal metastasis compared with invasive ductal carcinoma no special type, and lack hormone and HER2 receptor expression. Recent research has revealed some potentially actionable genetic changes in a subset of these rare tumours. However, ongoing efforts to further characterise the genetic basis and the molecular alterations underlying the distinctive morphological and clinical characteristics of these tumours are needed in order to identify new targets for treatment. This review will describe the theories of pathogenesis of metaplastic breast carcinoma, and highlight genetic changes and potential therapeutic targets in this generally poor prognosis malignancy.

Discussion

We present clinical germline genetic testing results from 143 patients pathologically proven to have MpBC at our institution over a 13-year period of time. To our knowledge, this cohort represents the largest series to date of patients with MpBC analyzed for PGVs in breast cancer susceptibility genes. The study population was ascertained from a pathology database rather than from a genetics or clinical database to minimize bias and included patients regardless of age at breast cancer diagnosis, hormone receptor positivity, or ERBB2 amplification status. All pathology reports underwent repeated review by a breast pathologist, and all germline genetic testing reports underwent review by genetics providers. We found that 16.8% (95% CI, 11.1%-23.9%) of participants with MpBC who underwent germline testing had PGVs in breast cancer susceptibility genes, with PGVs seen across MpBC subtypes and with most PGVs occurring in BRCA1 (11.9% variant prevalence) and BRCA2 (3.5%).

The observed PGV prevalence is higher than the 5.03% frequency noted in a large, population-based study evaluating PGV prevalence in an unselected population of patients with breast cancer. This variant prevalence also exceeds or is comparable to the 7.8% to 13.2% breast cancer susceptibility gene PGV prevalence seen in other studies of patients referred for clinical genetic testing. Furthermore, the variant prevalence of 16.8% noted in the present study of patients with MpBC is relatively high in comparison with the PGV frequency estimates in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (10.6%-15.8%). The highest cited frequency of PGVs in individuals with triple-negative breast cancer was from a study in which the median age of participants was 40 years, whereas the median age of individuals included in the present analysis was 53 years (range, 20–79 years). Although formal cross-study comparisons are not possible, and although the 95% CI of our observed 16.8% PGV prevalence overlaps with prior studies, even the lower limit of this 95% CI suggests that a substantial proportion of these patients with MpBC have PGVs. Indeed, to our knowledge, the 16.8% PGV prevalence among patients with MpBC represents the highest variant frequency in any reported histologic subtype-specific population of patients with breast cancer, although not all those with metaplastic carcinoma were referred for clinical testing.

### Genetics of breast cancer: risk models, who to test, and management options [^1121tFGz]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Genetic testing plays an important role in assessing breast cancer risk and often the risk of other types of cancers. Accurate risk assessment and stratification represents a critical element of identifying who is best served by increased surveillance and consideration of other prevention or treatment options while also limiting overtreatment and unnecessary testing. The indications for testing will likely continue to expand, and ideally, more women with a genetic predisposition to breast cancer will be identified before they are diagnosed with breast cancer and thus have the option to consider effective screening and prevention management strategies.

Introduction

Metaplastic breast cancers (MpBCs) comprise a rare, heterogeneous group of breast cancers that demonstrate elements of squamous, mesenchymal, or neuroectodermal differentiation. These tumors represent 0.2% to 1% of primary breast cancers diagnosed in the United States, and are often associated with an advanced stage at diagnosis, decreased sensitivity to systemic therapies, and inferior outcomes. Histologically, World Health Organization classification describes 4 aggressive subgroups of MpBC: spindle cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, MpBC with heterologous mesenchymal differentiation, and mixed MpBCs. Lower-risk histologies are less common and include low-grade adenosquamous and fibromatosis-like MpBCs. The majority of MpBCs lack estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) expression. Several studies have examined the molecular features of this group, noting diversity in gene-expression profiling, a high frequency of acquired, somatic TP53 variants, and alterations affecting the PI3K-AKT1-MTOR pathway, including PIK3CA and PTEN variants.,

Genomic features of homologous recombination deficiency, including BRCA -like genomic signatures, have also been noted in metaplastic breast tumors across histologic subgroups. One series noted BRCA1 -like genomic profiles, based on the number of large-scale state transitions, in 31% of evaluated MpBCs. Limited data describe whether the observed BRCA -like molecular features in MpBC are indicative of, or explained by, a higher frequency of pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in breast cancer predisposition genes associated with DNA repair, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2. A recent study described a higher frequency of PGVs in BRCA1 in MpBC compared with other breast cancer subtypes; however, this study included only 23 patients with MpBC, and the patients were ascertained from a genetic counseling and testing clinic. Although PGVs in breast cancer susceptibility genes are present in approximately 5% to 10% of individuals with breast cancer overall and approximately 12% to 15.8% of those with triple-negative breast cancer, the frequency of PGVs specifically in MpBC has not been described.

### Germline pathogenic variants in metaplastic breast cancer patients and the emerging role of the BRCA1 gene [^116x1Gip]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is a rare, aggressive breast cancer (BC) histotype. Scarce information is available about MpBC genetic predisposition. Previous studies, mainly consisting of case reports, retrospective reviews and others on target therapies, pointed to a possible involvement of the BRCA1 gene in increasing MpBC risk, without ever confirming it. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed all BC patients counseled at our Institute for genetic testing of at least BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA) genes and we found that 23 (23/5226 = 0.4%) were affected by MpBC. About 65% (15/23) of MpBC patients harbored a germline pathogenic variant (PV): 13 in BRCA1 (86.7%), including two patients who received genetic testing for known familial PV, one in TP53 (6.7%), and one in MLH1 (6.7%). We observed a statistically different frequency of MpBC in patients who carried a PV in the BRCA genes (13/1114 = 1.2%) vs. all other BC patients (10/4112 = 0.2%) (p = 0.0002). BRCA carriers proved to have an increased risk of developing MpBC compared to all other BC patients who were tested for BRCA genes (OR = 4.47; 95% CI: 1.95–10.23). Notably, MpBCs were diagnosed in 2.1% (13/610) of BRCA1 carriers. No MpBCs were observed in BRCA2 carriers (0/498 = 0%), revealing a statistically significant difference between the prevalence of MpBCs in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers (p = 0.0015). Our results confirmed that BRCA1 is involved in MpBC predisposition. Further studies on unselected patients are needed to elucidate the authentic role of BRCA1 and to explore the possible implication of other genes in MpBC predisposition.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of this study include a relatively substantial sample size for this rare subtype of breast cancer; ascertainment of study participants from a pathology database rather than from a genetics database; population unselected for hormone receptor or ERBB2 status; pathologic confirmation of MpBC by breast-specific pathologists rather than identification of MpBC based on International Classification of Diseases codes, which can pose a challenge for classification of rare subtypes. Additional strengths include primary source documentation of germline genetic testing results for most included participants and completion of germline genetic testing in a clinical setting.

This study also has important limitations. Although the participants included in this study were not overtly selected based on age, hormone receptor positivity, or ERBB2 expression, patients who underwent testing were significantly younger at diagnosis than those who did not. This observation reflects referral for clinical germline genetic testing prompted by young age at diagnosis concordant with NCCN guidelines, which for several years recommended genetic testing referral for breast cancer diagnosis at or younger than 45 years. Younger age at diagnosis of tested patients may have enriched for carriers of PGVs. Two other potential differences between tested and untested populations may be (1) proportion of patients with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and (2) family history of cancer. We were unable to reliably obtain these data, although only 1 of the PGVs identified represents an Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation (Table 3). Furthermore, the study was conducted at an academic center that not only is a breast oncology referral center but has a dedicated genetics referral center, which may have augmented our observed prevalence by increasing the number of young patients with a family history included in our study population. This may have resulted in higher rates of PGVs in this population and may affect the external validity of our findings. A sensitivity analysis stratified by age would be an informative next step in a future larger study.

### Metaplastic breast cancer and BRCA1: first strong evidence of a link [^112EYfHR]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

In this edition of the journal Corso et al. assessed 5,226 breast cancer patients who underwent germline genetic testing for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, of which 23 (0.4%) were diagnosed with metaplastic breast cancers. They identified 13/23 (56.5%) with a BRCA1 pathogenic variant compared to 11.5% (597/5,203) with other breast cancer types (p < 0.0001). Interestingly one of the BRCA1 variants was found in one of the two cases with HER2 overexpression which is not usually a feature of BRCA1 cancers. Although HER2+ breast cancers that are negative for oestrogen and progesterone receptors are more likely to be BRCA1 driven than those that are oestrogen overexpressed. The preselection based on age and family history for testing in genetics is likely to mean that the rate of BRCA1 pathogenic variants in metaplastic breast cancer is about 10-fold less based on the detection rates in all breast cancers tested. This is because population testing studies outside clear founder populations only find around a 1% rate for BRCA1. For instance, 1.05% in the BRIDGES study compared to the 11.5% in Corso et al. This suggests a rate of nearer 5–6% for metaplastic breast cancers if all had been tested. The 0.4% of breast cancers tested suggest there was no particular bias towards testing metaplastic breast cancers as this is in the middle of the predicted range on a population basis. All the BRCA1 variant carriers were < 53 years of age at diagnosis and 7/13 had a family history of breast or ovarian cancer with 2 being tested for a known variant in the family. Although the detection rate in this study is extremely high this bias in testing should mean a cautious approach to assessing the likelihood of a BRCA1 pathogenic variant in those with a sporadic metaplastic breast cancer aged > 60 years as the detection rates are likely to be very much lower. For instance, the report of exome sequencing came from a cohort of 347 with over 2/3rds of tumours > 51years at diagnosis and no BRCA1/2 variants were reported in 30 metaplastic tumours. Although the age range in the 30 cases undergoing exome sequencing was not recorded. It seems extremely unlikely the authors would have overlooked BRCA1 variants if they had been seen, but large rearrangements that account for around 20% of BRCA1 pathogenic changes would not have been detected in this study.

### Breast cancer risk assessment models and high-risk screening [^1142tYDG]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

It is important to recognize that patients at high risk for breast cancer may benefit by following breast cancer screening paradigms that are more robust than those recommended for the average-risk population. Assessing individual cancer risk and using guidelines to determine if a patient is a candidate for genetic counseling and possibly genetic testing are essential components to comprehensive breast cancer screening.

### Screening and follow-up of the patient at high risk for breast cancer [^113RHUUD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Accurately defining a patient's risk of developing breast cancer is a challenging endeavor. Many factors have been implicated in the causation of breast cancer and quantifying them is difficult. Risk stratification is performed using population models, such as the Gail model, as well as the patient's personal and family history and genetic testing. The clinician who is facile with these components will not only be able to identify those patients at highest risk for whom heightened surveillance is recommended, but also to allay the fears of the average-risk patient and provide them reassurance. Patients who are at very high risk of developing breast cancer are BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation carriers, those with a personal history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ with associated family history, those who have undergone therapeutic or similarly significant radiation exposure, and those with a history of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation in the family of an untested individual. Patients with an elevated risk, but not in the very high risk category, are those with a family history of breast cancer, personal history of breast cancer, significantly dense breast tissue, hormone replacement therapy longer than 10 years, and a history of atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ without family history of breast cancer. Risk-reducing strategies include chemoprevention with tamoxifen or raloxifene and surgical prophylaxis with bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and/or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. A high-risk surveillance regimen includes annual mammography, annual magnetic resonance imaging in selected individuals, and semiannual clinical breast exams.

### Current management of lesions associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [^117Bp1co]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

High-risk breast lesions, which comprise benign lesions and in situ carcinomas (lobular carcinoma in situ and ductal carcinoma in situ), are clinically, morphologically, and biologically heterogeneous and are associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer development, albeit to varying degrees. Recognition and proactive management of such lesions can help to prevent progression to invasive disease, and might, therefore, reduce breast cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. However, this opportunity comes with the possibility of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, necessitating risk-based intervention. Notably, despite the progress in defining the molecular changes associated with carcinogenesis, alterations identifying the individuals with high-risk lesions that will progress to invasive carcinoma remain to be identified. Thus, until reproducible clinicopathological or molecular features predicting an individual's risk of breast cancer are found, management strategies must be defined by population-level risks as determined by models such as the Gail or IBIS models, as well as patient attitudes toward the risks and benefits of interventions. Herein, we review the contemporary approaches to diagnosis and management of high-risk breast lesions. Progress in this area will ultimately be dependent on the ability to individualize risk prediction through better definition of the key drivers in the carcinogenic process.

### Pathogenic germline variants in patients with metaplastic breast cancer [^113bgtQu]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

The present study was a retrospective cohort study evaluating the PGVs in breast cancer susceptibility genes in an institutional cohort of patients with MpBC. The hypothesis that individuals with MpBC have an enrichment of PGVs in genes associated with inherited breast cancer risk was formulated before data collection. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Pennsylvania. A US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver of consent was obtained before the conduct of this analysis to allow for review and reporting of clinical and germline genetic test results for patients with MpBC, including patients both living and deceased, from whom consent could not feasibly be obtained. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline was followed.

An initial query was conducted of the pathology database at the University of Pennsylvania for all breast pathology reports from surgical procedures and biopsies signed by a University of Pennsylvania breast pathologist from January 2010 to May 2023 containing the term metaplastic. A patient list corresponding to these pathology reports was then generated with duplicate entries removed. The electronic medical record (EMR) was then reviewed for each patient to assess for evidence of germline genetic testing. The following were deemed to be acceptable sources of evidence of germline genetic testing: (1) primary source documentation (ie, a genetic test report from a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratory available within the EMR [preferred]); (2) genetics progress or posttest counseling note; and (3) breast medical oncology progress note containing specifics regarding commercial panel sent, number of genes evaluated, or discussion of medical management in the context of germline variant. Germline testing reports or progress notes were then reviewed to examine whether a PGV was present in a breast cancer susceptibility gene. Genes considered to be associated with breast cancer susceptibility included BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CDH1, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CHEK2 (truncating and missense variants), ATM, RAD51C, RAD51D, BARD1, and NF1. When clinical genetic testing reports were available, variant classification was based on these reports as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance, consistent with American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines. All variants classified as pathogenic and likely pathogenic were considered to be PGVs for the purposes of this study. To confirm up-to-date classification of variants of uncertain significance, all variants of uncertain significance were queried in the ClinVar database, a freely accessible, publicly maintained database of reports of genetic variants and their clinical significance and pathogenicity that incorporates contributions of multiple clinical testing laboratories. All sources of germline genetic testing were reviewed and confirmed by a medical oncologist with an expertise in germline genetics (P.D.S.) and a genetic counselor (A. A.). Pathology reports for all included participants were reviewed by a breast pathologist (A.N.) to confirm MpBC diagnosis and for subtype classification. Metaplastic carcinomas were subtyped as epithelial-only carcinomas (including low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma, high-grade adenosquamous carcinoma, or pure squamous cell carcinoma), pure monophasic sarcomatoid carcinomas (spindle cell, matrix producing, heterologous), biphasic epithelial and sarcomatoid carcinomas, and low-grade fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma. The EMR was queried for clinical, demographic, and pathologic data, including age at diagnosis and ER, PR, and ERBB2 status.

### Metaplastic breast cancer and BRCA1: first strong evidence of a link [^114doUBj]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

The Corso et al. report clearly has implications for testing and suggest that metaplastic breast cancers should be treated similarly to all other TNBC when selecting for testing. Clearly more data is required on testing those with later onset metaplastic breast cancers. Poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have demonstrated activity in both adjuvant and metastatic settings in germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 Pathogenic Variant carriers and the diagnosis of metaplastic breast cancer should certainly not dissuade clinicians from ordering germline testing if other local criteria are met. The relative absence of variants in BRCA2 in this study should not deter testing in this gene as they have also been reported and indeed shown to respond to PARPi.

Two further pathogenic germline variants were identified in MLH1 and TP53. The TP53 associated tumour was a spindle cell sarcoma, but interestingly this was also the pathology in two of the BRCA1 carriers and indeed two BRCA1 carriers were noted to have squamous type. It is of note that other genes specifically associated with TNBC were not tested in all the samples and in particular more testing of PALB2, RAD51D, RAD51D, and BARD1 would be important in future studies. Overall, this is an important finding that has implications for testing and treatment of metaplastic breast cancer.

Conclusions

In summary, our assessment shows that family history and genetic and non-genetic risk stratification tools have the potential to complement one another to identify women at high risk in breast screening programs. The results add to the growing body of evidence to support a paradigm shift from an approach that is age-based to risk-based.

Results

An initial breast pathology database query for reports read at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania between 2010 and May 2023 containing the term metaplastic yielded 320 pathology reports. A review of the medical records associated with these 320 pathology reports and a breast pathologist review of the pathology reports themselves yielded 272 individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of MpBC. Those excluded were either duplicates (ie, a biopsy and surgical pathology specimen from the same individual) or did not have a confirmed diagnosis of MpBC (including individuals with nonbreast or nonmetaplastic breast tumors).

Of the 272 individuals diagnosed with MpBC, the median age was 58 years (range, 20–102 years). All participants were biological female patients. Complete pathology reports (including hormone receptor and ERBB2 addenda) were available for 264 individuals. Overall, 178 of 264 individuals (67.4%) had triple-negative breast cancer, 75 (28.4%) had ER- and/or PR-positive ERBB2-negative breast cancer, and 11 (4.2%) had ERBB2-positive breast cancer. Of 272 individuals, 143 (52.6%) had documentation of prior germline genetic testing based on criteria described (tested); 129 individuals had no evidence of germline genetic testing on review of the EMR, and these individuals were considered untested. Tested participants were significantly younger than those without testing (median age, 53 years [range, 20–79 years] vs 63 years [range, 29–102 years]; P < .001 (Table 1). Of 129 untested individuals, pathology reports for 121 individuals included hormone receptor and ERBB2 status. ER, PR, and ERBB2 status and overall breast cancer subtype did not differ between tested and untested individuals. Those with missing data were excluded from analysis.

Abbreviations: BC, breast cancer; ER, estrogen receptor; ERBB2, erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2; NA, not applicable; PGV, pathogenic germline variant; PR, progesterone receptor.

Germline testing result reports were available for review for 112 of 143 tested individuals (78.3%), and the remainder had germline test result documentation in genetics or oncology progress notes (Table 2). Details specifying the testing type or platform (single site, BRCA1/2 only, multigene panel) were available for 125 of the 143 tested individuals, including the 112 individuals with available reports as well as 13 of those with genetics or oncology progress notes indicating germline mutations (Table 2). Most individuals (75.2% [94 of 125]) had multigene panel testing, and, of these, most had more than 15 genes evaluated. The remaining participants had testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 only except for 1 individual who had single-site testing in the context of a known familial variant.

Table 2.
Details of Germline Genetic Testing Including the Source of Documentation and Number of Genes Evaluated

Twenty-four individuals (16.8% [95% CI, 11.1%-23.9%]) with germline testing had PGVs in breast cancer susceptibility genes, including BRCA1 (n = 17 [70.8%]), BRCA2 (n = 5 [20.8%]), PALB2 (n = 1 [4.2%]), and CHEK2 (n = 1 [4.2%]). This corresponds to a BRCA1 prevalence of 11.9% (n = 17), a BRCA2 prevalence of 3.5% (n = 5), a PALB2 prevalence of 0.7% (n = 1), and a CHEK2 prevalence of 0.7% (n = 1) among the 143 individuals who were tested. Almost all known PGVs were unique; only 2 patients bore the same Polish founder variant (BRCA1 c.181T > G [p.C61G]) (Table 3). Pathogenic variants in genes not typically associated with breast cancer were also present in 4 patients. These included PGVs in MUTYH, HOXB13, CDKN2A, and SDHA. Variants of uncertain significance were found in 31 individuals.

### Phenotypic and molecular dissection of metaplastic breast cancer and the prognostic implications [^111xpU7V]. The Journal of Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is relatively rare but accounts for a significant proportion of global breast cancer mortality. This group is extremely heterogeneous and by definition exhibits metaplastic change to squamous and/or mesenchymal elements, including spindle, squamous, chondroid, osseous, and rhabdomyoid features. Clinically, patients are more likely to present with large primary tumours (higher stage), distant metastases, and overall, have shorter 5-year survival compared to invasive carcinomas of no special type. The current World Health Organisation (WHO) diagnostic classification for this cancer type is based purely on morphology - the biological basis and clinical relevance of its seven sub-categories are currently unclear. By establishing the Asia-Pacific MBC (AP-MBC) Consortium, we amassed a large series of MBCs (n = 347) and analysed the mutation profile of a subset, expression of 14 breast cancer biomarkers, and clinicopathological correlates, contextualising our findings within the WHO guidelines. The most significant indicators of poor prognosis were large tumour size (T3; p = 0.004), loss of cytokeratin expression (lack of staining with pan-cytokeratin AE1/3 antibody; p = 0.007), EGFR overexpression (p = 0.01), and for 'mixed' MBC, the presence of more than three distinct morphological entities (p = 0.007). Conversely, fewer morphological components and EGFR negativity were favourable indicators. Exome sequencing of 30 cases confirmed enrichment of TP53 and PTEN mutations, and intriguingly, concurrent mutations of TP53, PTEN, and PIK3CA. Mutations in neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) were also overrepresented [16.7% MBCs compared to ∼5% of breast cancers overall; enrichment p = 0.028; mutation significance p = 0.006 (OncodriveFM)], consistent with published case reports implicating germline NF1 mutations in MBC risk. Taken together, we propose a practically minor but clinically significant modification to the guidelines: all WHO_1 mixed-type tumours should have the number of morphologies present recorded, as a mechanism for refining prognosis, and that EGFR and pan-cytokeratin expression are important prognostic markers.

Statistical Analysis

For analysis, descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample. Two-sided t tests were used to compare ages between groups, and, given the small sample sizes, Fisher exact tests were performed to compare proportions. A 2-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Exact 95% CIs were calculated for the prevalence of PGVs. The statistical analysis was performed from August 15 to November 23, 2024, using Excel, version 16.76 (Microsoft); Stata, version 18 (StataCorp LLC); and SPSS Statistics, version 30.0.0.0 (IBM) to perform these functions.

### Assessing, counseling, and treating patients at high risk for breast cancer [^112qNm2p]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Identifying patients at high risk of carrying pathogenic variants in genes is a crucial part of providing both accurate counseling and evidence-based treatment recommendations. Current risk assessment models have strengths and weaknesses that may limit their applicability to specific clinical circumstances. Clinicians must have knowledge regarding variations in available models, how they should be used, and what data they can expect from specific models. In addition, indications for genetic testing are expanding, and the adoption of next-generation sequencing has allowed the creation of multigene testing panels. Complex consequences of panel testing have included an increase in the incidence of identifying variants of uncertain significance and the identification of pathogenic variants in genes for which treatment guidelines are not available. Women diagnosed with breast cancer who carry pathogenic variants in genes with proven associations with breast cancer (BRCA1/2) or highly likely associations (PTEN, PALB2) require additional risk assessment to facilitate treatment decisions that will limit in-breast tumor recurrence and contralateral breast cancer.

### The potential of genetics in identifying women at lower risk of breast cancer [^115fXmWY]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can genetic information identify women for whom it is safe to delay mammogram screening?

Findings

In this case-control study of 25 591 women, 2338 (9.1%) were classified as having low genetic risk for breast cancer; these women exhibited significantly later onset of breast cancer compared with average-risk or high-risk counterparts, indicating a potential to defer mammogram screening by 5 to 10 years.

Meaning

Delaying the age to start mammogram screenings for women at low genetic risk could optimize health care resource allocation.

### Pathogenic germline variants in patients with metaplastic breast cancer [^112bDxfx]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Most PGVs seen in the present study were in BRCA1 (11.9% PGV prevalence, comprising 71% of all breast cancer susceptibility PGVs seen). An association between MpBC and BRCA1 has previously been suggested in case report form, and in 2 small series. Rodríguez-Fernández et alevaluated the histology of 93 patients with breast cancer and known germline variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2; 3.2% of known affected carriers had metaplastic carcinoma compared with 0.8% (25 of 3157) of a genetically unselected reference population. Corso and colleaguesreported on a series of 23 individuals who were referred for and received genetic testing and who were found to have MpBC. They noted PGVs in breast cancer susceptibility genes in 14 of 23 individuals (60.9%), including in BRCA1 (n = 13) and TP53 (n = 1). Unlike the present report, these studies ascertained patients on the basis of a known breast cancer gene PGV or based on referral to genetics providers, indicating an enrichment of individuals with suspected variants; indeed, 2 individuals in the latter report were referred to genetics due to known familial BRCA1 PGVs. An association between MpBC and NF1 has also been discussed in case report form, although no NF1 variants were seen in the present report. No PGVs were seen in the breast cancer susceptibility genes RAD51C, RAD51D, or BARD1, all of which are known to be associated with triple-negative breast cancer, although not all patients had multigene panel tests including these genes.

Polygenic risk

Pathogenic variants in moderate‐ and high‐penetrance susceptibility genes explain approximately 25–30% of heritable breast cancer risk. A further 18% is attributable to polygenic risk, pertaining to variable combinations of hundreds of common low‐penetrance breast cancer susceptibility alleles, identified using population‐based GWAS. These low‐penetrance genetic variants are often located in non‐coding regions of DNA and individually confer a small risk of breast cancer (odds ratio < 1.5). However, the magnitude of breast cancer risk can be substantial when the sum of individual risk is assessed, expressed as the polygenic risk score. For women in the top centile of the polygenic risk score based on 313 confirmed risk loci, there was a ~ 33% lifetime risk of breast cancer, with a fourfold increased risk of developing ER‐positive breast cancer compared to women in the middle quintile.

### Genetic predisposition syndromes and their management [^113uS1w1]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Apart from BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53, more than a dozen breast cancer susceptibility genes have been identified. Recognizing affected individuals depends on evaluation of cancer family history and recognition of certain phenotypic markers on physical examination. Genetic testing provides a powerful tool for individualized risk stratification. Mutation carriers have several options for managing risk, including lifestyle alterations, enhanced surveillance, chemoprevention, and prophylactic surgery. Genetic counseling and testing should be considered in the initial evaluation of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer because this information contributes to surgical decisions, radiation therapy options, and systemic therapy choices.

### Metaplastic breast carcinoma: update on histopathology and molecular alterations [^113NB2tb]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context —

Metaplastic carcinoma is a rare, triple-negative carcinoma of the breast that exhibits transformation of part or all of its glandular carcinomatous component into a nonglandular, or metaplastic, component. The World Health Organization currently recognizes 5 variants of metaplastic carcinoma based on their histologic appearance.

Objective —

To review the histologic classifications, differential diagnosis, prognosis, and recent laboratory studies of metaplastic breast carcinoma.

Data Sources —

We reviewed recently published studies that collectively examine metaplastic carcinomas, including results from our own research.

Conclusions —

Metaplastic breast carcinoma has a broad spectrum of histologic patterns, often leading to a broad differential diagnosis. Diagnosis can typically be rendered by a combination of morphology and immunohistochemical staining for high-molecular-weight cytokeratins and p63. Recent studies elucidate new genes and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of metaplastic carcinoma, including the downregulation of CCN6 and WNT pathway gene mutations, and provide a novel MMTV-Cre; Ccn6 fl/fl knockout disease-relevant mouse model to test new therapies.

### Metaplastic breast carcinoma: tumour histogenesis or dedifferentiation? [^116nLZCy]. The Journal of Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Global gene expression profiling studies have classified breast cancer into molecular classes, some of which show similarity to normal mammary cells (ie luminal and basal subtypes) with a subsequent histogenetic implication that reinforced the perception that the phenotype of breast cancer reflects the cell of origin. However, it remains to be determined whether phenotypic changes are the result of malignant transformation of particular cancer stem cells (histogenesis) or specific genetic hits occurring at various stages of carcinogenesis (dedifferentiation). We sought to test the hypothesis that dedifferentiation may be the more likely explanation using in vivo clinical data. Our findings support the hypothesis that at least some metaplastic carcinomas are derived from phenotypic transition from conventional mammary adenocarcinoma either at the in-situ, primary invasive stage or at a distant metastatic site. This observation argues against the cell of origin theory (histogenesis) for breast carcinogenesis and favours the concept of tumour dedifferentiation at later stages.

### The 21-gene recurrence score in special histologic subtypes of breast cancer [^112doAV4]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context —

Recurrence score (RS) testing was developed and validated in invasive ductal and rare lobular carcinomas, although it is used for all special types of breast cancers.

Objective —

To determine association of histologic type (HT) and RS, specifically high-risk RS.

Design —

We used RSs linked to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program registries of invasive breast cancers diagnosed in 2004 through 2015. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate association between HT and high-risk RS. Relationships between HT and low-, intermediate-, and high-risk RS were compared with χ2 test. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using log-rank test.

Results —

A total of 110318 patients had RS testing. Of these, 23220 (21%) had low, 70822 (64.2%) intermediate, and 16276 (14.8%) high RS. Histologic types were 80476 (73%) ductal, 12713 (11.5%) lobular, 12449 (11.3%) mixed, 2151 (2%) mucinous, 610 (0.6%) tubular, 382 (0.4%) micropapillary, 365 (0.3%) salivary, 208 (0.2%) papillary, 49 (0.04%) medullary, 26 (0.02%) metaplastic, 26 (0.02%) neuroendocrine, and 863 (0.8%) unknown. The distribution of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk RS was significantly different among HTs. Higher percentages of high-risk RS were identified in patients with ductal, medullary, and metaplastic types (P < .001). The odds of having high-risk RS were lower for some HTs, including micropapillary, after multivariable adjustment (P < .05). The low number of estrogen receptor-positive medullary and metaplastic carcinomas tested had higher odds of having high-risk RS. In T1 and T2 tumors, when ductal, lobular, mixed, and other types combined were compared, the mortality was different.

Conclusions —

This population-based study of RS in HTs showed high-risk RSs are identified in traditionally good prognostic subtypes. Micropapillary carcinoma has lower odds of high-risk RS even after multivariable adjustment.

### Metaplastic breast carcinoma: clinicopathologic features and recurrence score results from a population-based database [^117Vm4LJ]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare, aggressive form of cancer comprising epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The purpose of this study was to use population-based data to review the clinicopathologic, molecular features, and outcomes of MBC.

Methods

Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) data were used to identify MBC and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), no special type (NOS) between 2004 and 2015. Results from Oncotype DX's 21-gene assay linked to SEER registries were included for hormone receptor (HR)-positive tumors. χ 2 analysis was performed to determine the differences between MBC and IDC. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used for breast cancer specific death (BCSD).

Results

Compared with IDC, NOS (n = 509,864), MBC (n = 3876) were more likely to present at an older age, be black, have negative lymph nodes, be > 2 cm, grade 3, and triple negative (TN). All subtypes [HR-positive/human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, HR-positive/HER2-positive, HR-negative/HER2-positive, and TN] had higher BCSD than IDC, NOS. 22.3% of MBC cases were HR-positive. HR-positive MBCs tested for a recurrence score (RS) 65% were high-risk compared with 16.8% of IDC, NOS. Within the MBC cohort, no significant differences in BCSD were identified with respect to different molecular subtypes. In a fully adjusted model, TN or HER2-positive status did not adversely affect BCSD compared with HR-positive MBC.

Conclusions

All molecular subtypes of MBC had a poorer prognosis compared with IDC, NOS. The different molecular subtypes of MBC did not affect the BCSD. HR-positive MBC patients had a significantly higher high-risk RS than IDC, NOS patients.

### Whole-exome sequencing of metaplastic breast carcinoma indicates monoclonality with associated ductal carcinoma component [^112KVx6y]. Clinical Cancer Research (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose: Although most human cancers display a single histology, there are unusual cases where two or more distinct tissue types present within a primary tumor. One such example is metaplastic breast carcinoma, a rare but aggressive cancer with a heterogeneous histology, including squamous, chondroid, and spindle cells. Metaplastic carcinomas often contain an admixed conventional ductal invasive or in situ mammary carcinoma component, and are typically triple-negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2 amplification/overexpression. An unanswered question is the origin of metaplastic breast cancers. While they may arise independently from their ductal components, their close juxtaposition favors a model that postulates a shared origin, either as two derivatives from the same primary cancer or one histology as an outgrowth of the other. Understanding the mechanism of development of these tumors may inform clinical decisions. Experimental Design: We performed exome sequencing for paired metaplastic and adjacent conventional invasive ductal carcinomas in 8 patients and created a pipeline to identify somatic variants and predict their functional impact, without having normal tissue. We then determined the genetic relationships between the histologically distinct compartments. Results: In each case, the tumor components have nearly identical landscapes of somatic mutation, implying that the differing histologies do not derive from genetic clonal divergence. Conclusions: A shared origin for tumors with differing histologies suggests that epigenetic or noncoding changes may mediate the metaplastic phenotype and that alternative therapeutic approaches, including epigenetic therapies, may be required for metaplastic breast cancers.

### Risk stratification in ductal carcinoma in situ: the role of genomic testing [^114BByaZ]. Current Oncology Reports (2013). Low credibility.

From the earliest days of conservative surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, there have been attempts to identify patients who may not need postoperative radiation. Randomized prospective trials have not identified a population for whom there is no benefit to radiation. However, decades of studies of clinical, radiological and pathologic correlates to local recurrence have led to criteria for a patient subgroup at low risk for local recurrence after omission of radiation. Gene expression profiling for invasive breast cancer has been used to identify patients at low, intermediate or high risk for distant recurrence. Application of this methodology to DCIS aims to identify patients at low, intermediate or high risk for local recurrence. Whether this method of risk stratification will prove more accurate than clinical, radiological and pathologic risk stratification, or identify patients with little to no clinical benefit from radiation, remains to be seen.

### Consensus guidelines on genetic ' testing for hereditary breast cancer from the American Society of Breast Surgeons [^115v1AyT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this consensus guideline is to outline recommendations for genetic testing that medical professionals can use to assess hereditary risk for breast cancer.

Methods

Literature review included large datasets, basic and clinical science publications, and recent updated national guidelines. Genetic testing to assess hereditary risk of cancer is a complex, broad, and dynamic area of medical research. The dominant focus of this guideline is limited in scope to breast cancer.

Results

There is a lack of consensus among experts regarding which genes among many should be tested in different clinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the understanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in many genes.

Conclusions

Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer. Recent data are reviewed that support genetic testing being offered to each patient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic testing is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with other genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local treatment recommendations. Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. Genetic testing should be made available to patients without a history of breast cancer who meet National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Finally, variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable and these patients should be managed based on their individual risk factors.

### Consensus guidelines on genetic ' testing for hereditary breast cancer from the American Society of Breast Surgeons [^111VW6Vb]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary of Data Reviewed

The National Cancer Institute estimates for 2018 were that more than 266,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer would be diagnosed in the United States, and more than 40,000 patients would die from the disease. Approximately 10% of breast cancers are associated with a pathogenic germline variant in one of several different genes. More than 50% of pathogenic germline variants are mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.–Using genetic testing to identify patients who are at increased risk to develop breast cancer enables patients to take steps to reduce this risk. There are several risk management strategies available for individuals at increased risk (e.g. chemoprevention along with enhanced screening; risk reducing surgeries).–Unfortunately, in the current state of medical practice, a significant number of pathogenic mutation carriers remain undetected and undiagnosed. These are largely women with "moderate penetrance" mutations, but even women with BRCA1 or 2 mutations may not be identified.–There is an unmet challenge to improve our identification and diagnosis of patients who have an inherited increased lifetime risk of breast cancer.

Access to Genetic Counseling and Testing

There are fewer barriers to genetic testing now than previously, and testing is less costly and being offered by more labs. The indications for who should be offered testing are ever increasing — each guideline update casting a wider net, and there is more public awareness. However, some barriers remain — one of which is the limited availability of genetic counseling nationwide for patients and their family members.–

Increased access to testing would likely lead to more patients pursuing testing and improving rates of identification of gene carriers. Breast surgeons are well positioned to be a resource for patients who may benefit from testing. Breast surgeons can identify individuals who are suitable for testing, inform patients of the risks and benefits, provide access to genetic testing, and also discuss risk management strategies for those patients who test positive. For patients with less common mutations, strong consideration should be given to consultation with cancer genetics specialists.–

Hereditary Breast Cancer Syndromes

Hereditary mutations to be considered include BRCA 1&2, PALB2, and other hereditary breast cancer syndromes, which include but are not limited to Li-Fraumeni syndrome (TP53 pathogenic variant), Cowden syndrome (PTEN pathogenic variant), hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome (CDH1 pathogenic variant), and Peutz-Jegher syndrome (STK11 pathogenic variant).

Molecular genomic testing provides clinicians with both prognostic and (sometimes) predictive information that can help individualize treatment and decrease the risk of over- or under-treatment. We review the genomic tests that are currently available for clinical use in management of breast cancer, discuss ongoing research related to validating and expanding their utility in different patient populations, and explain why it is important for surgeons to know how to incorporate these tools into their clinical practice in order to individualize patient treatment, reduce unnecessary morbidity, and, accordingly, improve outcomes.

### Resource guide: surgical management of benign or high-risk lesions [^11458YPq]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Breast high-risk lesion evaluation and excision decision-making — Patients with clinical or imaging findings that are discordant with core needle biopsy (CNB) histology should undergo excision, and consideration can be given to repeat biopsy if the initial biopsy procedure was felt to be inadequate. Selective excision for the remaining patients is recommended, and the final decision to excise depends on shared decision making with the patient and includes careful clinical, imaging, and pathology concordance assessment with multidisciplinary input, patient-specific estimates of the risk of upgrade to malignancy, disclosure of operative and cosmetic risks, and whether the patient can or will comply with follow-up. All patients should undergo comprehensive breast cancer risk assessment and be considered for risk reducing medication and high-risk screening as appropriate; the presence of a high-risk lesion is not an indication for genetic testing; however, all patients should be evaluated for personal or family history that would indicate that genetic evaluation is appropriate. Certain high-risk lesions such as lobular neoplasia and atypical ductal hyperplasia are associated with elevated lifetime breast cancer risk which is not mitigated by surgical excision, and these recommendations assume that the pathology and imaging results are deemed concordant.

### Risk assessment and management of high risk familial breast cancer [^115RFXXt]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

The demand for genetic services by women with a family history of breast cancer has increased exponentially over the last few years. It is important that risks to women are accurately assessed and that processes are in place for appropriate counselling and management. The classification of risk into average, moderate, and high, depending upon the assessed lifetime risk of breast cancer, allows for the management of moderate risk women within cancer units and high risk women within the regional genetic centres. Management of high risk women includes discussion of options including screening, chemoprevention, and preventive surgery. The majority of these options are still unproven in the long term and continuing research is needed for their evaluation. Mutation screening and predictive testing are now a reality for a minority of families, allowing for a more informed basis for decisions regarding management options.

### Tumour morphology predicts PALB2 germline mutation status [^11523U9f]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Mutations in PALB2 are rare (varying from 0.1% to 1.5% depending upon the population) but for women carrying them, and their relatives who might also be mutation carriers, knowing their mutation status has the potential to be clinically important as carriers are at high risk of breast cancer. Identified mutation carriers could be informed of optimal, risk appropriate clinical screening and treatment. Potential therapies could include those that target homologous DNA repair dysfunction. As PALB2 mutations have also been associated with increased risk of developing a second breast cancer, risk reducing surgery and treatment might also be considered by PALB2 mutation carriers. The integration of PALB2 mutation testing into clinical practice is still in progress and strategies that effectively identify potential PALB2 mutation carriers could help facilitate this important process.

Characterisation of the morphology of breast cancers arising in PALB2 mutation carriers and non-carriers offers the possibility of identifying tumour morphological features predictive of an underlying germline PALB2 mutation, as they have been shown for underlying BRCA1 mutations. This could be conducted at the time of diagnosis and therefore, be used to facilitate personalised treatment strategies, as well as enabling identification of those relatives who have also inherited a similar high breast cancer risk.

Breast cancer tumour morphology can be suggestive of underlying familial, if not heritable, risk. We recently reported that, in a population-based sample of 375 women with early-onset breast cancer cases with no known high-risk mutation in a breast cancer susceptibility gene, minimal sclerosis, presence of circumscribed growth, extensive intraductal carcinoma and lobular growth patterns were independent predictors of increased breast cancer risk for their first-degree female relatives (2.0-fold to 3.3-fold increased risk for relatives, P < 0.02 for all listed features). Relatives of the 128 (34%) index cases with none of these 4 features were at population risk (standardised incidence ratio = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.57–1.85), while relatives of the 37 (10%) index cases with two or more features were at high risk (standardised incidence ratio = 5.18, 95% CI = 3.22–8.33).

### Breast cancer risk assessment: a guide for clinicians using the NCCN breast cancer risk reduction guidelines [^111VoLXz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2003). Low credibility.

Breast cancer, a complex and heterogeneous disease, is the most common malignancy diagnosed in women in the United States, with over 180,000 new cases and approximately 44,000 deaths per year. Breast cancer risk is influenced by a large number of factors, including age, family history, reproductive and hormonal history, proliferative breast conditions, physical activity, diet, and environmental exposures. These factors all interact in a complex manner to contribute to the risk of developing breast cancer. Because the interactions between risk factors are poorly understood at the molecular level, it is difficult to accurately evaluate the breast cancer risk of a given person presenting with an individual constellation of factors. To better define the population at increased risk that may warrant specific intervention, several models exist to estimate a woman's risk for developing breast cancer and for harboring a germline mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene. This article summarizes these models and gives brief guidelines about which model may be preferable given a specific family history.

### Pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes predispose to ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast [^115eLXNd]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

Due to a limited understanding of genetic predisposition to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, current guidelines for germline genetic testing do not distinguish between DCIS and invasive disease. To personalize germline genetic testing, a comprehensive assessment of genetic predisposition to DCIS was conducted using clinical testing and population-based cohorts. This study found that pathogenic variants (PV) in ATM, BRCA1, CHEK2, and PALB2 were associated with moderate risk and PV in BRCA2 were associated with high risk of DCIS. The incidence of contralateral breast cancer among BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 PV carriers with DCIS was 23% over 15 years. These findings establish that predisposition gene PV are associated with an increased risk of DCIS and may inform the selection of appropriate risk management strategies in germline PV carriers.

### Male breast cancer in the age of genetic testing: an opportunity for early detection, tailored therapy, and surveillance [^115XqhdE]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

In detection, treatment, and follow-up, male breast cancer has historically lagged behind female breast cancer. On the whole, breast cancer is less common among men than among women, limiting utility of screening, yet the incidence of male breast cancer is rising, and there are men at high risk for breast cancer. While women at high risk for breast cancer are well characterized, with clearly established guidelines for screening, supplemental screening, risk prevention, counseling, and advocacy, men at high risk for breast cancer are poorly identified and represent a blind spot in public health. Today, more standardized genetic counseling and wider availability of genetic testing are allowing identification of high-risk male relatives of women with breast cancer, as well as men with genetic mutations predisposing to breast cancer. This could provide a new opportunity to update our approach to male breast cancer. This article reviews male breast cancer demographics, risk factors, tumor biology, and oncogenetics; recognizes how male breast cancer differs from its female counterpart; highlights its diagnostic challenges; discusses the implications of the widening clinical use of multigene panel testing; outlines current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (version 1, 2018) for high-risk men; and explores the possible utility of targeted screening and surveillance. Understanding the current state of male breast cancer management and its challenges is important to shape future considerations for care. Shifting the paradigm of male breast cancer detection toward targeted precision medicine may be the answer to improving clinical outcomes of this uncommon disease. © RSNA, 2018.

### Genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer [^114AqjG3]. ASBrS (2019). High credibility.

Impact of genetic testing results on management recommendations — identification of patients with pathogenic variants in these genes can influence management in terms of high-risk screening and risk reduction as well as therapeutic options related to surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies. For example, identifying that a breast cancer patient has a BRCA1 pathogenic variant provides that patient the opportunity to learn of her elevated risk for contralateral breast cancer as well as of ovarian cancer and to make educated decisions to reduce those risks, and studies are underway to determine whether these patients also might benefit from PARP inhibitors being included in their adjuvant therapy regimen. Another example is that radiation is relatively contraindicated in patients with TP53 pathogenic variants (associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome) due to their increased risk of developing radiation-induced secondary malignancies. Identifying a patient who has a pathogenic variant that indicates high hereditary breast cancer risk can have a profound impact on that patient's health and management, and it has potential impact on that patient's family members who should be counselled to consider testing for the mutation identified in the family with results that can guide risk of breast cancer development and consideration of risk management strategies.

### Racial disparities in breast cancer genetic testing may be mitigated by counseling [^115rj5WS]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death for women in the United States. It is estimated that 10% of these breast cancer diagnoses are attributed to pathogenic variants. More than 50% of these pathogenic variants are secondary to high penetrance genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, which confer a 50–85% lifetime likelihood of developing breast cancer. Knowledge of this risk is imperative, because it alters surveillance, surgical interventions, and therapeutic recommendations for patients and their families. For example, patients and relatives may be offered prophylactic surgery because of their increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Having an increased risk of breast cancer also alters screening recommendations. Patients with a lifetime risk of ≥ 20% receive recommendations to undergo annual breast MRI and to begin screening 10 years before the age of diagnosis of the affected family member. If patients identify that they have a pathologenic variant, predisposing them to breast cancer, they would have increased surveillance to identify cancers earlier. Recommendations on which patients should be tested for pathogenic variants differ between cancer and breast societies. The NCCN recommends testing for patients diagnosed with breast cancer ≤ 50 years and those at high risk for other reasons while American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends testing for patients diagnosed with breast cancer ≤ 65 years or those at high risk for other reasons. The American Society of Breast Surgeons have the most inclusive recommendations; they published an updated consensus on genetic testing in 2019 stating that all patients with a personal history of breast cancer or with a strong family should be offered genetic testing. Therefore, there exists some variability on how breast surgeons and oncologists refer patients.

### Managing the breast in patients who test positive for hereditary breast cancer [^112dUVtM]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose and Methods

The patient who tests positive for hereditary breast cancer has several important decisions to make regarding management of the breasts. Before making an informed decision, the physician must first review the screening assessment to make sure that the patient does not harbor an undiagnosed breast malignancy. In the absence of a malignancy, the management options for the breast range from nonoperative surveillance to prophylactic mastectomy to prevent cancer. In the event that a breast malignancy is diagnosed after a positive genetic test, implications for management of both the affected and the unaffected breast must be considered.

Results and Discussion

The clinical assessment of the patient who tests positive is discussed. If routine pretest mammograms were negative, should additional diagnostic studies be performed to exclude an undetected/occult malignancy, and if so, what are the roles of magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, digital mammogram, and detection of breast cancer circulating tumor cells? Medical management may include increased surveillance and chemopreventative therapy, including tamoxifen and oral contraceptives. Surgical interventions may be undertaken to reduce risk in people with a genetic susceptibility gene for breast or ovarian cancer; risk-reducing surgical options include mastectomy with or without reconstruction and nipple-sparing techniques. Finally, we discuss management decisions for women who test positive and who are diagnosed with a primary breast cancer, compared to women who have no obvious primary tumor but test positive.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common solid tumor in women and there are few means of preventing it other than risk-reducing surgery. Germline genetic testing identifies pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (hereafter referred to as mutations) in over 12 genes that confer a moderate to high risk of breast cancer, which begins in early adulthood. The greatest burden is attributable to mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, which confer high risks of breast and ovarian cancer. In the United States, between 5 and 10% of breast cancers are thought to be due to inherited genetic mutations, compared to 28% of ovarian, 7% of prostate, and 15% of colorectal cancers. Support for universal germline testing after a breast cancer diagnosis is growing, however; targeted guidelines miss many patients. About one-third of patients diagnosed with breast cancer meet guidelines for genetic testing at the time of diagnosis, but many don't receive it. Katz et al. examined women aged 20–79 years of age diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in 2014–2015 reported to the Georgia and Los Angeles County SEER registries, surveying them seven months and six years after diagnosis. Patients were asked about genetic counseling, testing, and communication with relatives about results. Seventy-two percent of those that met criteria for testing at diagnosis (28% of the total group), underwent testing initially, with 53.3% of the additional 20% that met criteria at a later time point undergoing testing later. Only 3.4% had direct-to-consumer testing, suggesting that these tests don't currently substitute for clinical testing. There was no difference in the uptake of testing by race.

Identification of healthy individuals harboring these mutations allows for early detection and risk-reduction strategies, and in cancer patients, targeted treatment strategies. Our discussion focuses primarily on carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations because these are the most studied. In general, testing will be conducted for a wide range of cancer predisposing genes (multigene panel testing) but all panels include both BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Some have argued that all breast cancer patients be tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, however, in most jurisdictions, testing is limited to those considered to be at high risk for carrying a mutation. Risk factors for carrying a mutation include a personal or family history of breast cancer (on either the maternal or paternal side; especially age at onset of 50 years or younger, triple-negative breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer, or male breast cancer) pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, or metastatic prostate cancer.

### Genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer [^111hQgc6]. ASBrS (2019). High credibility.

Genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer — limitations and risk interpretation are emphasized as follows: Genetic testing is one of several tools for assessing breast cancer risk, and not every genetic test yields a straightforward answer with clear guidance on how to proceed for optimal care; patients should be made aware that negative test results do not necessarily mean they are not at increased risk for developing breast cancer. Counseling should consider the broader lifetime risk context beyond inherited risk, including age, medical history, lifestyle, exposures, and family history, and for patients who test positive for a pathogenic variant, detailed understanding of the variant and its penetrance is important because penetrance varies among hereditary cancer syndromes and not all carriers of pathogenic genetic variants will develop breast cancer, with risk varying by gene and likely the variant as well. Examples include that some types of CHEK2 and ATM variants have low penetrance while other types are more highly penetrant, and tools such as ask2me.org and the BRCA Decision Tool can be useful, although these calculators are constrained by the limitations of the studies that provide the underlying odds ratios used to generate the absolute risk estimates and do not account for modification by age, mutation position, family history, or polygenic background risk.

### Prognostic factors in metaplastic carcinoma of the breast: a multi-institutional study [^1174EEWD]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Mammary parenchymal cells show a high degree of phenotypic plasticity, which is seen in both benign and malignant lesions. Conventional (ductal/no specific type) invasive breast carcinoma occasionally shows minor components of metaplastic elements with squamous and/or mesenchymal appearances. However, when the metaplastic components form a significant proportion (usually > 10%, although some authors have used different cutoffs including < 10%, ⩾20% or ⩾50%) the term metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is used. Although MBC is rare comprising 0.3%–1.5% of breast cancer, it is recognized to be a heterogeneous group of tumours with multiple subtypes reflecting variable histological appearances. There is a perception that MBC is an aggressive tumour with poor outcome. This is mainly based on previous studies of MBC that included either a limited number of cases or a population-based database without histological confirmation and with different clinical stages (i.e. stage I to IV) and ethnicity. In addition, some molecular studies have shown some shared characteristics between MBC and the aggressive high grade basal-like class of ductal carcinoma. As a consequence, the outcome and prognostic risk stratification of patients with MBC remain uncertain. Clinicopathological variables that are well-validated in conventional invasive breast carcinoma may behave differently in MBC. Therefore, in this large international multicentre study of MBC with histological confirmation and long-term follow-up, we aimed to assess the prognostic value of the different clinicopathological variables and determine its outcome compared with grade, node and receptor matched conventional invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type.

However, in patients with a suggestive personal and/or family history, a specific predisposing gene is identified in < 30% of cases. Up to 25% of hereditary cases are due to a mutation in one of the few identified rare, but highly penetrant genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, TP53, CDH1, and STK11), which confer up to an 80% lifetime risk of breast cancer. An additional 2%-3% of cases are due to a mutation in a rare, moderate-penetrance gene (e.g. CHEK2, BRIP1, ATM, and PALB2), each associated with a twofold increase in risk. Prediction models suggest that there are unlikely to be additional yet to be identified high-penetrance genes. Investigation of common, low-penetrance alleles contributing to risk in a polygenic fashion has yielded a small number of suggestive single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but the contributive risk of an individual SNP is quite small. Mutation testing is currently recommended for individual genes in the appropriate clinical setting where there is a high index of suspicion for a specific mutated gene or syndrome. Next-generation sequencing offers a new venue for risk assessment. At the present time, there are clear clinical guidelines for individuals with a mutation in a high-penetrance gene. Otherwise, standard models are used to predict an individual's lifetime risk by clinical and family history rather than genomic information.

### Estimating cumulative risks for breast cancer for carriers of variants in uncommon genes [^113wWuA6]. Familial Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

The rapid clinical embrace of next generation multigene cancer predisposition panels has resulted in discovery of DNA variants in genes for which very limited data on penetrance has been published. Evidence for increased risks associated with these genes is often expressed in odds ratios and studies often were conducted on a priori high risk cohorts, i.e. those with young onset disease and/or positive family histories. Despite these limitations, one can estimate cumulative risks, which may be useful for health care providers who are counselling individuals on their results. We present cumulative risks for several under-studied genes and provide generic information that can be extrapolated to data still emerging.

### Pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes predispose to ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast [^116UWkJr]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Although this is the largest reported study of genetic associations for DCIS, the sample size was still a limitation, in that PV in some of the predisposition genes resulted in associations with wide CI. In addition, the use of test requisition forms rather than medical records for ascertainment of clinical and phenotypic data for the clinical testing cohort and the lack of central pathologic validation of the diagnosis of DCIS across the entire dataset were limitations that may have introduced some uncertainty into the observed associations. Furthermore, this study established associations between PV in breast cancer predisposition genes and risk of DCIS, but prospective studies with long-term follow-up will be needed to estimate the absolute risk and/or RR of DCIS in PV carriers and the subsequent risk of progression to invasive breast cancer. The lack of long-term outcome data limits the demonstration of the clinical benefit of identifying PV carriers among women with DCIS beyond what would be expected for unaffected PV carriers.

Conclusions

PV in ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, or PALB2 are associated with a moderate to high risk of DCIS. Among women with DCIS undergoing germline genetic testing, multigene panels may be appropriate because of high frequencies of PV in genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy may be appropriate in women with DCIS who are carriers of PV in BRCA1, BRCA2, and possibly PALB2 because of the high risk of developing CBC.

### ASO author reflections: genetic counseling, a path to testing [^116dnkmG]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Past

The accessibility of genetic testing for breast cancer patients has dramatically changed over the past decade. In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that genes were not patent eligible, which led to an open market for the development of commercialized genetic testing. In addition, the advent of next-generation sequencing has allowed for multigene panels and more economical testing. High penetrance genes for breast cancer increase the likelihood of developing breast cancer by 5–20 times, and increased surveillance and management recommendations for these patients may have a significant impact. Therefore, it is imperative that high-risk patients undergo genetic testing. Despite growing public awareness, increased availability of testing, and reduction in cost, disparities persist in rates of genetic testing.

### Recognition and management of hereditary breast cancer syndromes [^112VqYJd]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

Clinicians should recognize the genetic syndromes that predispose to the development of breast cancer so that patients may be afforded the opportunity to have genetic testing to assist them and their family members in making medical management decisions. Approximately 80%-90% of hereditary breast cancer cases are caused by mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Other important clinical genetic predispositions include Cowden syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and ataxia-telangiectasia. The key to identifying women who are at risk for a hereditary breast cancer lies in obtaining an adequate, three-generation family history, including ethnic background. For unaffected women, breast cancer risks can be estimated using the quantitative models of Gail and Claus, but there are limitations to these models. Other quantitative models predict the likelihood that a patient is carrying a mutated gene. Genetic testing is available at selected laboratories for each of the hereditary syndromes described, and there are three possible outcomes to testing. These outcomes and their management implications are described in detail. Clinical management options for women at high risk for breast cancer include surveillance, chemoprevention, and prophylactic surgery. Application of these principles can reduce morbidity in women with genetic predispositions to breast cancer.

### Do current family history-based genetic testing guidelines contribute to breast cancer health inequities? [^111THcQ4]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Why we should consider moving beyond family history-based guidelines

There is already a precedent to move beyond family history-based guidelines for women once they are diagnosed with TNBC. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines now support universal genetic testing of all women with TNBC, regardless of family history. However, genetic testing of women diagnosed with other molecular subtypes is still based on a combination of age at diagnosis and family history. Current practice has been estimated to miss close to 50% of BC patients with PV –. There are important considerations in conducting genetic testing for patients with BC whose treatment may not be affected based on the presence of PV, like patients with TNBC. However, a key argument of testing all women once diagnosed with BC includes the benefit of cascade testing of relatives; cost effectiveness modeling has supported such a strategy.

Cascade testing, however, misses unaffected women without a family history, and as the incidence rates are increasing in women under 55 years in the U.S. and globally, it is important to consider other approaches for finding higher risk individuals. Although the prevalence estimates of PV are much lower in unaffected women compared to women once they have been diagnosed with BC, the reality is that family history approaches for genetic testing also miss over 50% of BRCA1/2 PV in unaffected women; missclassification of other BC PV is even higher. As a result, women without a family history will generally not be offered genetic testing, and will not receive BC screening until the age of population-based mammography, which is usually age 50 or older for countries where it exists (45 now in the United States).

### Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and other hereditary syndromes: using technology to identify carriers [^111DLUdJ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose and Methods

Most patients who harbor a genetic mutation for hereditary breast cancer have not been identified, despite the availability of genetic testing. Developing an effective approach to the identification of high-risk individuals is the key to preventing and/or providing early diagnosis of cancer in this patient population. This educational review addresses these issues.

Results and Discussion

Using data available on the internet, and making assumptions regarding the types and results of genetic testing, we have estimated the number of mutation carriers in the country and the number who have been tested and identified as such. Overall, our ability to fund and more effectively manage carriers is weak. A technological solution is discussed.

### An exceptional metaplastic lobular breast carcinoma diagnosed through exome sequencing [^114fsdX9]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Metaplastic breast carcinoma is a rare subtype of breast cancer. This subtype is mostly found in association with poorly differentiated ductal breast carcinomas and rarely with other breast carcinoma types. We report the case of a 69-year-old woman with an exceptional invasive lobular breast carcinoma associated with metaplastic squamous cell bone metastasis occurring 2years after the initial breast cancer diagnosis. Whole-exome sequencing and subsequent immunohistochemistry of the lesions were used to link the squamous cell bone metastasis of unknown origin to the primary breast carcinoma initially diagnosed. Searching for primary carcinoma when metastatic lesions of unknown origin occur can be complex. Current molecular biology techniques may help pathologists in associating metastasis with the primary carcinoma by identifying shared specific gene mutations, even when different morphological and immunohistochemical profiles are observed between the tumours.

### Pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes predispose to ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast [^115jt7fJ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a relatively common type of breast cancer and accounts for about 20% to 25% of all new breast cancer cases diagnosed in the United States. DCIS is considered a non-obligate precursor to invasive ductal breast cancer (IDC), and understanding predisposing factors to DCIS could have implications for the early detection and prevention of breast cancer. Similarities in the risk factors for DCIS and IDC, including hormonal factors, mammographic density, and family history of breast cancer, have been identified. However, the contribution of rare germline pathogenic variants (PV) in cancer predisposition genes to the risk of DCIS is poorly understood. Prior studies of BRCA1 and BRCA2, which focused on those qualifying for germline genetic testing because of young age at diagnosis or family history of cancer, found that PV were less frequent in women with DCIS than those with invasive breast cancer but were more frequent in DCIS relative to low-grade invasive disease. In contrast to BRCA1/2, the frequencies of PV in other breast cancer predisposition genes in DCIS and the risks of DCIS associated with these PV have not been established. Furthermore, an increased risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) has been established for carriers of PV in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, or PALB2 with breast cancer, but it is unknown whether these risk estimates apply to PV carriers with DCIS. In part due to a lack of understanding of genetic predisposition to DCIS, current guidelines on germline genetic testing and management of PV carriers do not distinguish between DCIS and IDC. A comprehensive assessment of genetic predisposition to DCIS is needed to personalize germline genetic testing in women with DCIS and identify appropriate management strategies for PV carriers with DCIS. Herein, we present the results of germline genetic testing among women with DCIS from clinical and population-based cohorts and identify the risk of DCIS and CBC among carriers of PV in cancer predisposition genes.

Identifying Individuals for Hereditary Cancer Genetic Testing Correctly identifying individuals/families with increased risk of developing cancer is an important role of primary care physicians and other health care providers. Once identified, these individuals can be referred to genetic counseling, where the following can be discussed: risk assessment, possible genetic testing, and developing a management plan. Clues suggesting hereditary cancer risk include the following: an individual/family member is diagnosed with cancer at a young age, cancers in the family exhibit a Mendelian inheritance pattern, and multiple primary cancers occur in the same patient/family member. Identifying hereditary cancer risk also provides information to an individual's family members. When an individual has a hereditary cancer P/LP variant, his/her relatives can have targeted genetic testing to search for this specific familial variant.

This is known as cascade genetic testing and can help clarify cancer risk in the proband's family members. For more information about cascade genetic testing, see the Cascade Genetic Testing of Family Members section in Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling. Family members who pursue genetic testing can learn either of the following:

- They carry the P/LP variant identified in their family. These patients can discuss appropriate cancer risk-management measures with their medical team.
- They do not carry the P/LP variant identified in their family. Cancer screening for these patients will be based on other cancer risk factors.
- Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome Type 1.

Methods of Genetic Analysis and Gene Discovery The methods in this section provide a brief background about the genetic analysis and discovery approaches that have been used during the past 10 to 30 years to identify disease susceptibility genes. These methods led to the discovery of important cancer genes like BRCA1, BRCA2, and other breast cancer risk genes. Since then, genetic analysis techniques have transitioned to next-generation sequencing methods, as described in the Clinical Sequencing section of this summary. 1–3] Many of these tumor-based approaches use germline DNA sequences as a reference to discriminate between DNA changes only within the tumor and those that are potentially inherited.

In the genetic counseling and cancer risk assessment setting, the use of multigene testing to evaluate inherited cancer risk is becoming more common and may become routine in the near future, with institutions and companies offering multigene testing to detect alterations in a host of cancer risk–associated genes.

### Genetic testing fact sheet-NCI… [^112tQ74k]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Genetic testing for inherited cancer risk is different from genetic testing of tumors, which is sometimes used to guide treatment. Tumor genetic testing, which may also be referred to as tumor DNA sequencing, somatic testing, or biomarker testing, looks for genetic changes that occurred during someone's lifetime. It can sometimes detect inherited changes as well, but it does not replace testing for inherited cancer risk. Genetic testing of tumor cells is addressed in the Biomarker Testing for Cancer Treatment page. Who should consider genetic testing for inherited cancer risk. Clinical practice guidelines recommend genetic testing for anyone diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer before age 50, metastatic prostate cancer, or male breast cancer. For people with these cancers, knowing whether their cancer is related to an inherited harmful genetic change may help to select the optimal treatment for them.

This information may also be relevant to their blood relatives.
- family members with breast or ovarian cancer
- family members with colon cancer and endometrial cancer
- Cancer in both organs in a set of paired organs, such as both kidneys or both breasts
- Rare types of cancer
- The presence of birth defects that are known to be associated with inherited cancer syndromes, such as certain noncancerous illnesses or physical abnormalities.
- Being a member of a racial or ethnic group that is known to have an increased risk of having a certain inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome and having one or more of the above features as well It is generally recommended that, when possible, genetic counseling and testing for a hereditary cancer syndrome begin with a family member who has had cancer.
- Confirm, for a person who has cancer, that the cancer was likely due to an inherited genetic change and potentially help guide treatment choices
- Indicate an increased risk of developing certain cancer in the future and guide future management to lower that risk, including:

- Being checked at a younger age or more often for signs of cancer.
- Testing can provide peace of mind if it finds that a person did not inherit a harmful genetic change identified in the family.
- Testing that rules out the presence of harmful changes in all known cancer genes allows a person to manage their cancer risk based on their personal and family history.
- Testing that identifies a harmful genetic change provides the person an opportunity to understand and, in some cases, potentially manage their cancer risk.

### Genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer… [^116LBcsp]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Your genetic counselor or other health care provider may recommend genetic testing based on your personal and family history of cancer, your ancestry, and whether you have a family member with a genetic mutation.
- Genetic test results may help you understand and manage your risk for breast, ovarian, and other cancers. How genetic testing can help you Genetic testing can help you understand and manage your risk for breast, ovarian, and other cancers. Knowing whether or not you have a genetic mutation that makes you more likely to get cancer can help you decide what steps to take to prevent cancer or find it early. Genetic counseling before genetic testing is important to find out if you and your family are likely to benefit from genetic testing. Who should be tested Usually, genetic testing is recommended if you have:

- A strong family health history of breast and ovarian cancers.
- A moderate family health history of breast and ovarian cancers and are of Ashkenazi or Eastern European Jewish ancestry.
- A personal history of breast cancer and meet certain criteria related to age of diagnosis, type of cancer, presence of certain other cancers or cancer in both breasts, ancestry, and family health history.
- A personal history of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.
- A known mutation in the breast cancer genes in someone in your family. Types of tests Genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers looks for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Your genetic counselor may suggest testing using a multigene panel. A multigene panel looks for mutations in several genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, at the same time. have nothad breast or ovarian cancer is unlikely to be helpful, unless another relative is known to have a mutation.
- Genetic testing may be helpful for family members who havehad breast or ovarian cancer.

This is because there may be a genetic mutation in your family, but you did not inherit it. If you have not had breast or ovarian cancer
- If a genetic mutation has notbeen found in another family member, you are still at higher risk for the cancers that run in your family.
- If a genetic mutation hasbeen found in another family member and the test showed you do not have the mutation, you are not at higher risk than the average person for breast or ovarian cancer. You also cannot pass the mutation on to your children.

### Cancer genetics risk assessment and counseling (PDQ ®) [^114kEQfo]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Cascade genetic testing can be effective in identifying carriers of a pathogenic variant prior to cancer presentation which provides opportunities for cancer prevention, early detection, risk reduction, and ultimately improved health outcomes. Various cancer genetic service delivery approaches are being used to facilitate greater access to genetic counseling and testing. These approaches have been utilized to streamline the process by which high-risk or affected individuals are identified and referred to specialty genetic services for additional evaluation. These service delivery models vary in the processes by which patients receive genetic education, counseling, and testing. The following are features that suggest hereditary cancer:

- Unusually early age of cancer onset.
- Multiple primary cancers in a single individual.
- Bilateral cancer in paired organs or multifocal disease.
- Clustering of the same type of cancer in close relatives.
- Unusual presentation of cancer.
- Uncommon tumor histology.
- Rare cancers associated with birth defects.
- Geographic or ethnic populations known to be at high risk of hereditary cancers. Genetic testing candidates may be identified based solely on ethnicity when a strong founder effect is present in a given population. As part of the process of genetic education and counseling, genetic testing may be considered when the following factors are present:

- An individual's personal history and/or family history are suspicious for a genetic predisposition to cancer.
- The genetic test has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be interpreted.
- The test will impact the individual's diagnosis, cancer management or cancer risk management, and/or help clarify risk in family members.
- A detailed, multifaceted assessment including medical, psychosocial, and family history.
- A determination of the risk of cancer and/or indication for genetic testing based on evidence of an inherited cancer syndrome.
- Education and counseling about familial/hereditary cancer risks.
- If appropriate, review of genetic testing options as well as potential limitations, risks, and benefits of testing.
- Establishment of a cancer risk management plan.
- Discussion of follow-up plans, provision of referrals, educational materials, etc.

### BRCA gene changes: cancer risk and genetic testing fact sheet-NCI… [^112pF8HR]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

People who inherit a harmful change in one of these genes have increased risks of several cancers — most notably breast and ovarian cancer, but also several other types of cancer. People who have inherited a harmful change in BRCA1 or BRCA2 also tend to develop cancer at younger ages than people who do not have such a variant. Testing can be appropriate for both people without cancer and people who have been diagnosed with cancer. If someone knows they have inherited a harmful change in one of these genes, they can take steps to reduce their risk of developing cancer or to detect cancer early. If they have cancer, the information about the genetic change may be important for selecting treatment. Also, people can share the results of testing with blood relatives, who can then better understand their own cancer risk.

Genetic counseling will allow for a discussion of the implications of testing for BRCA changes so that someone can give informed consent to the process. Enhanced screening. Professional groups generally recommend that women who have inherited harmful changes in BRCA1 and BRCA2 start breast cancer screening at younger ages and have screening with magnetic resonance imaging in addition to mammography. No effective ovarian cancer screening methods are known. In the past, some doctors recommended transvaginal ultrasound and blood tests for the CA-125 antigen for ovarian cancer screening in women with harmful changes in.

Some organizations recommend the use of ultrasound or MRI/magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to screen for pancreatic cancer in people who are known to have inherited a harmful change in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and who have a close blood relative with pancreatic cancer. Studies are ongoing to investigate whether screening people at increased risk for pancreatic cancer reduces their risk of dying from the disease. If someone has tumor genetic testing that reveals the presence of a harmful change in BRCA1 or BRCA2 in the tumor, they should discuss with their health care provider whether to consider having a germline genetic test to determine if the change was inherited or if it occurred during development of the tumor. Knowing if the change was inherited is important for that individual to understand their risks to potentially develop other cancers in the future. It can also provide an opportunity for family members to learn about their own cancer risks.
