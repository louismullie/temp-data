## Question

How does plasma cell leukemia differ from multiple myeloma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how plasma cell leukemia differs from multiple myeloma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic threshold that separates PCL from MM and how it has evolved. Then, I should verify epidemiology and subtype classification. Next, I will compare clinical and laboratory phenotypes. After that, I need to examine cytogenetic and transcriptomic distinctions. Then, I will contrast prognostic outcomes. Finally, I should consider treatment implications and synthesize why PCL is qualitatively different from MM, not just quantitatively more aggressive, while double-checking for any subtleties that might change management or trial eligibility [^1123eaA1] [^111EKXf2] [^113n7Adj].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic boundary, because if I misstate the cut-off, everything downstream will be off; historically, PCL required either ≥ 20% circulating plasma cells (CPCs) on smear or an absolute circulating plasma cell count ≥ 2 × 10⁹/L, but I should double-check whether both or only one criterion was necessary — wait, it was either criterion, not both, per IMWG/WHO conventions, and that matters for case capture [^114BYkY1] [^113791cz]. I need to ensure I reflect the 2021 IMWG update lowering the definition to ≥ 5% CPCs on peripheral smear in patients otherwise meeting MM criteria, based on datasets showing patients with ≥ 5% CPCs fare like classical PCL, which functionally shifts many "MM with CPCs" into a PCL-equivalent risk category [^1123eaA1] [^111unxfK] [^111EKXf2]. But wait, what if even lower levels are meaningful? Indeed, prospective flow-based data suggest a 2% CTC threshold identifies a PCL-like ultra–high-risk subset, though morphology-based diagnosis remains anchored at 5% for now, so I will distinguish emerging risk-stratification from formal diagnostic criteria [^113PZFoM] [^116Sg5Jd] [^113n7Adj].

> Next, I should review disease subtypes and epidemiology to avoid conflating primary and secondary PCL; primary PCL arises de novo and historically accounts for roughly 60–70% of PCL, whereas secondary PCL represents leukemic transformation of relapsed/refractory MM and may be increasing in incidence with modern survival, though I should acknowledge under-ascertainment in older series given reliance on morphology [^115DuYiM] [^114MFSrw] [^114BYkY1]. I need to ensure rarity is emphasized to contextualize evidence quality — PCL constitutes about 1–2% of plasma cell dyscrasias, far less common than MM, which impacts trial availability and guideline strength [^114BYkY1] [^115DuYiM] [^113n7Adj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about phenotype without verifying hallmark clinical differences; compared with MM, PCL more often presents with extramedullary disease, marked cytopenias (notably anemia and thrombocytopenia), higher LDH and β2-microglobulin, more frequent renal impairment, and relative independence from the marrow microenvironment, whereas frank lytic bone disease may be less prominent than in typical MM presentations, a pattern consistent across reviews and expert practice [^112wmqas] [^115DuYiM]. I should double-check that even "lower" CPC levels (5–20%) carry measurable clinical differences; yes, patients with ≥ 5% CPCs show lower platelet counts and higher marrow plasma cell infiltration, reinforcing the aggressive biology signal at sub-20% levels [^1179XTfq] [^112B33nv].

> I will now examine the genomic and transcriptomic landscape, since biology underpins phenotype; PCL exhibits enriched adverse cytogenetics such as del(17p), 1q gains, and complex karyotypes, and shows higher frequencies of certain IGH translocations including t(11;14) and t(14;16) compared with MM, which I need to keep in mind when discussing prognosis and therapy selection [^115DuYiM]. Let me verify older comparative genomic hybridization data to avoid overreliance on recent platforms — indeed, PCL demonstrates more frequent losses on 13q and 16q than MM, supporting greater genomic instability and dissemination capacity [^113m8gDu]. But wait, genetics alone may not fully explain the phenotype; transcriptome studies controlling for shared high-risk lesions like del(17p) still separate pPCL from MM, with thousands of deregulated genes and isoforms and perturbations in spliceosomal machinery, implying distinct mRNA processing and cellular programs beyond canonical cytogenetics [^111PB65A] [^113zJUQx].

> I should double-check outcomes next, because the crux of the redefinition rests on survival; in the Mayo analysis, patients with ≥ 5% CPCs had a median overall survival near 1.1 years versus 4.4 years in MM without CPCs, and even in the novel-agent era, outcomes around 1.4 years starkly underperform both standard- and high-risk MM, justifying the ≥ 5% threshold as PCL-equivalent in risk [^111EKXf2]. Wait, what about transplant? Autologous transplant improves outcomes in PCL but still yields substantially inferior survival and greater non-relapse mortality compared with MM, highlighting shorter response durability and higher early risk despite deep responses [^114EsGxC].

> Let me consider therapeutic implications, because this is where a mistake could misguide care; for typical MM, VRd, DRd, or D‑VMP are standards for transplant-ineligible patients per EHA/ESMO, whereas in PCL an intensified, proteasome inhibitor–based induction is recommended urgently to achieve rapid cytoreduction and reduce early mortality, which is a nuanced but critical divergence I need to emphasize [^112gdyVW] [^113791cz] [^115xhe24]. I should confirm transplant guidance to avoid overpromising benefit — yes, early ASCT is generally advised for all eligible PCL patients, though durability is limited, and allo-SCT may be considered selectively in younger, fit patients within trials, while maintenance is extrapolated with limited evidence and novel immunotherapies such as BCMA-directed CAR-Ts are reasonable considerations given poor relapse control [^114EsGxC] [^113791cz] [^111CHJP9] [^1114AuwR]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially framed VRd as the default for all transplant-ineligible MM, but I should correct that to reflect that DRd and D‑VMP are also evidence-based standards in this setting per EHA/ESMO, with regimen choice individualized by comorbidity and access, whereas PCL prioritizes speed and intensity over convenience due to early death risk [^112gdyVW] [^115xhe24].

> But wait, what if lower CTC thresholds blur the boundary further? I need to separate diagnostic criteria from risk stratification; while IMWG redefined PCL at ≥ 5% CPCs by morphology, converging data show that ≥ 2% CTCs by sensitive flow predicts PCL-like outcomes across transplant fitness, suggesting a biological continuum and supporting inclusion of these patients in high-risk pathways and trials, even if not labeled as PCL under current morphology-based rules [^113PZFoM] [^116Sg5Jd] [^113n7Adj]. I should also confirm that the IMWG and EMN advocate trial inclusion rather than exclusion of PCL by updated criteria to accelerate access to novel agents and improve evidence generation in this rare population [^113n7Adj] [^115xhe24].

> Stepping back, I can now synthesize the distinguishing framework without losing nuance: plasma cell leukemia is not simply "more myeloma", but a qualitatively distinct, ultra–high-risk entity defined by a lower diagnostic CPC threshold of ≥ 5% on smear, more frequent extramedullary spread and cytopenias, greater genomic complexity with del(17p) and 1q gains, a unique transcriptomic and splicing signature even when high-risk lesions overlap, dismal survival under modern therapy, and a need for immediate PI-based induction, early ASCT, and consideration of investigational immunotherapies, with active efforts to harmonize trial eligibility to include these patients and the adjacent "PCL-like" MM subset identified by elevated CTCs [^1123eaA1] [^112wmqas] [^115DuYiM] [^111PB65A] [^111EKXf2] [^115xhe24] [^113PZFoM] [^113n7Adj].

Multiple myeloma (MM) and plasma cell leukemia (PCL) are both plasma cell malignancies [^117BrZ4V]; PCL is defined by **≥ 5% circulating plasma cells** in peripheral blood [^1123eaA1], while MM is primarily bone marrow–based, with < 5% circulating plasma cells [^112B33nv]. PCL is **more aggressive**, with frequent extramedullary involvement, higher rates of cytopenias [^112wmqas], and a markedly poorer prognosis (median OS ~12–18 months) [^115xhe24] than MM (median OS ~5–7 years) [^111EKXf2]. PCL requires **urgent, intensive therapy**, including proteasome inhibitor–based induction [^113791cz], early autologous stem cell transplantation [^1135dRqd], and consideration of allogeneic transplantation or novel immunotherapies [^1114AuwR]; in contrast, MM is managed with standard triplet/quadruplet regimens [^112gdyVW] and autologous transplantation in eligible patients [^116URNBy].

| **Feature** | **Multiple myeloma (MM)** | **Plasma cell leukemia (PCL)** |
|-|-|-|
| Diagnostic criteria | Bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 10% or biopsy-proven plasmacytoma [^117BrZ4V], with < 5% circulating plasma cells [^112B33nv] | ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood [^1123eaA1] [^111unxfK] |
| Clinical presentation | - Bone pain [^117BrZ4V] <br/> - Anemia <br/> - Hypercalcemia <br/> - Renal impairment <br/> - Bone lesions [^1149tEJ3] | - Aggressive course [^1135dRqd] <br/> - Cytopenias [^112wmqas] <br/> - Extramedullary involvement [^112mp5NE] <br/> - Hepatosplenomegaly <br/> - Lymphadenopathy <br/> - CNS involvement [^111EKXf2] |
| Laboratory findings | - Monoclonal protein [^116izaxb] <br/> - Anemia <br/> - Hypercalcemia [^117BrZ4V] <br/> - Renal impairment | - High circulating plasma cells [^1135dRqd] <br/> - Severe cytopenias [^112wmqas] <br/> - Elevated LDH [^112mp5NE] <br/> - Hypercalcemia <br/> - Renal impairment |
| Prognosis | Median OS is approximately [^115ErVsj] 5–7 years [^111EKXf2] | Median OS is approximately [^1135dRqd] 12–18 months [^111EKXf2] [^115xhe24] |
| Treatment | Standard regimens (e.g. VRd, DRd) [^112gdyVW] [^1159KreE] and autologous stem cell transplantation are used [^116URNBy] | - Urgent intensive therapy [^113791cz] <br/> - Proteasome inhibitor–based induction [^1135dRqd] <br/> - Early autologous stem cell transplantation [^114EsGxC] <br/> - Consider allogeneic transplantation or novel immunotherapies [^115xhe24] [^1114AuwR] |

In summary, the key distinction is the presence of **≥ 5% circulating plasma cells** [^111unxfK] in PCL, which underlies its **aggressive course** [^112mp5NE], poorer prognosis [^111EKXf2], and need for **more intensive therapy** [^113791cz] compared with MM.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) has a consistently poor prognosis, even with advancements in recent decades. It is crucial to promptly identify PCL to begin the most effective treatment for this ultra-high-risk disease. This position paper aims to revisit the diagnosis of PCL based on the presence of circulating plasma cells in patients who otherwise meet the diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma. Two retrospective series were identified to address the question of the appropriate number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood for defining PCL. It was found that the presence of ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma has a similar adverse prognostic impact as the previously defined PCL. Therefore, PCL should be defined by the presence of 5% or more circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood smears in patients otherwise diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma.

- **Overall survival in patients with detectable CPCs**: Overall survival in patients with detectable circulating plasma cells (CPCs) at diagnosis is stratified by < 5%, 5–19%, and ≥ 20% CPCs on peripheral blood smear (a), and by < 5% and ≥ 5% CPCs on peripheral blood smear (b).

- **Comparison of overall survival with MM**: Figure 2 shows the overall survival (OS) of patients with ≥ 5% CPCs (n = 122, median OS: 1.1 years [0.8–1.4]) in comparison with a cohort of multiple myeloma (MM) patients diagnosed between 1971 and 2016, and without CPCs at diagnosis (n = 9724, median OS: 4.4 years [4.3–4.5], p < 0.001). When only considering patients diagnosed after January 1, 2001 (i.e. in the era of novel therapies), survival remained poorer in patients with ≥ 5% CPCs (n = 62, median OS: 1.4 years [0.8–2.5]) compared with MM patients (n = 5345, median OS: 5.7 years [5.5–6.0], p < 0.001, Figure 3a).

- **Comparison of overall survival with MM in the contemporary era**: We subsequently compared the survival of patients with ≥ 5% CPCs (diagnosed from 2001 onwards) with MM patients diagnosed in the same era and in whom cytogenetic information was available (n = 1707). Median OS in those with ≥ 5% CPCs (n = 62, median OS: 1.4 years [0.8–2.5]) was significantly lower compared with patients with both standard-risk MM (n = 1326, median OS: 7.5 years [7.0–8.7]) and high-risk MM (n = 381, median OS: 4.3 years [3.5–4.9], p < 0.001, Figure 3b).

### How I treat plasma cell leukemia [^112wmqas]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is a rare and aggressive plasma cell proliferative disorder characterized by a very poor prognosis and distinct biological, clinical, and laboratory features. Compared to multiple myeloma, pPCL more frequently presents with extramedullary involvement, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, elevated serum β(2)-microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as impaired renal function. Many genetic aberrations observed in newly diagnosed pPCL are typically found in advanced multiple myeloma. These cytogenetic abnormalities and mutations lead to increased proliferation, enhanced inhibition of apoptosis, escape from immune surveillance, and independence from the bone marrow microenvironment, with changes in the expression of adhesion molecules or chemokine receptors.

The outcome of pPCL has improved with the introduction of autologous stem cell transplantation and combination approaches with novel agents, including bortezomib and immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide. In this review, we provide an overview of currently available therapeutic options with recommendations on how these treatment modalities can best be used to improve outcomes for plasma cell leukemia patients.

### Plasma cell leukemia: Definition, presentation, and treatment [^1135dRqd]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Low credibility.

We discuss topics on the definition of plasma cell leukemia and the distinction between plasma cell leukemia and multiple myeloma. Moreover, we review the latest literature on how to treat plasma cell leukemia.

- **Recent findings**: Plasma cell leukemia is clinically and genetically distinct from multiple myeloma. It is defined by the observation in blood of more than 20% clonal plasma cells by differential count of the leukocytes or by counting more than 2×10⁹ per liter circulating clonal plasma cells. However, patients with lower levels of circulating plasma cells have the same adverse prognosis, which challenges the disease definition. Survival has improved after the implementation of high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support, bortezomib, and lenalidomide in the treatment; yet, the prognosis remains poor. The results of allo-transplants have been disappointing. The diagnostic criteria of plasma cell leukemia are currently discussed in the international myeloma community. Despite some improvement in survival, the prognosis remains adverse. New, more targeted treatment modalities, including immunotherapies, will hopefully improve the outcome in the near future.

### Prognostic impact of circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma: Implications for plasma cell leukemia definition [^112B33nv]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

As highlighted in the last consensus by IMWG, the diagnosis of PCL has been classically based on the presence of > 20% circulating PCs and/or an absolute count > 2 × 10⁹/L PCs. However, our study shows that lower peripheral blood PC counts, specifically ≥ 5% peripheral blood plasma cells, should be considered as diagnostic criteria for PCL ("PCL-like" myeloma or early PCL) due to their independent and strong prognostic impact. Prospective multicenter analyses with translational and correlative studies into the biology of these patients, as well as risk-oriented therapeutic strategies, are encouraged. A careful examination of peripheral blood by conventional microscopy should be conducted for all patients with MM in daily clinical practice.

In conclusion, the presence of ≥ 5% circulating PCs by conventional cytology easily identifies a group of myeloma patients with a prognosis as poor as that of PCL. This suggests that the diagnosis of PCL should be revisited. If confirmed in other series, especially in prospective studies of uniformly treated patients, such individuals may benefit from a distinct and more intensified therapeutic approach.

In 2014, strides were made in the care of haematological malignancies. The heterogeneity of multiple myeloma was particularly unraveled, leading to the proposal of new diagnostic criteria and frontline standards of care. Additionally, new therapeutic approaches have been validated and approved for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In chronic myeloid leukaemia, a complete cytogenetic response was confirmed as the primary therapeutic endpoint.

### Multiple myeloma [^117BrZ4V]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of terminally differentiated plasma cells. Patients typically present with bone marrow infiltration of clonal plasma cells and monoclonal protein in the serum and/or urine. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma is made when there is clear end-organ damage attributable to the plasma cell proliferative disorder or when findings suggest a high likelihood of their development. Distinguishing symptomatic multiple myeloma, which requires treatment, from the precursor stages of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smouldering multiple myeloma is important, as observation is the standard for those conditions.

Much progress has been made over the past decade in understanding disease biology and individualized treatment approaches. Several new classes of drugs, such as proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, have joined the traditional armamentarium (corticosteroids, alkylating agents, and anthracyclines). Along with high-dose therapy and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, these advances have led to deeper and more durable clinical responses. Indeed, an increasing proportion of patients are achieving lasting remissions, raising the possibility of a cure for this disease. Success will probably depend on using combinations of effective agents and treating patients in the early stages of the disease, such as those with smouldering multiple myeloma.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^113n7Adj]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

There is an urgent need to prospectively investigate the molecular characteristics of primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) further to gain a better understanding of the genomic mechanisms as a basis to develop optimal, stratified treatment approaches. Recent trial designs have demonstrated that addressing both ultra-high-risk myeloma and PCL jointly can further overcome barriers to recruitment for these patient populations with high unmet need. We recommend removing PCL as routine exclusion criteria for multiple myeloma (MM) trials. Patients with this new definition of primary PCL should be included in clinical trials and reported as a high-risk feature, in order to not penalize the possibility of receiving new agents.

In any given patient, the presence of a few circulating plasma cells demonstrated by conventional morphology is still a marker for a highly proliferative and aggressive process. Lower levels (more than 1 or 2% plasma cells in peripheral blood) could define higher risk MM with a prognosis very close to PCL. Patients with an 'early' PCL may rapidly progress; these patients must be followed closely because they may develop PCL in a very short time. However, it has yet to be demonstrated that aggressively treating patients with lower circulating plasma cells that fit the previous definition of primary PCL will yield superior outcomes.

Additional methods to detect early primary PCL should be a high priority and warrant further studies. Thus, the use of slide-based immunofluorescence microscopy, multiparametric flow cytometry, and next-generation flow for plasma cell quantification in peripheral blood has been associated with improved detection capabilities.

These recommendations were developed by a panel of clinical experts on multiple myeloma (MM) based on evidence from published data through August 2017. Expert consensus was utilized to suggest recommendations where sufficient data were lacking. The final recommendations were classified based on the GRADE criteria, which incorporate the strength and quality of evidence. Based on discussions at the 2017 EMN Trialist meeting in Baveno, Italy, guidelines were prepared and circulated among all panel members. The manuscript subsequently underwent revision in three rounds until EMN experts reached consensus. In line with the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, authorship was based on active contribution during discussion, writing, and revision of the guidelines.

The consistently ominous prognosis, even after improving in the last decades, deserves a prompt identification of these patients to establish the most effective treatment for this ultra-high-risk disease. However, the percentage of plasma cells is a continuous variable, and the cut-off should be based on retrospectively evaluating studies that have analyzed the prognosis of these patients.

With all the above considerations, we believe that the diagnostic criteria for primary PCL should be revisited. What number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood should be used for defining PCL? There is no scientific rationale to establish the appropriate number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood for defining PCL, and the percentage should be obtained from clinical evidence. Over the last few years, some retrospective studies have been conducted and published by different groups. The aim of this position paper is to revisit the diagnosis of primary PCL according to the presence of circulating plasma cells in patients otherwise meeting diagnostic criteria of symptomatic MM.

### Revised diagnostic criteria for plasma cell leukemia: results of a Mayo Clinic study with comparison of outcomes to multiple myeloma [^114BYkY1]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is an uncommon but aggressive malignancy that accounts for 1–2% of all plasma cell dyscrasias. First described in the early 1900s, PCL has been defined as the presence of ≥ 20% circulating plasma cells (CPCs) on conventional white blood cell differential count and an absolute plasma cell count of ≥ 2 × 10⁹/L in the peripheral blood. This definition includes both primary PCL (pPCL) — arising de novo, in the absence of antecedent multiple myeloma (MM) — and secondary PCL (sPCL), which describes leukemic transformation of MM. PCL is clinically and biologically distinct from MM, with a younger age at diagnosis, higher propensity to show visceral and extramedullary involvement, and unique biologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic characteristics.

The definition of PCL is considered too restrictive, requiring a very high level of CPCs to be detected on conventional white blood cell differential count. Patients with MM who have detectable CPCs at a level below the 20% threshold may have similar outcomes to those with ≥ 20% CPCs. In 2013, the International Myeloma Working Group called for studies to investigate a revision of the diagnostic criteria for PCL. Two such studies have since shown that MM patients with either ≥ 2% or ≥ 5% CPCs, as measured on a peripheral smear, have similar outcomes to patients with pPCL, suggesting that a lower threshold of CPCs be used to define PCL.

Based on these considerations, we sought to review our outcomes of MM patients with CPCs detectable on peripheral blood smears at diagnosis and attempt to determine…

### Transcriptome analysis reveals significant differences between primary plasma cell leukemia and multiple myeloma even when sharing a similar genetic background [^111PB65A]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is a highly aggressive plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by short remissions and very poor survival. Although the 17p deletion is associated with poor outcomes and extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma (MM), its presence does not confer the degree of aggressiveness observed in pPCL. The comprehensive exploration of isoform expression and RNA splicing events may provide novel information about biological differences between the two diseases.

Transcriptomic studies were conducted in nine newly diagnosed pPCL and ten MM samples, all of which harbored the 17p deletion. Unsupervised cluster analysis clearly distinguished pPCL from MM samples. In total, 3,584 genes and 20,033 isoforms were found to be deregulated between pPCL and MM. There were 2,727 significantly deregulated isoforms of non-differentially expressed genes.

Significant differences were observed in the expression of spliceosomal machinery components between pPCL and MM, with respect to gene, isoform, and alternative splicing event expression. In summary, transcriptome analysis revealed significant differences in the relative abundance of isoforms between pPCL and MM, even when they both had the 17p deletion. The mRNA processing pathway, including RNA splicing machinery, emerged as one of the most remarkable mechanisms underlying the biological differences between the two entities.

- **Patient characteristics**: As previously stated, there are two recent publications that have addressed this issue in Europe and the US (Table 1).

Table 1
Main results of the two clinical studies used for this position paper.

a. Totally, 382 patients (included in the number in the table) without circulating plasma cells were used as controls.
b. Totally, 9724 patients (not included in the number in the table) diagnosed in the same period without circulating plasma cells at diagnosis were used as controls.
c. Considering only patients with circulating plasma cells.

CPC: circulating plasma cells.

First, a series of 482 patients from Catalonia (Catalan Myeloma Group), Spain, between 2008 and 2013 with newly diagnosed MM or PCL was reported. Patients were classified into four categories according to the percentage of circulating plasma cells: 0% (382; 79.2%), 1–4% (83; 17.2%), 5–20% (12; 2.5%), and the conventional definition of PCL (more than 20%) (5; 1%). One hundred patients (20.7%) showed at least 1% of circulating plasma cells. Considering only the 100 patients with circulating plasma cells for comparison with the Mayo Clinic series, the percentages of circulating plasma cells were: 1–4% (83%), 5–20% (12%), and more than 20% (5%). The 382 patients without circulating plasma cells were used as controls.

More recently, Ravi et al. from the Mayo Clinic reviewed outcomes of 176 patients with MM who had circulating plasma cells at diagnosis between 1971 and 2006, to determine whether a lower threshold could be used to diagnose PCL. They classified the patients according to…

### Gene expression profiles in myeloma: Ready for the real world [^112qyqJf]. Clinical Cancer Research (2016). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by molecular and clinical heterogeneity. The outcome of the disease has dramatically improved with the advent of new drugs in the past few years. However, even with these increasing therapeutic options, important challenges remain, such as accurately evaluating patients' prognosis and predicting sensitivity to specific treatments and drug combinations. Transcriptomic studies have largely contributed to deciphering multiple myeloma's complexity, identifying subgroups distinguished by different outcomes. Microarrays and, more recently, RNA sequencing enable the evaluation of the expression of coding and noncoding genes, alternate splicing events, mutations, and novel transcriptome modifiers. This provides new information regarding myeloma biology, prognostication, and therapy. In this review, we discuss the role and impact of gene expression profiling studies in myeloma.

### Real-world data on prognosis and outcome of primary plasma cell leukemia in the era of novel agents: A multicenter national study by the Greek Myeloma Study Group [^114MFSrw]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is a distinct clinicopathological entity of plasma cell dyscrasias, accounting for about 60–70% of all plasma cell leukemia cases. The diagnosis of pPCL requires both 2 × 10³/μL peripheral blood clonal plasma cells and plasmacytosis accounting for > 20% of the differential white cell count, though in some studies, it was considered sufficient to meet only one of these two diagnostic criteria. The definition of pPCL is arbitrary, and a lower diagnostic threshold (i.e. 5% and/or > 0.5 × 10³/μL) has been recently proposed. Primary PCL does not arise from pre-existing multiple myeloma (MM) but is presented as de novo disease and is characterized by an aggressive clinical course.

In the past, the only available treatment for patients with pPCL was conventional chemotherapy, which failed to control the disease, leading to dramatically poor outcomes. During the last decades, initially autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and subsequently novel therapies, including immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors (PIs), namely bortezomib, led to a slight improvement in pPCL patients' survival. The efficacy of bortezomib in pPCL has been demonstrated by our group and others in small retrospective series; however, this has been questioned in other studies. Recently, a prospective phase 2 study has demonstrated that induction therapy with bortezomib-based combinations followed by ASCT led to high response rates and prolonged survival in patients with pPCL. Bortezomib-based therapies are currently recommended for the management of pPCL.

### European myeloma network group review and consensus statement on primary plasma cell leukemia [^115xhe24]. Annals of Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (PPCL) is the most aggressive disorder among plasma cell malignancies, with new diagnostic criteria recently established by the International Myeloma Working Group. Studies have shown that PPCL patients receiving a combination of novel agents, but not eligible for transplantation, may have a median survival of up to 2 years, extended to 3 years or more in those undergoing transplant procedures. These findings remain unsatisfactory, particularly when compared with progress achieved in multiple myeloma.

- **Design**: A European Myeloma Network (EMN) expert panel reviewed the most recent literature and selected the areas of major concern in the management of PPCL by generating and rank ordering key questions using the criterion of clinical relevance. Multistep procedures were utilized to achieve a consensus on recommendations. The Delphi questionnaire method was used, and a consensus of at least 80% was reached for all final statements.

- **Results**: An extended overview of biological, clinical, prognostic, and therapeutic aspects of PPCL, including ongoing and close-to-start clinical trials, is presented. Furthermore, updated guidelines for the management of PPCL and practical recommendations are provided in the context of knowledge about this disease, also looking at possible future perspectives to ameliorate the outcome for these patients.

- **Conclusions**: PPCL still remains an unmet clinical need. Notwithstanding, some not negligible progress has been recently achieved. The European Myeloma Network panel strongly supports ongoing research and efforts in this field.

### Transcriptome analysis reveals significant differences between primary plasma cell leukemia and multiple myeloma even when sharing a similar genetic background [^115DuYiM]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is an uncommon and aggressive plasma cell dyscrasia, characterized by the presence of more than 20% of plasma cells (PCs) and an absolute number of ≥ 2 × 10⁹/L of PCs in peripheral blood. PCL is classified as primary (pPCL) when detected de novo in patients with no evidence of previous multiple myeloma (MM), or as secondary (sPCL) in patients with relapsed or refractory MM that progresses to a leukemic phase. Around 60% and 40% of PCLs are pPCL and sPCL, respectively. pPCL accounts for less than 3% of all malignant plasma cell disorders. Consequently, the knowledge regarding the molecular basis of pPCL is quite limited by the small number of cases included in most series.

Various studies have reported that pPCL patients show different clinical and biological features from those of MM. pPCL is associated with a dismal prognosis, with median survival being about 10 months. Extramedullary plasmacytomas, renal failure, and massive bone marrow infiltration are more frequently observed in pPCL than in MM. Conversely, pPCL exhibits a lower prevalence of bone disease.

Cytogenetic studies have shown that pPCL features elevated genomic instability, especially with respect to karyotypic complexity, and a higher prevalence of 17p13 deletions and 1q gains. Of the translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH), t(11;14) and t(14;16) are more frequent in pPCL than in MM. In recent years, the development of high-throughput technologies has given rise to a detailed knowledge of molecular characteristics.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^112mp5NE]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The correct and timely diagnosis of PCL depends on the pathologist's or hematologist's ability to screen for and recognize plasma cells in the peripheral blood smear. They must be aware of the clinical relevance of a careful morphological examination of peripheral blood smears to exclude the presence of circulating plasma cells.

PCL is unique within the spectrum of malignant monoclonal gammopathies and is characterized by a poor prognosis, the shortest overall survival (OS), and an elevated frequency of certain genetic abnormalities, such as deletion 17p, hypodiploidy, and t(11;14), along with distinctive molecular and epigenetic characteristics. Some classical clinical features, such as reduced bone marrow reserve, extramedullary involvement, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), are more common than in patients with "standard" multiple myeloma (MM). The short duration of response in primary PCL has been disappointing. Despite significant improvements in recent years, the use of immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and either autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation cannot overcome the poor prognosis of this disease.

In the two series analyzed, morphology examination was crucial in identifying patients with clinical and prognostic features compatible with the natural history of primary PCL described. Consistently, in both articles, the OS in patients with 5% or more circulating plasma cells was significantly shorter than in patients with MM without circulating plasma cells. This significance was retained in one of the studies in multivariate analysis. Moreover, the prognosis was quite bleak for those with increased circulating plasma cells.

### A clinical perspective on plasma cell leukemia; current status and future directions [^1133wmqH]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is the rarest yet most aggressive plasma cell disorder. PCL was originally defined by an absolute plasma cell (PC) count greater than 2 × 10⁹/L in the peripheral blood (PB) and more than 20% circulating PCs. At present, only one of the original two requirements is used to define PCL according to the criteria by the World Health Organization and the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG). The definition of PCL is currently an area of controversy as recent studies suggest that the presence of ≥ 5% circulating abnormal PCs but not meeting the 20% cutoff have a similar adverse prognostic impact and poor survival as patients with > 20% abnormal PCs. Therefore, patients with PCs comprising ≥ 5% of the PB white cell differential count may be considered as having PCL and can be treated as such. Another limitation of the diagnostic definition of PCL is that it does not take into consideration plasma cell clonality, which can be characterized using multiparametric flow cytometry. Establishing the presence of a malignant clonal population is important as reactive plasmacytosis can occur due to a variety of infections, neoplastic or inflammatory conditions.

PCL is referred to as primary when the leukemic phase presents at diagnosis, or secondary when leukemic progression occurs in the context of preexisting multiple myeloma (MM). Historically, 60–70% of cases have been reported to be primary PCL (pPCL), whereas approximately 40% are secondary. In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of secondary PCL, likely related to mor.

### Distinct clonal identities of B-ALLs arising after lenalidomide therapy for multiple myeloma [^115DqiVQ]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant clonal expansion of plasma cells that exists on a spectrum with other plasma cell dyscrasias and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. It is the second most common hematologic malignancy and results in considerable morbidity and mortality due to its tendency to affect older patients.

Therapy for myeloma has rapidly evolved in the last two decades. Modern therapy involves a multimodal approach, often starting with a combination regimen involving immune modulators, proteasome inhibitors, biologics, and/or corticosteroids. Eligible patients are typically offered high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) due to its potential for prolonged remission. Long-term maintenance therapy with lenalidomide after HCT has been shown to improve survival; however, several studies have noted an increased frequency of secondary malignancies. In one study, the hazard ratio for a second primary hematologic malignancy for patients with MM being treated with lenalidomide was 2.03 (P = 0.015).

These malignancies have been described as clonally distinct from the primary tumor, and in particular, B-ALL malignancies have demonstrated inferior outcomes relative to those developed in the absence of therapeutic pressure. As practice patterns have shifted, larger numbers of patients are receiving maintenance lenalidomide, and there has been a corresponding increase in secondary malignancies, especially hematologic malignancies.

### Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies for multiple myeloma [^1114AuwR]. Blood (2017). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a nearly always incurable malignancy of plasma cells, so new approaches to treatment are needed. T-cell therapies are a promising approach for treating MM, with a mechanism of action different from those of standard MM treatments. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are fusion proteins incorporating antigen-recognition domains and T-cell signaling domains. T cells genetically engineered to express CARs can specifically recognize antigens.

The success of CAR-T cells (CAR-Ts) against leukemia and lymphoma has encouraged the development of CAR-T therapies for MM. Target antigens for CARs must be expressed on malignant cells, but expression on normal cells must be absent or limited. B-cell maturation antigen is expressed by normal and malignant plasma cells. CAR-Ts targeting B-cell maturation antigen have demonstrated significant antimyeloma activity in early clinical trials. Toxicities in these trials, including cytokine release syndrome, have been similar to toxicities observed in CAR-T trials for leukemia.

Targeting postulated CD19+ myeloma stem cells with anti-CD19 CAR-Ts is a novel approach to MM therapy. MM antigens, including CD138, CD38, signaling lymphocyte-activating molecule 7, and κ light chain, are under investigation as CAR targets. MM is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, so targeting more than one antigen might often be required for effective treatment of MM with CAR-Ts.

Integration of CAR-Ts with other myeloma therapies is an important area of future research. CAR-T therapies for MM are at an early stage of development but hold great promise.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia and autologous stem cell transplantation [^114EsGxC]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia is a rare disorder accounting for less than 5% of malignant plasma cell diseases. It has a poor prognosis compared to multiple myeloma, with a median survival of 8–12 months. The results of conventional therapy are disappointing, though autologous stem cell transplantation may improve survival.

- **Design and methods**: A retrospective analysis was undertaken of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation experience. This involved 272 patients with plasma cell leukemia and 20,844 with multiple myeloma undergoing first autologous transplantation between 1980 and 2006. All patients were reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry using MED-A (limited data) or MED-B (extensive data) forms. All patients were included regardless of the availability of complete data.

- **Results**: There was no difference in the type of graft or the use of total body irradiation between patients with plasma cell leukemia and those with multiple myeloma. However, the group with plasma cell leukemia was transplanted earlier after diagnosis (6.0 versus 7.7 months, P = 0.000). Patients with plasma cell leukemia were more likely to enter complete remission after transplantation, but their overall survival (25.7 months, 95% confidence interval 19.5–31.9 months) was inferior to that of patients with multiple myeloma (62.3 months, 95% confidence interval 60.4–64.3 months), due to the short duration of their post-transplant response and increased non-relapse-related mortality.

- **Conclusions**: This largest study ever reported on plasma cell leukemia suggests that auto-transplantation may offer some benefits, yet challenges remain due to the overall short survival and increased mortality not related to relapse.

### Chromatin-based, in cis and in trans regulatory rewiring underpins distinct oncogenic transcriptomes in multiple myeloma [^1116ssrR]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a genetically heterogeneous cancer of the bone marrow plasma cells (PC). Distinct myeloma transcriptome profiles are primarily driven by myeloma initiating events (MIE) and converge into a mutually exclusive overexpression of the CCND1 and CCND2 oncogenes. Here, with reference to their normal counterparts, we find that myeloma PC enhanced chromatin accessibility combined with paired transcriptome profiling can classify MIE-defined genetic subgroups. Across and within different MM genetic subgroups, we ascribe regulation of genes and pathways critical for myeloma biology to unique or shared, developmentally activated, or de novo formed candidate enhancers. Such enhancers co-opt recruitment of existing transcription factors, which, although not transcriptionally deregulated per se, organize aberrant gene regulatory networks that help identify myeloma cell dependencies with prognostic impact. Finally, we identify and validate the critical super-enhancer that regulates ectopic expression of CCND2 in a subset of patients with MM and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

### Defining and treating high-risk multiple myeloma [^112dNvft]. Leukemia (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous group of diseases with variability in outcomes based on specific clinical and biological predictors. MM patients can be broadly categorized into standard, intermediate, and high risk for disease relapse, morbidity, and mortality. The high-risk features include patient-specific factors such as advanced age, poor performance status, and comorbidities; clinical features such as primary plasma cell leukemia and extramedullary disease; and disease-specific biological features such as deletion 17p, t(4;14), and high-risk gene expression profiling signatures. The paper reviews the available data on the best therapeutic approaches for high-risk MM.

### Plasma cell leukemia: Definition, presentation, and treatment [^113VhuCh]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Low credibility.

We discuss topics on the definition of plasma cell leukemia and the distinction between plasma cell leukemia and multiple myeloma. Moreover, we review the latest literature on how to treat plasma cell leukemia.

Plasma cell leukemia is clinically and genetically distinct from multiple myeloma. It is defined by the observation in blood of more than 20% clonal plasma cells by differential count of the leukocytes or by counting more than 2 × 10⁹ per liter circulating clonal plasma cells. However, patients with lower levels of circulating plasma cells have the same adverse prognosis, which challenges the disease definition. Survival has improved after the implementation of high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support, bortezomib, and lenalidomide in the treatment; yet, the prognosis remains poor. The results of allo-transplants have been disappointing.

The diagnostic criteria of plasma cell leukemia are currently discussed in the international myeloma community. Despite some improvement in survival, the prognosis remains adverse. New, more targeted treatment modalities, including immunotherapies, will hopefully improve the outcome in the near future.

### More than 2% of circulating tumor plasma cells defines plasma cell leukemia-like multiple myeloma [^113PZFoM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is the most aggressive monoclonal gammopathy. It was formerly characterized by ≥ 20% circulating plasma cells (CTCs) until 2021, when this threshold was decreased to ≥ 5%. We hypothesized that primary PCL is not a separate clinical entity, but rather represents ultra-high-risk multiple myeloma (MM) characterized by elevated CTC levels.

- **Methods**: We assessed the levels of CTCs by multiparameter flow cytometry in 395 patients with newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible MM to establish a cutoff for CTCs that identifies patients with ultra-high-risk PCL-like MM. We tested the cutoff on 185 transplant-eligible patients with MM and further validated it on an independent cohort of 280 transplant-ineligible patients treated in the GEM-CLARIDEX trial. The largest published real-world cohort of patients with primary PCL was used for comparison of survival. Finally, we challenged the current 5% threshold for primary PCL diagnosis.

- **Results**: Newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible patients with MM with 2%-20% CTCs had significantly shorter progression-free survival (3.1 vs. 15.6 months; P < 0.001) and overall survival (14.6 vs. 33.6 months; p = 0.023) than patients with < 2%. The 2% cutoff proved to be applicable also in transplant-eligible patients with MM and was successfully validated on an independent cohort of patients from the GEM-CLARIDEX trial. Most importantly, patients with 2%-20% CTCs had comparable dismal outcomes with primary PCL. Moreover, after revealing a low mean difference between flow cytometric and morphologic evaluation of patients, the study supported revising the current diagnostic criteria.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^111unxfK]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) has a consistently ominous prognosis, even after progress in the last decades. PCL deserves a prompt identification to start the most effective treatment for this ultra-high-risk disease. The aim of this position paper is to revisit the diagnosis of PCL according to the presence of circulating plasma cells in patients otherwise meeting the diagnostic criteria of multiple myeloma.

We identified two retrospective series that addressed the question of what number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood should be used to define PCL. The presence of ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma had a similar adverse prognostic impact as the previously defined PCL. Therefore, PCL should be defined by the presence of 5% or more circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood smears in patients otherwise diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma.

### Development and validation of a novel risk stratification algorithm for relapsed multiple myeloma [^115ErVsj]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells that accounts for approximately 10% of all haematological cancers. MM is associated with considerable heterogeneity in terms of patient characteristics, drivers of disease progression, prognosis, and treatment response. This is exemplified by the variations observed in life expectancy. The median overall survival (OS) for MM patients is in the range of 5–7 years; however, data suggest that 13% of patients die within 24 months of diagnosis. Findings from a European chart review suggested that 36% of patients with MM do not reach the second line of treatment. A tool that could accurately evaluate the overall risk of death and identify the drivers of disease severity would be of considerable value, especially at first relapse when patient and disease-related information is available.

### Plasma cell leukemia: Consensus statement on diagnostic requirements, response criteria and treatment recommendations by the International Myeloma Working Group [^113791cz]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is a rare and aggressive variant of myeloma characterized by the presence of circulating plasma cells. It is classified as either primary PCL occurring at diagnosis or as secondary PCL in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma. Primary PCL is a distinct clinicopathological entity with different cytogenetic and molecular findings. The clinical course is aggressive, with short remissions and survival duration. The diagnosis is based upon the percentage (≥ 20%) and absolute number (≥ 2 × 10⁹/l) of plasma cells in the peripheral blood.

It is proposed that the thresholds for diagnosis be re-examined, and consensus recommendations are made for diagnosis, as well as response and progression criteria. Induction therapy needs to begin promptly and have high clinical activity leading to rapid disease control in an effort to minimize the risk of early death. Intensive chemotherapy regimens and bortezomib-based regimens are recommended, followed by high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation if feasible. Allogeneic transplantation can be considered in younger patients. Prospective multicenter studies are required to provide revised definitions and a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PCL.

### The surfaceome of multiple myeloma cells suggests potential immunotherapeutic strategies and protein markers of drug resistance [^114KMEY4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We next identified specific markers that most distinguish myeloma plasma cells versus B-cell types (Fig. 1D, E; Supplementary Fig. 1C). Giving confidence in this analysis, many canonical markers were among the strongest hits, including BCMA, CD138/SDC1, and CD28 for plasma cells and CD19, CD22, and CD72 for B-ALL cells, respectively (Fig. 1E). Comparison of myeloma cells to the two B-lymphoblastoid cell lines also showed CD138/SDC1 and CD28 as characterizing myeloma cells, while CD19, CD22, and CD20 characterized late-stage B-cells. We were surprised to find the three proteins that most distinguished myeloma plasma cells from B-ALL, based on fold-change and p-value, were not canonical markers at all: gamma-glutamyl transferase 1 (GGT1), selectin-P ligand (SELPLG), and cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) (Fig. 1E). These proteins may carry previously unexplored relevance to myeloma or broader plasma cell biology.

In parallel with our surface proteomic data, we also obtained RNA-seq data for all analyzed cell lines. We overall found a moderate quantitative correlation (Pearson R = 0.54; p < 2.2e−16) between the transcriptome and surface proteome of myeloma and B-ALL cells (Supplementary Fig. 1D), consistent with prior studies. We did find a set of proteins, including CD99, GGT1, and TOR1AIP2, with transcript levels discordant with surface protein, suggestive of possible post-transcriptional regulation (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Taken together, this initial profiling underscores the unique surface phenotype of malignant plasma cells and unexpected markers distinguishing them.

### Prognostic impact of circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma: Implications for plasma cell leukemia definition [^1179XTfq]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

The presence of circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma is considered a marker for highly proliferative disease. In the study herein, the impact of circulating plasma cells, assessed by cytology, on the survival of patients with multiple myeloma was analyzed. Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smears of 482 patients with newly diagnosed myeloma or plasma cell leukemia were reviewed, and patients were classified into four categories according to the percentage of circulating plasma cells: 0%, 1–4%, 5–20%, and plasma cell leukemia, with the following frequencies: 382 (79.2%), 83 (17.2%), 12 (2.5%), and 5 (1.0%), respectively. Median overall survival according to the circulating plasma cells group was 47, 50, 6, and 14 months, respectively.

At multivariate analysis, the presence of 5 to 20% circulating plasma cells was associated with a worse overall survival (relative risk 4.9, 95% CI 2.6–9.3), independently of age, creatinine, the Durie-Salmon system stage, and the International Staging System (ISS) stage. Patients with ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells had lower platelet counts (median 86×10⁹/L vs. 214×10⁹/L, P < 0.0001) and higher bone marrow plasma cells (median 53% vs. 36%, P = 0.004). The presence of ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma has a similar adverse prognostic impact as plasma cell leukemia.

In both studies, the primary outcome was overall survival (OS), defined as the duration between the date of diagnosis and death, or censored at the last follow-up. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and differences were tested for statistical significance using the log-rank test. Additionally, multivariate analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model in the Catalan study.

### The molecular make up of smoldering myeloma highlights the evolutionary pathways leading to multiple myeloma [^114aNBA7]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is an asymptomatic plasma cell disorder, distinguished from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by a higher rate of progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM). The nature of SMM as a discrete disease entity has been called into question because of the triphasic shape of the Kaplan–Meier curves associated with its progression to MM. These curves have been interpreted as indicative of a low-risk group similar to MGUS, a high-risk group of "early myeloma" who progress quickly, and an intermediate-risk group, the nature of which is uncertain.

The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) re-defined SMM to account for a number of risk factors, including serum-free light chain (SFLC) ratio, bone marrow tumor burden, and bone lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify a high-risk group. A group with an 80% 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was identified and re-defined as MM. To enhance historical comparison, we use the term Early myeloma (EM) to identify patients that fail to meet the criteria but would have been defined as SMM previously.

### European Myeloma Network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^116izaxb]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

European Myeloma Network recommendations aim to improve diagnostic and monitoring practices for multiple myeloma.

- **Diagnostic tools**: A defining feature of plasma cell (PC) disorders is the secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins, often referred to as a monoclonal M-protein. This can be used as a diagnostic marker and for the follow-up of the disease. Its heavy and light-chain components can be identified by immunofixation and further quantified by serum protein electrophoresis and/or a serum free light-chain (SFLC) assay. It should be kept in mind that with persisting disease and possible de-differentiation of myeloma cells, the capacity to produce M-proteins may decrease or be completely lost (light-chain escape). In those patients, low M-protein levels, the presence of light chains only, or even the complete absence of M-proteins and light chains may be mistaken as an ongoing or evolving response.

- **Blood tests**: Immunofixation is noted to be approximately ten times more sensitive than serum protein electrophoresis and is required at diagnosis to characterize the phenotype of the M-protein and for confirmation of a complete response, which is defined as being immunofixation-negative. Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation may not be able to detect light-chain aberrations in patients with oligo-secretory disease, such as light-chain MM. Due to their low molecular weight, these SFLC are rapidly cleared by the kidneys. In such cases, the monoclonal burden should be measured in a 24-hour urine collection or in the serum by an automated SFLC immunoassay (Grade 1A), the latter having a higher sensitivity to detect and quantify the involved free light chains.

### Chromatin-based, in cis and in trans regulatory rewiring underpins distinct oncogenic transcriptomes in multiple myeloma [^1144V8rz]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a genetically heterogeneous cancer of the bone marrow plasma cells (PC). Distinct myeloma transcriptome profiles are primarily driven by myeloma initiating events (MIE) and converge into a mutually exclusive overexpression of the CCND1 and CCND2 oncogenes. Here, with reference to their normal counterparts, we find that myeloma PC enhanced chromatin accessibility combined with paired transcriptome profiling can classify MIE-defined genetic subgroups. Across and within different MM genetic subgroups, we ascribe regulation of genes and pathways critical for myeloma biology to unique or shared, developmentally activated or de novo formed candidate enhancers. Such enhancers co-opt recruitment of existing transcription factors, which, although not transcriptionally deregulated per se, organize aberrant gene regulatory networks that help identify myeloma cell dependencies with prognostic impact. Finally, we identify and validate the critical super-enhancer that regulates ectopic expression of CCND2 in a subset of patients with MM and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

### Multiple myeloma, version 3.2017, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115EkwpQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is caused by the neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells. These neoplastic plasma cells proliferate and produce monoclonal immunoglobulin in the bone marrow, causing skeletal damage, a hallmark of multiple myeloma. Other MM-related complications include hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and infections. The NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel members have developed guidelines for the management of patients with various plasma cell dyscrasias, including solitary plasmacytoma, smoldering myeloma, multiple myeloma, systemic light chain amyloidosis, and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. The recommendations specific to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with newly diagnosed MM are discussed in this article.

### Differences in genetic changes between multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia demonstrated by comparative genomic hybridization [^113m8gDu]. Leukemia (2001). Low credibility.

To analyze the genomic differences between multiple myeloma (MM) and plasma cell leukemia (PCL), a total of 30 cases were studied using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). In five cases with a low proportion of plasma cells (PC) in bone marrow, an enrichment of PCs was performed using immunomagnetic beads conjugated with the monoclonal antibody B-B4. In 24 out of the 25 MM patients (96%) and in all five PCL patients (100%), DNA copy number changes were identified through CGH analysis. In the MM case without chromosomal imbalances, the immunomagnetic enrichment of PCs had failed.

- **Changes in multiple myeloma (MM) patients**: The most common changes were gains at chromosomes 15q (48%), 11q (44%), 3q (40%), 9q (40%), and 1q (36%).

- **Changes in plasma cell leukemia (PCL) patients**: All PCL patients showed gains in 1q. Losses of chromosomal material were significantly more frequent in PCL than in MM patients (P = 0.03): losses on 13q were found in 80% of PCL vs. 28% of MM; and on chromosome 16 in 80% vs. 12%, respectively. Additionally, PCL patients exhibited losses of 2q and 6p that were not present in MM patients.

The CGH data demonstrate differences in chromosomal imbalances between MM and PCL.

### More than 2% of circulating tumor plasma cells defines plasma cell leukemia-like multiple myeloma [^116Sg5Jd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy characterized by the expansion and accumulation of clonal plasma cells (PCs) in the bone marrow (BM). However, tumor PCs are able to egress from BM to peripheral blood (PB), where they are responsible for dissemination and extramedullary disease. Because of recent technological advances, circulating tumor plasma cells (CTCs) might be detected in the majority of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) using highly sensitive techniques such as next-generation flow cytometry (NGF).

- **Quantification of CTCs**: This has been recently proposed as one of the most relevant prognostic factors in NDMM, making it the ideal novel parameter for risk stratification. Indeed, patients with NDMM may present with a variable number of CTCs, ranging from zero, with exceptionally favorable outcomes, to higher numbers of CTCs, with adverse prognoses. Nevertheless, there are virtually no published data on the prognostic significance of CTCs in transplant-ineligible patients with NDMM.

As an extreme on the other side of the spectrum, there are patients with ≥ 20% of CTCs who are considered to have primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL), a distinct and rare clinical entity with the most aggressive behavior. In 2021, the International Myeloma Working Group decreased this threshold to ≥ 5% of CTCs evaluated by morphology to better reflect the ultra-high-risk nature of these patients. Here, we hypothesized that we could define new criteria to identify patients with ultra-high-risk PCL-like MM.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of increasing significance: Time to screen [^115UdofE]. Haematologica (2023). High credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy (MG) is a frequently detected clonal B-cell or plasma-cell disorder. Importantly, every multiple myeloma (MM) case is preceded by MG. Although clinical algorithms now allow earlier treatment of patients with biomarkers of malignancy before MM-induced tissue damage (CRAB) occurs, most patients are still diagnosed late. It is important to revisit how MG should be managed in clinical practice and whether screening is required. As the prevalence of MG and other medical co-morbidities both rise with increasing age, the degree of contribution of MG to disease states other than malignant progression is often unclear. This can lead to monitoring lapses and under recognition of the organ dysfunction that can occur with monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS). Therefore, models of progression to MM and/or MGCS require further refinement.

While MG is currently detected incidentally, a case for screening has been made with ongoing studies in this area. Screening has the potential benefit of earlier detection and prevention of both MGCS and delayed MM presentations. However, important drawbacks include the psychosocial impact on individuals and resource burden on healthcare services. MG terminology should transition alongside our increasing understanding of the condition and genomic characterization that have already begun to revise the MG nomenclature. The biology of MG has been poorly understood and is often inferred from the biology of MM, which is unhelpful. We review the literature and case for MG screening in this paper. In particular, we highlight a

### Role of F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis and management of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders: a consensus statement by the International Myeloma Working Group [^1149tEJ3]. The Lancet Oncology (2017). High credibility.

The International Myeloma Working Group consensus aimed to provide recommendations for the optimal use of 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) PET/CT in patients with multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders, including smouldering multiple myeloma and solitary plasmacytoma. The 18 F-FDG PET/CT can be considered a valuable tool for the work-up of patients with both newly diagnosed and relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma because it assesses bone damage with relatively high sensitivity and specificity and detects extramedullary sites of proliferating clonal plasma cells while providing important prognostic information.

Use of 18 F-FDG PET/CT is mandatory to confirm a suspected diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma, provided that whole-body MRI is unable to be performed, and to distinguish between smouldering and active multiple myeloma if whole-body X-ray (WBXR) is negative and whole-body MRI is unavailable. Based on the ability of 18 F-FDG PET/CT to distinguish between metabolically active and inactive disease, this technique is now the preferred functional imaging modality to evaluate and monitor the effect of therapy on myeloma-cell metabolism. Changes in FDG avidity can provide an earlier evaluation of response to therapy compared to MRI scans and can predict outcomes, particularly for patients who are eligible to receive autologous stem-cell transplantation.

The 18 F-FDG PET/CT can be coupled with sensitive bone marrow-based techniques to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) inside and outside the bone marrow, helping to identify those patients who are defined as…

### Multiple myeloma: The (r)evolution of current therapy and a glance into future [^113zHMg4]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

- **Overview of anti-multiple myeloma strategies**: The review discusses various strategies used against multiple myeloma (MM). The purple strategies are designed to directly target MM cell vulnerabilities, distinguishing those exploiting "lineage dependencies" or "clonal dependencies". The central strategy targets "epigenetic modifications" that may broadly affect both lineage and clonal vulnerabilities. At the bottom in yellow, strategies aim to disrupt MM-bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) interplay and restore host immunosurveillance. Purple double-pointed arrows indicate MM-related approaches, while yellow double-pointed arrows represent BMM-related approaches. These highlight that a specific treatment, even in targeted therapy, may affect multiple cellular components and interactions, thus amplifying therapeutic effects.

### Plasma cell myeloma and related neoplasms [^112TSjzj]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Session 1 of the 2009 Workshop of the Society for Hematopathology/European Association of Haematopathology, Cleveland, OH, focused on plasma cell neoplasms. This report summarizes the salient diagnostic, clinical, and genetic features of plasma cell myeloma (PCM) and related neoplasms. Based on the cases submitted to the workshop, we highlight common diagnostic issues and unusual manifestations of plasma cell neoplasms, such as t(11;14)+ PCM, plasma cell leukemia, and nonsecretory plasmacytoma, as well as plasmablastic transformation of PCM.

Additional issues repeatedly raised at the workshop included the differential diagnosis of extramedullary dissemination of PCM vs. primary extramedullary plasmacytoma and plasmablastic lymphoma; systemic plasma cell neoplasms in immunocompromised people; and Epstein-Barr virus-associated plasma cell neoplasms. Difficult cases with borderline features presented by submitters emphasized the necessity of integrating clinical, immunophenotypic, and genetic features for appropriate classification of these disorders.

- **Bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone**: This established combination continues to be effective.

- **Carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone**: Provides an option for patients not responding well to other treatments.

- **Daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone**: Highly potent in targeting multiple pathways.

- **Daratumumab, carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone**: This regimen is considered for previously treated individuals with aggressive disease.

- **Elotuzumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone**: Offers an alternative for cases resistant to standard treatments.

- **Ixazomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone**: Combines oral and intravenous approaches.

- **Lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone**: Provides another multi-faceted approach.

- **Pomalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone**: Recommended after two prior therapies including an IMiD and a proteasome inhibitor, particularly if disease progression occurs on or within 60 days of completing the last therapy.

These regimens present a range of options catering to the individual needs of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, as guided by the NCCN 2025 recommendations.

### Imaging of multiple myeloma and related plasma cell dyscrasias [^116p9DDJ]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy of the bone marrow. MM consists of three components: diffuse marrow infiltration, focal bone lesions, and soft-tissue (extramedullary) disease. A key biomarker in blood or urine is a monoclonal immunoglobulin known as the monoclonal protein. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a similar disease characterized by the secretion of IgM.

Staging has classically been conducted using the 1975 Durie-Salmon system, which involves conventional radiographs. Recently, the Durie-Salmon Plus staging system, which incorporates CT, MRI, and (18)F-FDG PET/CT, has been introduced. The hallmark radiographic lesion of symptomatic MM is a well-demarcated, focal osteolytic bone lesion. The number of focal bone lesions correlates inversely with patient outcomes. Extramedullary disease represents a typically aggressive, poorly differentiated form of MM, associated with an inferior outcome and a median survival of less than one year if present at diagnosis.

Achievement of a complete response with (18)F-FDG PET prior to stem-cell transplantation corresponds with superior outcomes.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^114PFCNU]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

We have reviewed the literature, looking for validation of alternative cutoffs for the diagnosis of primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) in prospective or retrospective series of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). We identified only two retrospective series that addressed the issue of determining the number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood necessary for defining PCL. The objective in both groups was to investigate whether lower values, such as 5% or more plasma cells, have the same prognostic impact as the historical criteria.

In a previous report from China, the impact of morphological examination was assessed, although the cutoff for high-risk group/PCL was inconsistent with other reports. This study was excluded as it only stratified MM patients with versus without circulating plasma cells using a cutoff of 2%, unlike the 5% threshold used in the other included papers. Other experiences have also validated the lower cutoff of 5% with prognosis significance similar to classical PCL, although these findings were only presented at meetings.

The objective was to summarize the results of previously published data regarding the outcomes of patients with a lower circulating plasma cell threshold from two series: one from five university hospitals in Catalonia, Spain (100 patients), and the other from the Mayo Clinic (176 patients), to support the new definition of PCL. These cases were compared to simultaneous and consecutive controls over the same period in the first series (382 patients) and historical controls in the second (9724 patients), respectively. The Catalan series was published previously.

### Plasma cell leukemia: another piece of the puzzle [^114csxpG]. Haematologica (2023). Low credibility.

On this basis, pPCL patients should always be considered for a clinical trial. As a rare disease, pPCL is, however, often excluded from studies performed in multiple myeloma. The new International Myeloma Working Group's definition of pPCL, which lowers the circulating plasma cells from 20% to 5%, seems to be a correct move to achieve broader clinical trial availability for pPCL patients who are in great need of better therapies. It is therefore hoped that these patients will be enrolled in future multiple myeloma trials with devoted endpoints, predefined plans to extrapolate specific data, and ad hoc analyses for pPCL populations. Such approaches could provide novel biological and clinical information in a short time, which would be useful to expedite the journey along the "long and winding road" of pPCL management.

### Diagnosis and management of smouldering myeloma: A British Society for Haematology good practice paper [^111UJWdx]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a bone marrow-based plasma cell tumour that develops from asymptomatic precursor conditions such as smouldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance. All these conditions are characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein in the blood. Diagnosis and distinction between these conditions are based on blood tests, bone marrow biopsy, and cross-sectional imaging.

There are various risk stratification models that group patients with smouldering myeloma into risk groups based on their risk of progression to symptomatic disease. Management is mainly observational for patients with smouldering myeloma, although clinical trials for high-risk disease may be available. Restaging is required if there is evidence of progression.
