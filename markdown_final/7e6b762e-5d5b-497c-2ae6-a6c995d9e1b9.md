## Question

Spontaneous retinal arterial pulsations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether spontaneous retinal arterial pulsations exist, what they mean, and how to interpret them clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical dogma that arterial pulsations are always pathologic. Then, I should verify whether contemporary evidence supports spontaneous arterial pulsations in health. Next, I will distinguish arterial from venous pulsations mechanistically and clinically. After that, I should review disease contexts where arterial pulsations are reported and what they imply. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded interpretation and note limitations and exceptions where absence or presence may be misleading.

> Let me first confirm the traditional teaching. The longstanding view in ophthalmic literature is that spontaneous pulsation of the retinal veins can be physiologic, but pulsation of the retinal arteries is always pathologic, reflecting abnormal vascular compliance or elevated intraluminal pressure; this has been repeatedly emphasized in classic and modern summaries and remains a cornerstone of clinical teaching [^dc0f1ee8].

> Wait, let me verify whether any recent data contradict this. I initially thought there were no credible reports of spontaneous retinal arterial pulsations in healthy eyes, but hold on, I should double-check. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis of retinal imaging biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease reported that retinal arterial pulsation amplitudes, measured with a dynamic vessel analyzer, were actually smaller in controls than in cases, implying that measurable arterial pulsations can occur even in health, albeit with smaller amplitude than in disease states; this challenges the absolutist view that arterial pulsations are never physiologic, though the clinical significance of these small amplitudes remains uncertain [^ad81791f].

> I need to ensure I distinguish venous from arterial pulsations clearly. Spontaneous retinal venous pulsations are well established and reflect the translaminar pressure gradient between intraocular pressure and cerebrospinal fluid pressure; they are commonly present in healthy individuals and their absence raises concern for elevated intracranial pressure, which has been repeatedly validated, including with simultaneous ICP monitoring and infrared video grading, reinforcing their clinical utility as a noninvasive ICP marker [^0cd4f9f6] [^5dde3cd7] [^6221ec75].

> Let me consider the mechanism for arterial pulsations. Unlike veins, retinal arteries are thick-walled and normally maintain forward flow throughout the cardiac cycle; visible pulsations imply loss of autoregulatory tone, increased wall compliance, or transmission of exaggerated pulse pressure, which is why arterial pulsations have historically signaled pathology such as arteriosclerosis, aneurysm, or elevated intraluminal pressure rather than a normal finding [^dc0f1ee8].

> Next, I should review disease contexts where arterial pulsations are described. Retinal arterial macroaneurysms can exhibit pulsation and carry risks of hemorrhage and exudation; their behavior is influenced by systemic blood pressure and Valsalva-like maneuvers, underscoring the link between arterial pulsation and wall instability or elevated transmural pressure in disease [^fc8c28ed] [^9ce867f2]. In Alzheimer's disease, larger retinal arterial pulsation amplitudes have been reported in cases versus controls, again associating arterial pulsatility with disease rather than health, though causality and clinical thresholds are not established [^ad81791f]. Experimental work in mural cell biology also shows that loss of vascular tone can produce pronounced arterial wall pulsations, supporting a pathophysiologic basis for visible arterial pulsations when autoregulation is impaired [^7369ab37].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the clinical implications. Even if tiny arterial pulsations can be detected with sensitive instruments in some healthy individuals, the clinical teaching remains sound: visibly spontaneous retinal arterial pulsations on routine ophthalmoscopy are abnormal and warrant evaluation for underlying vascular disease, hypertension, atherosclerosis, or local arterial pathology such as a macroaneurysm, whereas venous pulsations are often normal and their absence is the red flag for intracranial hypertension risk [^dc0f1ee8] [^0cd4f9f6].

> I should double-check measurement nuances that could confound interpretation. Retinal vessel caliber varies with the cardiac cycle, and ignoring pulse timing can increase measurement variability; this is particularly relevant when trying to quantify small pulsation amplitudes or when comparing serial exams, so documenting pulse phase or using ECG-gated methods can improve reliability if pulsation characteristics are being tracked over time [^5b3dc89e] [^ea1c7760].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line. Spontaneous retinal arterial pulsations are not entirely mythical; sensitive imaging can detect small-amplitude arterial pulsations even in some healthy individuals, but visible arterial pulsations on clinical examination are uncommon in health and should be considered pathologic until proven otherwise, prompting assessment for systemic vascular risk, local arterial disease, or elevated intraluminal pressure, whereas venous pulsations remain the clinically useful dynamic sign for inferring intracranial pressure status [^ad81791f] [^dc0f1ee8] [^0cd4f9f6].

---

Spontaneous retinal arterial pulsations are **not normal** and indicate **pathological conditions** such as increased arterial compliance, elevated intralocular pressure, or systemic hypertension [^dc0f1ee8]. They are distinct from retinal venous pulsations, which can be physiological and are used to assess intracranial pressure [^0cd4f9f6]. Arterial pulsations are associated with **increased cardiovascular risk** and warrant evaluation for systemic vascular disease, including hypertension and atherosclerosis [^be46fa0b] [^eabc69a8]. Clinically, they should prompt a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment and management of underlying risk factors [^notfound].

---

## Physiological basis and mechanisms

Retinal arteries are normally **non-pulsatile** because their thick, muscular walls withstand intraocular pressure (IOP) and maintain steady flow. Visible pulsations reflect **loss of autoregulatory tone** or increased transmural pressure [^dc0f1ee8]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Increased arterial compliance**: Loss of vascular tone or structural integrity allows arterial walls to bulge with each pulse, creating visible pulsations [^7369ab37].

- **Elevated intraocular pressure**: Higher IOP increases transmural pressure, making arterial pulsations more likely.

- **Systemic hypertension**: Elevated systemic blood pressure increases arterial pulse pressure, promoting visible pulsations [^eabc69a8].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

Spontaneous retinal arterial pulsations are **clinically significant** and indicate underlying pathology:

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Associated with systemic hypertension, atherosclerosis, and increased cardiovascular risk [^be46fa0b] [^eabc69a8].

- **Glaucoma**: Linked to elevated IOP and vascular dysregulation, contributing to optic nerve damage [^2b39a0f8] [^cdb0a857].

- **Ocular ischemia**: May signal hemodynamic compromise from carotid disease or other vascular insufficiency [^c35ce69f].

---

## Differentiation from retinal venous pulsations

It is essential to distinguish arterial from venous pulsations:

| **Feature** | **Arterial pulsations** | **Venous pulsations** |
|-|-|-|
| Physiology | Abnormal; pathological | Normal; physiological |
| Mechanism | Increased compliance or transmural pressure | Translaminar pressure gradient (IOP vs CSF) [^5dde3cd7] |
| Clinical significance | Indicates pathology (hypertension, glaucoma, ischemia) | Indicates normal ICP; absence suggests elevated ICP [^0cd4f9f6] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When spontaneous retinal arterial pulsations are observed, a **comprehensive evaluation is recommended**:

- **Ophthalmic examination**: Assess IOP, optic disc, and retinal vessels [^2c18190c].

- **Systemic blood pressure measurement**: Identify hypertension [^notfound].

- **Cardiovascular assessment**: Evaluate for atherosclerosis, carotid disease, and other vascular risk factors [^c35ce69f].

- **Imaging**: Consider carotid ultrasound or echocardiography if embolic disease is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management

Management focuses on **addressing underlying causes**:

- **Blood pressure control**: Antihypertensive therapy to reduce pulse pressure and vascular stress [^notfound].

- **Glaucoma management**: Lower IOP with medications or surgery as indicated [^2d4ffc4e].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, smoking cessation, and dietary changes to reduce cardiovascular risk [^notfound].

- **Regular monitoring**: Track progression and response to therapy [^56a66900].

---

## Conclusion

Spontaneous retinal arterial pulsations are **abnormal** and indicate underlying vascular pathology. They differ from physiological venous pulsations and are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Clinically, they warrant a thorough evaluation and targeted management of systemic and ocular risk factors to prevent progression and complications.

### Spontaneous retinal venous pulsation: aetiology and significance [^5dde3cd7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Spontaneous retinal venous pulsation is seen as a subtle variation in the calibre of the retinal vein(s) as they cross the optic disc. The physical principles behind the venous pulsations has been the point of much debate. Initial theories suggested that the pulsation occurred because of the rise in intraocular pressure in the eye with the pulse pressure. This article presents an argument that this is not the case. The pulsations are in fact caused by variation in the pressure gradient along the retinal vein as it traverses the lamina cribrosa. The pressure gradient varies because of the difference in the pulse pressure between the intraocular space and the cerebrospinal fluid. The importance of this is that as the intracranial pressure rises the intracranial pulse pressure rises to equal the intraocular pulse pressure and the spontaneous venous pulsations cease. Thus it is shown that cessation of the spontaneous venous pulsation is a sensitive marker of raised intracranial pressure. The article discusses the specificity of the absence of spontaneous venous pulsation and describes how the patient should be examined to best elicit this important sign.

### The detection of spontaneous venous pulsation with smartphone video ophthalmoscopy [^6221ec75]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

SVP is a dynamic clinical sign in which the pulsation of the retinal veins occurs with the cardiac cycle.–It is most commonly appreciated as the retinal veins cross the optic disc, it may be obvious or subtle and limited to a portion of a single vessel.–The underlying mechanism for this phenomenon is not fully understood, however it has been demonstrated that venous collapse occurs due to the difference in pulse pressure between the intracranial space and the intraocular space.–This pressure difference is transmitted across the lamina cribrosa and across the vessels at the optic disc.This causes pulsation of the retinal veins rather than the retinal arteries due to their compliant thin walls.

The presence of SVP is highly sensitive for the patient not having raised intracranial pressure.–This is due to the fact that when patients have raised ICP, the translaminar pressure gradient which causes SVP is reduced causing the cessation of SVP.There is some debate about the sensitivity of the presence of SVP for normal ICP.Early studies conducted suggest that if SVP is present, the ICP is less than 190mmH 2 O at the time of examination, implying 100% sensitivity.A more recent study demonstrated that the sensitivity of the presence of SVP for a normal intracranial pressure was 0.89, however patients in this study were examined with un-dilated pupils.The absence of SVP is not specific for raised ICP as the incidence of SVP is highly variable and may be present in up to 90% of the normal population.–This relationship between SVP and ICP means that the assessment of SVP can act as an indirect qualitative assessment of ICP.As such it is highly useful as part of an assessment of patients with headaches, in part because it is non-invasive and not traumatic for patients.

### Influence of retinal venous pressure on visual and structural outcomes in eyes with central retinal vein occlusion undergoing anti-VEGF treatment [^e9a8a904]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

At baseline, spontaneous pulsations of the central retinal vein were absent in all eyes across both groups, indicating elevated RVP at the start of the study. By the 12-month follow-up, spontaneous pulsations had become evident in four eyes within the low RVP group and in one eye from the high RVP group, suggesting a partial restoration of normal venous hemodynamics in these cases. Mean RVP exhibited a progressive decline in both groups over the 12-month follow-up period. A prior study investigating the relationship between RVP and visual outcomes, as well as retinal ischemia in eyes with CRVO, categorized baseline RVP into three levels: low (17% of patients), moderate (67%), and high (16%).Over the course of the 18-month follow-up, RVP demonstrated a general downward trend, with the distribution shifting to 41%, 48.9%, and 10.2% for the low, moderate, and high categories, respectively. These findings suggest that improvements in retinal venous outflow may occur naturally over time in CRVO eyes. Additionally, another study reported a significant reduction in RVP in CRVO-ME eyes following a single intravitreal anti-VEGF injection.However, the authors noted that it was not conclusively determined whether this reduction in RVP was directly attributable to the anti-VEGF treatment.

Our findings revealed that the baseline mean diastolic CRAP was significantly lower in the high RVP group compared to the low RVP group. This observation aligns with previous research indicating that diastolic CRAP is markedly reduced in eyes with ischemic CRVO compared to nonischemic CRVO, which itself exhibits lower values than those observed in healthy controls.The reduction in diastolic CRAP in CRVO-affected eyes is likely a consequence of elevated RVP, as increased intraluminal pressure in the retinal capillary network can impede or even halt arterial blood flow in severe cases, such as combined central retinal artery and vein occlusion.In the present study, mean diastolic CRAP progressively increased in both groups following anti-VEGF therapy over the 12-month follow-up period, suggesting potential improvements in retinal perfusion dynamics. This rise in diastolic CRAP may reflect a natural progression in CRVO eyes rather than a direct effect of anti-VEGF injections. In fact, anti-VEGF injections can cause temporary vasoconstriction of the retinal arteries, reducing retinal blood flow and velocity in RVO eyes, which might decrease retinal capillary perfusion.The implications of changes in CRAP in CRVO require further investigation.

### Frequency of spontaneous pulsations of the central retinal vein in glaucoma [^254ce827]. Journal of Glaucoma (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the prevalence of spontaneous pulsations of the central retinal vein in eyes with chronic open-angle glaucoma versus normal eyes in the setting of a general ophthalmic practice.

Methods

The clinical observational case-series study included 167 eyes of 84 subjects with chronic open-angle glaucoma and 704 eyes (352 subjects) of a control group. The optic disc was ophthalmoscopically examined using a noncontact ophthalmoscopic lens at the slit lamp in medical mydriasis.

Results

Spontaneous pulsations of the central retinal vein were observed in significantly (P=0.005; odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.84) fewer eyes of the glaucoma group (107/167 or 64.1%+/-3.7%%) than in the eyes of the control group (530/704 or 75.3%+/-1.6%). In both groups, the presence of a spontaneous central retinal vein pulsation was statistically (P>0.10) independent of age, sex, refractive error, and intraocular pressure.

Conclusions

As examined in a nonreferral ophthalmic practice, eyes with chronic open-angle glaucoma compared with normal eyes show a significantly lower frequency of detected spontaneous pulsations of the central retinal vein. Confirming previous hospital-based studies, the results suggest that assessment of the central retinal vessel pulsations, as part of an optic disc examination may clinically be useful for the diagnosis of glaucoma.

### Association of intracranial pressure and spontaneous retinal venous pulsation [^0cd4f9f6]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

A convenient and reliable method for noninvasive intracranial pressure assessments is desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures (eg, intracranial pressure monitoring and lumbar punctures) and allow clinicians to identify and treat patients with intracranial hypertension in a timely manner.

Objective

To determine whether infrared video assessment of spontaneous retinal venous pulsation is associated with intracranial pressure and is a valid tool to indicate the presence or absence of raised intracranial pressure in patients without papilledema.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A single-center prospective study was conducted at a tertiary referral center between January 2017 and May 2018. Patients consecutively admitted for clinically indicated elective 24-hour invasive intracranial pressure monitoring had ophthalmic review including infrared video recording of their spontaneous venous pulsation. Two neuro-ophthalmologists, who were masked to the intracranial pressure monitoring results, independently graded the spontaneous venous pulsation (grade 0 to 3). Analysis began in June 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The association between simultaneously recorded intracranial pressure and spontaneous venous pulsation (binary variable: present/absent) assessed through retinal infrared video recordings was evaluated using a multiple linear regression model.

Results

Of 105 patients, the mean (SD) age was 39 (14) years, and 79 (75%) were women. The mean (SD) simultaneous intracranial pressure was 1 (5) mm Hg for 91 patients (86.7%) with spontaneous venous pulsations and 13 (14) mm Hg for 14 patients (13.3%) without spontaneous venous pulsations. A multiple linear regression model adjusted for 7 potential confounders confirmed a statistically significant association between intracranial pressure and spontaneous venous pulsation (β=-9.1; 95% CI, -13.7 to -4.6; P<.001; adjusted R2=0.42).

Conclusions and Relevance

The absence of spontaneous venous pulsation on retinal infrared video recordings is significantly associated with higher levels of intracranial pressure and should raise the suspicion of intracranial hypertension.

### Retinal venous pulsation in glaucoma and glaucoma suspects [^998187be]. Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether changes in central retinal vein pulsation characteristics occur in glaucoma, and how these are related to indices of glaucoma severity.

Design

A large, consecutive, prospective, case-controlled study.

Participants

Ninety-four consecutive glaucoma patients and 105 glaucoma suspects seen in a tertiary referral clinic were examined. Forty-one age-matched normal subjects also were examined.

Methods

The presence or absence of spontaneous venous pulsation was observed in these 3 groups. The ophthalmodynamometric force (ODF) required to induce venous pulsation at the optic disc was measured in those without spontaneous pulsation. Optic disc photographs were obtained and visual field testing was performed for all subjects.

Main Outcome Measures

The prevalence of spontaneous venous pulsation between these 3 groups was compared. The relationship between ODF and visual field mean deviation, neuroretinal rim area, age, intraocular pressure (IOP), gender, and diagnosis of glaucoma was investigated using linear mixed models fitted by Gibb's sampling.

Results

Significantly fewer (chi-square, 27.7; P<0.001) glaucoma patients (54%) were observed to have spontaneous venous pulsation than suspects (75%) or normals (98%). A worse visual field mean deviation was shown to be the most significant predictor of a higher ODF (P<0.000), with younger age (P<0.000) also predictive of a higher ODF. A strong relationship between ODF and mean deviation was found in the glaucoma patients (r = 0.59; n = 52; P<0.001).

Conclusions

Spontaneous venous pulsation is less common in glaucoma. The ODF required to induce venous pulsation is increased in glaucoma, and this ODF is greater in those with more severe field loss.

### Central retinal venous pulsation pressure in different stages of primary open-angle glaucoma [^cdb0a857]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate the central retinal venous pulsation pressure (CRVPP) in patients with intraocular pressure (IOP)-controlled early, moderate and advanced open-angle glaucoma and a healthy control group.

Methods

CRVPP was measured with a contact lens dynamometer calibrated in mm Hg (Meditron GmbH, Voelklingen, Germany) in 34 patients with IOP-controlled open-angle glaucoma who were selected consecutively and according to the stage of their visual fields and 27 age-matched healthy controls. If a spontaneous venous pulsation was seen, CRVPP was considered to be equal to IOP. Visual fields were tested with the Humphrey 30-2 SST programme. The ocular perfusion pressure was conventionally calculated as OPP1=2/3MAP-IOP (MAP=systemic mean arterial blood pressure) and, using the measured CRVPP in the formula, as OPP2=2/3MAP-CRVPP. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney U test.

Results

Median CRVPP was 14.0 mm Hg (IQR 12.0-16.0) in controls, 15.0 mm Hg (IQR 14.0-17.0) in early, 38.9 mm Hg (IQR 29.9-48.4) in moderate and 34.6 mm Hg (IQR 23.9-51.0) in advanced glaucoma cases. The conventionally calculated OPP1 was 49.8 mm Hg (IQR 42.7-57.6) for controls, 56.9 mm Hg (IQR 55.3-58.8) for early, 56.6 mm Hg (IQR 51.2-64.4) for moderate and 59.3 mm Hg (IQR 53.9-61.6) for advanced cases. OPP2 was equal to OPP1 in the control group, 56.1 mm Hg (IQR 54.5-57.9) in early, 25.1 mm Hg (IQR 15.7-38.6) and 34.2 mm Hg (IQR 20.4-47.5) in moderate and advanced cases. This difference was statistically significant for moderate (OPP2 lower; p=0.003) and advanced (OPP2 lower; p=0.002) cases.

Conclusions

In more advanced cases of glaucoma, CRVPP seems to be much higher than previously thought. This might further compromise the perfusion pressure in the prelaminar region of the optic nerve head and be of clinical importance, especially in IOP-controlled more advanced cases. This should be considered as a possible risk factor for progression.

### Influence of retinal venous pressure on visual and structural outcomes in eyes with central retinal vein occlusion undergoing anti-VEGF treatment [^d818e144]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 
Changes in mean RVP over 12 months after IVR treatment for ME secondary to CRVO in the low RVP group (Group 1) and the high RVP group (Group 2). Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean. Asterisks (** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001) indicate time points with significant between-group differences.

At baseline, no spontaneous pulsations of the central retinal vein were identified in any eyes across both groups, confirming elevated RVP in all cases. By the 3-month follow-up, spontaneous pulsations were detected in two eyes from Group 1, both of which had only received the initial three injections without requiring additional treatments throughout the 12-month study period. At the final 12-month follow-up, spontaneous pulsations of the central retinal vein were present in four eyes within Group 1 (21.1%) and in one eye within Group 2 (8.3%).

### Relationship of intraocular pulse pressure and spontaneous venous pulsations [^e60b35bf]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the influence of intraocular pulse pressure (IOPP) on the presence of spontaneous venous pulsations (SVP) in patients with normal intracranial pressure.

Design

Clinic-based cross-sectional study.

Methods

Forty-seven patients without signs and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure were recruited from a general ophthalmology clinic. Patients with glaucoma or retinal vascular disease were excluded from the study. IOP was determined by applanation, and IOPP was measured with the Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer (Ziemer Group, Port, Switzerland). SVP were assessed by undilated (direct) and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy. Other variables assessed included age, cup-to-disc ratio, and refractive error (spherical equivalent). The main outcome measure was the presence of SVPs with normal IOPP.

Results

The incidence of SVPs declined with increasing age in a nonlinear manner. Dilated examinations yielded the greatest sensitivity for detecting SVPs, with 91.5% of subjects having SVPs. However, in subjects with IOPP of 1.2 mm Hg or more in at least one eye, the incidence of SVPs was 100%.

Conclusions

A significant correlation exists between the amplitude of IOPP and the presence of SVPs, with SVPs detected in one or both eyes of all patients with IOPP of 1.2 mm Hg or more. When IOPP is 1.2 mm Hg or more, absent SVPs may be more predictive of elevated intracranial pressure than previously recognized.

### Detection and characterization of tree shrew retinal venous pulsations: an animal model to study human retinal venous pulsations [^81ce346e]. Experimental Eye Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous retinal venous pulsations (SRVPs), pulsations of branches of the central retinal vein, are affected by intraocular pressure (IOP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) and thus convey potentially-useful information about ICP. However, the exact relationship between SRVPs, IOP, and ICP is unknown. It is not easily feasible to study this relationship in humans, necessitating the use of an animal model. We here propose tree shrews as a suitable animal model to study the complex relationship between SRVPs, IOP, and ICP. Tree shrew SRVP incidence was determined in a population of animals. Following validation of a modified IOP control system to accurately and quickly control IOP, IOP and/or ICP were manipulated in two tree shrews with SRVPs and the effects on SRVP properties were quantified. SRVPs were present in 75% of tree shrews at physiologic IOP and ICP. Altering IOP or ICP produced changes in tree shrew SRVP properties; specifically, increasing IOP caused SRVP amplitude to increase, while increasing ICP caused SRVP amplitude to decrease. In addition, a higher IOP was necessary to generate SRVPs at a higher ICP than at a lower ICP. SRVPs occur with a similar incidence in tree shrews as in humans, and tree shrew SRVPs are affected by changes in IOP and ICP in a manner qualitatively similar to that reported in humans. In view of anatomic similarities, tree shrews are a promising animal model system to further study the complex relationship between SRVPs, IOP, and ICP.

### Value of retinal vein pulsation characteristics in predicting increased optic disc excavation [^122090d3]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Retinal vein pulsation is often absent in glaucoma, but can be induced by applying a graded ophthalmodynamometric force (ODF) to the eye, which is elevated in glaucoma.

Aim

To assess whether ODF has a predictive value in determining glaucoma progression.

Methods

75 patients with glaucoma and suspected glaucoma were examined prospectively in 1996, and then re-examined at a mean of 82 months later. All subjects had intraocular pressure, visual fields, stereo optic disc photography and ODF measured on their initial visit. When venous pulsation was spontaneous, the ODF was said to be 0 g. At re-examination, central corneal thickness and blood pressure were also measured. Initial and subsequent optic disc photographs were compared and graded into those that had increased excavation and those that had remained stable. The relationship between increased excavation (recorded as a binary response) and the measured variables was modelled using a multiple mixed effects logistic regression.

Results

ODF at the initial visit was strongly predictive of increased excavation (p = 0.004, odds ratio 1.16/g, range 0-60 g), with greater predictive value in women than in men (p = 0.004). Visual field mean deviation was predictive of increased excavation (p = 0.044), as was optic nerve haemorrhage in association with older age (p = 0.038). Central corneal thickness was not significantly predictive of increased excavation (p = 0.074) after having adjusted for other variables.

Conclusion

ODF measurement seems to be strongly predictive of the patient's risk for increased optic disc excavation. This suggests that ODF measurement may have predictive value in assessing the likelihood of glaucoma progression.

### Ocular changes as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease [^dab0737a]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Similarly, retinal microvascular anomalies have been observed to be associated with cognition,,structural brain changes as measured by MRI,retinal layer thickness,,,cognitive ability, and AD severity.Moreover, retinal arterial dilation was found to correlate with CSF Aβ levels in AD and MCI subjects,whereas the retinal venous and arterial pulsation amplitudes were found to correlate with neocortical Aβ scores negatively and positively, respectively.Multiple studies have suggested a wide range of retinal vascular abnormalities, including decreased blood flow,,reduced perfusion density,,,altered microvascular network,,,,,,,,,increased retinal oxygen saturation in arterioles and venules,venule diameter changes,,,,,,and increased vascular tortuosity,,in AD cases compared to controls. Conversely, some studies reported reduced vascular tortuosity,and a higher retinal artery diameter in the vicinity of the optic disc,in the AD retina than in the controls. However, some studies could not demonstrate any significant differences in retinal perfusion density,,,decreased blood flow,artery diameter,,venular diameter,and altered vascular network,between cases and controls. Researchers have hypothesized that vascular measures such as caliber vary with the cardiac cycle and can be altered in static retinal images. So, vascular screening methods will indeed be effective if vascular parameters can account for pulse‐driven fluctuations.Other factors for these inconsistent outcomes include differences in the study instrumentation, sample size, and subjects. For example, the majority of the studies on retinal vascular changes in AD are cross‐sectional studies including individuals with AD dementia, while others have investigated cohorts with MCI,,both AD and MCI,,,,,,,,,,neocortical Aβ or hyperphosphorylated tau positive,,,,,, APOE ε4 gene carrier,,and cognitively impaired,,individuals as subjects. Among the studies with AD and MCI subjects, only a few were able to detect significant differences in vascular parameters.

### Relationship of intraocular pressure and frequency of spontaneous retinal venous pulsation in primary open-angle glaucoma [^2b39a0f8]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the relationship of intraocular pressure (IOP) and the frequency of spontaneous venous pulsation (SVP) in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Participants

A total of 229 eyes of 229 patients with POAG and 205 eyes of 205 glaucoma suspects as a control.

Methods

The SVP was assessed using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (Spectralis HRA, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) movie tool. Patients with POAG were divided into 3 groups on the basis of the frequency distribution of untreated IOP: lower tertile (IOP ≤ 15 mmHg; group A), middle tertile (IOP >15 and ≤ 21 mmHg; group B), and upper tertile (IOP >21 mmHg; group C). The frequency of SVP was compared between the glaucoma suspects and patients with POAG and among the 3 groups of POAG. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with the frequency of SVP.

Main Outcome Measures

Frequency of SVP in patients with POAG and glaucoma suspects.

Results

Spontaneous venous pulsation was more frequently found in glaucoma suspects than in patients with POAG (86.3% vs. 53.3%, P<0.0001). Within the POAG group, the frequency of SVP was significantly lower in group A (40.2%) than in group B (57.3%, P = 0.03) and group C (63.9%, P = 0.003). There was no significant difference between groups B and C (P = 0.42). In addition to IOP (P = 0.007), visual field mean deviation (MD) and refractive error were associated with the frequency of SVP (P<0.0001 and P = 0.011, respectively). When analyzed within the same stage of disease, SVP was less frequently found in group A than in group C in early (P = 0.011) and advanced (P = 0.044) glaucoma and marginally less frequently found in moderate glaucoma (P = 0.080).

Conclusions

Spontaneous venous pulsation was less common in patients with POAG than in glaucoma suspects. Among the patients with POAG, SVP was less common in patients with low IOP at all stages of disease. These results are consistent with vascular factors having a more significant role in patients with POAG with low IOP than in patients with POAG with higher IOP.

### Influence of retinal venous pressure on visual and structural outcomes in eyes with central retinal vein occlusion undergoing anti-VEGF treatment [^7400aad8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

An additional significant observation from this study is the reduced number of IVR injections required in the low RVP group compared to the high RVP group over the 12-month follow-up period (6.3 vs 7.8 injections; P = 0.017). Notably, two eyes (10.5%) in the low RVP group required only the initial three injections, with no need for further retreatments. In these cases, RVP normalized, and spontaneous pulsations of the central retinal vein were observed by the 3-month follow-up. Conversely, all eyes in the high RVP group necessitated additional injections beyond the initial treatment series. Histopathological studies indicate that CRVO typically occurs in the lamina cribrosa region, characterized by thrombosis.While most thrombi can recanalize, restoring some circulation, this recovery process may take considerable time. We hypothesize that eyes in the low RVP group may develop recanalized channels more quickly or may have had incomplete occlusions at baseline, facilitating the normalization of retinal circulation and resulting in fewer retreatments. Responses to anti-VEGF therapy in CRVO-ME patients vary significantly between individuals, with most requiring repeated injections over several years.In our previous study, only 12.2% eyes showed no recurrence of ME after the initial ME resolution.Measuring RVP and identifying the baseline characteristics of these patients can help us select different treatment regimen, thus reducing treatment burden and achieving the goals of precision treatment and tailored treatment. These findings and hypotheses warrant further investigation in larger, randomized, controlled clinical trials.

### Influence of retinal venous pressure on visual and structural outcomes in eyes with central retinal vein occlusion undergoing anti-VEGF treatment [^cd823e37]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

RVP Measurement

The measurement of RVP was performed at baseline and during follow-up visits using an ophthalmodynamometer (Imedos Systems UG, Jena, Germany; previously Meditron GmbH, Völklingen, Germany). This technique, thoroughly described in previous studies,,utilizes a Goldmann contact lens modified with a pressure sensor encircling its outer rim. The sensor continuously monitors the pressure applied through the lens and subsequently to the eye. Following pharmacological mydriasis induced with tropicamide, the optic nerve head was examined using a slit lamp and a noncontact lens to detect any spontaneous pulsations in the central retinal vein or its branches. If such pulsations were present, RVP was assumed to equal the IOP. In the absence of pulsations, topical anesthesia was administered, and the Goldmann lens was gently placed on the corneal surface. The absence of pulsations was confirmed after observing three complete breathing cycles. Gradual pressure was then applied via the lens while continuously monitoring the optic nerve head. The appearance of pulsations in the central retinal vein or its branches was recorded as the ocular dynamic force (ODF), and RVP was calculated by summing ODF and IOP. To measure diastolic central retinal artery pressure (CRAP), additional pressure was applied until slight pulsations were observed in the central retinal artery. Diastolic CRAP was determined by adding the corresponding ODF value to the IOP. Each measurement was conducted a minimum of nine times, and the average was used for subsequent statistical analysis.

Patients were categorized into two distinct groups based on baseline RVP and diastolic CRAP measurements. Group 1, referred to as the low RVP group, consisted of individuals with RVP values lower than the diastolic CRAP, suggesting the likelihood of continuous retinal blood flow throughout the cardiac cycle. In contrast, Group 2, identified as the high RVP group, included patients whose RVP was equal to or exceeded the diastolic CRAP, indicating intermittent or restricted retinal perfusion.

3.4.5 Other retinal imaging modalities

Golzan et al.assessed retinal vascular pulsation with a dynamic vessel analyzer (DVA) and found that retinal arterial pulsations (RAP) were significantly smaller in controls (4.0 ± 1.2 μm) than in cases (5.2 ± 1.2 μm) (n = 73 participants, p = 0.01) and retinal venous pulsations (RVP) were significantly greater in controls (5.8 ± 1 μm) than in cases (5.2 ± 1 μm) (n = 73 participants, p = 0.03). Furthermore, they reported a reduction in flicker‐induced retinal arterial and venous dilation in cases compared to controls; however, this was not statistically significant. Forest plots for each of these retinal parameters are included in Appendix D.

Snyder et al.performed blue‐peak autofluorescence (BAF) imaging and identified hyper‐autofluorescent spots, designated as inclusion bodies and postulated to contain fibrillar Aβ, which were found to have larger surface area in AD cases than in controls (see Appendix D). While the difference between AD cases and controls did not reach statistical significance, inclusion body surface area was found to be predictive of Aβ burden (PET standardized volume uptake ratio) (see Appendix F).

3.5 Association between retinal and quantitative AD biomarkers

Fifteen studies investigated the association between retinal and quantitative measures of AD biomarkers, both assessed as continuous variables (see Appendix F). None of the analyses were performed in >1 study and therefore no pooled estimates were derived. Due to this lack of standardization in methods between studies, there was no scope for synthesis in this review.

Two studies assessed FLIO; however, both were classified as category three studies as they did not clearly state whether cases were defined according to biomarker criteria for AD. Nevertheless, both studies assessed associations between amyloid or tau levels and FLIO parameters as continuous variables (see Appendix F).Jentsch et al.found significant associations between FLIO parameters (relative contribution Q 2 and amplitude a 2 in channel 2) and CSF tau levels. On the other hand, Jentsch et al.and Sadda et al.found no significant association between mean fluorescence lifetime and CSF tau and Aβ levels.

### The neurovasculome: key roles in brain health and cognitive impairment: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^7855bf3f]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Perivascular fluid-driving mechanisms are debated: arterial pulsations generated by heartbeat and breathing can generate unidirectional fluid flow in perivascular spaces, and fluorescently labeled tracers injected into the cisterna magna traveled into the brain along periarteriolar spaces in a pulsatile manner in phase with the cardiac cycle, yet whether such subtle arteriolar wall displacements can drive fluid out of the brain along perivenular or intramural pathways has been disputed; vasomotion is an alternative candidate, observed during resting wakefulness as spontaneous large arterial diameter fluctuations at low frequency (0.1 Hz), and low-frequency hemodynamics increase during sleep which may facilitate waste drainage, but invasive techniques and anesthesia used in preclinical studies can interfere with brain homeostasis, highlighting a need for noninvasive imaging preferably in the awake resting or sleep state.

### Mural cell SRF controls pericyte migration, vessel patterning and blood flow [^7369ab37]. Circulation Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Loss of Vascular Tone in the Absence of Mural SRF

Our transcriptomic analyses of MCs, isolated from P12 Srf iMCKO and control retinas revealed a conspicuous misregulation of genes involved in the regulation of the vascular tone. To explore the biological significance of these results, we investigated the retinal vascular morphology of control and Srf iMCKO mice at 3, 4, and 8 weeks of age in vivo via scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography. Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy confirmed a substantial enlargement of arterial and venous vessels in all examined Srf iMCKO retinas (Figure 7 A). Moreover, we were able to classify the individual vascular alterations into three different degrees of severity, ranging from mild and intermediate to severe. Strikingly, there were also major abnormalities in the dynamic movement of vessel walls associated with blood pulsations in Srf iMCKO retinas. Although the vessel wall of arteries in control retinas showed relatively scant movements, we observed exceptionally strong pulsating motion in the arterial wall of Srf iMCKO animals (Figure 7 A through 7 C;). This finding is in strong support of a hemodynamically relevant loss of the vascular tone. Moreover, in our longitudinal study, we further observed that arterial and venous vessels gradually enlarged during the course of the experiment. This effect was quantified by repetitive size assessment of identical vessels at 3, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively (Figure 7 D). In the most severe cases, we observed that venous vessels ruptured (Figure 7 D), which further supports the hypothesis that vSMCs had lost their ability to modulate blood pressure.

### The effect of optic disk edema on spontaneous venous pulsations [^baa5ff40]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the effect of optic disk edema on spontaneous venous pulsations (SVP) in patients without elevated intracranial pressure (ICP).Prospective, cross-sectional comparison in an institutional setting.

Methods

Twenty consecutive patients with unilateral optic disk edema due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION, n = 11) or optic neuritis (n = 9) were evaluated. The proportion of subjects with SVP in both eyes, the involved eye only, the uninvolved eye only, or neither eye was determined. Comparisons were made using the Exact McNemar Test.

Results

There was a significant difference in the proportion of uninvolved and involved eyes with SVP (60% [12/20] vs 5% [1/20], P <.005). Spontaneous venous pulsations were present in the uninvolved eye of 12 patients and the nonedematous portion of the optic disk in 1 patient with segmental edema from AION.

Conclusions

Optic disk edema may cause SVP cessation without ICP elevation.

### Retinal microvasculature in relation to central hemodynamics in a flemish population [^3d4eb6c7]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

The mechanical and functional properties of blood vessels, including arterial stiffness and wave reflection, predict cardiovascular complications over and beyond traditional risk factors. – The arterial pressure wave consists of a forward component generated by the heart and reflected waves returning from peripheral branching sites to the central aorta. – In stiff compared with elastic arteries, reflected waves return faster, reach the proximal aorta during systole, and augment late systolic blood pressure.Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) is the gold standard in the assessment of arterial stiffness.

The observation that retinal microvascular diameters predict cardiovascular mortality,coronary heart disease,and lacunar stroke,extended research from the macrocirculation to the microcirculation. The brain is continually perfused at high volume flow throughout systole and diastole, so that pulsations are transmitted through the capillary network up to the venous efflux.The retina shares similar embryological origin, anatomic features, and physiological properties with cerebral microvasculature.Nonmydriatic retinal photography allows noninvasive visualization of the retinal microvasculature in population surveys. – Few studies addressed the association between the retinal microcirculation and the properties of the large arteries – but are difficult to interpret, because they cannot be generalized to the general population,, because they involved brachial-ankle PWV and thereby encompassed both elastic and muscular arteries,, or because they had a small sample size. Our literature review did not reveal any previous study that addressed the possible association of retinal microvascular traits with the forward and backward components of the aortic pulse wave. – We addressed this knowledge gap by analyzing data from the FLEMENGHO (Flemish Study on Environment, Genes, and Health Outcomes).

### Central venous pulsations: new findings, clinical importance and relation to cerebrospinal fluid pressure [^be2e2ebd]. Journal of Glaucoma (2013). Low credibility.

The translaminar pressure gradient (TLPG) is largely influenced by the difference between intraocular pressure (IOP) and cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), but modulated by the buffering effect of orbital tissue and pia mater, which limits the reduction in retrolaminar tissue pressure as intracranial CSFP falls below 0 mm Hg. Across the lamina cribrosa, the central retinal vein experiences the greatest pressure gradient (TLPG) of any vein in the body. When CSFP rises, the minimum IOP required to induce venous pulsation pressure (VPP) rises with CSFP (r=0.95, slope=0.90). Lowering IOP in glaucoma patients leads to a reduction in VPP (P=0.0003). The normal human central retinal vein endothelial cells in the lamina region resemble typical arterial endothelia and are quite unlike other venous cells. It is likely that the TLPG is increasing retinal vein shear and in glaucoma this effect is likely to be increased with possible wall effects.

### The association between retinal vein ophthalmodynamometric force change and optic disc excavation [^b71aeeb0]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

Retinal vein ophthalmodynamometric force (ODF) is predictive of future optic disc excavation in glaucoma, but it is not known if variation in ODF affects prognosis. We aimed to assess whether a change in ODF provides additional prognostic information.

Methods

135 eyes of 75 patients with glaucoma or being glaucoma suspects had intraocular pressure (IOP), visual fields, stereo optic disc photography and ODF measured on an initial visit and a subsequent visit at mean 82 (SD 7.3) months later. Corneal thickness and blood pressure were recorded on the latter visit. When venous pulsation was spontaneous, the ODF was recorded as 0 g. Change in ODF was calculated. Flicker stereochronoscopy was used to determine the occurrence of optic disc excavation, which was modelled against the measured variables using multiple mixed effects logistic regression.

Results

Change in ODF (p = 0.046) was associated with increased excavation. Average IOP (p = 0.66) and other variables were not associated. Odds ratio for increased optic disc excavation of 1.045 per gram ODF change (95% CI 1.001 to 1.090) was calculated.

Conclusion

Change in retinal vein ODF may provide additional information to assist with glaucoma prognostication and implies a significant relationship between venous change and glaucoma patho-physiology.

### Structural characteristics of the optic nerve head influencing human retinal venous pulsations [^a4fd69ee]. Experimental Eye Research (2016). Low credibility.

The relationship between structural characteristics of the optic nerve head and venous pulsations in the human eye remain unknown. Using photoplethysmographic techniques we investigated whether properties of the human retinal veins and their surrounding structures influence venous pulsation. 448 locations of venous pulsation were analysed from 26 normal human eyes. Green channel densitometry derived from video recordings of venous pulsations were used to generate a map of venous pulsation amplitudes along retinal veins. Optical coherence tomography was used to perform quantitative measurements of tissue characteristics at sites of high and low amplitude points as well as in a second analysis, at maximal amplitude pulsation sites from superior and inferior halves of the eyes. Structural characteristics measured included venous diameter, distance from pulsation point to cup margin, vessel length from pulsation point to vein exit, tissue thickness overlying vein, optic disc diameter and presence of a proximal arteriovenous crossing. Increasing venous pulsation amplitudes were associated with larger applied ophthalmodynamometry force, increasing venous diameter, and decreasing absolute cup margin distance (all p < 0.001). Increasing distance of maximal amplitude pulsation point to cup margin was associated with the presence of a proximal arteriovenous crossing, increasing venous diameter, and decreasing tissue depth (all p ≤ 0.001). Venous diameter and tissue depth alter venous compliance, which is likely to be a major factor determining sites of venous pulsation.

### Quantitative retinal vascular changes in obstructive sleep apnea [^a43cb6b1]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the relationship between both static and dynamic retinal vascular caliber and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Design

Prospective cross-sectional study.

Methods

Adult patients undergoing diagnostic polysomnography studies at a private Australian university teaching hospital were recruited. OSA severity was defined by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI): severe >30, moderate >15-30, mild 5-15, and controls <5. Of 115 patients recruited (73 male; mean age 58 ± 13 years), there were 41 severe, 35 moderate, and 25 mild OSA patients and 14 controls. Static retinal vascular caliber was measured as the average diameter of retinal arterioles (CRAE) and venules (CRVE), and summarized as the arteriovenous ratio (AVR). Dynamic retinal vascular caliber was evaluated as the average pulsation amplitude of retinal arterioles (SRAP) and venules (SRVP). Comparisons across groups were performed using multivariate linear regression analysis. All results were adjusted for age, body mass index, and mean arterial pressure.

Results

Increasing AHI was significantly associated with decreasing AVR (P = .008) and CRAE (P = .016). A significant relationship was demonstrated between increasing AHI and attenuated retinal vascular pulsation amplitude (arterioles P = .028; venules P < .0001).

Conclusions

Increasing OSA severity is independently associated with retinal arteriolar narrowing and attenuated vascular pulsation amplitude. The retinal vasculature is easily imaged, and may be a surrogate biomarker of cerebral and systemic vascular risk in patients with OSA requiring further comprehensive investigation.

### Updates on ophthalmic imaging features of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema [^281c3528]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Typical appearance of papilledema and optic disc edema on color fundus photography and fluorescein angiography

Optic disc in papilledema typically exhibits hyperemia, dilated and tortuous veins, and splinter hemorrhages in acute cases, or smooth, champagne cork-like elevation in chronic cases. Different causes of optic disc edema may look slightly different. Severe papilledema and optic disc edema may be associated with narrowed or obscured papillary arterioles (optic disc ischemia), cotton wool spots (nerve fiber layer ischemia), exudates, Paton's lines, and retinal and choroidal folds. Spontaneous venous pulsation may be subtle or absent in papilledema but visible in at least one eye in optic disc edema. On fluorescein angiography, papilledema is associated with normal perfusion, excess vascularity, and early as well as late staining of the optic disc. Nonischemic optic disc edema is also associated with normal perfusion of the optic disc, whereas most cases of optic disc edema from AION have significantly delayed filling of the optic disc.

### New observations concerning the nature of central retinal vein pulsation [^2d3ed626]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Central retinal vein pulsation is affected by intracranial pressure (ICP), glaucoma and venous pathology. Its genesis is poorly understood with most models suggesting that intraocular pressure (IOP) fluctuation dominates the rhythm of venous pulsation; however, this has not been explored experimentally. This study planned to measure the timing of central retinal vein pulsation with respect to IOP pulse.

Methods

Video recording of the optic disc vessels and movement of Goldmann applanation mires while recording the cardiac cycle with a pulse oximeter probe was undertaken in 10 subjects from a general ophthalmic clinic. The timing of the variation in IOP and retinal vein diameter from the onset of the oximeter signal were expressed as a percentage of the cardiac cycle and also in degrees of the cycle.

Results

Minimum vein diameter occurred at a mean 40 ms (SD 47) after minimum IOP in 10 subjects with mean cardiac cycle length of 866 ms (SD 132), the delay representing 4% or 14 degrees (SD 5.1, 95% CI 0.3% to 8%) of the mean cardiac cycle. Maximum vein diameter occurred an average of 5 ms after maximum IOP (SD 57) representing 1% or 4 degrees (SD 6.9, 95% CI -4% to 6%) of the mean cardiac cycle.

Conclusion

During venous pulsation, venous collapse occurred in time with ocular diastole and dilatation in time with systole. This is contrary to earlier conceptual understanding. The results suggest that the intracranial pulse pressure may be of equal importance to intraocular pulse pressure in producing venous pulsation.

### Central blood pressure, arterial waveform analysis, and vascular risk factors in glaucoma [^ad0a5839]. Journal of Glaucoma (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Reduced ocular perfusion pressure has been linked to glaucoma, and increased arterial stiffness is implicated in systemic cardiovascular risk. This study measured central blood pressure (BP) and arterial waveforms derived from pulse tonometry, together with data on systemic and ocular vascular factors relevant to glaucoma status.

Methods

A total of 126 patients and 66 normal controls were tested, including 90 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients and 36 normal tension glaucoma (NTG) patients. Glaucoma patients had been followed for at least 3 years and inclusion required several (>4) reliable visual fields such that glaucoma progression could be determined. Radial pulse tonometry and brachial BP data were collected, together with data on disc hemorrhages, spontaneous venous pulsation, peripapillary atrophy, smoking, and medications.

Results

Brachial BP or derived central aortic BP parameters generally showed no significant differences between glaucoma patients and normal individuals. The POAG group had a lower pulse pressure, which was also significant in the regression analysis (P<0.002). In the arterial waveform analysis, POAG was associated with a lower brachial form factor than NTG (P<0.001) and higher subendocardial viability ratio (P<0.008). NTG was associated with a lower body mass index, and POAG with a smoking history. There was an increased incidence of disc hemorrhages and a reduced incidence of spontaneous venous pulsations in the progressing group.

Conclusions

Derived central BP does not reveal significant differences from controls or in glaucoma subgroups, but a reduced pulse pressure was identified. There may be some changes in arterial pulse waveform shape suggesting possible differences in diastolic perfusion. Disc hemorrhages and loss of spontaneous venous pulsation were associated with disease progression.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^164b8cf5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Pseudopapilloedema must be distinguished from early papilloedema. Ocular ultrasound may be useful in differentiating optic nerve oedema from drusen and measuring fluid in the optic nerve sheath. Additionally, the calcification in optic nerve head drusen are readily seen on CT imaging, therefore, revisiting imaging performed may be useful. However, we do not recommend drusen as an indication for CT scanning. Fundus fluorescein angiography can identify optic disc leakage in papilloedema, and is used occasionally.

Features of papilloedema include initial hyperaemia of the disc, blurring of the disc margins, elevation of the disc with a periapillary halo, loss of spontaneous venous pulsation and obscuration of major vessels (figure 3). In severe papilloedema, retinal vessels crossing the disc margin and overlying the optic disc are obscured by the oedematous nerve fibre layer; retinal haemorrhages and cotton wool spots may be present, serial colour fundus photographs are useful in recording disc findings and help document resolution.

Formal grading of papilloedema using the Frisén scale has been shown to have a limited reproducibility with high intraobserver and interobserver variability, and requires a senior level of expertise.Quantification of disc swelling using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an important development. OCT permits high-resolution non-invasive cross-sectional imaging of the neurosensory retina (figure 3). It is analogous to ultrasound imaging, measuring light waves rather than sound.Measurement of the following parameters: retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness; total retinal thickness; optic nerve (ONH) volume; and retinal ganglion cell layer thickness; for longitudinal monitoring of papilloedema is useful.Practically in IIH OCT measurements have been shown to correlated with Frisén grade, but not clinical features or visual dysfunction.However, RNFL thickness demonstrates an indiscriminate ability to separate the resolution of papilloedema from axonal loss in optic atrophy (as exampled in figure 3).As the technology advances, for example enhanced depth imaging and newer light sources, OCT will hopefully be able to distinguish buried ONH drusen.

### The impact of continuous positive airway pressure treatment on retinal vascular changes in obstructive sleep apnea [^a5572278]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was recently shown to be associated with quantifiable retinal vascular changes, which correlate with disease severity. This follow-up study examines the response of retinal vascular changes in patients with OSA receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.

Methods

This prospective cohort study recruited adult patients undergoing diagnostic polysomnography at a tertiary sleep clinic in Sydney, Australia, stratified into 4 groups by the apnea-hypopnea index; control patients and patients with mild, moderate, and severe OSA. At baseline and follow-up approximately 24 months later, static retinal vascular calibers were derived from fundus photographs, and dynamic vascular pulsation amplitudes were measured on video fundoscopy. A proportion of patients started CPAP therapy after baseline assessment.

Results

Seventy-nine patients participated in this follow-up study: 9 control patients and 18 patients with mild OSA, 21 patients with moderate OSA, and 31 patients with severe OSA. Twenty-five patients started CPAP after baseline. In the severe group, patients not on treatment showed progressive narrowing of retinal arteries from baseline, whereas those on CPAP showed a slight improvement (mean, 171.3-165.1 and 171.2-174.0 μm, respectively; P = .012). Arterio-venous ratio was also significantly reduced in the nontreatment group compared to the treatment group in those with severe OSA (0.836-0.821 and 0.837-0.855, respectively; P = .031). CPAP did not seem to have a significant impact on venous caliber or vascular pulsatility.

Conclusions

This study shows that patients with severe untreated OSA demonstrate progressive retinal arterial narrowing, whereas CPAP treatment may be protective.

For all patients and controls, RVP was measured in both eyes by ophthalmodynamometry (Meditron GmbH, Völklingen, Germany). This device consists of a conventional Goldmann contact lens fitted with a pressure sensor at its outer margin where the Goldmann contact lens is usually held during an ophthalmoscopic examination. The device is connected to an LCD screen.

Ophthalmodynamometry is conducted by applying increasing pressure to the eye via the contact lens. This applied pressure can be read as an IOP increase on the attached LCD screen based on a calibration curve. The IOP increase that is required to induce a venous pulsation is called the ophthalmodynamometric force (ODF). If a spontaneous venous pulsation is present, ODF is said to be 0, if not present, increasing pressure is applied. The RVP is defined and calculated as the sum of the ODF and IOP [RVP = ODF + IOP]. Measurements by the ophthalmodynamometer are reproducible.

### Ophthalmodynamometric differences between ischemic vs nonischemic retinal vein occlusion [^9eb46121]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To estimate the central retinal vein pressure in patients with ischemic vs nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).

Design

Prospective clinical observational comparative study.

Methods

The study included 28 patients with CRVO, either of the ischemic type (n = 7) or the nonischemic type (n = 21). The control group consisted of 38 subjects without retinal disease. A new ophthalmodynamometer consisting of a Goldmann contact lens fitted with a pressure sensor into the holding grip of the contact lens, was used to indirectly estimate the central retinal artery and vein pressure.

Results

Central retinal vein pressure was significantly higher in the ischemic CRVO group than in the nonischemic CRVO group (91.5 +/- 30.1 arbitrary units vs 52.4 +/- 32.5 arbitrary units; P = .014), in which it was significantly (P < .001) higher than in the control group (4.8 +/- 8.1 arbitrary units). Central retinal vein pressure was higher than the diastolic central retinal artery pressure significantly (P = .039) more frequently in the ischemic CRVO group (7/7 or 100%) than in the nonischemic CRVO group (8/21 or 38%) or the control group (0/38; P < .001). Central retinal artery pressure was significantly (P = .017) lower in the ischemic CRVO group (46.0 +/- 10.6 arbitrary units) than in the nonischemic CRVO group (64.5 +/- 22.8 arbitrary units), in which it was significantly (P = .016) lower than in the control group (79.9 +/- 22.3 arbitrary units).

Conclusions

Ophthalmodynamometric estimation of the retinal vein pressure may be helpful for the differentiation between the ischemic vs nonischemic type of CRVO. In the ischemic type, vein pulsations were usually observed at supradiastolic arterial values.

### Retinal and renal microvasculature in relation to central hemodynamics in 11-year-old children born preterm or at term [^030b3b64]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Prematurity disrupts the perinatal maturation of the microcirculation 1 and macrocirculation 1 and predisposes to impairment of the arterial structure and function later in life, 2 as exemplified by the well‐known narrower retinal arteriolar diameters in children 3, 4 or young adults 5 born prematurely compared with their peers born at term. The brain and kidney are continually perfused at high volume flow throughout systole and diastole, so that pulsations are transmitted through the capillary network up to the venous efflux, 6 in particular if the elastic properties of the aorta degrade. The arterial pressure wave consists of a forward component generated by the heart and reflected waves returning from peripheral branching sites to the central aorta. 7 In stiff compared with elastic arteries, reflected waves return faster, reach the proximal aorta during systole, and augment the late systolic blood pressure (SBP). 8 A recently published case‐control study demonstrated that preterm‐born 18‐year‐old adolescents had higher central SBP than controls attributable to increased wave reflection in the central aorta. 9 However, studies on how premature birth affects the central hemodynamics in children at a younger age are scarce, 10 and, according to our review of the literature, no previous study has addressed how premature birth affects the crosstalk between the retinal or renal microcirculation and central hemodynamics. We addressed this knowledge gap in a case‐control study of 11‐year‐old children born with extremely low birth weight or delivered at term. 11, 12 We hypothesized that the association of retinal and renal microvascular traits in young children might be modulated by prematurity.

### Choroidal blood flow and arterial blood pressure [^0ff5ffe7]. Eye (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Untreated hypertension is associated with ocular complications and is a risk factor for the development and progression of vascular ocular pathologies. We set out to investigate the association between systemic blood pressure and choroidal blood flow.

Methods

All subjects were male non-smokers, who did not receive any medication and had normal or slightly elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure < or = 160 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure < or = 100 mmHg). The association between systemic blood pressure and fundus pulsation amplitude, a measure of pulsatile choroidal blood flow, was investigated in 318 volunteers. In addition, the association between systemic blood pressure and blood flow velocities in the posterior ciliary arteries supplying the choroid was investigated in these subjects.

Results

Ocular fundus pulsation amplitude (r = 0.252; P < 0.001) and mean flow velocity in the posterior ciliary arteries (r = 0.346, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with mean arterial pressure. The correlation of ocular haemodynamic variables with systolic and diastolic blood pressure was in the same range.

Conclusions

Our data indicate a small, but significant increase in choroidal blood flow with increasing blood pressure.

### Influence of retinal venous pressure on visual and structural outcomes in eyes with central retinal vein occlusion undergoing anti-VEGF treatment [^507190ad]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results of this study suggest that ophthalmodynamometry may provide prognostic information in nonischemic CRVO-ME eyes received anti-VEGF treatment, however, this test is not part of the routine clinical evaluation of patients with CRVO. A simplification of this test can be commonly used by clinicians to elucidate whether the venous pressure is increased in patients with CRVO.It relies on the clinical maneuver of exerting pressure on the eye at the same time that the blood vessels are visualized by slit lamp biomicroscopy. As the pressure in the eye is increased (by pressing on the eye), the central retinal artery may collapse at the same time or even before the central retinal vein does, indicating very high venous pressure (venous pressure in normal circumstances is much lower than the pressure in arteries, and thus, veins should collapse earlier than arteries when pressure is exerted on the eye), and poor visual and anatomical outcomes, along with greater required injections.

This study is subject to several limitations. First, the retrospective design may limit the generalizability of the results to broader clinical populations. Second, the relatively small sample size and the short duration of the follow-up period may have restricted the robustness of statistical analyses and the ability to capture long-term outcomes. Third, the measurement of RVP using an ophthalmodynamometer remains an indirect and subjective method. The reliance on the observation of retinal venous pulsations introduces a degree of variability and potential bias, as this approach is inherently dependent on examiner interpretation. The reproducibility of the technique was evaluated in a previous study.It showed that the coefficient of variation for the redetermination of the RVP was 15.9 ± 11.9%, and that the coefficient of variation for the redetermination of the diastolic CRAP was 9.1 ± 4.2%. We employ multiple methods to improve inter- and intra-rater reliability, including standardized protocol, training, monitoring, pilot testing, and repeated measurements. Recent advancements have focused on the development of more objective techniques for evaluating retinal venous pulsations, enabling quantification of their presence or absence with greater accuracy. These innovations hold promise for enhancing the reliability of RVP assessment in future studies. These methods include quantitative vessel diameter measurement,lateral displacement of blood vessels,and hemoglobin concentration assessment.Further research is warranted to validate the findings of this study and to explore their applicability to broader clinical contexts.

### Central pulse pressure is an independent determinant of vascular remodeling in the retinal circulation [^eabc69a8]. Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Pulse pressure has been recognized as a risk factor for stroke. Moreover, it was shown that central pulse pressure relates more strongly to vascular disease and outcome than (peripheral) brachial pulse pressure. Because vascular remodeling in the retinal circulation mirrors the 1 in the cerebral circulation and represents an easy, noninvasive possibility to assess microvascular changes in humans, we analyzed the impact of central pulse pressure on retinal vascular structure in humans. The study cohort comprised 135 nondiabetic patients across a wide range of blood pressure values. Parameter of retinal arteriolar remodeling (wall-to-lumen ratio) was assessed noninvasively and in vivo by scanning laser Doppler flowmetry. Central pulse pressure and augmentation index normalized to a heart rate of 75 beats per minute were assessed by pulse wave analysis. Central pulse pressure correlated with wall-to-lumen ratio (r=0.302; P<0.001), central augmentation index normalized to a heart rate of 75 beats per minute correlated with wall-to-lumen ratio (r=0.190; P=0.028), and in accordance pulse pressure amplification (peripheral pulse pressure/central pulse pressure) was negatively correlated with wall-to-lumen ratio (r=-0.223; P=0.009). In contrast, central mean arterial pressure was not correlated with wall-to-lumen ratio (r=0.110; P=0.203). Multiple regression analysis revealed an independent relationship between wall-to-lumen ratio and central pulse pressure (β=0.277; P=0.009), but not with other classical cardiovascular risk factors. Thus, central pulse pressure, indicative of changes in large conduit arteries is an independent determinant of vascular remodeling in small retinal arterioles. Such a relationship indicates a coupling and crosstalk between the microvascular and macrovascular changes attributable to hypertension.

### Acute monocular blindness associated with spontaneous common carotid artery dissection [^9ed8081f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients with loss of vision is common in the emergency department. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a potentially reversible cause of acute monocular blindness. When evaluating a patient with CRAO, the potential underlying causes should be considered while simultaneously initiating treatment. We present a case of spontaneous common carotid artery dissection manifesting as CRAO and propose that spontaneous carotid artery dissection be included in the differential diagnosis of CRAO.

### ECG-gated retinal vessel calibre as a novel measure of aberrant pulsatile retinal flow in diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study [^09992143]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Arterial stiffness is an independent cardiovascular risk predictor of mortality in diabetes mellitus. It relates to the physiological and anatomical alterations within the arterial wall, resulting in an impairment of vascular compliance, inappropriate responses to changes in blood pressure, and a greater pulsatile flow in end organs such as the retina.

The association of arterial stiffness with diabetes mellitus has increased interest in developing non-invasive screening tools to detect arterial stiffness early in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Arterial applanation tonometry is one method that assesses arterial stiffness through carotid-femoral aortic pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and augmentation index (AIx). The cfPWV is currently the most reliable and valid non-invasive surrogate for estimating arterial stiffness, and is in good agreement with the invasive gold standard of catheterisation. Under rigid conditions for arterial applanation tonometry, cfPWV and AIx demonstrate good intra- and inter-observer reproducibility in subjects with diabetes mellitus. However, these conditions are difficult to create and maintain because of the many limitations of both techniques. An alternative method that may overcome many of these limitations includes the direct assessment of retinal vessel calibre.

Although the association of systemic arterial stiffness with retinal vessel calibre has been described previously, very little has been investigated in diabetes mellitus. The only study to explore this in diabetes mellitus demonstrated that systemic arterial stiffness measured by cardio-ankle vascular index was correlated with ocular microvascular changes in this population. The present study proposes aberrant retinal vessel pulsatile flow as a measure of arterial stiffness in diabetes mellitus, and has developed a novel method of assessing this using mean peak changes in retinal vascular response from baseline based on individual arteriolar and venular calibre measurements (hereby referred to as arteriolar and venular pulsatility). We aimed to determine the associations of diabetes mellitus with our novel method and compare it with the commonly reported method of arterial applanation tonometry measuring cfPWV and AIx.

### First experience in analysing pulsatile retinal capillary flow and arteriolar structural parameters measured noninvasively in hypertensive patients [^9564899c]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Increased pulsatile pressure induces as well as aggravates microvascular damage. Scanning laser Doppler flowmetry allows the noninvasive assessment of both retinal capillary flow (RCF) and arteriolar structural parameters of the retinal circulation. Moreover, pulsatile characteristics of the retinal arterioles can be assessed.

Methods

In study 1, reliability of pulsatile RCF and structural parameters were examined in randomly selected patients. In study 2, pulsatile RCF as well as the structural parameters of retinal arterioles were assessed in hypertension grade 1-2 (HT1-2; n=20) and treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH; n=19).

Results

In study 1, test-retest, interobserver and intraobserver reliability of all parameters showed coefficients of variation of less than 10%. In study 2, it was shown that patients with TRH had higher pulse pressure (P=0.003) and pulsed RCF values (P<0.001) as patients with HT1-2. Patients with HT1-2 had no change in the vessel diameter, but a significant difference in lumen diameter, resulting in an altered wall thickness (P=0.001) between systole and diastole. In contrast, patients with TRH showed differences in vessel diameter (P=0.005) as well as lumen diameter (P=0.001), resulting in an unaltered wall thickness between systole and diastole. Hence, wall thickness change as a result of pulsed flow regulation observed in HT1-2 was missing in TRH.

Conclusion

We suggest a new reliable tool for evaluating the pulsatility in the retinal circulation in humans, and found significant differences in pulsatile RCF and structural parameters between patients with HT1-2 and those with TRH.

### Intravitreal ranibizumab or conbercept for retinal arterial macroaneurysm: a case series [^fc8c28ed]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

RAMs are rare, acquired, localized dilation of retinal arterial branches, possibly resulting in macular edema, serous retinal detachment with subretinal fluid, and intraretinal lipid accumulation. The abrupt rupture of RAMs may cause subretinal, intraretinal, preretinal or vitreous hemorrhage. Since the majority of RAM patients have a benign course, asymptomatic or spontaneous resolution, close follow-up is a reasonable treatment option. However, it is challenging to identify patients who regress spontaneously. In symptomatic RAM cases, if the macular is not involved, observation is still considered to be the preferred treatment. When the vision decreases and the macular is involved in hemorrhage or exudation, patients can still receive close follow-up in the early stage due to the high possibility of spontaneous resolution. Early intervention depends on the individual’s decision and their visual needs. However, chronic and long-lasting hemorrhage or exudation, especially in the subretinal layer, could cause the progressive damage of photoreceptors, leading to permanent visual disorders. Nonresolving cases may be complicated by a rupture of the RAM wall and significant preretinal hemorrhage, which could result in visual deterioration or surgical intervention. Thus, early intervention is recommended, especially in cases with foveal involvement. The most common treatment is direct argon laser photocoagulation at the site of RAM, but with several complications, such as possible retinal traction, an increase in retinal exudation, and enlargement of the laser scar, which limit the use in the clinical practice to some extent. Other therapeutic options include pneumatic displacement of tissue by a plasminogen activator, surgical removal of the associated hemorrhage with vitrectomy, and photodisruption of the internal limiting membrane or the posterior hyaloid to release the hemorrhage. However, there has been no established treatment protocol available.

### ECG-gated retinal vessel calibre as a novel measure of aberrant pulsatile retinal flow in diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study [^ea1c7760]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study proposed an increased ECG-gated mean peak change in retinal vessel calibre from baseline in diabetes mellitus. The main objective was to assess the correlation of diabetes mellitus with systemic measures of arterial stiffness (arterial applanation tonometry) and mean peak changes in retinal vascular response from baseline. Another objective was to determine the precise timing of the cardiac cycle when minimal and maximal retinal vascular dilation occurred in controls and participants with diabetes mellitus. Retinal arteriolar pulsatility (and venular pulsatility) was more highly correlated with diabetes mellitus than cfPWV and AIx, and occurred 300ms after the QRS.

Previously, we demonstrated that in healthy individuals, the trough of the pressure waveform, representing minimum retinal arteriolar pulsatile flow, occurred at the end of diastole, on the QRS. The maximum retinal arteriolar pulsatile flow was observed to occur between 200-350ms after the QRS, corresponding with systole, but the exact timing was yet to be determined. With a larger sample size, and irrespective of diabetes status and vessel type, the present study determined that the maximum pulsatile flow occurred at 300ms after the QRS (late systole) and was in agreement with our previous study that the minimum pulsatile response occurred at approximately the QRS (end diastole).

### Ankle-brachial index and ocular diseases in a Russian population [^96ca5efd]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Arteriosclerosis is a sign of arterial aging and, due to a thickening, hardening and loss of elasticity of the arterial walls, gradually reduces the blood flow. It is a major risk factor for arterial hypertension and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. The hardening of the arterial walls in arteriosclerosis leads to a loss of the buffering effect of the Windkessel function on systolic blood pressure (BP). The resulting premature return of the counter-pulsation to the aorta increases the systolic BP, decreases the diastolic BP, and increases the pulse pressure (PP). It results in damage to low-resistance organs including the heart, brain, kidney, and liver. The risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, cognitive dysfunction, renal dysfunction, fatty liver, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause death increases with arteriosclerosis.

Despite the importance of atherosclerosis for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and although the retinal and choroidal blood perfusion of the eye is part of the cerebrovascular system, only a few studies have addressed the question whether atherosclerosis affects the prevalence of ocular diseases. These studies had limitations such as including a relatively small number of participants, a hospital-based recruitment of the study participants, and in particular, not addressing most of the systemic parameters influencing the measurements of atherosclerosis so that confounding effects might have occurred. We, therefore, conducted this study to investigate the association between arteriosclerosis and ocular parameters in a relatively large study population recruited on a population-basis and examining a relatively large number of systemic factors which may influence atherosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis was estimated by determination of the ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI) defined as the ratio of the ankle to the brachial systolic BP. It is an indicator of atherosclerotic vascular disease in the lower extremities and a simple, non-invasive measure of subclinical atherosclerosis in general.

### Retinal microvasculature in relation to central hemodynamics in a flemish population [^66c2c964]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, our study is the first population survey assessing the association of retinal microvascular traits with central hemodynamic measurements. The key finding of our study was that the CRAE was smaller with higher values of aortic PWV, central pulse pressure, augmentation ratio, and the forward and backward wave amplitudes. There is close anatomic proximity between the central arteries and the retinal arterioles. The ophthalmic artery branches directly from the internal carotid artery. The inverse association of the retinal arteriolar diameter with central hemodynamic indexes reflecting arterial stiffness is, therefore, coherent and physiologically plausible. Indeed, in a stiffer arterial tree, the backward wave returns during systole, thus augmenting central systolic blood pressure and widening central pulse pressure. The pulsatile stress on the wall of the large arteries leads to further degradation of the elastin fibers, so that extremely stiff collagen increasingly bears the pulsatile load.

### Vascular resistance indices are higher in the superior than inferior optic nerve head and retina [^54be381d]. Experimental Eye Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Retinal vascular resistance is of interest in glaucoma research, as a potential link between retinal ganglion cell loss and observed phenomena including disrupted vascular autoregulation, altered biomechanical stiffness, and impaired neurovascular coupling. It can now be assessed in vivo, using laser speckle flowgraphy. However, continued progress in the field requires better understanding of its physiology. In this study, we test the hypothesis of homogeneity of vascular resistance indices between regions of the retina: specifically, between superior and inferior hemifields. The resistivity index (maximum flow minus minimum flow, as a proportion of the maximum) and pulsatility index (maximum minus minimum, as a proportion of the mean) were measured in major vessels within the optic nerve head, in the remaining tissue within the optic nerve head, and in peripapillary branch retinal arteries, separated in each case into superior and inferior quadrants. This was performed in 378 eyes of 189 participants with suspected, early or moderate glaucoma; and in 99 eyes of 50 participants without any ocular pathology. In the glaucoma cohort, the resistivity index was on average 9% higher superiorly than inferiorly in vessels within the optic nerve head; 8% higher superiorly in remaining tissue; and 8% higher superiorly in peripapillary vessels (all p < 0.001). The pulsatility index was on average 11% higher superiorly in all three locations (all p < 0.001). Average flow was slightly higher superiorly in major vessels in the nerve head, but higher inferiorly elsewhere. In the healthy control cohort, resistivity index was higher superiorly by 10% in vessels and 8% in tissue within the optic nerve head; pulsatility index was 12% and 10% higher superiorly respectively (all p < 0.001). The fact that these differences were similar between the two cohorts suggests that they are not caused by the disease process. However, it is notable that glaucomatous loss most frequently occurs first in the superior visual field, corresponding with the inferior retina. The finding that vascular resistance indices are consistently higher in the superior retina warrants further investigation, both for its causes and consequences.

### Effects of dopamine on retinal and choroidal blood flow parameters in humans [^1b196b30]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate the effect of dopamine on retinal and choroidal blood flow in humans.

Methods

We investigated the effect of two doses of intravenous dopamine (5 and 10 microg/kg/min) via a randomised double-masked crossover study in 12 healthy subjects chosen from a total of 16. Blood flow parameters in retina, optic nerve head and choroid were assessed with bi-directional laser Doppler velocimetry, laser Doppler flowmetry and laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude, respectively.

Results

Intravenous dopamine dose-dependently increased retinal blood cell velocity and fundus pulsation amplitude (p<0.001). At the highest administered dose red blood cell velocity in retinal vessels increased by 37% and fundus pulsation amplitude by 24%. By contrast, optic nerve head blood flow did not change with dopamine administration.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that dopamine has a pronounced enhancing effect on the retinal perfusion in humans. Further studies are required to establish the exact role of dopamine in the regulation of choroidal and optic nerve head blood flow.

### Pulse wave velocity in retinal arteries of healthy volunteers [^80cddcba]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV) in large vessels has been used extensively in clinical practice as an indirect measure of arterial stiffness and an indicator of cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial stiffness increases with age and in coronary artery disease. An in vivo clinical method to characterise arterial stiffness of the central microcirculation was developed.

Methods

Time-dependent alterations of retinal vessel diameter were examined by the dynamic vessel analyzer in a randomly chosen eye of 10 young (26.0 (23.5, 27.0) years old (median (1st quartile, 3rd quartile)) and 10 old (67.0 (61.3, 69.5)) years old) healthy volunteers. Two segments of a retinal artery were measured simultaneously. The distance between the segments was measured using retinal photographs. The data were filtered and analysed using signal analysis methods in order to calculate PWV in the assessed retinal artery (rPWV).

Results

rPWV differed significantly between young (21.5 (17.9, 4.6) mm/s) and old (243.8 (186.1, 347.7) mm/s) volunteers: (p=0.0001, Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni correction).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates a higher rPWV in elderly people than in young people. Therefore this new parameter resembles large artery PWV. This suggests that dynamic in vivo imaging of the central microcirculation enables the measurement of local microvascular stiffness with a commercially available medical device.

### Correction-spontaneous central retinal artery occlusion in hemoglobin SC disease (1) [^5dc1dda4]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2000). Low credibility.

PURPOSE: To describe a case of spontaneous central retinal artery occlusion in a young man with hemoglobin sickle cell disease.METHOD: Case report.RESULTS: A 31-year-old African-American man with a history of hemoglobin SC (sickle C) disease developed sudden painless loss of vision in the right eye. Medical history was remarkable for the recent history of a mild sickle crisis, but no other systemic illness or contributing factors. Central retinal artery occlusion was diagnosed with retinal whitening, cherry red spot, and delayed arteriovenous transit on fluorescein angiography. Over the ensuing week, the patient had visual recovery to 20/60 in the absence of therapeutic intervention.CONCLUSION: Central retinal artery occlusion has been reported in sickle cell hemoglobinopathies (ie, SS, S-thal, sickle trait, and SC), but the association with double heterozygous SC disease is rare. Most reports have described additional contributing factors, such as trauma or concomitant systemic illness, to help account for the central retinal artery occlusion. The present case suggests that SC disease alone is sufficient for the development of central retinal artery occlusion.

### Vortex vein imaging: what can It tell Us? [^88f7c2e6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Choroidal Blood Flow Regulation

The choroidal circulation is an important component of the blood supply to the optic nerve head.The blood flow in the ocular tissues is usually non-uniform as it demonstrates a pulsatile nature of flow. Also, factors like intraocular pressure variations and a thick non-compliant scleral coat result in non-uniform blood flow dynamics. Therefore, regulatory mechanisms are needed to maintain a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen in the ocular tissues. Choroidal vessels have a parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation which is thought to be relevant to the regulation of flow in these vessels.The intrascleral portions of the vortex veins, however, are also thought to be an important site of choroidal blood flow regulation.Thus, there may be a hybrid control of choroidal blood flow with local and systemic mechanisms. Understanding mechanisms of choroidal blood flow regulation including the role of vortex vein ampullae and the anatomy of vortex vein exit sites is becoming more relevant in the light of new evidence regarding choroidal influence on various retinal pathologies. These pathways may also be important considerations for the development of suprachoroidal delivery as a route for administration of therapies to the posterior segment of the eye (discussed in later section).

### Pathophysiology of preeclampsia-induced vascular dysfunction and implications for subclinical myocardial damage and heart Failure [^d50ddf1d]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Correlative findings in other vascular beds

In preeclampsia, endothelial dysfunction leads to vasoconstriction, thrombosis, and hyperinflammation.There is a growing understanding that preeclampsia exerts a systemic response with profound vascular effects on the mother leading to diverse pathophysiologic alterations across multiple organs.

Cerebral blood flow

Cerebral and visual symptoms (eg, seizures) are hallmarks of eclampsia, occurring in ∼1% of pregnancies.With eclampsia, cerebral blood flow velocities increasewith reduced cerebral blood flow when compared to normotensive women.In preeclampsia, higher velocities against the thin walls of cerebral vessels increase susceptibility to micro-bleeds and potentially cerebral edema.

Retinal and ophthalmic artery flow

Flow resistance indices are similarly increased with mean arterial pressure in the ophthalmic and central retinal arteries.At the time of delivery, retinal artery diameters are significantly smaller in preeclampsia and may persist for ∼1 year postpartum.

Systemic vascular dysfunction

There are few reports noting that women with preeclampsia have a higher arterial stiffness index, that may remain elevated for up to 3 years postpartum.In a small series, peripheral arterial tonometry measures of vasoreactivity were markedly abnormal in preeclampsia as compared to pregnant controls.Importantly, sufficiently powered samples are not available but represent critical evidence regarding systemic vascular dysfunction in preeclampsia.

Coronary imaging

Beyond acute coronary angiography for spontaneous coronary artery dissection, evidence as to the impact of preeclampsia on coronary vasoreactivitiy is unknown.

Microvascular involvement

The microvasculature has also been implicated in preeclampsia.From 1 study, 93 women with preeclampsia underwent measurement of skin microvascular function responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside at 22 to 34 weeks of gestation.They employed a unique method of transdermal drug delivery—iontophoresis—that does not induce systemic effects. In preeclampsia, an exaggerated increase in endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilatory responses exceeds that of normotensive women.

### Eye emergencies-AAFP (...) [^e864b168]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT Interventions should be initiated to prevent an increase in intraocular pressure if a globe injury is diagnosed or suspected. The patient should be instructed to prevent Valsalva maneuvers, including coughing or straining, and avoid placing external pressure on the eye to prevent extrusion of intraocular contents. Antiemetics should be administered to prevent emesis. A metal shield should be placed over the eye, and the patient should be immediately referred to an ophthalmologist. Retinal Detachment CASE SCENARIO A 60-year-old woman presents with several new floaters and a series of flashing lights in her right eye. She noticed a progressively enlarging black spot in her superior visual field during the past two days. Her visual acuity on presentation is 20/25 with a dense superior scotoma on confrontational visual field testing.

BACKGROUND A retinal detachment occurs when the neurosensory layer of the retina is separated from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. Retinal detachment is commonly preceded by a posterior vitreous detachment, which occurs when the vitreous body separates from the retina. This causes traction on the retina and potentially creates a tear that may allow the liquefied vitreous to seep through the tear and underneath the retina, causing it to detach. DIAGNOSIS Patients with a retinal detachment may notice unilateral flashing lights in their peripheral vision, followed by an increase in floaters. These symptoms may be attributed to a posterior vitreous detachment; however, 14% of patients develop a retinal tear. A dilated funduscopic examination can identify a retinal detachment. A retinal tear may be difficult to detect with direct ophthalmoscopy; however, the surrounding retina will appear elevated.

Ocular ultrasonography has a 94% sensitivity in diagnosing a retinal detachment if the retina cannot be visualized because of cataract or vitreous hemorrhage.
27. TREATMENT Immediate ophthalmology referral is indicated for patients with symptoms such as flashing lights, floaters, or visual field defect, or if a retinal detachment is detected on initial examination. 12 Surgical treatment involves sealing the retinal tear with a laser and reapproximating the retina to the underlying choroid with an intraocular gas bubble or scleral buckle. Surgery is successful for more than 95% of patients. 13, 14.

### Pulsatile ocular blood flow: relationship with flow velocities in vessels supplying the retina and choroid [^3265c582]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although ocular tonography measures a pulsatile component of the ocular perfusion, the retinal and/or choroidal components of this pulsatile flow remain undefined.

Aim

To compare ocular tonography with the assessment of flow velocities in arteries supplying the retina, choroid and entire orbit.

Methods

22 normal eyes from 11 subjects were studied. Pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) was measured using the ocular blood flow tonograph, and flow velocities in the ophthalmic, central retinal (CRA) and temporal short posterior ciliary arteries (TSPCA) using colour Doppler imaging. The correlation between POBF and retrobulbar flow velocities was determined.

Results

POBF correlated significantly with peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the CRA (r = 0.56, p = 0.007) and the TSPCA (r = 0.48, p = 0.02), and with the resistive index of the TSPCA (r = 0.45, p = 0.04). Additionally, pulse amplitude (PSV-end diastolic velocity) in the CRA and the TSPCA correlated significantly with POBF measurements (each p<0.05). However, POBF did not correlate with any flow velocity indices in the ophthalmic artery.

Conclusion

POBF is associated with systolic and pulsatile components of blood flow velocities in both the CRA and the TSPCA. This result suggests that POBF determinations are influenced by the pulsatile components of both choroidal and retinal perfusion.

### Management of acute central retinal artery occlusion [^e3da524e]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is considered to be an acute stroke of the eye that results in profound visual loss. Spontaneous recovery rates are poor. Most CRAOs are caused by thromboembolism in the central retinal artery. Current standard therapies for CRAO that aim to restore perfusion to the retina and optic nerve head have not been shown to alter the natural course of the disease. Thrombolytic therapy for acute management of CRAO has shown promise in nonrandomized studies with regard to improving visual outcomes. A randomized controlled trial will be required to confirm the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy before it can be recommended for use in CRAO in daily clinical practice.

### Ocular blood flow parameters after pars plana vitrectomy in patients with diabetic retinopathy [^438008b1]. Retina (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Whereas the anatomic result of vitrectomy in patients with vitreoretinal complications due to diabetes is usually satisfying, the functional outcome is sometimes poor. The authors investigated whether this may be related in part to effects of vitrectomy on ocular perfusion.

Methods

Ocular hemodynamics were measured before vitrectomy and 1 and 4 weeks postoperatively in 13 consecutive diabetic patients. Pulsatile choroidal blood flow was assessed with laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude. In addition, mean blood flow velocity and resistive index in the ophthalmic artery, the central retinal artery, and the posterior ciliary arteries were measured with color Doppler imaging.

Results

Fundus pulsation amplitude was significantly reduced after surgery as compared to baseline (baseline: 3.7 +/- 1.0 microm; 4 weeks: 3.1 +/- 0.8; P < 0.001). Postoperatively, mean blood flow velocity in the central retinal artery (P = 0.009) and the posterior ciliary arteries (P = 0.0006) was significantly reduced, whereas resistive index was increased in the central retinal artery (P = 0.028) but not in the posterior ciliary arteries.

Conclusions

The current data suggest that vitrectomy induces significant reductions in ocular blood flow in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Whether this may affect the visual outcome after vitrectomy or whether this reflects improved retinal oxygenation after vitrectomy remains to be established.

### The association between the pulsatile choroidal volume change and ocular rigidity [^f13156f5]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Glaucoma is a multifactorial disease characterized by damage to the retinal ganglion cells’ axons and visual field loss. It is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally. Despite investigative efforts to elucidate the relationship between ocular rigidity (OR) and the pathophysiology of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), our understanding of this association remains limited. The biomechanical paradigm of glaucoma postulates that elevated mechanical stress and strain lead to axonal damage and retinal ganglion cell loss.A growing body of evidence indeed suggests that scleral stiffness, the major contributor to the rigidity of the corneoscleral shell, is the most determining factor for stress and strain at the optic nerve head (ONH) (more so than intraocular pressure [IOP]), and that lower OR (or a more compliant sclera) may be associated with glaucoma.,,There is also evidence that ocular blood flow plays an important role in the pathophysiology of glaucoma.However, it has been proposed that the mechanical and vascular mechanisms of glaucoma are intertwined in determining the susceptibility to developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The geometrical and material properties of the sclera and lamina cribrosa, through which blood vessels must pass, could affect the vasculature (and perfusion) of the eye.

The sclera, as a relatively closed shell, could also constrain the expansion of the choroid during systole to a greater or lesser amount depending on its stiffness because it requires more force to expand during systole if the sclera is stiffer. In fact, recent biomechanical modeling has predicted exactly this phenomenon, but it has not been validated clinically.In addition, basic physiology links increased rigidity of blood vessels to reduced pulsatile volume.As the stiffness of an artery wall increases, the pulse volume of blood in the artery decreases, if other factors are constant.

The intimate relationship between biomechanics and ocular blood flow is evidenced by a number of studies. For example, subjects with vasospasticity, a known risk factor in glaucoma, were found to exhibit an abnormal vascular regulatory response to biomechanical stimuli,,,,,in addition to temperature and emotional stress.More recently, low OR was shown to be significantly associated with greater glaucomatous retinal nerve fiber layer damage in patients with vasospasm.

### ECG-gated retinal vessel calibre as a novel measure of aberrant pulsatile retinal flow in diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study [^581f8b6e]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3 
Comparison of median cfPWV and AIx with IQR values in controls and participants with diabetes mellitus. AIx, Augmentation index; cfPWV, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity; IQR, interquartile range. **** p <0.0001

The time delay in retinal image initiation to acquisition between controls and participants with diabetes mellitus was calculated across four points of the cardiac cycle (0ms, 220ms, 300ms and 380ms). From the desired time of 0ms after the QRS, the actual time of photo acquisition was significantly before the QRS in participants with diabetes mellitus than controls (controls: -61.66ms, 95%CI -72.62- -51.04 vs diabetes mellitus: -39.40ms, 95%CI -50.34- -29.22, p =0.006). There was no statistically significant difference between the controls and participants with diabetes mellitus in actual times of photo acquisition compared to the desired times of 220ms (controls: 247.78ms, 95%CI 245.09-250.43 vs diabetes mellitus: 248.85ms, 95%CI 247.57-250.04, p =0.49), 300ms (controls: 305.85ms, 95%CI 304.07-308.11 vs diabetes mellitus: 305.85ms, 95%CI 304.73-307.00, p =1.00) and 380ms (controls: 386.90ms, 95%CI 385.01-389.20 vs diabetes mellitus: 386.90ms, 95%CI 385.67-388.18, p =1.00) after the QRS.

### Ophthalmodynamometric determination of the central retinal vessel collapse pressure correlated with systemic blood pressure [^953397b1]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate whether determination of the central retinal artery and vein collapse pressure correlate with systemic blood pressure measurements, using a new Goldmann contact lens associated ophthalmodynamometric device

Methods

The prospective clinical study included 92 eyes of 92 patients presenting with cataract or refractive problems (n = 40; control study group) or with retinal and orbital pathologies (n = 52). With topical anaesthesia, a Goldmann contact lens fitted with a pressure sensor in its holding ring was placed onto the cornea. Pressure was asserted onto the globe by pressing the contact lens, and the pressure value at the time when the central retinal artery and vein started pulsating were noted as central retinal artery and vein collapse pressure. Additionally, the brachial arterial blood pressure was measured.

Results

In the control study group, central retinal artery collapse pressure was highly significantly correlated with diastolic blood pressure (correlation coefficient r = 0.77; p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.35; p = 0.03). Central retinal vein collapse pressure was statistically independent of diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.11). In eyes with retinal or orbital diseases, the correlation coefficients were lower than in the control study group. In eyes with retinal arterial occlusions, central retinal vessel collapse pressure measurements were not correlated with arterial blood pressure measurements.

Conclusions

Depending on coexisting retinal or orbital diseases, ophthalmodynamometric estimation of the central retinal artery collapse pressure, performed during a routine Goldmann contact lens ophthalmoscopy, correlates with systemic blood pressure measurements.

### Ocular pulse amplitude and retina nerve fiber layer thickness in migraine patients without aura [^50c39c18]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that the choroidal perfusion assessed by OPA, is not significantly different between the migraine patients and the controls. Similarly, PPAA is not significantly different between the groups. However, there is significant sectoral RNFL thinning which correlates with PSD –an indicator of localized visual field defects- but not with OPA in migraine patients without aura.

Recent studies have reported choroidal and retinal involvement in migraine patients. Using colored doppler ultrasonography, reduction of blood flow has been shown in both the central retinal artery and posterior ciliary artery in migraine patients without aura compared to healty subjects. Decrease in choroidal blood flow by stimulation of choroidal sympathetic supply, amaurosis fugax in young migraneurs and pigmentary changes on fundus examination following attacks were suggested as signs of affected choroidal circulation in migraine. OPA reflects pulsatile variations in IOP which corresponds to the blood volume (mostly from the choroidal bed) pumped into the eye during each cardiac cycle. Therefore, OPA was suggested as an indirect indicator of choroidal blood flow and has been investigated in several disorders with vascular origin. Decreased OPA values were reported in patients with carotid artery stenosis, uveitis, normal tension glaucoma and primary open angle glaucoma. We assessed the choroidal blood flow by measuring OPA and could not find a significant difference in OPA between the migraine group and controls. The result of this study shows that there is a possibility that the pulsative choroidal blood flow is not affected in patients without aura. This outcome does not rule out the involvement of choroidal perfusion but rather shows that the pulsative choroidal blood flow is not permanently compromised in this subgroup.

Follow-up evaluation for retinal artery occlusions—The follow-up evaluation includes a history and examination, and a follow-up history should include changes in symptoms (e.g., change in vision, visual field loss, pain, focal neurological symptoms) and systemic condition (e.g., elevated blood pressure, systemic arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia/diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea).

### The interpretation of visible pulsation in the retinal arteries (...) [^dc0f1ee8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Our purpose in this communication is to discuss an error that persists in ophthalmic literature concerning the interpretation of pulsation of the retinal arteries. Two years after Helmholtz1 announced his discovery of the ophthalmoscope in 1851, Van Trigt2 and Coccius3 observed a venous pulsation on the papilla. The following year Jaeger4 described an arterial pulse in the retinal arteries and von Graefe5 noted retinal arterial pulsation in glaucoma. Since then, many observations have been published on pulsation of the retinal blood vessels. The opinion that pulsation of the retinal veins is physiologic, but that pulsation of the retinal arteries is always pathologic, became established in ophthalmic literature and persists to date. When it became possible to observe the fundus of the eye more minutely as the result of improvements in the ophthalmoscope, a few observers expressed doubt that a pulse in the retinal arteries.

### Ocular blood flow in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus [^a4a7e8a0]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Alterations of ocular blood flow may play a role in the pathophysiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related retinal microvasculopathy. In this study ocular blood flow was investigated in patients with HIV infection.

Design

In a prospective, cross-sectional study ocular blood flow was measured in 37 eyes of consecutive HIV- infected persons and compared with the data of age-matched healthy controls. This sample size was calculated based on an alpha-error of 0.5 and a beta-error of 0.8.

Methods

Macular white blood cell flow, fundus pulsation amplitude, and blood flow velocities in the retrobulbar vessels were measured with blue field entoptic technique, laser interferometry, and Doppler sonography, respectively. Immunologic and ophthalmologic status was evaluated from each patient.

Results

Mean CD4+ cell count of the HIV-infected persons was 206.8 +/- 145.6 cells/mm(3). In five patients HIV-related retinopathy was observed. A significant reduction in leukocyte density was seen in HIV infected persons (82.2 +/- 23.4) as compared with the control group (102.0 +/- 28.4; P =.019). The resistive index in the central retinal artery was higher in HIV infected patients (0.77 +/- 0.05) as compared with the controls (0.74 +/- 0.04; P =.04). The other hemodynamic parameters were not different between groups. No correlation of flow parameters and CD4+ cell count or HIV-related retinopathy was observed.

Conclusions

Decreased macular leukocyte density was detected in HIV infected persons. Our study suggests that abnormal retinal hemodynamics in individuals infected with HIV may be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-related microvasculopathy.

### Retinal vascular caliber as a biomarker for diabetes microvascular complications [^bc99d5e1]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

NEWER METHODS FOR DYNAMIC STUDIES OF RETINAL VESSELS

Further, the development of retinal vascular caliber changes as a robust biomarker of risk for retinopathy and other microvascular complications of diabetes depends, in part, on the capability to detect in vivo subclinical changes caused by diabetes. Instruments and strategies that can probe the vessels with enhanced resolution and functional yield will be able to reconstruct mechanisms and consequences of the early widening of retinal vascular caliber and to identify additional early abnormalities with biomarker potential. The newer approaches briefly described below are poised to widen the accessibility of hemodynamic measurements, permit observations of discrete vascular structures at very high resolution, and test molecular events occurring on the vascular endothelium.

Doppler Fourier domain optical coherence tomography to measure retinal blood flow

Doppler Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging is now widely used for clinical purposes, and the continuous enhancement of the speed of image acquisition and resolution are making OCT an important tool for dynamic measurements. As a coherent detection technique, OCT can detect the Doppler frequency shift of backscattered light and thus measure the speed of moving objects such as erythrocytes that scatter light and thereby provide information on blood flow velocity. The high-speed and ultrahigh-speed Fourier domain OCT enables acquisition of blood velocity and vessel volumes that permit measurements of pulsatile blood flow. Comparisons in normal and diseased human retinas have been performed. The Doppler OCT, which is still in development at this time, may eventually offer significant advantages over the methods used to date to measure retinal blood flow. By measuring flow over the central retinal artery or at vessels at the optic nerve head, Doppler OCT can provide total retinal blood flow as opposed to flow in individual vessels. The measurements are depth-resolved, increasing the accuracy of the data. The blood flow measuring capability is compatible with existing standard OCT patient interfaces, and new strategies and software will likely render the blood flow calculations completely automatic and facilitate the testing of its use as a risk biomarker for diabetes complications. This will make it possible to test and compare retinal autoregulatory responses and their longitudinal changes in larger cohorts of patients using standardized instruments and methods as opposed to instruments with different characteristics developed in different research laboratories.

### Variation associated with measurement of retinal vessel diameters at different points in the pulse cycle [^5b3dc89e]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To assess the variability in retinal vessel measurements at different points in the pulse cycle.

Methods

A healthy white male aged 19 years had 30 digitised images taken at three distinct points in the pulse cycle over a one hour period. A pulse synchronised ear clip trigger device was used to capture images at the desired point in the pulse cycle. Two trained graders measured the retinal vessel diameter of one large arteriole, one large venule, one small arteriole, and one small venule 10 times in each of these 30 images.

Results

Within an image, variability was similar between graders, pulse point, and vessel type. Across images taken at the same point in the pulse period, the change from the minimum to maximum measurement was between 6% and 17% for arterioles and between 2% and 11% for venules. In addition, measurements of small vessels had greater changes than large vessels and no point in the pulse period was more variable than another. Ignoring pulse cycle increased variability across images in the large venule, but not in the other vessel types. Mixed effect models were fit for each of the vessel types to determine the greatest source of variability. Controlling for pulse point and grader, the largest source of variability for all four vessels measured was across images, accounting for more than 50% of the total variability.

Conclusion

Measurements of large retinal venules is generally less variable than measurements of other retinal vessels. After controlling for pulse point and grader, the largest source of variation is across images. Understanding the components of variability in measuring retinal vessels is important as these techniques are applied in epidemiological studies.

### Paediatric vitreous haemorrhage secondary to clinically occult, anomalous hyaloid and peripapillary arteries demonstrated by OCT-A [^7a365178]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Spontaneous and traumatic paediatric vitreous haemorrhage secondary to persistent hyaloid artery remnants have been well described. Here we demonstrate the presence of clinically occult, anomalous retinal arteries in two children presenting with vitreous or pre-retinal haemorrhages, with flow signals demonstrated using OCT-A.

A non-systematic review identified that approximately 1.7–6.5% of cases of spontaneous, unilateral paediatric vitreous haemorrhage are idiopathic. It is possible that clinically occult, persistent anomalous artery remnants may explain some of these cases. Whilst OCT-A may demonstrate flow in clinically obvious hyaloid arteries, we recommend OCT-A of the optic disc for paediatric patients presenting with unexplained vitreous haemorrhage where media clarity permits. This may prevent the need for extensive investigations, for example, to exclude underlying vasculitic, septic or haematological disorders.

Further studies are required to determine the prevalence of persistent hyaloid remnants with proven flow signals using OCT-A in paediatric populations, and to further validate the possible association with vitreous haemorrhage.

### The significance of retinal arterial anastomosis in the new classification system of prepapillary vascular loops [^8591b18a]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze the ophthalmic characteristics of congenital prepapillary vascular loops (PVL), propose the significance of retinal arterial anastomosis and propose a new classification of PVL.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Subjects

31 patients (35 eyes) with PVLs.

Methods

This study evaluated the color fundus photography and fluorescein angiography of 31 patients (35 eyes) with PVLs in the department of ophthalmology of three hospitals between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2023.

Results

There were 27 unilateral (87.1%) and 4 bilateral (12.9%) PVLs, 23 arterial loops (65.7%), 11 venous loops (31.4%) and 1 combined arteriovenous loop (2.9%). The mean filling time of the arterial loops was 13.76 seconds, while the mean filling time of the venous loops was 20.71 seconds. Retinal vascular anastomoses were found in 10 eyes with arterial PVLs (43.5%), and all the anastomoses were arterioarterial communications. Four types could be classified based on these clinical observations: Type 1: arterial type: 1a, with anastomosis; 1b, without anastomosis; Type 2: venous type; Type 3: combined arteriovenous loop. Twenty (64.5%) patients having clinical symptoms. In the 9 patients with vitreous hemorrhage, 6 cases were arterial loops (66.7%), while 3 cases were venous loops (33.3%). The vascular malformation was present in 6 eyes, including tortuous retinal arteries, multiple branching vessels, trifurcation of superior retinal vein, smaller angle of vascular arcade, and cilioretinal artery.

Conclusions

PVLs are usually arterial loops, however, venous loops may not be as rare as previously thought. Both arterial and venous loops can cause vitreous hemorrhage, and venous loops can cause retinal vein occlusion. PVL could be divided into four types based on different vascular sources and the presence or absence of anastomotic branches.

### Intravenous administration of L-arginine increases retinal and choroidal blood flow [^6bd30d6d]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Nitric oxide (NO) is among the most important regulators of ocular perfusion. L-arginine, an amino acid, is the precursor of NO synthesis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether administration of L-arginine affects ocular blood flow.

Design

L-arginine (1 g/min) or placebo was administered intravenously for 30 minutes in 12 healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-masked, two-way cross-over design.

Methods

Ocular hemodynamics were measured before, in the last 10 minutes of the infusion period, as well as 30 minutes after cessation of the administration. Retinal vessel diameters were measured with a retinal vessel analyzer, red blood cell velocities with bidirectional laser Doppler velocimetry, and pulsatile choroidal blood flow was measured using laser interferometry.

Results

L-arginine significantly decreased mean arterial pressure by -8 +/- 5% and -6 +/- 7% at the two time points (P < .01), respectively. Intravenous administration of L-arginine increased choroidal blood flow by +10 +/- 6% and +12 +/- 7%, respectively. Retinal venous diameters decreased by -2.5 +/- 2.1% and -1.4 +/- 2.7%, respectively, whereas red blood cell velocity significantly increased after administration of L-arginine by +22 +/- 23% and +20 +/- 19% at the two time points. Thus, calculated blood flow in retinal veins, increased by +21 +/- 18% and +21 +/- 19% before and after the end of L-arginine infusion.

Conclusions

Intravenous administration of L-arginine increases retinal and choroidal blood flow in healthy volunteers. Whether this effect is related to an increased NO-production or an unidentified mechanism remains to be clarified. However, administration of L-arginine might be an interesting new approach to therapeutically increase ocular blood flow in ocular vascular disease.

### Pulsatile flow into the aqueous veins: manifestations in normal and glaucomatous eyes [^4115613c]. Experimental Eye Research (2011). Low credibility.

3.2. Causes of pulsatile aqueous outflow transients

Pulsatile flow transients are a salient feature of aqueous movement through the aqueous veins; such descriptions of pulsatile flow were strongly emphasized in the original independent aqueous vein descriptions ofand,as well as many later investigators (;;). Pulsatile flow in the aqueous veins occurs in synchrony with small IOP transients such as those induced by the ocular pulse, blinking and eye movements (;) (Fig. 1).

The choroidal vasculature contributes 85–95% of the intraocular blood volume. The systolic cardiac pulse wave induces a rapid expansion of choroidal volume (Fig. 2, Panel A) thus causing choroidal pulsations. The increase in choroidal blood volume “acts like the piston of a fluid displacement pump in relation to the outflow of aqueous humor”. The expanding choroidal volume in the closed space of the eye causes transient oscillatory changes in IOP of about 3 mm Hg that are synchronous with the cardiac pulse (Fig. 1). Similarly blinking and eye movements cause transient IOP elevations by inducing pressure on the surface of the eye.

### Carotid-cavernous fistulas: the utility of ocular echography in their differentiation [ letter ] [^35bd55ce]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

In case of direct CCFs, ultrasound detects dilation of the superior ophthalmic vein with pulsation of the walls, vertical veins, and sometimes the inferior ophthalmic vein due to arterialization and increased flow within these vessels. A low and regular reflectivity, weak sound attenuation with an angle k lower than 30°, and the presence of rapid spontaneous movements in the lumen of these vessels indicating flow arterialization.

In cases of dural CCFs, A-scan ultrasound shows thickening of all orbital structures, particularly the extraocular muscles and optic nerve sheaths due to venous congestion in the orbit. The extraocular muscles will appear thickened only on the affected side, with normal reflectivity in the initial phase and subsequently high and irregular reflectivity.

Therefore, we recommend using standardized echography for a rapid and accurate differentiation between dural and direct CCFs after the clinical exam.

### C-peptide does not affect ocular blood flow in patients with type 1 diabetes [^104d1e5c]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of intravenous C-peptide infusion on ocular blood flow in patients with type 1 diabetes under euglycemic conditions.

Research Design and Methods

The study was performed in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked, two-way, crossover design in 10 type 1 diabetic patients. C-peptide was intravenously administered at two different dosages (dosage 1: 25 pmol . kg(-1) . min(-1) bolus followed by 5 pmol . kg(-1) . min(-1) continuous infusion; dosage 2: six times higher than dosage 1), each for 60 min. Physiologic saline solution was used as a control for C-peptide on a different study day. On both study days, euglycemic clamps were performed. To assess retinal blood flow, laser Doppler velocimetry (blood flow velocities) and retinal vessel analyzer (vessels diameters) measurements were performed. Laser interferometric measurements of fundus pulsation were used to assess pulsatile choroidal blood flow. Blood velocities in the ophthalmic artery were measured using color Doppler imaging.

Results

Eight patients (two female and six male) completed the study according to the protocol and without adverse events. One patient developed an anaphylactic reaction to C-peptide, which resolved without sequelae. The following results originate from the remaining eight subjects. Systemic hemodynamic parameters remained stable during both study days. Infusion of C-peptide did not affect any ocular hemodynamic parameter.

Conclusions

The data of the present study indicate that exogenous C-peptide exerts no effect on ocular hemodynamic parameters in type 1 diabetic patients under euglycemic conditions. The maximum detectable change in these parameters was <25%.

### Retinal microvasculature in relation to central hemodynamics in a flemish population [^be46fa0b]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Arterial stiffness and wave reflection predict cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and are associated with renal microvascular disease. We hypothesized that the retinal microvascular traits might be associated with central hemodynamic properties. In 735 randomly recruited Flemish (mean age, 50.3 years; 47.1% women), we derived central pulse pressure and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity by applanation tonometry and calculated forward (Pf) and backward (Pb) pulse waves, using an automated pressure-based wave separation algorithm. We measured central retinal arteriolar (CRAE) and venular equivalent and their ratio, using IVAN software (Vasculomatic ala Nicola, version 1.1). Mean values for pulse wave velocity (n=554), Pf and Pb were 7.50 m/s, 32.0 mmHg, and 21.5 mmHg, respectively. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, CRAE was 4.62 µm and 1.26 µm smaller (P≤0.034) for a 1-SD increment in central mean arterial pressure (+11.3 mmHg) and central pulse pressure (+15.2 mmHg); a 1-SD increment in the augmentation ratio (+7.0%), aortic pulse wave velocity (+1.66 m/s), Pf (+10.0 mmHg), and Pb (+8.5 mmHg), was associated with smaller CRAE; the association sizes were -1.91 µm, -1.59 µm, -1.45 µm, and -2.38 µm (P≤0.014), respectively. Associations of arteriole-to-venule diameter ratio with the central hemodynamic traits mirrored those of CRAE. None of the multivariable-adjusted associations of central retinal venular diameter with the central hemodynamic traits reached significance with the exception of central diastolic blood pressure (-1.62 µm; P=0.030). In conclusion, in the general population, higher central pulse pressure, pulse wave velocity, Pf, and Pb were associated with smaller CRAE.

### Retinal arterial tortuosity in Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^eb063499]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of EDS differs according to the subtypes. This includes defects in fibrillar pro-collagen types I, III and V; defects in collagen cross-linking and folding; defects in glycosaminoglycans biosynthesis; defects in extracellular matrix (ECM) bridging molecules; and other rare defects involving intracellular molecules and complementary pathways.

Abnormal blood vessels are a key feature of some EDS subtypes, especially vEDS. Spontaneous arterial rupture, including the aorta, is a potential cause of morbidity and mortality. Aneurysmal formation and arterial dissection can occur. Early onset varicose veins are also associated with vEDS. Systemic arterial tortuosity has been reported in association with vEDS. Vertebral arterial tortuosity has been suggested as a biomarker for vascular events in the young population with vEDS.

Ocular manifestations in EDS are variable and include blue sclera, pathologic myopia, steep and thin corneas, keratoconus, keratoglobus, retinal detachment and dry eye syndrome. We noted that our index patient diagnosed with EDS had retinal vascular tortuosity affecting the arteries. This study aims to describe our findings.

### Pulsatile flow into the aqueous veins: manifestations in normal and glaucomatous eyes [^500fa7bc]. Experimental Eye Research (2011). Low credibility.

1.2. Aqueous and cardiovascular pulsatile flow correlates

Many decades have passed since the initial documentation that aqueous outflow is pulsatile. Flow through the outflow system is generally discussed as a passive phenomenon without reference to transient ocular pressure changes as a driving force. One might question whether simple observations of a dynamic process made so long ago have any current relevance.

However, studies leading to recognition of pulsatile aqueous flow and its manifestations involved careful observation as well as measurements. The studies demonstrated that aqueous flow was pulsatile, unidirectional, and could account for all of normal aqueous flow. Numerous studies support the observations, which have neither been refuted nor even challenged. Such observations and measurements are remarkably similar to those of Harvey whose demonstration that blood circulates through a pulsatile flow mechanism was initially not well accepted. Harvey’s observations and measurements ultimately established a set of principles that have persisted not for decades but rather for centuries.

Harvey’s work is now widely recognized as the classic early study using the principles of biomechanics (,;). The principles of physiology revealed through his observations continue to become more relevant with time as implications of his principles are studied in ever greater depth (;;;). Similar pulsatile flow evidence in the aqueous outflow system may reasonably be expected to have physiologic importance that is not diminished but rather enhanced by time, as mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of pulsatile aqueous outflow also become more clearly understood.

### Ocular ischaemia due to a spontaneous carotid artery dissection [^61791c50]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD) is caused by the disruption of the tunica intima, with the formation of an intramural haematoma that can cause stenosis or occlusion of the artery's lumen, leading to reduced blood flow and secondary thrombus formation. Up to two-thirds of patients with ICAD show ophthalmological symptoms or signs, which are, frequently, the first manifestations of this clinical condition, often preceding for weeks the neurological signs of cerebral infarction. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a rare complication of ICAD, secondary either to haemodynamic compromise, with ocular hypoperfusion and reverse flow within the ophthalmic artery, or to thromboembolic events, in rarer cases. We report a case of CRAO secondary to a spontaneous ICAD, in an otherwise healthy middle-aged patient.

### MEK / ERK / 1 / 2 sensitive vascular changes coincide with retinal functional deficit, following transient ophthalmic artery occlusion [^06af9830]. Experimental Eye Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Retinal ischemia remains a major cause of blindness in the world with few acute treatments available. Recent emphasis on retinal vasculature and the ophthalmic artery's vascular properties after ischemia has shown an increase in vasoconstrictive functionality, as previously observed in cerebral arteries following stroke. Specifically, endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor-mediated vasoconstriction regulated by the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway. In this study, the ophthalmic artery of rats was occluded for 2 h with the middle cerebral artery occlusion model. MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was administered at 0, 6, and 24 h following reperfusion and the functional properties of the ophthalmic artery were evaluated at 48 h post reperfusion. Additionally, retinal function was evaluated at day 1, 4, and 7 after reperfusion. Occlusion of the ophthalmic artery led to a significant increase of endothelin-1 mediated vasoconstriction which can be attenuated by U0126 treatment, most evident at higher ET-1 concentrations of 10 -7  M (E max 151.0 ± 22.0% of 60 mM K + ), vs non-treated ischemic arteries E max 212.1 ± 14.7% of 60 mM K + ). Retinal function also deteriorated following ischemia and was improved with treatment with a-wave amplitudes of 725 ± 36 μV in control, 560 ± 21 μV in non-treated, and 668 ± 73 μV in U0126 treated at 2 log cd*s/m 2 luminance in the acute stages (1 days post-ischemia). Full spontaneous retinal recovery was observed at day 7 regardless of treatment. In conclusion, this is the first study to show a beneficial in vivo effect of U0126 on vascular contractility following ischemia in the ophthalmic artery. Coupled with the knowledge obtained from cerebral vasculature, these results point towards a novel therapeutic approach following ischemia-related injuries to the eye.

### Response of choroidal blood flow to carbogen breathing in smokers and non-smokers [^2f4c162b]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate a potential difference in ocular vascular reactivity during carbogen breathing in optic nerve head, choroid, and retina between healthy smokers and non-smokers.

Methods

25 (13 smokers and 12 non-smokers) healthy male volunteers participated in this observer masked, two cohort study. During inhalation of carbogen (5% CO(2) and 95% O(2)) over 10 minutes measurements were taken using laser Doppler flowmetry to assess submacular choroidal and optic nerve head blood flow, laser interferometry to assess fundus pulsation amplitudes, and retinal vessel analyser (RVA) to assess retinal vessel diameters.

Results

At baseline choroidal blood flow was higher (p = 0.018, ANOVA) in smokers than in non-smokers. During administration of carbogen the response in choroidal blood flow was significantly different between the two groups: there was an increase in non-smokers after carbogen breathing (p = 0.048) compared with relatively stable blood flow in smokers (p = 0.049 between groups, ANOVA). A similar response pattern was seen for fundus pulsation amplitude, which increased notably after carbogen breathing in non-smokers but not in smokers (p<0.001 between groups, ANOVA). Optic nerve head blood flow and retinal vessel diameters were reduced in both groups to a comparable degree during carbogen breathing.

Conclusion

The study indicated abnormal choroidal vascular reactivity in chronic smokers. These early haemodynamic changes may be related to the increased risk to smokers of developing ocular vascular diseases. The specific mechanisms underlying abnormal choroidal vascular reactivity in chronic smokers remain to be characterised.

### Retinal arterial occlusion with multiple retinal emboli and carotid artery occlusion disease. haemodynamic changes and pathways of embolism [^c35ce69f]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is an emergent ocular disorder that frequently results in profound and permanent loss of vision. Embolism originating from carotid or cardiac lesion is the most common cause. In the literature, RAO served as a significant marker for carotid artery occlusion disease (CAOD) and a predisposing factor of cerebrovascular accident (CVA).Most patients with RAO had ipsilateral carotid lesions, atherosclerotic plaque or stenosis; and in a few cases (16%~35%), the carotid stenosis was flow-limiting or even totally occluded with haemodynamically significant intracranial flow changes.In the literature, investigators had attempted to find out what clinical features of RAO were related to haemodynamically significant CAOD. However, they concluded that ocular symptoms and findings including retinal embolus and type of RAO are poor predictors of haemodynamically significant CAOD.

In recent years, great advances in the development of carotid/cerebral imaging and flow studies, more timely clinical information and evidence can be collected and surveyed to facilitate the understanding of relationships between RAO and CAOD. During review of our cases at a single medical centre (Changhua Christian Hospital), we found a special subgroup, RAO with multiple retinal emboli, was highly associated with ipsilateral haemodynamically significant CAOD. Herein, we introduce these cases with findings of carotid/cerebral evaluations to discuss the association and the possible mechanisms and pathways of retinal emboli as a preliminary report. Issues about the retinal manifestations of this special subgroup will be discussed in the subsequent report.

### Glaucoma surgery and ocular blood flow in colour Doppler imaging: is there a link? [^2d4ffc4e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glaucoma comprises a group of ocular diseases with a multifaceted aetiology; however, the common feature is progressive, irreversible optic nerve injury that eventually leads to vision loss.According to the World Health Organisation, glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide.It is estimated that glaucoma affects 80 million individuals worldwide and approximately 11 million patients experience complete blindness. Owing to the aging population, the number of patients with glaucoma has been increasing steadily and is projected to reach 112 million by 2040.The pathogenesis of this disease involves the loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, leading to optic disc alterations and visual field loss. The major quantifiable risk factor for glaucoma is an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), resulting from an imbalance between the production of aqueous humour and its drainage from the anterior chamber of the eye. Reducing IOP is the only established treatment option that may inhibit or slow the progression of vision loss.The progression of glaucoma is associated with the gradual development of structural and functional anomalies within the optic nerve, resulting in peripheral visual field loss, which significantly deteriorates quality of life during advanced stages of the disease.The pathogenesis of glaucoma is complex, multifactorial and poorly understood. Although increased IOP is believed to directly contribute to mechanical damage to the optic nerve head, only one-third of patients with glaucoma present with increased IOP during the early stages of the disease.Furthermore, visual field loss progresses in some patients despite achieving IOP control. According to the “vascular theory” of glaucoma, the loss of retinal ganglion cells results from an inadequate blood supply. Reduced ocular blood flow may be associated with vascular constriction and autoregulatory disorders. This hypothesis is supported by the co-occurrence of glaucoma with vascular diseases such as arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Potential contributing factors include mechanical stress, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neurotrophin deficiency.An increase in IOP causes compression of blood vessels, which may impair blood flow in the retina. If the IOP is normal, retinal ischaemia may result from systemic vascular deregulation observed in many diseases, including arterial hypertension or hypotension, nocturnal hypotonia, heart rate disorders, Raynaud syndrome, and migraine. Reduced ocular blood flow has been identified as an IOP-independent risk factor for glaucoma progression because it leads to oxygen and nutrient deficiencies, resulting in disorders of cellular energy metabolism and accumulation of ROS.In the normal retina, ROS are generated during metabolic processes and are scavenged by antioxidant enzymes and chemical antioxidants. However, in glaucomatous eyes, ROS is generated in excess of the neutralising potential of the antioxidant system. This leads to oxidative stress in retinal ganglion cells, resulting in structural damage to proteins and nucleic acids, oxidation of lipids, hyaluronic acid depolymerisation, and eventually, cell apoptosis.Although blood flow anomalies associated with glaucoma have been examined using various techniques, it is still unclear whether they are the cause or a consequence of the disease.

### Retinal arterial macroaneurysm rupture by valsalva maneuver: a case report and literature review [^9ce867f2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Retinal arterial macroaneurysms (RAMs) are acquired focal dilatations of the large retinal arteries, usually occurring within the first three bifurcations of the central retinal artery. Typically, RAMs are seen in elderly women and are usually closely related to long-standing hypertension and arteriosclerosis. Most RAMs are located in the temporal retina, and many may regress spontaneously with a favorable prognosis. However, a marked decrease in visual acuity may result when the macula is involved by hemorrhages and exudates. The Valsalva maneuver is a forced expiration against a closed glottis causing transient systemic changes such as increased blood pressure and intraabdominal pressure. It is quite common in daily life and typical activities such as coughing hard, vomiting, straining, constipation, and weightlifting can all lead to it. The Valsalva maneuver can affect retinal arteries due to the sudden and violent fluctuation of blood pressure that occurs.

To the best of our knowledge, there have yet to be any reports of RAM rupture by a Valsalva maneuver-related mechanism. Here, we reported a rare case of the rupture of a retinal arterial macroaneurysm by the Valsalva maneuver in an elderly female with hypertension and constipation and provided a review of the relevant literature.

### Flickering light increases retinal blood flow [^d205c577]. Retina (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the retinal blood flow in normal eyes before and during retinal stimulation by flickering light.

Design

A prospective cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS AND TESTING: Twenty-seven eyes of 27 normal subjects with a mean age +/- SD of 38 +/- 15 years (study I) and 21 eyes of 21 normal subjects with a mean age +/- SD of 46 +/- 17 years (study II) were examined with respect to capillary retinal blood flow and central retinal artery and central retinal vein blood flow velocities during flickering light stimulation. A luminance flicker light with a frequency of 8 Hz increased the neuronal activity of retinal ganglion cells. In study I, the retinal capillary blood flow was measured before and during flickering by scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (670 nm, Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter). In study II, the blood flow velocities in the central retinal artery and central retinal vein were examined by pulsed Doppler sonography.

Main Outcome Measures

Change in blood flow velocities in the central retinal artery and vein and in retinal capillary blood flow after full-field flicker stimulation.

Results

In study I, measurements of blood flow during retinal flicker stimulation showed a significant increase in the mean value of blood flow +/- SD from 317 +/- 72 arbitrary units to 416 +/- 103 arbitrary units. The change was on average 46 +/- 19%. In study II, the systolic and end-diastolic blood flow velocities in the central retinal artery increased significantly (P < 0.0001): systolic, 9 cm/s to 15 cm/s (+62%); end-diastolic, 2.7 cm/s to 5.3 cm/s (+96%). In the central retinal vein, the systolic and end-diastolic blood flow velocities increased significantly (P < 0.0001): systolic, 4.3 cm/s to 6.7 cm/s (+56%); end-diastolic, 1.8 cm/s to 3.6 cm/s (+100%). The authors found no significant change in blood pressure and heartbeat frequency.

Conclusions

Visual stimulation of the retina by flickering light strongly increased the juxtapapillary retinal capillary blood flow and central retinal artery blood flow velocity in normal eyes.

### Serial bevacizumab injections and laser photocoagulation for macular edema associated with a retinal artery macroaneurysm [^4932d799]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Retinal artery macroaneurysms (RAMs) are rare, acquired dilatations of the retinal arterial vasculature, usually within the first three branches of the arteriolar tree.The incidence is estimated to be approximately 1 in 4,500 people over the age of 40.Hypertension and older age lead to hyaline degeneration of the vascular walls, loss of autoregulatory tone and elastic recoil, and arterial dilatation.

Approximately 8%–25% of RAMs will undergo spontaneous involution. Even with submacular hemorrhage, up to 37% of patients will have better than 20/40 visual acuity without treatment.However one third of patients will develop vascular leakage and retinal edema and may need treatment.

### Interpretation of peripheral arterial and venous Doppler waveforms: a consensus statement from the Society for Vascular Medicine and society for vascular ultrasound [^38f7d60e]. Vascular Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Interpretation of peripheral venous Doppler waveforms—venous descriptors and spontaneity states are defined as follows: continuous flow is characterized by the lack of respiratory or cardiac influence on velocity with a steady, consistent Doppler signal and minimal to no variation in flow; regurgitant flow shows cyclical variation with the cardiac cycle but similar amplitude in forward and reverse directions, typically seen with severe tricuspid regurgitation; spontaneity includes spontaneous flow when blood is observed actively moving in a vein without external maneuvers such as Valsalva, muscle contraction, or distal compression, and nonspontaneous flow when it is not actively observed and only noted with such maneuvers.

### The effect of flammer-syndrome on retinal venous pressure [^8c1c780b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Disturbances of ocular blood flow are involved in many ophthalmic diseases and are therefore of utmost clinical relevance. There are various causes for blood flow disturbances, such as diseased blood vessels or mechanical compression of the vessel wall. However, some organs are not well perfused, despite anatomically healthy blood vessels, when the regulation of blood flow is not adapted to the needs of the tissue. Such a vascular dysregulation implies either inappropriate vasoconstrictions (vasospasms) or an insufficient vasodilation (more or less than is required). Dysregulation can be secondary in nature, as in multiple sclerosis, wherein the high level of Endothelin-1 reduces ocular blood flow OBF. Dysregulation can also be primary in nature (primary vascular dysregulation or PVD), meaning that it can occur without any underlying disease and caused by an inborn tendency to respond differently to various stimuli, such as cold temperatures or mechanical or emotional stress. The combination of PVD with a cluster of additional vascular and non-vascular signs and symptoms is what is known today as the Flammer-Syndrome.

The eye is one of the best-perfused organs in the body. One factor influencing this process is the ocular perfusion pressure (OPP). OPP is the difference between systemic blood pressure and the RVP. In the eye, arterial pressure is assumed to be 2/3 of the brachial arterial pressure. The RVP is assumed equal to the IOP. The latter assumption is not always true in glaucoma patients.

As summarized in the literature reviews, glaucoma patients often concomitantly suffer from a FS. One of the clinical observations that we made in patients with a FS was that they often had dilated retinal veins, which is why we hypothesized that RVP may be higher in FS than in non-FS subjects. We therefore set out to measure RVP in glaucoma patients and healthy subjects with and without a FS.

### Reversibility of retinal ischemia due to central retinal artery occlusion by hyperbaric oxygen [^6a8fcd54]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the optimism generated by anecdotal reports and uncontrolled studies, none of the treatments aiming to target CRAO have been proven to be safe and effective.Conventional treatment regimens aimed at promoting downstream movement of the embolus by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) and producing vasodilatation have been largely unsuccessful.–The use of local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) has been evaluated in a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial (the European Assessment Group for Lysis in the Eye, or EAGLE, study) in 82 patients with non-arteritic CRAO within 20 hours of symptom onset.Unfortunately, LIF had similar efficacy as conservative standard treatment (CST) with significantly higher rate of adverse reactions (37%).

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) includes the inhalation of 100% oxygen at pressures exceeding 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA) used to enhance the amount of oxygen dissolved in the body tissues. During HBOT treatment, the arterial O 2 tension typically exceeds 2,000 mmHg.The proposed role for hyperbaric oxygen in CRAO is to increase the oxygen delivery to the ischemic tissue until spontaneous or assisted reperfusion occurs. CRAO is a US Food and Drug Administration approved indication for HBOT, with the highest level of evidence when administrated within the first 8–12 hours from the onset of the visual loss.–It should be noted that most studies were based on a relatively small sample size without proper exclusion criteria, such as arteritic CRAO or cilioretinal artery sparing. There is a significant difference between patients in relation to residual retinal blood flow and that may be the reason for the large variability in visual outcomes, irrespective of the time delays until treatment.Based on the current available data, it is difficult to predict which patients will respond to HBOT beyond the recognition that the earlier the better (minimizing the retinal ischemic time, maximizing the potential for visual recovery).

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of HBOT and determine possible markers for irreversible retinal damage. The study includes the largest cohort published to date, of non-arteritic CRAO patients with no cilioretinal artery sparing.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^14273975]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) management—multiple treatments have been proposed; however, there are currently insufficient data to demonstrate any conclusive benefits from intervention beyond the natural history of the disease, and when presented with an asymptomatic BRAO, the most important approach is a systemic evaluation including a careful medical history and an assessment for systemic disease, preferably in conjunction with the patient’s internist.

### The effect of flammer-syndrome on retinal venous pressure [^d2f67b16]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The term vascular dysregulation in the context of glaucoma was first introduced by Flammer. Later, a distinction was made between primary and secondary vascular dysregulation. A secondary vascular dysregulation occurs in the context of another disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis whereas a primary vascular dysregulation, described an inborn disposition to respond differently to stimuli. Today, the combination of PVD with a cluster of additional vascular and non-vascular signs and symptoms is called the Flammer-Syndrome (FS). The FS can occur in otherwise healthy subjects. Since we made the clinical observation that glaucoma patients with a FS often had dilated retinal veins, we hypothesized that the RVP in the subset of glaucoma patients with a FS may be higher than in those glaucoma patients without a FS.

Glaucoma patients have a higher RVP than controls [–,]. Our values of RVP in the glaucoma group without FS (POAG/FS-) were in line with those of Jonas et al. who measured the diastolic collapse pressure of the central retinal vein in their glaucoma group to be 26.1 (SD 26.4) relative units. Our results suggest that glaucoma patients who suffer from a FS have a significantly higher RVP than non-FS glaucoma patients. The vascular systems of people with a FS respond differently (e.g. reacting with vasoconstrictions to various stimuli such as cold or stress). Despite the anatomically normal appearance of their vessels, those people with a FS have stiffer retinal vessels, as pulse waves in their retinal vessels propagate faster compared to those of subjects without a FS. The spatial irregularity of the vessels of people with a FS is increased, whereas neurovascular coupling is decreased, and autoregulation of ocular blood flow is disturbed.

### Retrobulbar blood flow changes in eyes with diabetic retinopathy: a 10-year follow-up study [^daba2ee3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The pathophysiological mechanism of DR remains a challenge for medical research. Although the exact pathogenesis of the disease is yet unknown, there are several theories about the processes that affect the ocular blood flow in DR. Most of the studies claim that the central abnormality in DR is microangiopathy, which causes macular edema and retinal ischemia. The microangiopathy is multifactorial and appears to be a consequence of hyperglycemic and hypoxic damages.–

Hemodynamic changes in the diabetic retina and choroid have been the focus of considerable research. As in other vascular beds, ocular blood flow is measured as blood flow velocity multiplied by cross-sectional area. Reports about ocular blood flow abnormalities in the different stages of DR show some significant deviations, but the exact nature of these deviations is somewhat controversial and possibly attributable to the variety of techniques used to measure retinal blood flow.

Despite the many advances that have been made in the past 30 years, there is still no gold standard for the evaluation of blood flow in humans. The methods that are currently available for the assessment of ocular blood flow utilize different measures that evaluate, and thus represent, different phases in the retinal circulation.These methods include fluorescein angiography, fluorescein angiography with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, CDI, laser Doppler velocimetry, laser Doppler flowmetry, scanning laser Doppler flowmetry, laser speckle imaging, blue field entoptic test, pneumotonometry, laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation, and color Doppler Fourier domain optical coherence tomography.–

CDI is an ultrasound-based technique that combines B-scan images with velocity information obtained from the Doppler shift of the moving erythrocytes. Doppler spectra can be obtained from the CRA, PCA, and OA. The operator can identify the PSV and the EDV, which represent the fastest velocities in systole and diastole, respectively. The RI can be calculated as a measure of downstream vascular resistance. The RI is calculated as RI = (PSV – EDV)/PSV.–All the studies utilizing CDI that have been published thus far showed a decrease in the retrobulbar flow velocities, an increase of the resistance, or a combination of these two processes in DR. These results have been attributed to downstream vascular changes related to diabetes in both the retinal and choroidal vasculature, ie, the concept of “diabetic choroidopathy.”–
