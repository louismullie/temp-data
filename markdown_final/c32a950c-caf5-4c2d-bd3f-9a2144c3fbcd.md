## Question

What if the primary symptom is impairment of balance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a patient whose primary symptom is impaired balance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and risk stratification, including falls, triggers, and medication review. Then, I should verify the focused physical examination with emphasis on gait, balance, and neurologic systems. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis organized by etiologic domains and decide when to order targeted tests. After that, I need to outline condition-specific management, including BPPV maneuvers, vestibular rehabilitation, and falls prevention. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, reassessment, and escalation triggers, while double-checking for red flags and special populations that modify management.

> Let me first confirm the core elements of the history that most efficiently narrow the differential and quantify risk. I need to check for falls in the past year, near-falls, and fear of falling, because prior falls and fear are among the strongest predictors of future falls and should trigger a multifactorial assessment if present [^112YPdE5] [^1131krRf]. I should ask about timing and triggers: constant imbalance suggests bilateral vestibular loss or neurodegenerative disease; brief, positionally triggered episodes point toward BPPV; orthostatic symptoms raise concern for hypotension or autonomic dysfunction; and diurnal fluctuations may reflect Parkinsonian features or medication effects [^111Q81cr] [^115w7quT]. I need to ensure a thorough medication review, especially sedatives, psychotropics, antihypertensives, and ototoxins, and I should screen for cognitive complaints, visual problems, and neuropathic symptoms that can destabilize gait and balance [^112jZ4jG] [^111hwk3b].

> Wait, let me verify the focused examination sequence before I jump to conclusions. I will observe gait at usual speed, then with dual tasking or narrow base, and I will time gait speed because speeds under 0.8 m/s predict falls and functional decline. I will also use TUG, noting that times over about 15 seconds are concerning though evidence is mixed, so I should interpret TUG alongside other findings and not in isolation [^115aJ2aT]. I will examine balance in stance (Romberg on firm and foam surfaces), assess postural responses, and perform a full neurologic exam including cranial nerves, strength, sensation, coordination, and visual acuity, because clinically detected gait or balance abnormalities are among the most consistent predictors of future falls and guide risk stratification [^112YPdE5] [^116yHhqM]. I should double-check for orthostatic vital signs when symptoms suggest presyncope or autonomic dysfunction, and I will inspect feet and footwear as part of the falls risk assessment [^115w7quT] [^1131krRf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to organize the differential by etiologic domains to avoid anchoring. Peripheral vestibular causes include BPPV, unilateral or bilateral vestibular hypofunction, and Ménière's disease; central causes include cerebrovascular disease, Parkinsonian syndromes, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and cerebellar disorders; systemic contributors include orthostatic hypotension, medication effects, visual impairment, and peripheral neuropathy; and cervical or musculoskeletal factors can impair proprioception and postural control, especially after trauma or concussion [^111Q81cr] [^112q39Ks] [^112YpF6x] [^1153bNPn]. I should confirm that multifactorial etiologies are common in older adults, so more than one domain may contribute simultaneously, which changes both testing and treatment plans [^116iiq5y].

> I will now examine the role of targeted testing, but I need to ensure I do not over-order low-yield studies. For suspected BPPV, I should perform Dix-Hallpike and, if negative with a compatible history, a supine roll test to assess lateral canals, and I should avoid routine imaging or vestibular testing unless the diagnosis is uncertain or atypical features are present [^114YZfTT]. For chronic imbalance without a clear peripheral cause, vHIT is the most reliable test to detect bilateral or unilateral vestibular hypofunction, and a foam Romberg can help distinguish proprioceptive from vestibular deficits; I should also consider audiometry when hearing symptoms coexist and MRI when focal deficits, red flags, or progressive symptoms suggest central pathology [^112q39Ks] [^111Vr8G7]. But wait, what if the patient is an athlete after concussion? In that case, exertional balance testing may unmask deficits not seen at rest, so I should consider post-exertion assessments when baseline testing is unrevealing but symptoms persist [^111AMJ3Z].

> Next, I should review condition-specific management, starting with BPPV because it is common and treatable. Let me verify that canalith repositioning maneuvers such as Epley are first-line and superior to vestibular suppressants, which should generally be avoided. Vestibular rehabilitation can be offered as adjunctive therapy or when CRP is contraindicated or declined, and I should reassess within about a month to document resolution or persistent disease [^114YZfTT] [^113W1Rqn]. I need to ensure I assess and document falls risk modifiers in all patients with BPPV, including impaired mobility, lack of home support, and increased fall risk, because these factors change counseling and follow-up intensity [^113SNsQk].

> For unilateral or bilateral vestibular hypofunction, I should confirm that vestibular rehabilitation is the cornerstone of care. Moderate-to-strong evidence supports VR for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction, with benefits in symptom reduction and function; for bilateral loss, I should prescribe gaze stabilization, balance, and gait exercises and consider adjuncts such as vibrotactile feedback when deficits are severe and refractory [^113W4sRq] [^117U5am8]. Let me double-check dosing guidance: for chronic unilateral hypofunction, static and dynamic balance exercises around 20 minutes daily for 4–6 weeks is reasonable; for bilateral hypofunction, programs often extend 6–9 weeks, tailored to deficits and goals [^113FrYtp].

> For Ménière's disease with chronic interictal imbalance, I should verify that vestibular rehabilitation is recommended to improve symptom control, confidence, and quality of life, while avoiding therapy during acute attacks and coordinating with otolaryngology for definitive management when indicated [^112YpF6x]. For suspected orthostatic hypotension or reflex syncope, I will follow guideline-based evaluation including medication review, orthostatic vitals, and targeted testing, and I will treat contributors such as volume depletion, autonomic failure, or offending drugs in collaboration with cardiology or primary care [^115w7quT].

> For neurodegenerative and higher-level gait disorders, I need to ensure early identification and referral. In suspected Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonism, I should screen for axial motor features, freezing of gait, and postural instability, and consider early referral for comprehensive management; exercise and balance training are beneficial, though medication responses for axial symptoms may be limited, and advanced therapies may be considered in refractory cases [^115U11L5] [^116so4hE]. But wait, I should also remember that gait and balance impairment can precede overt cognitive diagnoses; in patients with cognitive complaints or MCI, I should integrate gait and balance assessment into the diagnostic workup and safety planning because motor and cognitive domains frequently co-decline and elevate fall risk [^111hwk3b].

> For concussion and cervical contributors, I should confirm that cervical musculoskeletal impairments can drive dizziness and balance problems even without neck pain, so I will examine cervical range, strength, and joint position error and integrate cervical and vestibular rehabilitation when indicated. Exertional testing can reveal deficits at higher demand, and I should coordinate with sports medicine or neurology for return-to-activity decisions [^112cfcBY] [^111AMJ3Z]. I need to ensure that persistent dizziness or imbalance beyond the acute phase prompts a trial of targeted vestibular and proprioceptive exercises, with goal-based reassessment to avoid prolonged, ineffective therapy [^111aGeap].

> Now, I should review falls prevention because impaired balance is a major modifiable risk factor. For older adults, I will stratify risk using gait speed, TUG, and falls history, and I will implement a multifactorial intervention for those at intermediate or high risk, including strength and balance exercise, medication review, vision correction, home safety, and management of foot problems and footwear; these strategies reduce falls by roughly 30–40% in high-risk groups [^112YPdE5] [^1131krRf]. I should double-check that even those at low risk benefit from primary prevention counseling and annual reassessment, and I will document functional goals and progress using validated tools such as gait speed, TUG, and balance scales to track response [^115aJ2aT].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers that change urgency or approach. In children, bilateral vestibular impairment can cause developmental delays and school difficulties, so early identification and vestibular rehabilitation are critical. Hypotonia may compound motor delays, and persistent balance problems after hypotonia resolution still warrant vestibular-focused therapy [^115vsJ3Q]. In patients with cognitive impairment, I should integrate balance and gait assessment into cognitive care pathways and anticipate higher fall risk, coordinating home safety and assistive strategies early [^111hwk3b]. In athletes, I should align vestibular testing and rehabilitation with exertional protocols and sport-specific demands to ensure safe return to play [^111AMJ3Z].

> I need to ensure follow-up and reassessment are built into the plan. For BPPV, I should reassess within about one month to confirm resolution or identify persistent disease or alternative diagnoses. For chronic imbalance, I will set functional goals and reassess every 4–6 weeks during rehabilitation, adjusting the program based on progress and patient preferences [^114YZfTT] [^113FrYtp]. If symptoms persist despite appropriate therapy, I should reconsider the diagnosis, look for central or multisystem contributors, and escalate to specialty referral or advanced testing such as vHIT, MRI, or neuropsychological evaluation as indicated [^112q39Ks] [^111Vr8G7].

> To synthesize, I should double-check that my approach remains tiered and patient-centered: screen for falls and risk modifiers, perform a focused gait and balance exam, target testing to the most likely etiologies, initiate condition-specific treatments such as CRP for BPPV and vestibular rehabilitation for hypofunction, embed falls prevention for older adults, and schedule reassessment to verify response and pivot care as needed. This balances effectiveness with efficiency and aligns with guideline-based practice across vestibular, neurologic, and geriatric domains [^114YZfTT] [^115aJ2aT] [^113W4sRq].

Balance impairment as a primary symptom reflects **multifactorial causes** — vestibular, neurological, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and psychogenic — and requires a structured approach: history, exam, and targeted testing [^1132xzrG] [^111Q81cr]. Key red flags — acute onset, focal deficits, or nonmechanical falls — **warrant urgent imaging** for stroke or mass lesions [^111Vr8G7]. Most cases are managed with **vestibular rehabilitation**, balance training, and fall prevention; medications are reserved for specific etiologies, and surgery is rare. Prognosis varies by cause and comorbidities, but early, individualized care improves outcomes and reduces fall risk [^113W4sRq] [^115aJ2aT].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Balance impairment spans **multiple domains**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Vestibular | - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) [^114YZfTT] <br/> - Vestibular neuritis [^111Q81cr] <br/> - Ménière's disease [^112YpF6x] <br/> - Bilateral vestibular hypofunction [^112q39Ks] |
| Neurological | - Parkinson's disease [^115U11L5] <br/> - Multiple sclerosis [^114HgbLg] <br/> - Cerebellar ataxia [^112q39Ks] <br/> - Normal pressure hydrocephalus [^112q39Ks] <br/> - Peripheral neuropathy [^1119J27V] |
| Musculoskeletal | - Osteoarthritis [^116eVobE] <br/> - Muscle weakness [^112jZ4jG] <br/> - Spinal disorders [^1153bNPn] |
| Cardiovascular | - Orthostatic hypotension [^115w7quT] <br/> - Arrhythmias [^115w7quT] <br/> - Heart failure |
| Psychogenic | - Anxiety disorders [^notfound] <br/> - Functional neurological disorders [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **structured evaluation** is essential:

- **History**: Onset, duration, triggers, associated symptoms (vertigo, dizziness, falls), medication use, and comorbidities [^1132xzrG].
- **Physical examination**: Gait analysis, Romberg test, Dix-Hallpike maneuver, neurological examination, and cardiovascular assessment [^1132xzrG].
- **Functional tests**: Timed Up and Go (TUG), Berg Balance Scale, and dynamic posturography [^115aJ2aT].

---

## Diagnostic testing

Testing is tailored to the **suspected etiology**:

- **Vestibular testing**: Videonystagmography (VNG), vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP), and video head impulse test (vHIT) [^112q39Ks].
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI or CT for suspected central causes or red flags [^111Vr8G7].
- **Cardiovascular testing**: ECG, echocardiogram, and tilt table testing for suspected cardiovascular etiologies [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific and multidisciplinary**:

- **Vestibular rehabilitation**: Effective for vestibular disorders, including BPPV, unilateral vestibular hypofunction, and chronic imbalance [^113W4sRq] [^113FrYtp].
- **Balance training**: Tai chi, yoga, and strength training improve balance and reduce falls [^114dW4f3].
- **Medications**: Treat underlying conditions (e.g. Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disorders) [^115U11L5] [^114HgbLg].
- **Surgical interventions**: Reserved for refractory cases or structural lesions [^111LD3Uj].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by cause, severity, and comorbidities. Complications include **increased fall risk** [^notfound], reduced mobility, and diminished quality of life [^116iiq5y]. Early diagnosis and targeted interventions improve outcomes and reduce fall risk [^115aJ2aT].

---

## Preventive measures and lifestyle modifications

Preventive strategies are essential: engage in **regular physical activity** — including balance, strength, and flexibility exercises [^114dW4f3]; review and adjust medications that impair balance [^112jZ4jG]; and implement home safety measures such as grab bars, adequate lighting, and clutter removal [^111hwk3b]. Addressing vision and hearing impairments further reduces fall risk [^111hwk3b].

Balance impairment as a primary symptom requires a **comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach** to identify causes, implement targeted interventions, and prevent complications.

### Tumours of the external ear and temporal bone [^111LD3Uj]. The Lancet: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Symptoms such as hearing impairment, tinnitus, or a disturbance in sense of balance can generally be attributed to non-neoplastic causes, such as otitis media, otosclerosis, or trauma. Less commonly, auricular signs and symptoms are the result of non-neoplastic and neoplastic space-occupying lesions. The external ear can be the site of development of squamous carcinomas and basal-cell carcinomas; the middle ear and inner ear can host metastatic deposits, and primary squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. Most auricular malignant diseases occur in adulthood; only the rhabdomyosarcomas of the middle ear arise in children. Most malignant diseases of the auricular apparatus are treated by a combination of surgery (commonly including radical excision of temporal bone), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.

Unilateral or bilateral vestibular hypofunction presents most commonly with symptoms of dizziness or postural imbalance and affects a large population. However, it is often missed because no quantitative testing of vestibular function is performed, or misdiagnosed due to a lack of standardization of vestibular testing. Therefore, this article reviews the current status of the most frequently used vestibular tests for canal and otolith function. This information can also be used to reach a consensus about the systematic diagnosis of vestibular hypofunction.

### Key gait findings for diagnosing three syndromic categories of dynamic instability in patients with balance disorders [^111J9vjn]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Disturbances of mobility and gait are major symptoms of patients with balance disorders, dizziness, or vertigo. They are related to deteriorations of the functional status and to severe health outcomes, such as falls and fall-related morbidity. The clinical application of quantitative, instrument-based gait analysis procedures can help to assess the degree of dynamic gait instability and to predict individual patient's fall risk. Moreover, quantitative gait assessment has the potential to facilitate differential diagnostic decisions in early stage gait disorders. The clinical applicability of these assessment routines relies on an easy-to-assess form of data representation. In particular, a reduction of spatiotemporal gait parameters to five distinct gait domains and standardized data normalization and visualization techniques can facilitate the trade-off between infrastructural efforts and the clinical usefulness of instrument-based gait analysis. Superior diagnostic validity can be achieved by performing a standardized multi-conditions gait protocol, including walking at non-habitual speeds, perturbations of sensory feedback, and the performance of cognitive dual tasks.

### Executive function predicts risk of falls in older adults without balance impairment [^116ijmz2]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Falls are common in older persons with approximately one third of individuals aged 65 and older experiencing a fall annually. Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries in this population and are a significant public health concern. Identification of potentially modifiable risk factors is important for developing fall prevention strategies and interventions. Previously identified risk factors for falls include a number of physical impairments such as impairment of gait and balance, vision impairment, orthostatic hypotension, musculoskeletal problems, and also the use of some medications

The presence of cognitive impairment has also been identified as a risk factor for falls. Lower scores on cognitive screening tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment have been associated with an increased risk of falls. Several studies have examined the role of specific cognitive domains on fall risk. Lower scores on tests of attention, executive function, memory and visuospatial function have all been reported to be associated with an increased risk of falls in both cognitively intact and cognitively impaired individuals. Difficulty with dual-task walking, a measure of divided attention and executive function in which individuals are given a secondary mental task while walking, has consistently been shown to be associated with an increased risk of falls

Although most studies of cognitive function and falls include gait assessments in their study design, balance is often measured only indirectly through gait assessments and specific balance functions may not be included in the analyses. Given the limited information available about the association of balance with cognitive function and falling, we wished to examine the role of balance in the association between cognitive dysfunction, and specifically executive dysfunction, and falling. In this study, we wished to answer the following questions: Which cognitive domains are associated with an increased risk of falling, and specifically, is executive function associated with an increased risk of falling? Is the association between executive function and falling independent of balance? We hypothesized that the association between executive dysfunction and falls would be independent of balance impairment. In order to answer these questions, we performed a secondary analysis of existing data from two longitudinal cohort studies using baseline neuropsychological and motor testing and prospective measurement of falls over a 13 month period.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^111YGjua]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Dizziness and disequilibrium — assessment in post-acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) should document symptom character, timing, and triggers, perform a targeted primary care vestibular assessment prior to referral, and include specified examination domains and functional testing, with referral to vestibular rehabilitation recommended once other causes are excluded. Dizziness and disequilibrium are common symptoms that individuals present with in the primary care settings and may be related to mTBI. In individuals with symptoms attributed to mTBI, a description and characterization of their dizziness, temporal pattern, and symptom-provoking activities provides valuable information in establishing a working differential diagnosis. Primary care assessment for vestibular disorders should be done before referring for further vestibular examination and rehabilitation, and observation and patient interview are key elements to guide care. Evaluation should include a thorough examination of neurologic function, orthostatics, vision, auditory, sensory, motor, cervical, and vestibular systems, and evaluation of functional activities should include sitting and standing balance and gait. Once the initial assessment is completed and other causes are eliminated, referral to a vestibular rehabilitation specialist is recommended for symptom management.

### Summary of the updated American Geriatrics Society / British Geriatrics Society clinical practice guideline for prevention of falls in older persons [^1131krRf]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society/British Geriatrics Society falls prevention — assessment changes call for a multifactorial falls risk assessment for all older adults who present with a fall or have gait and balance problems and also for individuals who simply report difficulties with gait or balance, whereas a falls risk assessment is not considered necessary for older persons reporting only a single fall without report or demonstrated difficulty or unsteadiness. The history should address frequency of falling, symptoms at the time of fall, and injuries from fall, and new assessment elements include examination of the feet and footwear; functional assessment of activities of daily living (including adaptive equipment and mobility aids as appropriate); assessment of the individual's perceived functional ability and fear related to falling; and environmental assessment, including home safety.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^112x5Kfk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline — risk factors, follow-up, and education: Clinicians should assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling (Recommendation). Clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms (Recommendation), and clinicians should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders (Recommendation). Clinicians should educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up (Recommendation).

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^1132xzrG]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112EJGHV]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Primary care after stroke — Functional and cognitive assessment: Screening patients after they have had a stroke for cognitive impairment by using a validated brief instrument (eg, the Mini-Mental State Examination or Montreal Cognitive Assessment test) is recommended, and guidelines emphasize routine screening before hospital discharge, during the first year, and possibly later, with case finding when impairment is suspected. Structured tools can target key risks: the Berg Balance Scale and Morse Scale classify fall risk, the timed up and go test and the 10-meter walk test classify mobility skill, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 test screens for depression. Formal neuropsychological testing is rarely needed.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^111HfkDy]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Vestibulo-oculomotor interventions after concussion indicate that a CPG supported by level I evidence recommended that if benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is identified as a potential source of dizziness, then canalith repositioning maneuvers should be used, and if BPPV is identified as a potential impairment, then physical therapists should use canalith repositioning maneuvers. Evidence includes a systematic review including 2 randomized controlled trials providing weak-to-moderate evidence that vestibulo-oculomotor rehabilitation improved outcomes; a moderate-quality randomized controlled trial indicates such rehabilitation may be feasible even within the first 10 days after a concussive injury and can be effective in reducing symptoms, reducing time to recovery, and improving function; and in 1 randomized controlled trial, individuals in the treatment group who received cervical and vestibular rehabilitation were 3.91 times more likely to be medically cleared for return to sport by 8 weeks. Observational evidence indicates that vestibular rehabilitation, including canalith repositioning maneuvers for BPPV, is commonly used by physical therapists to treat individuals who have experienced a concussive event and may help reduce dizziness and improve gait and balance dysfunction, and although repositioning maneuvers can be effective in treating BPPV, a patient may require additional interventions in the presence of concomitant vestibular hypofunction.

### Nigral stimulation for resistant axial motor impairment in Parkinson's disease? A randomized controlled trial [^115S47Dy]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Outcome measures

In this phase II study we primarily aimed to investigate a broad spectrum of axial motor symptoms. Therefore, a broad-scaled primary endpoint was defined as 'axial score' built from eight items of the anamnestic UPDRS II (items 13–15: falling unrelated to freezing, freezing when walking, walking) and the clinical UPRDS III (items 27–31: arising from chair, posture, gait, postural stability, body bradykinesia and hypokinesia), all 5-point rated. For the statistical evaluation the five rating points are represented by the numbers 0 to 4, which represent increasing levels of impairment on different axial motor domains including freezing of gait, independence of gait, balance and posture. This 'axial score' was summed of the ratings across the eight items (range 0–32). Secondary clinical endpoint assessments tested axial motor function (UPDRS III, items 27–31), balance, gait [timed walking test from Core Assessment Program for Surgical Interventional Therapies in Parkinson's Disease (CAPSIT-PD)], and freezing of gait (Freezing of Gait Assessment Course). The Freezing of Gait Assessment Course reliably detects freezing of gait given its episodic nature and dependence on environmental factors and includes elements like 'walking through a narrow door', 'turning in tight space' and 'dual tasking' that are well-known to provoke freezing of gait. These clinical ratings were obtained at baseline, upon 'immediate testing' and at '3-week follow-up' in all treatment conditions. Further anamnestic measures were assessed at baseline and at '3-week follow-up' on: (i) gait impairment related to freezing (Giladi Freezing of Gait Questionnaire) ((ii) quality of life (PDQ-39); (iii) neuropsychiatric symptoms (Beck's Depression Index, Barrett Impulsiveness Scale); and (iv) non-motor symptoms (Non-motor Symptoms Scale). Note that the anamnestic scores and the primary endpoint (including anamnestic items) were not considered for 'immediate testing' as treatment conditions were separated by only 30 min.

### Health care utilization, prognosis and outcomes of vestibular disease in primary care settings: systematic review [^111PWwHd]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

With a high lifetime prevalence and high burden of disease, vertigo and dizziness can be severely disabling because of its high impact on daily life. Psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, panic disorders, and specific phobias such as agoraphobia or acrophobia may account for avoidance behavior, increased disability, and increased health care utilization. Finally, vertigo and dizziness are specific and important risk factors for falls and injuries, especially in the aged.

Almost 45% of outpatients with dizziness and vertigo are primarily seen and treated by a primary care physician (PCP) who is often without specific neuro-otological expertise for the diagnosis and management of vestibular disorders. Management in primary care seems to be difficult because dizziness as a symptom is difficult to describe and to standardize. Also, PCPs might reasonably want to exclude potentially life threatening diseases and utilize all possible diagnostic options to avoid litigation. There is evidence that PCPs are referring such "red flag" cases correctly. However, they failed to refer patients to the specialist when referral would have been appropriate.

Most instances of vertigo and dizziness are manageable. Peripheral vestibular disorders are frequent causes for dizziness and vertigo; benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent form of peripheral vestibular disorders with a lifetime prevalence of 2% in the general population. Other, less-frequent peripheral forms of vestibular disorders include Menière's disease and vestibular neuritis. Central vestibular forms of vertigo include cerebrovascular diseases, brain stem and cerebellar lesions, infections, and vestibular migraine. In aged adults, the ageing of vestibular and proprioceptive systems and, most notably, medication are potential risk factors for vertigo and dizziness.

Inappropriate management of patients with the cardinal symptoms of vertigo and dizziness may lead to chronicity, activity limitations and considerable economic impact. Yet studies conducted from the retrospective perspective of specialized tertiary care centers found considerable under-and misdiagnosis and irrational treatment and management practices in primary care. Since vertigo and dizziness are frequent complaints that lead to extensive health care utilization, and since most patients are likely to rely on PCPs for the management of their complaints, it is important to know more about typical management patterns and referral practices as well as about prognosis and outcomes of dizzy patients in primary care.

Objective of this systematic review was to examine health care of patients with vertigo and dizziness in primary care settings. Specifically, we wanted to characterize health care utilization, therapeutic and referral behaviour and to examine the outcomes associated with this.

Disorders of gait and balance — across older adult populations, abnormal gait or balance features were associated with increased fall risk, including a Class I odds ratio (OR) of 2.7 (1.1 to 6.2), relative risks (RRs) between 1.7 (1.1 to 2.7) and 2.5 (1.7 to 3.8), Class III ORs such as 6.0 (1.7 to 21.6) and 8.1 (2.0 to 32.8), and for self-reported difficulties with balance or walking ORs of 3.0 (1.7 to 5.0) and 6.2 (1.8 to 21.5).

### Clinical symptom clusters, neurocognitive function, balance and vestibulo-ocular function in athletes with sport-related concussion [^111oCq6M]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a frequent injury with an estimated incidence of 1.6–3.8 million per year in the USA. The clinical presentation of SRC is highly heterogeneous. It can include a wide range of clinical signs and symptoms, which may affect the domains of headache/migraine, fatigue, cognition, anxiety/mood, vestibular or ocular. Due to the complexity and variability of the injury, the diagnosis of SRC is challenging, and there is no objective clinical test or marker that can be used in isolation to diagnose concussion. Therefore, a multimodal assessment that covers all potentially affected domains is recommended.

One commonly affected domain is neurocognitive functioning, which may include deficits in reaction time, memory or executive function. Many patients also present with balance problems and/or impaired vestibulo-ocular function, for example, objectively manifested in changes in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Objective tests of these functions (eg, neurocognitive test batteries, computerised vestibulo-ocular tests, objective balance tests) can be used in addition to the clinical examination and may aid in facilitating the diagnosis or monitoring recovery. However, a single test may not be able to discriminate between SRC and healthy athletes, as patients may not be affected in all domains.

In this context, grouping symptoms according to clinical profiles may facilitate a systematic evaluation of symptoms. These clinical profiles may include the symptom clusters headache/migraine, fatigue, cognitive, anxiety/mood, vestibular or ocular. While some patients present with a single cluster only, SRC is more commonly associated with a combination of several clusters. Recognition of these symptom clusters can potentially help to develop a more targeted assessment and treatment of symptoms. Especially for athletes, this could be highly important and may contribute to optimising management and rehabilitation outcomes, for example, during the return-to-sport process. It has already been shown that certain symptom profiles are associated with a longer duration of symptoms or recovery, but the specific symptom clusters related to symptom/recovery duration differed between studies. Different risk factors may also be associated with specific symptom clusters. Investigating SRC-related impairments specifically for patients presenting with certain symptom clusters could therefore provide more information than investigating the whole cohort of patients. Additionally, it may provide insight into the relationship and dependency of different clinical clusters.

Therefore, this study investigates whether neurocognitive function, balance, and vestibulo-ocular performance are impaired in athletes with SRC, depending on clinical symptom clusters.

### Small vessel disease contributions to acute delirium: a pilot feasibility MRI study [^1168j8up]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this mostly cognitively impaired population with moderate–severe background SVD and without acute stroke syndromes, we found that MRI is feasible, tolerable and interpretable during the acute delirium episode. We detected DWI-hyperintense lesions in 30% of patients overall, both with and without delirium, which are equally detectable on a fast 5-min MRI versus a 25-min standard MRI protocol (Figure 2), showing strong potential for clinical translation to acute delirium populations. In this small sample, we found that WMH burden was higher but summary SVD score was lower in the delirium group. We also establish the feasibility of determining cognitive and functional status by 6-month telephone follow-up after delirium. This pilot study provides insights into the potential role of acute vascular contributions, including SVD, to delirium and mobility-related presentations.

Previous work showed that small subcortical lesions located in the internal capsule are most likely to cause typical stroke symptoms since motor and sensory function are densely represented in the corticospinal tracts, whilst lesions located in other subcortical regions are more likely to result in so-called 'silent' stroke or atypical stroke symptoms. Most acute lesions in our study's population were located outside the corticospinal tracts, which may explain atypical clinical presentations with delirium rather than stroke. Moreover, our cognitively impaired population may lack the ability to perceive, recall or communicate stroke symptoms, and our clinical experience is that focal neurological deficits are more difficult to elicit in cognitively impaired populations, meaning that traditional stroke syndromes may be easily missed.

The 30% prevalence of DWI-hyperintense lesions in the non-delirium group may reflect that this group's primary complaint was mobility related, i.e. acute lesions may have precipitated syndromes of acute balance impairment without classic ataxia or unilateral motor symptoms that might ordinarily trigger a stroke review. Alternatively, acute infarcts in this population may reflect the high proportion of participants with cognitive impairment in both arms. It is unclear whether the acute brain changes reflect acute cognitive and physical deteriorations resulting in hospital admissions versus a more dynamic vascular element to chronic cognitive impairment than was previously thought. A serial imaging study would help to address this question. The summary SVD score was higher in the delirium arm. However, the WMH score was higher in the delirium arm. This suggests that WMH, rather than other SVD features, may be the primary SVD feature linked to delirium.

### Practice parameter: assessing patients in a neurology practice for risk of falls (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^117RDQCg]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Neurology practice parameter — assessing patients in a neurology practice for risk of falls: Evidence was classified using the American Academy of Neurology's criteria (Level A: established; Level B: probable; Level C: possible). Increased fall risk is established for stroke, dementia, and disorders of gait and balance (Level A) and is probable for Parkinson disease, peripheral neuropathy, lower extremity weakness or sensory loss, and substantial vision loss (Level B). A history of falling in the past year strongly predicts the likelihood of future falls (Level A). Screening measures, including functional assessments, may be useful (Levels B and C), but there is insufficient evidence that they offer benefit beyond a standard neurologic examination. Patients with neurologic or general conditions associated with increased fall risk should be asked about recent falls and further examined for neurologic deficits that predict falls, including gait and balance disorders; deficits of lower extremity strength, co-ordination, and sensation; visual loss; and cognitive impairment, and if substantial risks are identified, interventions described in other evidence-based guidelines may be considered.

### Current perspectives on aerobic exercise in people with Parkinson's disease [^1158q1Yh]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

There is insufficient evidence for a beneficial effect of aerobic exercise on gait, balance, falls, and functional mobility. It is possible that aerobic exercise alone, given its relatively weak effects compared to medication that we alluded to earlier, is unable to overcome such rather gross deficits in axial mobility. One option is therefore to consider combining aerobic exercise with task-specific (gait) training if patients manifest impairments in gait, balance, or functional mobility.

The effects of aerobic exercise on non-motor symptoms and health-related quality of life in PD were thus far unconvincing. However, several important limitations in the available evidence must be considered here. First, non-motor symptoms and health-related quality of life were never included as primary endpoint. Five studies included improvement of non-motor symptoms as the main aim, but none specified one primary outcome or reported a sample size calculation (except). Therefore, these studies may have been underpowered to detect improvements in non-motor symptoms or health-related quality of life. Second, study candidates were not selected based on the presence of non-motor symptoms or poor health-related quality of life. Consequently, participants manifested few depressive symptoms and cognitive deficits, while baseline health-related quality of life was high, which limited the likelihood of finding an effect on these symptoms. This is supported by a study showing that aerobic exercise did improve cognitive functioning (as measured with the Trail Making Test B) in people with PD who had cognitive impairment, as compared with usual care controls who also had cognitive impairment. Third, trials were relatively short (4–24 weeks), but more prolonged interventions may be needed to find an effect. Fourth, virtually no studies reported the effect of aerobic exercise on sleep, fatigue, and constipation, even though all these domains are theoretically attractive targets for improvement with exercise. This area therefore warrants further research. Future trials should specifically target people with PD who experience depression or anxiety, apathy, cognitive problems, sleep problems, fatigue, or reduced health-related quality of life to elucidate the effect of aerobic exercise on these non-motor symptoms and on health-related quality of life.

### Vibrotactile feedback improves balance and mobility in patients with severe bilateral vestibular loss [^117U5am8]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) is a chronic condition of which the causes can be ototoxic, infectious, traumatic, autoimmune or congenital. However, in approximately 30–50% of the cases no cause can be found. The prevalence of severe BVL has been estimated at 81 in 100,000 persons, corresponding to 500,000 patients in Europe and the United States, and as many as 3 million worldwide. Due to a limited medical expertise and poor diagnostics worldwide, there is a substantial underestimation of the prevalence of BVL in the general population and a substantial delay before the diagnosis BVL is established. BVL prevalence increases with age (presbyo-vestibulopathy), which becomes very apparent in developed countries with progressive aging of the populations. Patients with BVL complain mainly of imbalance, oscillopsia and a reduced dynamic visual acuity (DVA). Various options to reduce symptoms have been studied. There is robust evidence that vestibular rehabilitation can be effective in vestibular pathology and also in BVL. However, in severe BVL patients (including patients with bilateral areflexia), the impact of VR remains unfortunately limited in daily life balance and patients experience a sustained reduced quality of life. Not many BVL patients improve in the long term. In 2012 we implanted the first vestibular implant in humans to create a treatment option for the reduced DVA and imbalance in patients with severe BVL. But this approach is invasive, and still need substantial research to be clinically available. Already many years, research focussed on the development of non-invasive devices to restore balance per se, especially using feedback. Feedback by electrical, visual or auditory cues have been evaluated by several studies to improve balance in patients with severe vestibular deficits. Electro-tactile feedback on the tongue has been evaluated extensively to restore imbalance. However, this is quite inconvenient for permanent chronic use. Auditory and visual feedback for restorage of imbalance, interfere with the primary function of these senses. Continuous noisy galvanic stimulation at the level of the temporal bone (bilateral, retro-auricular) also provides a treatment option, which is suggested to optimize residual vestibular resources in BVL by lowering the vestibular threshold to elicit balance-related reflexes. This intervention is only effective in the presence of a residual vestibular functionality, which applies for many patients with BVL. Vibrotactile feedback can be used to increase somatosensory input to balance control. Vibrotactile feedback through the trunk is to this respect an intuitive approach and has been successfully used to reduce the need for visual navigation for special military forces, police officers and fire brigades, and to support spatial orientation for blind people and in industrial tele-manipulators. Therefore, vibrotactile feedback to the body might be the best option to restore balance next to an implant. We, therefore, developed an ambulatory vibrotactile balance belt to increase and improve the proprioceptive perception of verticality in daily life, based on the same laboratory-based approach used by Wall III and colleagues. The impact of continuous vibrotactile feedback in daily life is studied and evaluated in this study.

### Neuroimaging of dizziness and vertigo [^111Vr8G7]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Dizziness and vertigo are common symptoms in the primary care and emergency settings, resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life and a high cost burden to the US health care system. The etiology of these symptoms is difficult to elucidate owing to a wide range of diseases with overlapping manifestations. The broad differential diagnosis based on whether the disease process is central or peripheral is showcased. Each differential will be categorized into neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory, structural, traumatic, and iatrogenic causes. Computed tomography scans, MRI, and vascular imaging are frequently complimentary in providing diagnoses and guidance in management.

### Tailored multifactorial intervention to improve dizziness symptoms and quality of life, balance and gait in dizziness sufferers aged over 50 years: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^114wogyF]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

This multifactorial aetiology combined with imprecise symptom descriptions, make it difficult to establish an accurate diagnosis of dizziness A retrospective chart audit of 50 older patients with dizziness from a family practice showed that 45% did not have a diagnosis and 10% had more than one diagnosis. Furthermore, in 20% of consecutive older patients presenting to a general practice, there was no attributable cause of dizziness based on clinical characteristics. Other contributing factors to the diagnostic challenge of dizziness include overreliance on symptom description to establish a diagnosis, a tendency to diagnose conditions in the clinicians own field of experience ("the blind men and the elephant" phenomenon), and the lack of diagnostic accuracy of many tests.

If an accurate diagnosis for the underlying cause of dizziness can be made, there is potential for effective therapy. The Epley manoeuvre and vestibular rehabilitation appear effective in managing Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) and some unilateral peripheral disorders, respectively. There are also well-established syncope assessment and management guidelines, fall prevention balance and strength exercise programs for older people, and emerging cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT) that could be readily applied to older patients with psychogenic dizziness.

A comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment of dizziness holds great promise for more effectively diagnosing and treating dizziness in older people. There have been models proposed before and these have had some success in reducing the number of unresolved cases. However, these assessments are either very time consuming, have never been further developed as tools, or are not based on empirical evidence. A one-stop dizziness assessment would be welcomed by older people with dizziness who report that they would like to minimize the number of specialist referrals, for logistical reasons, cost and because they perceive that specialist's consultations often do not result in successful treatment.

This randomised controlled trial will aim to improve the understanding of dizziness, its assessment and its management in older people, overcoming the barriers we have described. We have designed a comprehensive, multidisciplinary battery of vestibular, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, balance and psychological assessments to improve the likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis for the symptom of dizziness in middle-aged and older people.

Primary objective

To compare the effect of a tailored multifaceted intervention with usual care on frequency of dizziness episodes, balance and gait performance and quality of life in people aged 50 years and over with self-reported significant dizziness.

Secondary objectives

To establish the cost-effectiveness of the program from the health provider's perspective.
To determining the effects of the program on vestibular, cardiovascular and psychological measures associated with dizziness.

### Physical therapy interventions for older people with vertigo, dizziness and balance disorders addressing mobility and participation: a systematic review [^116iiq5y]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vertigo, dizziness and balance disorders (VDB) are the most relevant factors influencing the burden of disability among older adults and are associated with immobility, limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) and decreased participation. VDB are frequent complaints of older people with a reported prevalence up to 50%, and the prevalence tends to increase with age. Complaints of VDB are distinct risk factors for falls, and even the fear of falling may lead to activity restriction and disability. Especially in older individuals, a unique underlying cause of VDB is difficult to determine because of multifactorial potential underlying pathomechanisms in the vestibular, visual and proprioceptive systems. With the impairment of one system, the other two have to compensate more to sustain postural control. Degeneration and consecutive morphological changes in otolith organs and the vestibular epithelium can be responsible for the increasing number of older individuals suffering peripheral vestibular disorders, e.g. benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Postural stability is known to be decreased with visual impairment due to age-related macular degeneration. Furthermore, sensorimotor deficits due to aging and a significantly increasing incidence of neurodegenerative conditions such Parkinson's disease starting at the age of > 60 years lead to less proprioceptive input and neuromuscular control and therefore promote imbalance. The Bárány Society considered it necessary to attend to the phenomena of presbyvestibulopathy and developed diagnostic criteria for the manifestation of unsteadiness, gait disturbance, and falls.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117D87TK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Guideline scope and shared decision-making for menopausal symptom therapy: This guideline covers the full spectrum of therapies for relief of the most common and bothersome menopausal symptoms, while the detailed management of early menopause transition, primary ovarian insufficiency, and prevention of osteoporosis and fracture are considered beyond the current scope. Choice of therapy is ideally based on available evidence regarding safety and efficacy and is generally a shared decision including both patient and provider, and the treatment selected should be tailored to the individual patient and will vary according to each woman's symptom severity, age, medical profile, personal preference, and estimated benefit/risk ratio. An accepted philosophy is that a fully informed patient should be empowered to make a decision that best balances individual QOL benefits against potential health risks.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^114SbFtg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is the most common vestibular disorder in adults, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4 percent. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with a potential diagnosis of BPPV, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with BPPV.

Purpose

The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary tests such as radiographic imaging and vestibular testing, and to promote the use of effective repositioning maneuvers for treatment. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of audiology, chiropractic medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, neurology, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The panel made recommendations against 1) radiographic imaging, vestibular testing, or both in patients diagnosed with BPPV, unless the diagnosis is uncertain or there are additional symptoms or signs unrelated to BPPV that warrant testing; and 2) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines or benzodiazepines. The panel made recommendations that 1) if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test is negative, clinicians should perform a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV; 2) clinicians should differentiate BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; 3) clinicians should question patients with BPPV for factors that modify management including impaired mobility or balance, CNS disorders, lack of home support, and increased risk for falling; 4) clinicians should treat patients with posterior canal BPPV with a particle repositioning maneuver (PRM); 5) clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to confirm symptom resolution; 6) clinicians should evaluate patients with BPPV who are initial treatment failures for persistent BPPV or underlying peripheral vestibular or CNS disorders; and 7) clinicians should counsel patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may offer vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, for the initial treatment of BPPV and 2) clinicians may offer observation as initial management for patients with BPPV and with assurance of follow-up. The panel made no recommendation concerning audiometric testing in patients diagnosed with BPPV.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgement or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^115aJ2aT]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation details and justification

There are several tests for assessing gait and balance impairment. For risk stratification, we recommend use of gait speed, with a cut-off value of < 0.8 m/s on the basis of its predictive ability and simplicity. Resources with simple instructions on how to measure gait speed can be found at.
Alternatively, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test can be used, with a cut-off value of > 15 seconds, although evidence for fall risk stratification is mixed. There is evidence that he TUG is predictive of falls in lower functioning adults.

An older adult who does not have a history of falling, or who had a single non-severe fall and no gait or balance problems, is deemed as being at low risk. Since low risk does not mean 'no risk at all', we recommend primary prevention for these older adults. This 'low risk' group should be reassessed annually. Older adults who had a single non-severe fall but also have gait and or balance problems, should be considered as being at 'intermediate risk' and would benefit from a strength and balance exercise intervention since evidence shows that this type of exercise is effective in reducing falls risk. Finally, those at 'high risk' include older adults with a fall and one or more of the following characteristics: (i) accompanying injury, (ii) multiple falls (≥ 2 falls) in the previous 12 months, (iii) known frailty, (iv) inability to get up after the fall without help for at least an hour and (v) accompanied by (suspected) transient loss of consciousness. These high-risk older adults should be offered a multifactorial falls risk assessment. Suspicion of a syncopal fall should trigger syncope evaluation and management. With regard to frailty for risk stratification, this can be either previously identified frailty or a positive result on a validated instrument used for its detection. Commonly used frailty assessment instruments include the Frailty phenotype (FP) and the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). The FP includes 5 criteria: slow gait speed, low physical activity, unintentional weight loss, exhaustion and muscle weakness; where ≥ 3 components categorises an individual as 'frail', 1 or 2 as prefrail, and 0 as not frail. The CFS is a semi-quantitative scale with pictograms that ranges from 1 (very fit) to 9 (terminally ill). A score ≥ 4 is considered as frail. The algorithm for stratification and management in Figure 1 summarizes this approach.

### Overview on cognitive impairment in psychotic disorders: from impaired microcircuits to dysconnectivity [^114dpNZB]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia's cognitive deficits, often overshadowed by positive symptoms, significantly contribute to the disorder's morbidity. Increasing attention highlights these deficits as reflections of neural circuit dysfunction across various cortical regions. Numerous connectivity alterations linked to cognitive symptoms in psychotic disorders have been reported, both at the macroscopic and microscopic level, emphasizing the potential role of plasticity and microcircuits impairment during development and later stages. However, the heterogeneous clinical presentation of cognitive impairment and diverse connectivity findings pose challenges in summarizing them into a cohesive picture. This review aims to synthesize major cognitive alterations, recent insights into network structural and functional connectivity changes and proposed mechanisms and microcircuit alterations underpinning these symptoms, particularly focusing on neurodevelopmental impairment, E/I balance, and sleep disturbances. Finally, we will also comment on some of the most recent and promising therapeutic approaches that aim to target these mechanisms to address cognitive symptoms. Through this comprehensive exploration, we strive to provide an updated and nuanced overview of the multiscale connectivity impairment underlying cognitive impairment in psychotic disorders.

### Nigral stimulation for resistant axial motor impairment in Parkinson's disease? A randomized controlled trial [^116i7eA3]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Gait and balance disturbances typically emerge in advanced Parkinson's disease with generally limited response to dopaminergic medication and subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. Therefore, advanced programming with interleaved pulses was put forward to introduce concomittant nigral stimulation on caudal contacts of a subthalamic lead. Here, we hypothesized that the combined stimulation of subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata improves axial symptoms compared with standard subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Twelve patients were enrolled in this 2 × 2 cross-over double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial and both the safety and efficacy of combined subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata stimulation were evaluated compared with standard subthalamic nucleus stimulation. The primary outcome measure was the change of a broad-scaled cumulative axial Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score (Scale II items 13–15, Scale III items 27–31) at '3-week follow-up'. Secondary outcome measures specifically addressed freezing of gait, balance, quality of life, non-motor symptoms and neuropsychiatric symptoms. For the primary outcome measure no statistically significant improvement was observed for combined subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata stimulation at the '3-week follow-up'. The secondary endpoints, however, revealed that the combined stimulation of subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata might specifically improve freezing of gait, whereas balance impairment remained unchanged. The combined stimulation of subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata was safe, and of note, no clinically relevant neuropsychiatric adverse effect was observed. Patients treated with subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata stimulation revealed no 'global' effect on axial motor domains. However, this study opens the perspective that concomittant stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata possibly improves otherwise resistant freezing of gait and, therefore, highly warrants a subsequent phase III randomized controlled trial.

### Vestibular rehabilitation for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction [^113W4sRq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2007 and previously updated in 2011. Unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction (UPVD) can occur as a result of disease, trauma or postoperatively. The dysfunction is characterised by complaints of dizziness, visual or gaze disturbances and balance impairment. Current management includes medication, physical manoeuvres and exercise regimes, the latter known collectively as vestibular rehabilitation.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation in the adult, community-dwelling population of people with symptomatic unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The most recent search was 18 January 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of adults living in the community, diagnosed with symptomatic unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction. We sought comparisons of vestibular rehabilitation versus control (e.g. placebo), other treatment (non-vestibular rehabilitation, e.g. pharmacological) or another form of vestibular rehabilitation. Our primary outcome measure was change in the specified symptomatology (for example, proportion with dizziness resolved, frequency or severity of dizziness). Secondary outcomes were measures of function, quality of life and/or measure(s) of physiological status, where reproducibility has been confirmed and shown to be relevant or related to health status (for example, posturography), and adverse effects

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 39 studies involving 2441 participants with unilateral peripheral vestibular disorders in the review. Trials addressed the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation against control/sham interventions, medical interventions or other forms of vestibular rehabilitation. Non-blinding of outcome assessors and selective reporting were threats that may have biased the results in 25% of studies, but otherwise there was a low risk of selection or attrition bias. Individual and pooled analyses of the primary outcome, frequency of dizziness, showed a statistically significant effect in favour of vestibular rehabilitation over control or no intervention (odds ratio (OR) 2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85 to 3.86; four studies, 565 participants). Secondary outcomes measures related to levels of activity or participation measured, for example, with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, which also showed a strong trend towards significant differences between the groups (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.83, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.64). The exception to this was when movement-based vestibular rehabilitation was compared to physical manoeuvres for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), where the latter was shown to be superior in cure rate in the short term (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49). There were no reported adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate to strong evidence that vestibular rehabilitation is a safe, effective management for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction, based on a number of high-quality randomised controlled trials. There is moderate evidence that vestibular rehabilitation resolves symptoms and improves functioning in the medium term. However, there is evidence that for the specific diagnostic group of BPPV, physical (repositioning) manoeuvres are more effective in the short term than exercise-based vestibular rehabilitation; although a combination of the two is effective for longer-term functional recovery. There is insufficient evidence to discriminate between differing forms of vestibular rehabilitation.

### Relationships between physical activities performed under free-living conditions and non-motor symptoms in people with parkinson' s: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hJr2J]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The global burden of neurological conditions is significant and increasing, and as the population ages, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease is particularly fast growing. Parkinson's is often characterised by motor impairments, such as bradykinesia and postural instability, rigidity, or tremor. In more recent times, research has highlighted the recognition of non-motor symptoms which present in more than 90% of people with Parkinson's. Compared to healthy older adults, the prevalence and severity of these symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, fatigue, affective disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety, apathy), pain, and sleep problems, are greater among people with Parkinson's. Non-motor symptoms typically increase with disease progression, and negatively affect health-related quality of life, daily routines, planning/socialising, and independence.

While there is growing evidence from intervention studies supporting the benefits of exercise – and physical activities, such as dance, aquatic therapy, tai chi, and Nordic walking, for improving physical domains of health, such as muscle strength, balance, and gait speed, few have focused on non-motor symptoms as the primary outcome. Additionally, such interventions have been critiqued for being highly supervised and not reflecting a sustainable frequency or intensity of activity under free-living conditions. Although supervision ensures exercise safety and provides encouragement and support for participants, upon cessation of the intervention, many participants return toward baseline activity levels without this supervision. – In contrast, participation in unsupervised physical activities that are performed under free-living conditions, such as gardening, housework, and community exercise classes, which are part of an individual's day-to-day life, – tends to be more sustainable throughout the lifespan. – The potential for participation in physical activities under free-living conditions to benefit non-motor symptoms is important, particularly when pharmaceutical interventions offer limited effectiveness or unwanted side effects. – It is also important for people with Parkinson's, who might otherwise be sedentary due to factors, such as access or resource constraints, and low self-efficacy for exercise –; yet there is a dearth of reviews to determine this relationship.

Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to analyse the research literature to understand whether there is a relationship between physical activities performed under free-living conditions and non-motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's: cognitive impairment, fatigue, sleep problems, affective disorders, and pain.

### Patient information: multiple sclerosis… [^114HgbLg]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease that damages the protective covering around nerves in the brain and spinal cord due to inflammation. In areas of the brain and spinal cord affected by MS, signals transmitted across nerves are slowed or blocked, causing neurological symptoms that can result in decreased quality of life and disability. Common Types and Symptoms of MS Individuals with relapsing-remitting MS have neurologic symptoms that appear suddenly, followed by a period of complete or near-complete recovery. Over time, the relapsing-remitting episodes may occur less frequently and individuals may develop gradually worsening disability. Persons with primary progressive MS have symptoms that worsen over time without relapses and remissions.

Symptoms of MS include fatigue, blurred vision and eye pain, weakness or changes in sensation in parts of the body such as the face, arms, or legs, dizziness, balance difficulty, impairment in memory or thinking, and problems with bladder control. Patients with MS are also at increased risk of depression and anxiety. Diagnosis and Treatment of MS The diagnosis of MS is typically made by a neurologist and is based on history of symptoms, physical examination, and characteristic abnormalities found on brain magnetic resonance imaging. In some cases, a lumbar puncture is performed to confirm the diagnosis of MS. Patients with MS should receive comprehensive, coordinated care from a neurologist and a team of other clinicians. Medications and other health interventions are used to treat nerve pain, muscle spasms, fatigue, depression and anxiety, and urinary incontinence.

Assistive devices, such as a brace or cane, may be helpful for patients with MS who have difficulty with balance and walking. One drug is approved for patients with primary progressive MS. Depending on which treatment is used, these disease-modifying therapies can decrease MS relapses by approximately 30% to 70%. Potential side effects of some of these treatments include infection, injection site reactions, low heart rate, and autoimmune thyroid disease.

### Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness: a useful new syndrome [^116T9dD4]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Popkirov, Staab and Stone also indicate that PPPD may coexist with other diagnoses that cause dizziness. We emphasise that if there are coexisting balance disorders (eg, Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, vestibular migraine, vestibular neuritis, Ménière's disease, central neurological conditions), these accompanying disorders should be managed either first or in parallel to PPPD therapy. Migraine deserves a special mention since in patients with active migraine, clinical observation suggests that vestibular rehabilitation may trigger or aggravate migraine and/or PPPD symptoms, leading to failure of vestibular therapy. Some vestibular neurologists therefore recommend having a low threshold for using prophylactic agents to treat migraine in patients requiring vestibular therapy, even if migraine is not the primary cause of the vestibular disturbance.

Although vestibular exercises can help to tackle PPPD, combining them with psychotherapies and other approaches that target anxiety-related symptoms and lifestyle-associated disorders — for example, good sleep hygiene, physical exercise, and a balanced diet — may be ideal to accelerate recovery from the maladaptive cycle that perpetuates PPPD. Future research should also include the effect of potentially enjoyable vestibular stimulation in PPPD, such as that derived from sports like tennis or dancing, which are known to mediate brain plasticity within vestibular–cerebellar circuits.

Nevertheless, some important issues remain before we can employ such strategies, including the key pathophysiological mechanisms that underly PPPD and establishing the potential of neuroimaging and other biomarkers for tracking the development and evolution of PPPD. Popkirov, Staab and Stone's proposal for a new theoretical account to conceptualise PPPD lays the groundwork to move in this direction.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^115w7quT]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope in the elderly — causes and assessment: The most common causes of syncope in the elderly are orthostatic hypotension (OH), reflex syncope, especially carotid sinus syndrome (CSS), and cardiac arrhythmias, and different forms may co-exist in one patient, complicating diagnosis. Polypharmacy is frequent and relevant to evaluation: "One-third of individuals over 65 years are taking three or more prescribed medications, which may cause or contribute to syncope", and "Medication history should include the time relationship with onset of syncope". Cognitive issues and witness availability affect history quality: "Cognitive impairment is present in 5% of 65 year olds and 20% of 80 year olds", and "it is important to pursue a witness account of episodes, although this is not available in up to 60% of cases". Examination priorities are specified: "Evaluation of neurological and locomotor systems, including observation of gait and balance, is useful. If cognitive impairment is suspected, the Mini–Mental State Examination should be performed". Etiologic frequencies include: "Cardioinhibitory CSS is the recognized cause of symptoms in up to 20% of elderly patients with syncope. CSH of predominantly vasodepressor form is equally prevalent, but its potential role in syncope is much less clear".

### Preventive effect of sensorimotor exercise and resistance training on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a randomised-controlled trial [^1125qLTN]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tingling, burning, numbness and pain in hands and/or feet may be observed from the first administration of neurotoxic drugs such as taxanes, platinum compounds or vinca alkaloids. The severity and persistence of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) are mainly dependent on drug type and cumulative dose, but probably also on comorbidities and lifestyle factors such as obesity and low moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The primary sensory symptoms and resulting functional limitations, such as balance and gait difficulties, may persist over several years/decades in up to 50% of patients, causing reduced individual independence and quality of life, but also probably increased cancer recurrence and mortality rates, due to chemotherapy dose reductions and early treatment termination.

The reduction of chemotherapy dose is currently the only way to prevent the progression of CIPN symptoms. However, the body of research is constantly growing investigating the effects of various prevention and rehabilitation measures, such as exercise therapy. After chemotherapy, exercise is shown to positively affect various aspects of CIPN. However, the preventive potential has been so far less investigated and the results are sometimes divergent. Positive intervention effects were found for deep sensitivity, perception of hot and coldness and static balance performance. All other studies were not able to detect a positive influence on CIPN signs/symptoms or functional limitations, which might be due to the following methodological issues: small sample sizes (N = 19–43), blurred baseline values by performing baseline measurement after the first chemotherapy administration, and rudimentary CIPN assessment. Regarding CIPN assessment, it is recommended in the current literature to combine both subjective and objective CIPN diagnostics. However, only one study complies with the current literature recommendations. All other studies used either singular subjective assessments (ranging from simple, non-psychometrically tested symptom queries to the use of recommended questionnaires), or a singular objective test (tuning fork). On this basis, we conducted a single-centre randomised-controlled three-arm intervention trial. The primary aim of the PIC study was to evaluate the preventive potential of sensorimotor exercise training (SMT) and resistance training (RT) versus usual care (UC) during neurotoxic chemotherapy on clinically objectified CIPN signs/symptoms by means of the Total Neuropathy Score (TNSr). The SMT represented a specific training approach guided by the CIPN symptoms (especially the balance impairment), while the RT was tested as a non-specific training approach. We hypothesised that patients randomised to the SMT or RT group would have a smaller change on the TNSr score over the course of neurotoxic chemotherapy in comparison to patients receiving UC.

### Gait and balance disorders in older adults [^113ttfWR]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Gait and balance disorders are common in older adults and are a major cause of falls in this population. They are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as reduced level of function. Common causes include arthritis and orthostatic hypotension; however, most gait and balance disorders involve multiple contributing factors. Most changes in gait are related to underlying medical conditions and should not be considered an inevitable consequence of aging. Physicians caring for older patients should ask at least annually about falls, and should ask about or examine for difficulties with gait and balance at least once. For older adults who report a fall, physicians should ask about difficulties with gait and balance, and should observe for any gait or balance dysfunctions. The Timed Up and Go test is a fast and reliable diagnostic tool. Persons who have difficulty or demonstrate unsteadiness performing the Timed Up and Go test require further assessment, usually with a physical therapist, to help elucidate gait impairments and related functional limitations. The most effective strategy for falls prevention involves a multifactorial evaluation followed by targeted interventions for identified contributing factors. Evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for gait and balance disorders is limited because of the lack of standardized outcome measures determining gait and balance abilities. However, effective options for patients with gait and balance disorders include exercise and physical therapy.

### Will my patient fall? [^112YPdE5]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Effective multifactorial interventions reduce the frequent falling rate of older patients by 30% to 40%. However, clinical consensus suggests reserving these interventions for high-risk patients. Limiting fall prevention programs to high-risk patients implies that clinicians must recognize features that predict future falls.

Objective

To identify the prognostic value of risk factors for future falls among older patients.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Search of MEDLINE (1966-September 2004), CINAHL (1982-September 2004), and authors' own files to identify prospective cohort studies of risk factors for falls that performed a multivariate analysis of such factors.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently determined inclusion of articles and assessed study quality. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Included studies were those identifying the prognostic value of risk factors for future falls among community-dwelling persons 65 years and older. Clinically identifiable risk factors were identified across 6 domains: orthostatic hypotension, visual impairment, impairment of gait or balance, medication use, limitations in basic or instrumental activities of daily living, and cognitive impairment.

Data Synthesis

Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria and provided a multivariate analysis including at least 1 of the risk factor domains. The estimated pretest probability of falling at least once in any given year for individuals 65 years and older was 27% (95% confidence interval, 19%-36%). Patients who have fallen in the past year are more likely to fall again [likelihood ratio range, 2.3–2.8]. The most consistent predictors of future falls are clinically detected abnormalities of gait or balance (likelihood ratio range, 1.7–2.4). Visual impairment, medication variables, decreased activities of daily living, and impaired cognition did not consistently predict falls across studies. Orthostatic hypotension did not predict falls after controlling for other factors.

Conclusions

Screening for risk of falling during the clinical examination begins with determining if the patient has fallen in the past year. For patients who have not previously fallen, screening consists of an assessment of gait and balance. Patients who have fallen or who have a gait or balance problem are at higher risk of future falls.

### Sensory phenotypes for balance dysfunction after mild traumatic brain injury [^116EJP1Z]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Recent team-based models of care use symptom subtypes to guide treatments of individuals with chronic effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, these subtypes, or phenotypes, may be too broad, particularly for balance (e.g., vestibular subtype). To gain insight into mTBI-related imbalance, we (1) explored whether a dominant sensory phenotype (e.g., vestibular impaired) exists in the chronic mTBI population, (2) determined the clinical characteristics, symptomatic clusters, functional measures, and injury mechanisms that associate with sensory phenotypes for balance control in this population, and (3) compared the presentations of sensory phenotypes between individuals with and without previous mTBI.

Methods

A secondary analysis was conducted on the Long-Term Impact of Military-Relevant Brain Injury Consortium-Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium. Sensory ratios were calculated from the sensory organization test, and individuals were categorized into 1 of the 8 possible sensory phenotypes. Demographic, clinical, and injury characteristics were compared across phenotypes. Symptoms, cognition, and physical function were compared across phenotypes, groups, and their interaction.

Results

Data from 758 Service Members and Veterans with mTBI and 172 individuals with no lifetime history of mTBI were included. Abnormal visual, vestibular, and proprioception ratios were observed in 29%, 36%, and 38% of people with mTBI, respectively, with 32% exhibiting more than 1 abnormal sensory ratio. Within the mTBI group, global outcomes (p < 0.001), self-reported symptom severity (p < 0.027), and nearly all physical and cognitive functioning tests (p < 0.027) differed across sensory phenotypes. Individuals with mTBI generally reported worse symptoms than their non-mTBI counterparts within the same phenotype (p = 0.026), but participants with mTBI in the vestibular-deficient phenotype reported lower symptom burdens than their non-mTBI counterparts (e.g., mean [SD] Dizziness Handicap Inventory = 4.9 [8.1] for mTBI vs 12.8 [12.4] for non-mTBI, group × phenotype interaction p < 0.001). Physical and cognitive functioning did not differ between the groups after accounting for phenotype.

Discussion

Individuals with mTBI exhibit a variety of chronic balance deficits involving heterogeneous sensory integration problems. While imbalance when relying on vestibular information is common, it is inaccurate to label all mTBI-related balance dysfunction under the vestibular umbrella. Future work should consider specific classification of balance deficits, including specific sensory phenotypes for balance control.

### Challenges and opportunities in managing the dizzy older adult [^115FMxHn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Balance disorders are common in elderly people, not only resulting in distressing sensations but also leading to reduced activity levels and quality of life. It has been estimated that 30% of elderly patients experience a balance disorder. Managing these disorders is a substantial challenge for patients and their caregivers and physicians. Moreover, abnormalities in balance are associated with falls, a major cause of morbidity and mortality for elderly people. Management is complicated by the inherent difficulties in assessing the generic complaint of dizziness, as well as the likelihood of multiple, often nonvestibular causes. The authors of this mini-seminar review both vestibular and nonvestibular causes of balance disorders in elderly people, emphasizing practical therapeutic maneuvers that can be used.

### Prediagnostic presentations of Parkinson's disease in primary care: a case-control study [^114Y2DVz]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Parkinson's disease has an insidious onset and is diagnosed when typical motor features occur. Several motor and non-motor features can occur before diagnosis, early in the disease process. We aimed to assess the association between first presentation of several prediagnostic features in primary care and a subsequent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and to chart the timeline of these first presentations before diagnosis.

Methods

We identified individuals with a first diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and those without Parkinson's disease from Jan 1, 1996, to Dec 31, 2012, from The Health Improvement Network UK primary care database. Codes were extracted for a range of possible prediagnostic or early symptoms, comprising motor features (tremor, rigidity, balance impairments, neck pain or stiffness, and shoulder pain or stiffness), autonomic features (constipation, hypotension, erectile dysfunction, urinary dysfunction, and dizziness), neuropsychiatric disturbances (memory problems, late-onset anxiety or depression, cognitive decline, and apathy), and additional features (fatigue, insomnia, anosmia, hypersalivation and rapid-eye-movement sleep behaviour disorder) in the years before diagnosis. We report the incidence of symptoms recorded in more than 1% of cases per 1000 person-years and incidence risk ratios (RRs) for individuals with and without Parkinson's disease at 2, 5, and 10 years before diagnosis.

Findings

8166 individuals with and 46,755 individuals without Parkinson's disease were included in the study. Apathy, REM sleep behaviour disorder, anosmia, hypersalivation, and cognitive decline were all reported in less than 1% of people per 1000 person-years and were excluded from further analyses. At 2 years before Parkinson's disease diagnosis, the incidence of all studied prediagnostic features except neck pain or stiffness was higher in patients who went on to develop Parkinson's disease (n = 7232) than in controls (n = 40,541). At 5 years before diagnosis, compared with controls (n = 25,544), patients who went on to develop Parkinson's disease (n = 4769) had a higher incidence of tremor (RR 13·70, 95% CI 7·82–24·31), balance impairments (2·19, 1·09–4·16), constipation (2·24, 2·04–2·46), hypotension (3·23, 1·85–5·52), erectile dysfunction (1·30, 1·11–1·51), urinary dysfunction (1·96, 1·34–2·80), dizziness (1·99, 1·67–2·37), fatigue (1·56, 1·27–1·91), depression (1·76, 1·41–2·17), and anxiety (1·41, 1·09–1·79). At 10 years before diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, the incidence of tremor (RR 7·59, 95% CI 1·11–44·83) and constipation (2·01, 1·62–2·49) was higher in those who went on to develop Parkinson's disease (n = 1680) than in controls (n = 8305).

Interpretation

A range of prediagnostic features can be detected several years before diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in primary care. These data can be incorporated into ongoing efforts to identify individuals at the earliest stages of the disease for inclusion in future trials and to help understand progression in the earliest phase of Parkinson's disease.

### Screening for primary open-angle glaucoma: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1126ecpz]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening for primary open-angle glaucoma — recommendation and scope: For adults 40 years or older who do not have any symptoms of glaucoma, the USPSTF found that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for primary open-angle glaucoma in adults (Grade: I statement). This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults (40 years or older) and does not apply to adults who have reported signs and symptoms of vision loss or have been diagnosed with other types of glaucoma. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for primary open-angle glaucoma in the primary care setting in persons without symptoms of vision impairment, and clinicians should use their clinical judgement to determine if screening is appropriate for individual patients. Glaucoma affects an estimated 2.7 million persons in the US, its onset is mid-late adulthood with prevalence increasing with age, and it disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic/Latino persons, with Black persons having the highest prevalence of glaucoma, a higher rate of glaucoma progression, and earlier presentation of glaucoma symptoms. Several screening tests can identify open-angle glaucoma, but these tests are not commonly administered in the primary care setting and it cannot be precisely predicted whether increased intraocular pressure or early glaucomatous changes will progress to visual impairment. Treatment of early, screen-detected primary open-angle glaucoma often includes prescription eye drops or laser therapy and focuses on reducing intraocular pressure, visual field loss, and optic nerve damage; however, there is limited evidence about whether these changes lead to improvements in visual impairment, vision-related function, and quality of life. Glaucoma is the second-leading cause of irreversible blindness in the US and the leading cause of blindness in Black and Hispanic/Latino persons.

### Use of physical exertion to enhance objective testing following mild traumatic brain injury: a systematic review [^111AMJ3Z]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

To reduce reliance on symptom reporting as the primary indicator of mTBI recovery, experts have highlighted the importance of including objective measurements in RTP testing. In current practice, any objective measures, such as balance testing and oculomotor examination, are completed in a resting state. However, in a sporting context, the demands on the physical systems are much higher and assessment at rest has a potential ceiling effect.

A range of mTBI reports have demonstrated that physical exertion can highlight impairments in various objective measurements that are not detectable at rest. This suggests that RTP assessment could incorporate post-exertion testing, where a selection of physical measurements (eg, visual tracking, balance, gait) are undertaken following physical exertion to 'objectively' determine if an individual is ready to RTP or whether they are likely to experience a decline in performance when they begin to train or compete.

In current clinical practice, exertional tolerance testing (ETT) is recommended in mTBI management to assess an athlete's tolerance to aerobic exercise and to determine if, and at what intensity, symptoms are produced. However, ETT relies on the reporting of symptoms to identify exercise intolerance, and is not currently widely used to detect objective impairments that could indicate incomplete physiological recovery in asymptomatic individuals.

Replicating sport-specific demands through exertional testing has proven valuable in the domain of cognitive assessment. Several studies agree that post exertion, many concussed participants show a decline in cognitive performance that was not detected at rest. Cognition represents one domain where lingering impairments would contribute to an increase in injury risk. Impairments of the visual and balance systems, or dysfunction in the autonomic systems resulting in decreased oxygen delivery or abnormal fatigue, could also represent an injury risk.

Previous reviews have been limited to the use of exertion testing within ETT paradigms onlyor were limited to objective autonomic measuresexcluding other physical measures such as sensorimotor function. Thus, a systematic review is warranted to explore the use of various types of physical exertion testing to detect a range of objective physical mTBI impairments. The aim of this systematic review was to determine if physical exertion affects objective measures of physiological and sensorimotor function differently in individuals with mTBI compared with healthy control participants. The findings may provide further guidance about which measures could be considered for inclusion in RTP post-exertion testing protocols following mTBI.

### Framework for understanding balance dysfunction in Parkinson's disease [^116so4hE]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

People with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from progressive impairment in their mobility. Locomotor and balance dysfunction that impairs mobility in PD is an important cause of physical and psychosocial disability. The recognition and evaluation of balance dysfunction by the clinician are an essential component of managing PD. In this review, we describe a framework for understanding balance dysfunction in PD to help clinicians recognize patients who are at risk for falling and impaired mobility.

### The Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): validated clinical assessment instruments [^111hwk3b]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinician needs to be aware of any alterations in sensory or motor function (especially vision, hearing, gait, and balance) to fully interpret symptoms of cognitive or behavioral change. Hearing loss (presbycusis), a known and potentially reversible dementia risk factor, is very common in the elderlyas is visual loss (presbyopia). Some components of hearing or visual dysfunction related to primary sensory inputs (as opposed to processing and integration of auditory and visual signals in brain networks) are also amenable to treatments that can mitigate cognitive or behavioral symptoms, maintain or improve daily activities, and reduce safety risks.

Gait and balance problems take on added importance in the evaluation and management of people who are cognitively impaired. Fall risk may be substantially increased when sensorimotor, gait, or balance problems co‐occur with cognitive or behavioral impairments in insight, judgment, impulse control, attention, memory, psychomotor processing, and visuospatial awareness. Gait and balance impairment can point to a group of disorders in which impaired cognition, behavior, and impaired motor function co‐occur, the most common being a Parkinson's spectrum disorder (manifesting as Dementia with Lewy Bodies [DLB] or Parkinson's disease dementia), vascular cognitive impairment or dementia, or one of the diseases linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration such as progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal degeneration. In some patients, a gait disorder can be the most prominent symptom. Gait and balance disorders also have predictive utility of future risk for developing dementia. Distal polysensory neuropathy, particularly in the feet/legs, is common in older individuals, can be idiopathic or due to long‐term sequelae of chronic microvascular insufficiency, and is a fall risk that may be treated (e.g. in vitamin B12 deficiency) or mitigated (e.g. by use of assistive device, night light, shower grab bars, and eliminating trip hazards). Some sensorimotor impairments in persons with cognitive and behavioral syndromes are amenable to early intervention and sustained treatments and exercises (e.g. formal physical therapy assessment and treatment of gait and balance, home occupational therapy, and safety assessment). Improved balance or limb motor function can benefit daily functions and reduce safety risks.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^111aGeap]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

VA/DoD post-acute mild traumatic brain injury — vestibular and proprioceptive symptoms: We suggest that patients with persistent symptoms of dizziness and imbalance attributed to mild traumatic brain injury be offered a trial of specific vestibular rehabilitation and proprioceptive therapeutic exercise (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). The Work Group reviewed two RCTs that suggested specific vestibular and proprioceptive therapeutic exercises may help reduce dizziness symptom severity and improve functional independence in the short term, although there were serious limitations (i.e., high risk of bias, small sample size), which led to concerns about the precision of the estimates reported. Benefits slightly outweigh harms/burdens with participation in specific vestibular therapy, and vestibular/balance therapy should be encouraged in patients with unresolved symptoms of dizziness or imbalance that persist beyond the acute phase (see the Algorithm, Module A: Initial Presentation (> 7 Days Post-Injury)). There is low risk of harm with participation in vestibular rehabilitation. However, the Work Group discourages a prolonged course of therapy in the absence of patient improvement to mitigate negative illness expectations. To minimize the potential negative effects of protracted, ineffective treatment, the Work Group suggests goal-based, functional re-assessment to determine treatment responsiveness by a vestibular rehabilitation provider (i.e., physical therapist or occupational therapist). It is preferred that the rehabilitation provider has acquired post-graduate training specific to vestibular rehabilitation, providers should consider patient preferences, which likely vary, and provocation of symptoms to a moderate level should be expected by patients participating in vestibular rehabilitation.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115tbr1E]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Poststroke physical rehabilitation in primary care — algorithm for screening and management specifies foundational steps and branching actions: Education about stroke (Class 1 recommendation), Advice and support for individually tailored recreational exercise program (Class 1 recommendation), and Advice to participate in balance training to reduce falls (Class 1 recommendation), followed by ASSESSMENT OF FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENTS (Class I or IIa Recommendations). If Rehabilitation potential has been achieved, proceed to Periodic reassessment; if not, Refer for therapy to address specific needs. This assessment determines the need for rehabilitation services, is initiated during admission and repeated in the office setting, and capabilities and needs for rehabilitation can change over time and across the continuum of stroke recovery. Three questions can be helpful in this assessment: (1) What could the patient do before the stroke that they cannot do now? (2) What does the patient want to be able to do? (3) Has the patient reached full potential?

### Practice parameter: assessing patients in a neurology practice for risk of falls (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^112jZ4jG]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Falls epidemiology and risk factors in older adults: In the United States, unintentional falls account for more than 16,000 deaths each year, with three quarters occurring among persons over 64 years of age, and result in nearly 500,000 hospitalizations and more than 1.8 million emergency department visits annually. Identified risk factors include advanced age, muscle weakness, deficits in gait or balance, visual deficits, arthritis, impairments in activities of daily living, depression, cognitive impairment, and use of medications — especially sedatives, antidepressants, and neuroleptics — with evidence that multiple risk factors in a single patient have additive effects. According to evidence-based guidelines, interventions with demonstrated efficacy in older, community-dwelling populations include patient training (including use of assistive devices), review and reduction of medications (especially psychotropics), and exercise programs with balance training.

### Peripheral neuropathy in older people is associated with reduced life expectancy [^1119J27V]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of older primary care patients to determine whether the presence of peripheral neuropathy (PN) was associated with premature mortality and to investigate potential mechanisms.

Methods

PN was defined as the presence of 1 or more bilateral lower extremity sensory deficits detectable by physical examination. Mortality was determined from key contacts and Internet sources. Statistical models were used to evaluate the association between PN and mortality.

Results

Bilateral lower extremity neurological deficits were common, reaching 54% in those 85 and older. PN was strongly associated with earlier mortality. Mean survival time for those with PN was 10.8 years, compared with 13.9 years for subjects without PN. PN was also indirectly associated through impaired balance.

Conclusions

In this relatively healthy cohort of older primary care patients, PN detectable by physical examination was extremely common and strongly associated with earlier mortality. One possible mechanism involves loss of balance, though our data were insufficient to determine whether poor balance led to injurious falls or to less-specific declines in health. These findings may warrant further studies to determine the causes of age-associated PN and potential impact of early detection and balance improvement and other fall prevention strategies.

a Unless stated otherwise, variables are reported as the mean (and standard deviation)

All participants were recruited from local community groups, and were free from any cardiovascular or musculoskeletal impairment that prohibited them from standing for > 2 min without support. Participants did not report a current diagnosis for any neurological or vestibular condition, nor did they report any recent (within the past 6 weeks) bouts of dizziness. Participants were excluded if they demonstrated major cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score < 18/30), or if they were currently prescribed medication for anxiety. Demographic information for both cohorts is reported in Table 1. Institutional ethical approval was obtained from the local ethics committee and the research was carried out in accordance with the principles laid down by the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Dizziness demystified [^111Q81cr]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Four vestibular presentations caused by six different disorders constitute most of the neuro-otology cases seen in clinical practice. 'Acute vestibular syndrome' refers to a first-ever attack of acute, spontaneous, isolated vertigo and there are two common causes: vestibular neuritis / labyrinthitis and cerebellar infarction. Recurrent positional vertigo is most often caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and less commonly is central in origin. Recurrent spontaneous vertigo has two common causes: Ménière's disease and vestibular migraine. Lastly, chronic vestibular insufficiency (imbalance) results from bilateral, or severe unilateral, peripheral vestibular impairment. These six disorders can often be diagnosed on the basis of history, examination, audiometry, and in some cases, basic vestibular function testing. Here we show that most common neuro-otological problems can be readily managed by general neurologists.

### Exercise for improving balance in older people [^114dW4f3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In older adults, diminished balance is associated with reduced physical functioning and an increased risk of falling. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007.

Objectives

To examine the effects of exercise interventions on balance in older people, aged 60 and over, living in the community or in institutional care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE and EMBASE (to February 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies testing the effects of exercise interventions on balance in older people. The primary outcomes of the review were clinical measures of balance.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from studies. Data were pooled where appropriate.

Main Results

This update included 94 studies (62 new) with 9,917 participants. Most participants were women living in their own home. Most trials were judged at unclear risk of selection bias, generally reflecting inadequate reporting of the randomisation methods, but at high risk of performance bias relating to lack of participant blinding, which is largely unavoidable for these trials. Most studies only reported outcome up to the end of the exercise programme. There were eight categories of exercise programmes. These are listed below together with primary measures of balance for which there was some evidence of a statistically significant effect at the end of the exercise programme. Some trials tested more than one type of exercise. Crucially, the evidence for each outcome was generally from only a few of the trials for each exercise category. 1. Gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks (19 studies of which 10 provided primary outcome data): Timed Up & Go test (mean difference (MD) -0.82 s; 95% CI -1.56 to -0.08 s, 114 participants, 4 studies); walking speed (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.43; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.75, 156 participants, 4 studies), and the Berg Balance Scale (MD 3.48 points; 95% CI 2.01 to 4.95 points, 145 participants, 4 studies).2. Strengthening exercise (including resistance or power training) (21 studies of which 11 provided primary outcome data): Timed Up & Go Test (MD -4.30 s; 95% CI -7.60 to -1.00 s, 71 participants, 3 studies); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes closed (MD 1.64 s; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.31 s, 120 participants, 3 studies); and walking speed (SMD 0.25; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.46, 375 participants, 8 studies).3. 3D (3 dimensional) exercise (including Tai Chi, qi gong, dance, yoga) (15 studies of which seven provided primary outcome data): Timed Up & Go Test (MD -1.30 s; 95% CI -2.40 to -0.20 s, 44 participants, 1 study); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes open (MD 9.60 s; 95% CI 6.64 to 12.56 s, 47 participants, 1 study), and with eyes closed (MD 2.21 s; 95% CI 0.69 to 3.73 s, 48 participants, 1 study); and the Berg Balance Scale (MD 1.06 points; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.76 points, 150 participants, 2 studies).4. General physical activity (walking) (seven studies of which five provided primary outcome data). 5. General physical activity (cycling) (one study which provided data for walking speed). 6. Computerised balance training using visual feedback (two studies, neither of which provided primary outcome data). 7. Vibration platform used as intervention (three studies of which one provided primary outcome data).8. Multiple exercise types (combinations of the above) (43 studies of which 29 provided data for one or more primary outcomes): Timed Up & Go Test (MD -1.63 s; 95% CI -2.28 to -0.98 s, 635 participants, 12 studies); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes open (MD 5.03 s; 95% CI 1.19 to 8.87 s, 545 participants, 9 studies), and with eyes closed ((MD 1.60 s; 95% CI -0.01 to 3.20 s, 176 participants, 2 studies); walking speed (SMD 0.04; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.17, 818 participants, 15 studies); and the Berg Balance Scale ((MD 1.84 points; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.97 points, 80 participants, 2 studies). Few adverse events were reported but most studies did not monitor or report adverse events. In general, the more effective programmes ran three times a week for three months and involved dynamic exercise in standing.

Authors' Conclusions

There is weak evidence that some types of exercise (gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks; strengthening exercise; 3D exercise and multiple exercise types) are moderately effective, immediately post intervention, in improving clinical balance outcomes in older people. Such interventions are probably safe. There is either no or insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions for general physical activity (walking or cycling) and exercise involving computerised balance programmes or vibration plates. Further high methodological quality research using core outcome measures and adequate surveillance is required.

### Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of balance disorders [^114GMhm9]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Here we summarize the recent progress made in the diagnosis and treatment of balance and gait disorders. Focusing on work published in the Journal of Neurology in 2010 and 2011, we have found evidence for the following clinically relevant statements: (1) the exclusion of stroke in acute vestibular syndromes is based on the bedside clinical findings; (2) the risk of developing secondary somatoform vertigo is predictable; it is especially high in patients with vestibular migraine; (3) postural imbalance and falls in Parkinson syndromes are related to dysfunction of the cholinergic midbrain thalamic axis; (4) aminopyridines improve a variety of cerebellar parameters including central nystagmus and gait variability.

vHIT in chronic imbalance

There are many possible causes for a complaint of chronic imbalance: some neurological, such as sensory neuropathies, extrapyramidal disorders, orthostatic tremor, or normal pressure hydrocephalus, and others not, such as musculoskeletal disorders or mental health issues. What concerns us here is chronic vestibular insufficiency which can either be due to severe unilateral vestibular impairment or moderate to severe, symmetrical or asymmetrical, bilateral vestibular impairment. The patient with chronic vestibular insufficiency might have no obvious symptoms while sitting or lying but feels imbalance as soon as she stands or walks. Despite this there might be little clinically obvious impairment of gait or of stance even with eyes closed and feet together — a negative Romberg test. But if the patient now tries to do a Romberg test on a soft surface, say a foam mat, then she will sway and could fall if not caught. This is a positive foam Romberg test which is almost diagnostic of vestibular impairment. Patients with proprioceptive impairment such as those with a hereditary neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie Tooth disease or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy or a ganglionopathy such as CANVAS (cerebellar ataxia neuropathy vestibular areflexia syndrome) already have a positive Romberg test on the firm surface such as the floor but will be worse when standing on foam. Patients with bilateral vestibular impairment might also have difficulties with movement strategies, control of dynamics, orientation in space, and cognitive processing. Such patients will also notice vertical oscillopsia during rapid, passive vertical head-shaking due to impairment of the vertical VOR. They might even volunteer, or at least admit, that they have to stop walking in order to see clearly. Having the examiner shake their head up-and-down will drop their vision by at least three lines on a Snellen chart. Bilateral vestibular impairment needs to be severe to be detectable on caloric or rotational tests, as these tests have large normal ranges. vHIT is the most reliable test to detect bilateral vestibular impairment as it has a tight age-adjusted normal range and is even suitable for detecting age-related vestibular impairment, that is "presbyvestibulopathy", also called "presbystasis". Although mild impairment of just one lateral SCC can be detected by caloric testing, it will not produce imbalance if it is only mild. vHIT is the best test for measuring whether vestibular function is by itself impaired sufficiently to produce imbalance. A possible cause of an isolated severe unilateral vestibular loss presenting with chronic vestibular impairment is an unrecognised previous attack of acute vestibular neuritis; the patient might not have had or might not have noticed vertigo. If there is definitely no history of a previous vertigo attack, then a chronic progressive cause of unilateral vestibular loss such as a vestibular schwannoma (hearing should also be impaired) needs to be excluded. The cause of non-syndromic bilateral vestibular impairment without hearing impairment usually remains undiagnosed unless it is bilateral sequential vestibular neuritis, gentamicin toxicity, Wernicke's encephalopathy or maybe hereditary spastic paraplegia. If accompanied by hearing impairment then other diagnoses need to be considered: hereditary disorders such as Usher syndrome and also acquired diseases such as superficial siderosis and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. If there is also cerebellar impairment, as shown by an impaired visually enhanced VOR, then CANVAS needs to be considered. If there is paradoxical enhancement of the VOR on vHIT, as well as of the visually enhanced VOR, then autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 3 (ARCA3) which is due to a mutation in the ANO10 gene needs to be considered.

Association With Developmental Delay and Hypotonia

Managing vestibular symptoms in children is especially important, as vestibular dysfunction from any etiology occurring during critical developmental periods can contribute to delays across multiple developmental domains. As the vestibular system is critical to an individual's ability to maintain posture and coordinate movement, it is unsurprising that children with BVH and other vestibular impairments exhibit delays in achievement of developmental milestones. Examples of impairments often include delayed acquisition of head control, sitting, and independent walking. This trend was seen in our cohort with 18 children exhibiting developmental delay.

It is also important to note the potential contributions of hypotonia to the motor delays seen in our cohort. Associations between hypotonia, delayed acquisition of milestones, and vestibular dysfunction have been previously reported. It is unsurprising that the 10 children with hypotonia at time of evaluation had difficulty with motor tasks and balance. For the two children with prior histories of hypotonia, however, their impaired balance and motor functioning persisted beyond resolution of their hypotonia. This supports a vestibular etiology for their difficulties and suggests that addressing the vestibular dysfunction has meaningful potential for improving motor functioning.

In addition to motor delays, there is also evidence to suggest that bilateral vestibular impairment during critical developmental windows in childhood can impact both spatial and nonspatial cognitive functioning. The vestibular system is involved in visuospatial processing and directing eye movements, so children with gaze instability or oscillopsia have difficulties with reading, drawing, writing, and mathematics resulting in poor academic performance. These impairments have also been shown to extend into the social and emotional domains by impacting a child's self‐esteem, anxiety, and social functioning.

The complex interplay between vestibular dysfunction, developmental delay, and underlying syndromes in our cohort pose interesting questions. It remains unclear whether vestibular dysfunction is a common underlying etiology of these children's impairments or an unrecognized contributor responsible for some portion of their overall deficits. Thus, identifying these deficits through vestibular testing may allow for timely intervention and the possibility of long‐term improvements across multiple functional domains and quality of life.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

DETeCD-ADRD recommendations — Recommendation 3 (tiered assessment strategy): The evaluation process should use tiers of assessments and tests based on individual presentation, risk factors, and profile to establish a diagnostic formulation, including (1) the overall level of impairment, (2) the cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and (3) the likely cause(s) and contributing factors (Strength of Recommendation A). A structured yet personalized diagnostic evaluation of cognitive or behavioral symptoms — with hierarchical use of tiers of assessments and tests tailored to the patient — balances effectiveness and efficiency, and this structured yet individualized approach ensures that essential information is collected in all cases while allowing leeway for clinical judgment regarding need for further assessments, tests, or consultative input. Ultimately, the clinician will integrate available data to arrive at a confident diagnosis based on established clinical criteria (Tables 1–4), or to exclude such diagnoses.

### Tailored multifactorial intervention to improve dizziness symptoms and quality of life, balance and gait in dizziness sufferers aged over 50 years: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^111SBF1t]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The intervention

Based on their underlying conditions and case conference recommendations, appropriate interventions will be organised for participants assigned to the intervention group (Table 3). The intervention plan will be guided by published normative data for the vision, sensorimotor, balance and psychological tests and the presence of abnormal results in our vestibular and cardiovascular tests. Due to the multifactorial aetiology of dizziness in older people, it is likely that many participants will require multiple interventions which we will implement in a staged manner.

Table 3
Underlying conditions diagnosed and indicated interventions

Adverse events (for example, a fall during an exercise session) will be monitored with monthly calendars and telephone calls as required and adherence to all interventions documented with therapist records and/or participant diaries.

A trial safety committee composed of two Senior staff of Neuroscience Research Australia (a Senior scientist and a Senior biostatistician), not involved in any aspect of the study and independent from the sponsor and investigators, will review the withdrawal, deceased and incident data of the trial annually and report to the Ethics Committee.

The control group

Control group participants will receive usual care during the six-month trial period. At completion of the trial, they will be provided with their baseline and re-assessment reports and given the option to being referred appropriate therapies.

Primary and secondary outcomes

The primary outcome measures outlined in Table 2 will capture the four crucial aspects of the trial: dizziness, balance, walking stability and quality of life. The secondary outcome measures, also outlined in Table 2, will elucidate how the interventions assist in ameliorating dizziness symptoms. Dizziness episodes and duration will be ascertained with monthly calendars and telephone calls as required. Participants will return to NeuRA for reassessment of outcomes at the end of the trial (6 months post randomisation). Staff monitoring the dizziness episodes and administering reassessments will be blinded to group allocation.

Sample size calculation

A power analysis determined that 300 participants (150 per group) will need to be recruited to provide 80% power to detect a statistically significant 20% between-group difference in the primary outcome measures. For these calculations, we assumed an alpha of 0.05 and a dropout rate of 15%. We assumed the following control group means (standard deviations), based on values from previous studies of older people: choice-stepping reaction time = 1322 (331) ms, step-time variability = 0.02 (0.01) s, and dizziness handicap inventory = 37 (2).

### Identifying mechanisms of change in a magic-themed hand-arm bimanual intensive therapy programme for children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy: a qualitative study using behaviour change theory [^116CHcdY]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Unilaterial spastic cerebral palsy (USCP, or "hemiplegia") is a neurological condition affecting around 1.77 to 2.11 in every 1000 live births, in which one side of the body is paralysed due to damage to or abnormalities in the brain. Primary symptoms include impaired motor function, speech and balance, which can lead to difficulties in managing daily tasks independently. In particular, children with a unilateral impairment tend to avoid using the affected limb, even if they are suffering mild functional loss. This can lead to increased impairment in the affected limb, including reduced motor control, motion, and skeletal maturation. Poor movement of the affected hand can also reduce the performance of a non-affected hand. Alongside these physical symptoms, children with USCP can also experience behavioural problems, learning and visual difficulties, and developmental delay. Improving the use of affected hands is, therefore, critical to the functional and emotional development of children with USCP.

### Vestibular rehabilitation using dynamic posturography: functional stability and fall risk outcomes from a randomized trial [^111gWcHT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the underlying causes of deficits among participants varied (Table 1), the focus of this study on stable, objectively determined, unilateral deficits strengthens the interpretation of our findings for this cohort. However, it is uncertain whether these findings may be generalizable to other patient groups. We have recently published an analysis, from a single‐group pilot study of CVRT, of sensory ratios of the SOT. These findings offer clues into the compensation mechanisms underpinning the changes in global balance observed after CVRT. Future research of CVRT in patients with other vestibular pathologies would be valuable to determine which patients may benefit from CVRT and whether the sensory integration changes associated with CVRT vary when the deficits arise from divergent underlying causes or treatment is initiated during the acute phase of vestibular loss.

The World Guidelines for Fall Prevention recommends intervention for those at intermediate or high risk based on history of falls and responses to the "Three Key Questions" (1. Have you fallen in the past year, 2. Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking? 3. Do you have worries about falling?). However, the results of the meta‐analysis by Donovan et al suggest that those latter two questions offer little insight into an individual's vestibular function, which increases the risk of falls regardless of age or sex. In a meta‐analysis, fallers with vestibular dysfunction did not report poorer balance confidence or more severe dizziness than those without a diagnosis of vestibular dysfunction, and the majority of fallers with a vestibular deficit reported no dizziness or vertigo symptoms. These findings underscore the importance of screening for vestibular function as part of FRA strategies.

In this study, we found that CVRT was associated with improvements in reaction time, directional control, movement velocity, and endpoint excursion that were greater than for HEP for individuals with unilateral vestibular deficits. Considered alongside our previous report showing CVRT‐associated improvements in participant‐reported disability and objective posturographic measures, these findings support a role for CVRT, as part of a multimodal treatment approach, to provide complementary therapeutic outcomes to current therapies. Research comparing CVRT against, and in combination with, such therapies as supervised vestibular physiotherapy would be a valuable area for future research.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^112cfcBY]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Cervical musculoskeletal impairments — postconcussion symptom relationships note that cervical musculoskeletal impairments can lead to symptoms commonly reported after concussion, including neck pain, headache with or without neck pain, dizziness, and diminished balance/postural control, yet the incidence associated with concussive events has not been comprehensively studied; given the biomechanical mechanism of many concussive injuries, it is hypothesized these impairments may be present, and in patients with neck pain without concussion there is strong evidence for diminished range of motion, strength, and insufficient muscle endurance, with evidence that sensorimotor and vestibular reflex deficits may originate from altered cervical afferent input leading to dizziness, visual dysfunction, balance problems, and difficulties with head and eye movement control; even without neck pain after a concussive event, cervical musculoskeletal impairments may underlie symptoms such as dizziness, imbalance, and headache, and overlapping symptoms can make determining symptom origin difficult.

### Tailored multifactorial intervention to improve dizziness symptoms and quality of life, balance and gait in dizziness sufferers aged over 50 years: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^113TP93Q]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Dizziness is a frequently reported symptom in older people that can markedly impair quality of life. This manuscript presents the protocol for a randomised controlled trial, which has the main objective of determining the impact of comprehensive assessment followed by a tailored multifaceted intervention in reducing dizziness episodes and symptoms, improving associated impairments to balance and gait and enhancing quality of life in older people with self-reported significant dizziness.

Methods

Three hundred people aged 50 years or older, reporting significant dizziness in the past year will be recruited to participate in the trial. Participants allocated to the intervention group will receive a tailored, multifaceted intervention aimed at treating their dizziness symptoms over a 6 month trial period. Control participants will receive usual care. The primary outcome measures will be the frequency and duration of dizziness episodes, dizziness symptoms assessed with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, choice-stepping reaction time and step time variability. Secondary outcomes will include health-related quality of life measures, depression and anxiety symptoms, concern about falling, balance and risk of falls assessed with the physiological fall risk assessment. Analyses will be by intention-to-treat.

Discussion

The study will determine the effectiveness of comprehensive assessment, combined with a tailored, multifaceted intervention on dizziness episodes and symptoms, balance and gait control and quality of life in older people experiencing dizziness. Clinical implications will be evident for the older population for the diagnosis and treatment of dizziness.

Trial registration

The study is registered with the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.

### Emerging therapies for gait disability and balance impairment: promises and pitfalls [^116YLaBt]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Therapeutic management of gait and balance impairment during aging and neurodegeneration has long been a neglected topic. This has changed considerably during recent years, for several reasons: (1) an increasing recognition that gait and balance deficits are among the most relevant determinants of an impaired quality of life and increased mortality for affected individuals; (2) the arrival of new technology, which has allowed for new insights into the anatomy and functional (dis)integrity of gait and balance circuits; and (3) based in part on these improved insights, the development of new, more specific treatment strategies in the field of pharmacotherapy, deep brain surgery, and physiotherapy. The initial experience with these emerging treatments is encouraging, although much work remains to be done. The objective of this narrative review is to discuss several promising developments in the field of gait and balance treatment. We also address several pitfalls that can potentially hinder a fast and efficient continuation of this vital progress. Important issues that should be considered in future research include a clear differentiation between gait and balance as two distinctive targets for treatment and recognition of compensatory mechanisms as a separate target for therapeutic intervention.

### New balance capability index as a screening tool for mild cognitive impairment [^11791hSD]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 50 million people live with dementia worldwide, and this number is predicted to increase to 152 million by 2050. Total cost in 2019 for people with dementia was estimated to be $1.3 trillion globally, which could rise to $1.7 trillion by 2030. Thus, the burden of dementia continues to grow, and prevention strategies including early identification and early treatment of the disease are highly needed.

Although our understanding of dementia etiology is still shifting, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, accounting for an estimated 60% to 80% of cases. The progression of AD is called the AD continuum. On this continuum, there are three broad phases: preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and dementia due to AD. A meta-analysis study found that among individuals with MCI who were tracked for 5 years or longer, 38% developed dementia. However, in some individuals MCI reverts to normal cognition or remains stable, particularly with some appropriate intervention. Therefore, it is important to identify individuals with MCI early in the course of AD in order to protect from dementia.

Generally, individuals with dementia are vulnerable for a decline in physical functioning and basic activities of daily living. In fact, as a characteristic of cognitive impairment and dementia, it has long been known that people with AD have a higher frequency of falls, and today, cognitive impairment is well established as an independent risk factor for falling. Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that early disturbances in cognitive function are associated with slower gait and gait instability. Given that gait and balance are deeply connected, some relationship between cognitive function and balance capability can be implicated.

The vestibular (inner ear balance) system senses head movement and orientation in space, and vestibular sensory input plays a critical role in postural control, contributing to balance capability which can be measured by static postural balance parameters during standing. Intriguingly, growing evidence suggests that vestibular impairment is disproportionately prevalent among individuals with MCI and dementia due to AD.

### Higher-level gait disorders: a population-based study on prevalence, quality of life, depression and confidence in gait and balance [^112pkxwr]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Psychological features associated with higher-level gait disorder (HLGD)

The reduced QoL, symptoms of depression and reduced confidence in gait and balance in HLGD are distressing, especially since 76 out of 87 individuals had an unknown aetiology to the symptom, indicating they had not been in contact with healthcare professionals for their gait-related problems, or the cause could not be identified.

Functional disability is a risk factor for depression, which may be mirrored in the association between HLGD and symptoms of depression. Symptoms of depression may also cause functional disability. Evaluation of psychomotor symptoms is part of a standard psychiatric evaluation, but if the gait impairment is non-equivalent to the psychiatric symptoms, other causes should be considered. Those with HLGD in primary care should be screened for symptoms of depression. Depressive symptoms should elicit an in-depth anamnesis directed towards depression and, if applicable, initiation of treatment. However, the problem is complex since the use of anti-depressant drugs in old age may also contribute to higher mortality ratesand falls.

Impaired gait function, falls and fear of falling are associated with reduced QoL and depressive symptoms. However, some associated problems may be reduced by interventions (physical therapy and home-safety improvements), which emphasise the importance of awareness of HLGD and a thorough anamnesis of associated problems.

Higher-level gait disorder (HLGD) in clinical care

The severity of the GDs in this study varied from pronounced with very slow gait velocity to milder symptoms. Additional symptoms might have emerged in a follow-up visit, making a final diagnosis possible in some individuals. However, the definition of HLGD is broad, and symptoms originating from the lower or middle levels of the nervous system may overlap with higher-level findings, introducing challenges in the diagnostics. In a previous study investigating clinical characteristics of the 'cautious gait of unknown origin', defined similar to HLGD in the present study, the cases had frontal lobe, postural and extrapyramidal disturbances; more fear of falling; incontinence; sleep disturbances; and lower cognition than normal walkers. In these individuals, more extensive investigations were performed, including neuroimaging; still, no known diagnosis could explain the syndrome.

Recommendation based on systematic reviews and limited RCTs with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A, with level of confidence in evidence High, and the policy level is Recommendation. Benefits include improved symptom control, safety, reduced risk of falls, improved confidence, and improved QOL, while risks, harms, and costs include cost of therapy, time for appointments, and potential exacerbation of acute symptoms; the benefit-harm assessment is preponderance of benefit over harm. Exclusions include patients in the setting of an acute attack, and while ineffective acutely, VR therapy has a significant role in the chronic management of MD patients; patient preferences are small but patients can have a larger role in deciding if they choose to do VR.

### Traditional Chinese rehabilitation exercise (TCRE) for myofascial pain: current evidence and further challenges [^115pYna1]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Myofascial chain-related diseases and primary symptom.

Analyze the frequent points of myofascial chain-related pain and find that they occur in three motor joints: cervical, lumbar, and knee. Figure 2 shows the symptoms and the main locations of myofascial-related diseases.

The cervical spine maintains posture and limb movement with its seven flexible segments and myofascial chains. Poor neck habits can lead to tension and degenerative pathologies like cervical spondylosis and disc herniation due to the disruption of the cervical power balance system. The lumbar spine, composed of five vertebrae, relies on balancing myofascial chains for stability. Trunk muscle dysfunction can cause instability, leading to LBP. Long-term poor posture or excessive force can result in degenerative changes and potential nerve compression. The lumbar intervertebral disc fibrous ring, cartilage plate, and nucleus pulposus will have different degrees of degenerative changes, resulting in straightening of the physiological curvature of the lumbar spine, decreasing elasticity and reducing the pressure that the lumbar intervertebral disc can withstand. The nucleus pulposus will protrude from the rupture and compress the surrounding nerves, causing back and leg pain, numbness, and other symptoms. The knee joint, the largest and most complex hinge joint, maintains stability during movement. Imbalances in its stability structures can lead to chronic pain, swelling, and impaired mobility, often characterized by degeneration of knee cartilage and osteophytes, resulting in abnormal mechanical conduction and joint stress imbalance.

### Nigral stimulation for resistant axial motor impairment in Parkinson's disease? A randomized controlled trial [^116KzP6j]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Gait and balance disturbances typically emerge in advanced Parkinson's disease with generally limited response to dopaminergic medication and subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. Therefore, advanced programming with interleaved pulses was put forward to introduce concomittant nigral stimulation on caudal contacts of a subthalamic lead. Here, we hypothesized that the combined stimulation of subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata improves axial symptoms compared with standard subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Twelve patients were enrolled in this 2 × 2 cross-over double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial and both the safety and efficacy of combined subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata stimulation were evaluated compared with standard subthalamic nucleus stimulation. The primary outcome measure was the change of a broad-scaled cumulative axial Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score (Scale II items 13–15, Scale III items 27–31) at '3-week follow-up'. Secondary outcome measures specifically addressed freezing of gait, balance, quality of life, non-motor symptoms and neuropsychiatric symptoms. For the primary outcome measure no statistically significant improvement was observed for combined subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata stimulation at the '3-week follow-up'. The secondary endpoints, however, revealed that the combined stimulation of subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata might specifically improve freezing of gait, whereas balance impairment remained unchanged. The combined stimulation of subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata was safe, and of note, no clinically relevant neuropsychiatric adverse effect was observed. Patients treated with subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata stimulation revealed no 'global' effect on axial motor domains. However, this study opens the perspective that concomittant stimulation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata possibly improves otherwise resistant freezing of gait and, therefore, highly warrants a subsequent phase III randomized controlled trial.

### Orthostatic tremor: a cerebellar pathology? [^113QXu35]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Primary orthostatic tremor is a rare condition characterized by singular symptoms including a high frequency 13–18 Hz tremor of the legs and trunk that appears in the standing position, and which is associated with a strong feeling of instability, fear of falling, fatigue, and often pain. Subjective unsteadiness worsens over time, while posturographic measurements reveal an increase of the total sway path without concomitant change of the tremor frequency. Whether impaired balance control is the consequence of a pathological orthostatic tremor or whether the tremor is the response to a primarily abnormal control of balance is still under debate. This latter hypothesis came from the finding that, in healthy humans, postural instability caused by galvanic stimulation or leaning backwards elicited coherent EMG bursts at ∼16 Hz, similar to the orthostatic tremor frequency.

### Concussion in combination with whiplash-associated disorder may Be missed in primary care: key recommendations for assessment and management [^1147XNGn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Synopsis

Whiplash and concussion may have similar presenting symptoms, biomechanical mechanisms, and neurophysiological sequelae, but neither enjoys a gold standard diagnostic test. Guidelines for whiplash and concussion are developed and implemented separately. This disparate process may contribute to misdiagnosis, delay appropriate primary care management, and impair patient outcomes. In our clinical commentary, we present 3 cases where signs and symptoms consistent with whiplash were identified in primary care. Symptoms in all cases included neck pain, headache, dizziness, and concentration deficits, raising suspicion of coexisting postconcussion syndrome. All cases were referred for specialist physical therapy. Characteristics consistent with poor recovery in both whiplash and postconcussion syndrome were confirmed, and multidisciplinary management, drawing from both whiplash and concussion guidelines, was implemented. All patients reported improvement in activities of daily living after tailored management addressing both neck and head injury-related factors, suggesting that these conditions were not mutually exclusive. Self-reported outcomes included reductions in neck disability and postconcussion symptoms of between 20% and 40%. It may be appropriate for whiplash and concussion guidelines to be amalgamated, enhanced, and mutually recognized on a patient-by-patient basis. Primary health care professionals might consider minimum screening to identify postconcussion syndrome in patients following motor vehicle collision by administering questionnaires and assessing cranial nerve function, balance, and cognition. Management should then incorporate principles from both whiplash and concussion guidelines and harmonize with available imaging guidelines for suspected spine and head trauma.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disabling chronic pain syndrome characterized by multiple symptoms, including medically unexplained widespread pain, fatigue, cognitive, mood and sleep disorders.FM is considered a diagnosis of exclusion, leading to a significant delay in diagnosis, of up to 5 years, with the number of physicians visited in the interim reported as 3. The subjective nature of FM and the absence of validated diagnostic tests negatively impact its management, contributing to greater disease severity, fatigue, pain, poor treatment response and frustration. Efficient FM diagnosis and treatment depend on eliciting valid biomarkers, and defining subgroups. Motor control deficits in balance and postural control have been demonstrated in patients with FM, as have symptoms of central sensitization, characterized by hypersensitivity to bright light, touch, noise, temperature, and mechanical pressure. The prevalence of FM in the general population is estimated to be between 1 and 10%, with a female predominance. FM patients report higher levels of pain and fatigue than other chronic pain syndromes, negatively impacting social contacts, employment abilities, daily activities, and mental health, associated with reduced quality of life, and presenting a societal burden.FM has an unknown aetiology but has been described as a complex hyperalgesic pain syndrome in which abnormalities of central sensory processing interact with peripheral pain generators. Despite the importance of comorbid symptoms, most research has traditionally focused on pain-related outcomes. However, recommended pharmaceutical therapies generally achieve only 30% effectiveness in relieving symptoms and 20% effectiveness in improving function. Multiple position statements recommend that medications be accompanied by exercise and coping skills approaches.

The symptoms of FM may lead to a sedentary lifestyle by reducing physical abilities, which can lead to adverse effects on the functional capacity of the patient. Patients with chronic pain often have deficits in motor performance, including restricted movement or altered motor planning, leading to posture, gait and balance insufficiencies. Despite the evidence of altered gait and postural parameters in FM, little is known about how these abnormalities are linked to clinical variables such as pain, fatigue, stiffness, or depression. Understanding the underlying disease process will provide insights for targeted therapeutic approaches. This review aims to synthesise current evidence on motor control deficits, balance, and postural dysfunction in FM, and to evaluate multidisciplinary strategies to improve functional capacity and quality of life.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^117AP6bq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.

### Dizziness: state of the science [^115tXFhD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Dizziness is prevalent in all adult populations, causing considerable morbidity and utilization of health services. In the community, the prevalence of dizziness ranges from 1.8% in young adults to more than 30% in the elderly. In the primary care setting, dizziness increases in frequency as a presenting complaint; as many as 7% of elderly patients present with this symptom. Classification of dizziness by subtype (vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and other) assists in the differential diagnosis. Various disease entities may cause dizziness, and the reported frequency of specific diagnoses varies widely, depending on setting, patient age, and investigator bias. Life-threatening illnesses are rare in patients with dizziness, but many have serious functional impairment. Dizziness can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in elderly persons, in whom it often represents dysfunction in more than one body system. Given the relatively underdeveloped state of the empirical literature on dizziness, investigators would benefit from use of consistent criteria to describe dizziness symptoms and establish diagnoses. Investigation of the effects of testing and treatment should focus on diagnoses that are life threatening or lead to significant morbidity. In the elderly, a function-oriented approach should be studied and compared with current diagnosis-focused strategies. Alternative therapies for chronic and recurrent dizziness also merit investigation.

### Summary of the updated American Geriatrics Society / British Geriatrics Society clinical practice guideline for prevention of falls in older persons [^1159VpJY]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Annotations — screen-positive criteria, single-fall significance, and gait/balance evaluation: Persons at higher risk of falling identified by screening should be assessed for known risk factors, and a multifactorial fall risk assessment should be performed for community-dwelling older persons who report recurrent (≥ 2) falls, report difficulties with gait or balance, or seek medical attention or present to the emergency department because of a fall. A (first) single fall may indicate difficulties or unsteadiness in walking or standing, and in older individuals a fall may be a sign of problems in gait or balance that was not present in the past. Gait and balance deficits should be evaluated in older individuals reporting a single fall as a screen for identifying individuals who may benefit from a multifactorial fall risk assessment, and for persons who screen positive for falls or fall risk, evaluation of balance and gait should be part of the multifactorial fall risk assessment.

### Key gait findings for diagnosing three syndromic categories of dynamic instability in patients with balance disorders [^1165zMD5]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

With the emergence of affordable, clinical-orientated gait analysis techniques, clinicians may benefit from a general understanding of quantitative gait analysis procedures and their clinical applications. This article provides an overview of the potential of a quantitative gait analysis for decision support in three clinically relevant scenarios of early stage gait disorders: scenario I: gait ataxia and unsteadiness; scenario II: hypokinesia and slow gait; scenario III: apparently normal gait with a specific fall tendency in complex mobility situations. In a first part, we justify the advantages of standardized data collection and analysis procedures including data normalization and dimensionality reduction techniques that facilitate clinical interpretability of instrument-based gait profiles. We then outline typical patterns of pathological gait and their modulation during different walking conditions (variation of speed, sensory perturbation, and dual tasking) and highlight key aspects that are particularly helpful to support and guide clinical decision-making.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^116eVobE]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis — gait impairments and fall risk assessment are emphasized, with consideration for balance evaluation: Patients with knee OA may also present with various gait impairments that can lead to abnormal joint loading, and medial knee OA is more likely to show a higher knee adduction moment during gait; patients with knee OA may be at increased risk for future falls compared to age-matched control due to gait-related pain and sensorimotor impairments, therefore, an assessment of balance and fall risk should be considered in patients with knee OA.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^113Fsfsn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Vestibulo-oculomotor impairments — physical therapists should examine vestibular and oculomotor function for patients after a concussive event who report symptoms such as headache, dizziness, vertigo, nausea, fatigue, balance problems, visual motion sensitivity, blurred vision, or difficulty with focusing on stable or moving targets, and should examine aspects including ocular alignment, smooth pursuits, saccades, vergence and accommodation, gaze stability, dynamic visual acuity, visual motion sensitivity, light-headedness caused by orthostatic hypotension, and vertigo caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV); if BPPV is suspected, physical therapists should assess the patient using a Dix-Hallpike test or other appropriate positional test(s), and they may examine vestibulo-oculomotor function even when related symptoms are not reported to identify potential subtle impairments contributing to symptoms.

### Dizziness, unsteadiness, visual disturbances, and sensorimotor control in traumatic neck pain [^1153bNPn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Synopsis There is considerable evidence to support the importance of cervical afferent dysfunction in the development of dizziness, unsteadiness, visual disturbances, altered balance, and altered eye and head movement control following neck trauma, especially in those with persistent symptoms. However, there are other possible causes for these symptoms, and secondary adaptive changes should also be considered in differential diagnosis. Understanding the nature of these symptoms and differential diagnosis of their potential origin is important for rehabilitation. In addition to symptoms, the evaluation of potential impairments (altered cervical joint position and movement sense, static and dynamic balance, and ocular mobility and coordination) should become an essential part of the routine assessment of those with traumatic neck pain, including those with concomitant injuries such as concussion and vestibular or visual pathology or deficits. Once adequately assessed, appropriate tailored management should be implemented. Research to further assist differential diagnosis and to understand the most important contributing factors associated with abnormal cervical afferent input and subsequent disturbances to the sensorimotor control system, as well as the most efficacious management of such symptoms and impairments, is important for the future.

### Natural history of falls in an incident cohort of Parkinson's disease: early evolution, risk and protective features [^115YqXv4]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Falls aetiology in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is complex and multidimensional. Falls are associated with primary features (age, disease severity, gait and balance deficit, cognitive impairment), and secondary features that occur in response to falling (anxiety, reduced self-efficacy, weakness and loss of mobility). To date, the strongest predictor of a future fall is a prior fall, and clinical fall assessment is typically triggered when falls are established and not prior to their occurrence. Although pragmatic, this approach is limited and important to recognise because effective falls management becomes more challenging when secondary features are established. Ideally, management of falls risk should begin early and aim to prevent or at least delay the onset of falls. The early natural history of falls and emerging risk factors is, however, poorly understood.

Responding to these concerns we reported on risk factors for falls in a cohort of falls-naïve, newly diagnosed people with PD. We assessed falls over 36 months from diagnosis using monthly falls diaries alongside a comprehensive battery of motor, cognitive and clinical measures. Slow gait speed, decreased stance time and Hoehn and Yahr III emerged as significant baseline predictors with 92% sensitivity and 62% specificity. Risk of falling was almost eight times higher for people presenting with these characteristics. Cognition did not feature as a risk factor despite recent evidence supporting a clear role in falls prediction and in promoting effective falls intervention programmes possibly because the level of cognitive impairment did not reach a threshold of effect.

We now extend these findings by taking a more nuanced and detailed approach to the data. Previous research has identified the need for personalised fall prevention strategies, but until the drivers of falls (both primary and secondary features) are more fully understood this is difficult to achieve. Characteristics that identify falls risk may differ for established and new fallers, and also influence fall frequency and the circumstances in which falls occur. In this study, we document evolution of falls over 54 months from diagnosis in an incident cohort of PD. We examine baseline characteristics of emergent fallers and non-fallers over 54 months to identify features that precipitate and alternatively protect from falls. We identify baseline features that discriminate fallers from falls-naïve at 54 months from diagnosis; identify protective features in people who remain falls-naïve; explore baseline differences in falls risk in single versus recurrent falls; and explore the impact of a previous fall on fall risk characteristics.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^114Gyt4P]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Cervical musculoskeletal impairments — physical therapists should examine the cervical and thoracic spines for potential sources of musculoskeletal dysfunction for patients who have experienced a concussive event with reports of symptoms such as neck pain, headache, dizziness, fatigue, balance problems, or difficulty with visually focusing on a target, and recommended tests include range of motion, muscle strength and endurance, tenderness to palpation of cervical and scapulothoracic muscles, passive cervical and thoracic spine joint mobility, and joint position error testing; physical therapists may also examine the cervical spine, thoracic spine, and temporomandibular region in patients who do not report the listed symptoms to determine whether subtle impairments are present and may be contributing to symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^113EtkmY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — falls risk and screening summarizes that symptomatic dizziness confers a 12-fold increase in the risk for falls and that among community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years, 1 in 3 falls each year, with U.S. fall costs estimated to exceed $20 billion annually. Across studies of fall etiology, dizziness and vertigo were the primary etiology 13% of the time compared with balance and gait problems 17% and person-environment interactions 31%. In a geriatric referral series, 9% had undiagnosed BPPV and three-fourths of those with BPPV had fallen within the 3 months prior to referral. Accordingly, evaluation of patients with a diagnosis of BPPV should include an assessment of risk for falls, and elderly patients will be more statistically at risk for falls with BPPV. An initial falls risk screening might start with questions such as those suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2015: (1) Have you had a fall in the past year? How many times? Were you injured? (2) Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking? (3) Do you worry about falling? A positive response to questions such as these might then prompt the clinician to conduct a more detailed falls risk assessment or refer to a clinician who can use tools such as the Get Up and Go test, Tinetti Balance Assessment, Berg Balance Scale, or others.

### Screening for cognitive impairment in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111kXCVA]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Response to public comment — interpretation of the I statement and clinician vigilance were clarified. The USPSTF states that its statement is a conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment and is neither a recommendation for nor against screening, and clarifies that although there may be reasons to identify cognitive impairment early, none of the potential benefits in Practice Considerations have been clearly demonstrated in controlled trials; the USPSTF also notes that clinicians should remain alert to early signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment.

### Parkinson disease… [^115U11L5]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of Parkinson disease is clinical, and key features include bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. The most common presenting symptom in Parkinson disease is a unilateral resting tremor, often localized to the distal muscles of the hand, causing a pill-rolling motion. Some patients note an internal tremulousness sensation before the manifestation of the pill-rolling tremor. The main diagnostic signs of Parkinson disease are motor symptoms; however, nonmotor symptoms are also common and debilitating. Nonmotor symptoms that often present before motor symptoms include rapid eye movement sleep disorder, depression, constipation, fatigue, and olfactory dysfunction. A large survey of patients with Parkinson disease found that almost all patients reported nonmotor symptoms, with psychiatric symptoms occurring most often.

6 Associated nonmotor symptoms that can occur later in the disease can include autonomic dysfunction such as orthostatic hypotension and urinary dysfunction, which can impact quality-of-life and level-of-care issues for patients. Some nonmotor symptoms such as dementia and psychosis occur with advanced Parkinson disease but are notably debilitating. A physical examination should include assessment for decreased spontaneous or uncontrollable movements, tremors, or flat or masked facial expressions. A gait examination should assess for shuffling gait, stooped posture, en bloc turns, freezing, or postural instability. Bradykinesia, or the overall slowing of movement, includes decreased manual dexterity, shuffling steps, freezing gait, and festinating gait. Misdiagnosis often occurs because of the multiple symptoms associated with Parkinson disease and the notable clinical overlap with other diseases.

Careful examination of the tremor can differentiate between Parkinson disease and other causes. Whole hand tremor is usually an essential tremor or it can be attributed to cerebellar causes. Features supporting a diagnosis of Parkinson disease are asymmetric clinical motor presentation, gradual onset, and bradykinesia. Pharmacologic Treatment INITIAL DRUG THERAPY SELECTION FOR MOTOR SYMPTOMS Guidelines recommend treating motor symptoms when they impact the functions of daily life or decrease quality of life. Continuous use may lead to more off periods, during which Parkinson disease symptoms return because of low dopamine levels, and decreased medication effectiveness per dosing interval. 14–16, 20, 21 Patients with Parkinson disease can experience dystonia or pain from lack of levodopa or dyskinesias caused by levodopa administration.

### Mental health issues and psychological factors in athletes: detection, management, effect on performance, and prevention: American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^114hao1N]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Anxiety management in athletes — medications and psychotherapy: Some psychotropic medications may be used to treat anxiety in athletes, but caution is noted regarding potential negative impact on athletic performance, potential athletic performance-enhancing effects, and safety risks. The use of SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, is recommended for athletes. In general, as-needed anxiolytics are not recommended for athletic performance anxiety. Beta-blockers can be either performance enhancing or performance inhibiting and have been banned in various Olympic sports because of their ability to improve fine motor control. In a membership survey, the most commonly prescribed medication for anxiety by sport psychiatrists was the SSRI escitalopram, and members previously reported that they avoided benzodiazepines because of sedation, dependence, impaired reflexes and balance, and cognitive impairment. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the primary nonpharmacological intervention; although there are no randomized controlled trials of CBT specifically within athletes, CBT is well established as an effective treatment in other clinical populations. CBT interventions generally include cognitive interventions and exposure to the anxiety stimuli and should be delivered by a qualified CBT clinician with experience with athlete populations; additional adjunctive treatments such as exercise, sleep management, mindfulness training, and diet change may also be considered.

### Vestibular assessment: a practical approach [^1141ejLA]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This paper presents an evidence-based introduction to assessing and managing the dizzy patient. It is based upon a literature review highlighting current best practice and the clinical experience of the author. Dizziness is common, often chronic and largely untreated, resulting in great personal and economic loss. Serious pathological causes of dizziness may be quickly and effectively screened by a simple ocular motor examination, differentiating these from peripheral vestibular lesions. A triage, differentiating dizziness into either acute onset, intermittent episodes or continuous symptoms is proposed, along with management strategies for the commonest causes of dizziness. Vestibular suppressant medication should be restricted to the acute phase of a vestibular episode. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is the most effective treatment for continuous or chronic dizziness.

### Dexamethasone treatment in patients with brain metastases and primary brain tumors: do the benefits outweigh the side-effects? [^112DJcvb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

In order to minimize neurological symptoms and treatment-related side-effects, patients with primary or secondary brain tumors receive dexamethasone. The goal of this study was to analyze dosage and duration of dexamethasone intake and to compare the advantages and disadvantages of this medication during the course of radiation therapy (RT). Data from 138 consecutive patients were therefore analyzed retrospectively. During the course of therapy, the dosage of dexamethasone was evaluated, as were the indications for and duration of this treatment, its side-effects and any clinical changes reported during dexamethasone intake. The dosage of dexamethasone was higher at the outset and during RT (median 7–12 mg/day) than at the end of RT (median 1–6 mg/day). The average duration of dexamethasone intake was 23 weeks for patients with primary, and 7 weeks for patients with secondary brain tumors. The most frequent side-effects were a rise in serum glucose level, peripheral edema, psychiatric disorders, and Cushing's syndrome. Life-threatening complications remained rare. Initially, dexamethasone led to good clinical improvement with few side-effects of RT, whereas by the end of RT the symptom relief was slight and toxicity increased. In a group of 13 patients who received no dexamethasone during RT, 12 showed neither RT-related side-effects nor of neurological impairment. Dexamethasone effectively minimizes neurological symptoms and RT-related side-effects in patients with primary and secondary brain tumors. Nevertheless, the side-effects of dexamethasone itself increase over time. For this reason, a generalized dose scheme should not be used. Instead, dosage should be adapted to each patient's individual needs. Future prospective studies will have to determine whether dexamethasone is advantageous on balance or not.

### Can vestibular rehabilitation exercises help patients with concussion? A systematic review of efficacy, prescription and progression patterns [^112ZhbgX]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Concussion symptoms normally resolve within 7–10days but vertigo, dizziness and balance dysfunction persist in 10–30% of cases causing significant morbidity. This study systematically evaluated the evidence supporting the efficacy, prescription and progression patterns of vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) in patients with concussion.

Design

Systematic Review, guided by PRISMA guidelines and presenting a best evidence synthesis.

Data Sources

Electronic databases PubMed (1949 to May 2015), CINAHL (1982 to May 2015), EMBASE (1947 to May 2015), SPORTDiscus (1985 to May 2015), Web of Science (1945 to May 2015) and PEDRO (1999 to May 2015), supplemented by manual searches and grey literature.

Eligibility Criteria For Study Selection

Article or abstract of original research, population of patients with concussion/mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) with vestibular symptoms, interventions detailing VRT, measurement of outcomes pre-VRT/post-VRT. Study type was not specified.

Results

Following a double review of abstract and full-text articles, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria: randomised controlled trial (n = 2), uncontrolled studies (n = 3) and case studies (n = 5). 4 studies evaluated VRT as a single intervention. 6 studies incorporated VRT in multimodal interventions (including manual therapy, strength training, occupational tasks, counselling or medication). 9 studies reported improvement in outcomes but level I evidence from only 1 study was found that demonstrated increased rates (OR 3.91; 95% CI 1.34 to 11.34; p = 0.002) of medical clearance for return to sport within 8weeks, when VRT (combined with cervical therapy) was compared with usual care. Heterogeneity in study type and outcomes precluded meta-analysis. Habituation and adaptation exercises were employed in 8 studies and balance exercises in 9 studies. Prescription and progression patterns lacked standardisation.

Conclusions

Current evidence for optimal prescription and efficacy of VRT in patients with mTBI/concussion is limited. Available evidence, although weak, shows promise in this population. Further high-level studies evaluating the effects of VRT in patients with mTBI/concussion with vestibular and/or balance dysfunction are required.
