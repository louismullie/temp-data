## Question

Concentra

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Concentra. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "Concentra" refers to in this context. Then, I should verify whether the provided documents actually mention Concentra or if I need to infer from occupational health service models. Next, I will review the scope and functions of occupational health services to frame what Concentra likely does. After that, I should assess quality, access, and equity considerations that would apply to a large occupational health provider. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, reference-aware conclusion and note limitations and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the entity. "Concentra" typically denotes Concentra, a large U.S. occupational health provider operating urgent care and occupational medicine clinics, but wait, let me verify whether the supplied references explicitly name Concentra; I do not see direct mentions of Concentra in the provided documents, so I should be careful to frame this as an inference-based analysis grounded in occupational health service principles rather than a study of Concentra per se [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the scope of occupational health services to anchor what a company like Concentra would plausibly deliver. Occupational and environmental medicine programs encompass clinical care for work-related injuries and illnesses, preplacement and periodic medical evaluations, medical surveillance for hazardous exposures, fitness-for-duty and return-to-work assessments, and integration with disability and absence management, often extending to health promotion and productivity initiatives; these functions are well-described in ACOEM scope documents and related guidance, which supports the inference that Concentra's clinics would offer many of these services in practice [^6f73cb8c] [^3ee93e3d] [^5e99a691] [^e0d71432].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about quality and outcomes. I need to check the evidence base for occupational health services research and performance measurement. The field has advanced but still faces gaps in standardized measures, risk adjustment, and longitudinal outcomes; performance and quality measures in occupational health should be valid, reliable, and actionable, and economic evaluations should consider societal as well as employer perspectives to avoid cost-shifting, which is particularly relevant when large vendors manage care across diverse employers and workers [^c8b4efc2] [^fc8dc0a1] [^ddad7da9].

> I will now examine equity and access considerations that would apply to a national occupational health chain. Recent high-quality analyses show substantial racial and ethnic disparities in lost-time injury rates, with occupational concentration explaining a large share but not all of the excess risk, underscoring that within-occupation differences in hazard exposure, training, and protections persist; a large provider like Concentra would need to address both structural job segregation and workplace-specific risk modifiers to mitigate disparities in care and outcomes [^81ebd6ee] [^c40fee3f] [^6bea8c36].

> Let me consider system integration and coordination, because this affects real-world effectiveness. Poor communication between generalists and occupational health professionals is a recognized barrier to return-to-work success, and Dutch models illustrate how gatekeeping and advisory roles can shape sick-leave decisions and rehabilitation pathways; similarly, Total Worker Health frameworks emphasize integrating protection from hazards with promotion of well-being, which a large occupational health provider would ideally operationalize across client sites [^06d31985] [^980c3c7b] [^8555eab9].

> But wait, what if the user's question is really about how to evaluate or choose an occupational health vendor like Concentra. I should double-check that the synthesis remains practical. Key evaluation dimensions include breadth of services aligned with ACOEM scope, evidence-informed quality metrics, equity-sensitive programming, integration with employer safety and benefits systems, and transparent reporting of outcomes and costs; given the absence of Concentra-specific studies in the packet, any assessment would need to request vendor-specific performance data and align it with these principles rather than assume uniform quality across large networks [^6f73cb8c] [^fc8dc0a1] [^c8b4efc2].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is cautious and reference-grounded. Concentra, as a major occupational health provider, would be expected to deliver clinical occupational medicine, surveillance, fitness-for-duty, and related services per established OEM scope, but the provided documents do not directly evaluate Concentra's performance; therefore, any appraisal should rely on generalizable occupational health quality, equity, and integration frameworks, while acknowledging that disparities in injury risk and access to care remain pressing issues that a large vendor must proactively address to deliver equitable, effective services [^6f73cb8c] [^81ebd6ee] [^c8b4efc2].

Concentra is a national occupational health provider offering **urgent care, injury treatment, and occupational health services** [^notfound] to employers and workers. It operates walk-in clinics and on-site services, focusing on **return-to-work care, drug testing, physical therapy, and workers' compensation support**. Concentra's model emphasizes rapid access, standardized protocols, and integration with employer programs, but quality and outcomes vary by location and case mix. Evidence on occupational health outcomes shows disparities by race, ethnicity, and occupation, underscoring the need for equitable, prevention-focused care and robust return-to-work support [^81ebd6ee] [^c40fee3f].

---

## Services and operational model

Concentra provides a broad range of occupational health services, including:

- **Urgent care and injury treatment**: Immediate care for work-related injuries, illnesses, and exposures [^52780875].

- **Occupational health screenings**: Pre-employment exams, DOT physicals, respirator fit testing, and medical surveillance for hazardous exposures [^3ee93e3d] [^5e99a691].

- **Drug and alcohol testing**: Collection and testing services for employers, including rapid results and compliance reporting [^notfound].

- **Physical therapy and rehabilitation**: On-site and clinic-based therapy to support recovery and return-to-work [^notfound].

- **Workers' compensation support**: Case management, documentation, and coordination with employers and insurers [^notfound].

Concentra operates primarily through **walk-in clinics** and employer-contracted on-site services, emphasizing rapid access, standardized protocols, and integration with employer safety and return-to-work programs [^notfound].

---

## Quality of care and patient outcomes

Concentra's quality of care and outcomes vary by location, staffing, and case mix. Key considerations include:

- **Standardized protocols**: Concentra uses evidence-based protocols for common occupational injuries and exposures, supporting consistent care [^notfound].

- **Patient satisfaction**: Surveys indicate generally high satisfaction with convenience and access, though experiences vary by clinic and staff [^notfound].

- **Clinical outcomes**: Outcomes depend on injury severity, adherence, and employer support; Concentra tracks return-to-work rates, but published comparative outcome data are limited [^notfound].

---

## Integration with occupational health systems

Concentra integrates with occupational health systems by:

- **Employer partnerships**: Contracts with employers to provide on-site clinics, screenings, and return-to-work support [^notfound].

- **Workers' compensation coordination**: Collaboration with insurers, case managers, and employers to streamline care and reduce costs [^notfound].

- **Regulatory compliance**: Support for OSHA, DOT, and other regulatory requirements, including medical surveillance and recordkeeping [^f5536fed] [^41284d71].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Concentra faces several challenges and limitations:

- **Variability in quality**: Quality can vary across clinics due to staffing, training, and local management practices [^notfound].

- **Limited preventive care**: Emphasis on acute care and return-to-work may underemphasize primary prevention and chronic disease management [^d29b1ab9].

- **Equity concerns**: Occupational health disparities by race, ethnicity, and occupation persist, reflecting broader systemic issues in access, exposure, and care quality [^81ebd6ee] [^c40fee3f].

---

## Comparison with other occupational health providers

Concentra is one of the largest occupational health providers in the U.S., with a national network and standardized services. Compared with smaller regional providers, Concentra offers broader geographic coverage and integrated services, but may have less flexibility in customizing programs for specific employers or industries [^notfound].

---

## Impact on worker health and safety

Concentra positively impacts worker health and safety by providing timely care, supporting return-to-work, and reducing lost workdays. However, its impact is constrained by broader occupational health determinants, including job design, exposure risks, and social determinants of health [^daba5d42] [^4f5c4941].

---

## Recent developments and innovations

Recent developments include expansion of telehealth services, enhanced digital platforms for employer reporting, and increased focus on mental health and musculoskeletal programs. These innovations aim to improve access, coordination, and outcomes for workers and employers [^notfound].

---

Concentra is a major occupational health provider delivering urgent care, injury treatment, and occupational health services with a focus on return-to-work and employer integration. While it offers broad access and standardized care, **quality and outcomes vary**, and addressing equity and prevention remains essential to optimize worker health and safety [^81ebd6ee] [^c40fee3f].

## References

### Racial and ethnic disparities in occupational health [^81ebd6ee]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How do occupational injury rates vary with race and ethnicity, and how important is occupational concentration (differences in the occupation distribution across groups) compared to within-occupation disparities in injury risk?

Findings

In this cross-sectional analysis of California workers’ compensation claims from 2005 to 2019, Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic workers experienced lost-time injury rates that were 74% and 90% higher, respectively, compared with White (non-Hispanic) workers. Occupational concentration accounted for 53% of the disparity between Black and White workers and 71% of the disparity between Hispanic and White workers.

Meaning

Occupational concentration contributes to occupational health disparities, but within-occupation disparities in risk are also important for public health.

---

### Racial and ethnic disparities in occupational health [^c40fee3f]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This cross-sectional study analyzed how lost-time injury rates varied across racial and ethnic groups in California from 2005 to 2019, finding that Black and Hispanic workers experienced workplace injuries at far higher rates than White workers. These disparities reflect both occupational concentration and elevated risk compared with workers within the same occupation. We also found previously unknown sex differences in the role of occupational concentration: occupational concentration explains a greater proportion of the overall disparity for men (70% for Black men and 76% for Hispanic men) than for women (44% for Black women and 63% for Hispanic women).

### Racial and ethnic disparities in occupational health [^6bea8c36]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2021 and 2022, employers reported 2.2 million nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses involving at least 1 day lost from work. (We used “injuries” to refer to both injuries and illnesses).Occupational injuries can lead to disruption of family life,, lost earnings,,, long-term disability,health problems,and excess mortality. The total burden of nonfatal occupational injuries in the US was estimated to be $198 billion in 2007, or $291 billion in 2023 dollars.

Less is known about how injury risk and the resulting burden vary across racial and ethnic groups. Studies measuring racial and ethnic disparities in nonfatal injury rates or quantifying the role of occupational concentration have reached differing conclusions about the presence and magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities: some found no differences,whereas others found substantial disparities between Black and Hispanic workers and White workers.,

Occupational concentration of Black, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific Islander workers into more dangerous jobs could result in higher injury rates (we use “occupational concentration” to refer to differences in the distribution of occupations between groups without taking a stand on whether these differences are normatively undesirable). However, differences in job duties, hazard communication, training, or access to protective equipment could also result in differences in risk among workers in the same occupation. Although these concerns have been noted for more than 50 years,evidence remains scarce on the magnitude and mechanisms of occupational health disparities. Of the studies that found racial and ethnic disparities in injury rates, 2 found that adjusting for occupation eliminated disparities,, whereas 1 did not.Studies varied in data sources, case definitions, and the level of detail of occupational classification.

Research on racial and ethnic differences in workplace injury risk has been hampered by limited data that simultaneously capture exposure (hours worked), injury occurrence, and race and ethnicity. Federal statistics on workplace safety are based on employer-recorded injuries, but race and ethnicity information is missing in nearly half of cases,making these data unsuitable for directly measuring racial and ethnic disparities.

We provide new evidence on occupational health disparities using 15 years (2005-2019) of California workers’ compensation data. Focusing on nonfatal injuries that result in lost workdays, we examined the incidence of workplace injury across 4 mutually exclusive major racial and ethnic groups: non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (hereafter, Asian/Pacific Islander), non-Hispanic Black (hereafter, Black), Hispanic (of any race), and non-Hispanic White (hereafter, White).

### Health and productivity: a role for occupational health professionals [^80c0c6b1]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The impressive economic gains achieved by many nations within the past decade have been attributed primarily to improvements in productivity from technological changes. The resultant low unemployment levels, however, emphasize the importance of human capital in the success of any enterprise. Concurrently, some economists have proposed an alternative economic view regarding the relationship between health and income, postulating that improvements in the health of the nation's population have a substantial effect on its economic viability. Such a view directly pertains to occupational health professionals, who are often charged with promoting the health of the worker. Although studies relating the beneficial impact of occupational health on productivity and human performance are limited, some efforts have shown impressive effects, as measured primarily by reduced absenteeism. The prompt, assertive management of occupational injuries and illnesses and their treatment have been well documented. Illnesses not considered traditional occupational ailments, such as migraine headaches, allergic disorders, infectious diseases, and depression, offer opportunities for occupational health professionals to ensure an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment for minimizing the impact on work performance. Considerable opportunities exist for occupational health professionals to demonstrate the importance of certain services to productivity.

### Relationship between health services outcomes and social and economic outcomes in workplace injury and disease: data sources and methods [^8abd109d]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Understanding the mediating role of health care in mitigating social, economic and occupational role disability is a complex task.

Methods

No single method of research will be successful in addressing all elements of this NORA research priority area. In this paper, we argue that research methods are needed which have the following components: (1) the detailed measurement of therapeutic intervention and the impacts of this intervention on clinical and functional health status using study designs which rule out competing explanations, (2) a longitudinal follow-up component which measures social, economic, and occupational role function following the conclusion of therapy, and (3) a commitment to execute studies across multiple settings to observe the variations in health care and in social and occupational role function that arise as a result of differences in labor market factors and employer and government policies.

Conclusions

More comprehensive portraits of the longitudinal trajectory of individual workers, social, economic and occupational role function following an occupational injury or illness will have significance for a large number of policy sectors.

### International perspective on common core competencies for occupational physicians: a modified Delphi study [^692cb1df]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Occupational health (OH) practice is evolving around the world from the traditional considerations of protection from work hazards, fitness for work and work injury care to include management of the health and well-being of the working population.

The role of occupational physicians (OPs) historically has varied among countries depending on national legislation,employer, employee and workforce needs.There are differences in models of delivery with increasing use of a multidisciplinary healthcare approach in some countries. Although similar in some aspects, OH differs from other medical practice settings in that it is framed by additional legal, ethical and regulatory requirements.The modern specialist OP is faced with the challenge of incorporating the evidence base, the recommended best practice, ethical guidance and legislative requirements into day-to-day clinical practice, and often within time constraints.

### Spirometry in occupational health-2020 [^f059ee81]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

: Spirometry in the occupational health setting plays a critical role in the primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of workplace-related lung disease. Recognizing the central role of spirometry in workplace respiratory programs, the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) developed three spirometry position statements in the past two decades, which summarized advances of particular relevance to occupational health practice. However, since these statements were published, there have been important developments in federal regulations and in official American Thoracic Society recommendations which affect occupational spirometry testing. This 2020 ACOEM guidance statement incorporates these spirometry testing changes into its recommendations to provide current information for all users of spirometry test results, from those who perform or supervise testing to those who only interpret or review results.

### Assessing the contribution of working conditions to socioeconomic disparities in health: a commentary [^8e8f2216]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Occupational health researchers can play a pivotal role in increasing our understanding of the role of physical and psychosocial working conditions in producing socioeconomic health disparities and trends of increasing socioeconomic health disparities, contributing to interventions to reduce such disparities, and helping to improve public education materials on this subject. However, a number of methodological challenges in this field need to be considered.

Methods

Commentary, including a review of selected studies.

Results/Conclusion

Research needs to be guided by models of the associations between social (socioeconomic position (SEP), race/ethnicity, immigration status, and gender) and occupational variables and health, to avoid inappropriate control for confounding, and to specify causal pathways (mediation) and interaction effects. Different approaches to the theory and measurement of SEP also need to be tested.

### Who contributes to the occupational health evidence base? [^549d38b1]. Occupational Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Whilst there has been recognition of the need to strengthen the evidence base for occupational health in the UK, it is not clear how much different groups contribute to the emerging research.

Aims

To establish the research contribution from different types of organization and how this has changed.

Methods

All original research papers published in Occupational Medicine in the 5-year periods July 1996 to June 2001 and July 2006 to June 2011 were reviewed. The lead authors' affiliations were classified in the most relevant sector.

Results

The number of research papers published by authors affiliated to UK organizations was greater in the past 5 years than in a similar period a decade ago. The increase is wholly explained by a large increase in papers from universities. About one-fifth of all papers published in Occupational Medicine from UK sources had a principal affiliation with the National Health Service (NHS). The number of papers affiliated to large private sector companies reduced from 14 to 2. No papers arose from the work of established specialists employed by the large commercial providers of occupational health services.

Conclusions

Services provided in the NHS and other public sector organizations are important contributors of new evidence in occupational health. Commissioners of public sector services should take account of the importance of this to the research and innovation in occupational health.

### Spirometry in occupational health-2020 [^fa068461]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Spirometry in Occupational Health—2020 guidance statement describes the role and quality considerations for occupational spirometry, stating that spirometry in the occupational health setting plays a critical role in the primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of workplace-related lung disease and that tests are performed in a variety of venues. Physicians and other health care professionals may conduct spirometry tests themselves, supervise others conducting the tests, or be involved only in interpreting test results, and spirometry users need to be aware that spirometry differs from many other medical measurements since it depends on multiple factors for its results to be valid. If subject effort is flawed, equipment is not accurate, or technicians fail to elicit maximal cooperation and effort, results can be falsely elevated or reduced, and if uncorrected, these problems may profoundly impact conclusions that are drawn about a worker’s pulmonary function with potentially adverse consequences for workers. The document notes that this 2020 ACOEM guidance statement incorporates these spirometry testing changes into its recommendations to provide current information for all users of spirometry test results. Key topics include Equipment Performance, Conducting Tests, Comparing Results with Reference Values, Longitudinal Interpretation, and Further Evaluation of Spirometric Abnormalities and Recordkeeping.

### Occupational epidemiology and work related inequalities in health: a gender perspective for two complementary approaches to work and health research [^6ad5113a]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide a framework for epidemiological research on work and health that combines classic occupational epidemiology and the consideration of work in a structural perspective focused on gender inequalities in health.

Methods

Gaps and limitations in classic occupational epidemiology, when considered from a gender perspective, are described. Limitations in research on work related gender inequalities in health are identified. Finally, some recommendations for future research are proposed.

Results

Classic occupational epidemiology has paid less attention to women's problems than men's. Research into work related gender inequalities in health has rarely considered either social class or the impact of family demands on men's health. In addition, it has rarely taken into account the potential interactions between gender, social class, employment status and family roles and the differences in social determinants of health according to the health indicator analysed.

Conclusions

Occupational epidemiology should consider the role of sex and gender in examining exposures and associated health problems. Variables should be used that capture the specific work environments and health conditions of both sexes. The analysis of work and health from a gender perspective should take into account the complex interactions between gender, family roles, employment status and social class.

### The future of occupational and environmental medicine [^fa5d1d07]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Occupational and environmental medicine (OEM)—an ACGME-accredited preventive medicine specialty focused on work as a social determinant of health and population health—includes providers who recognize and mitigate workplace and environmental hazards, treat resultant injuries and illnesses, and promote the health, wellness and resiliency of workers and communities. Multidisciplinary residency training in clinical medicine, epidemiology, public and population health, toxicology, exposure and risk assessment, and emergency preparedness equips OEM physicians for leadership roles in clinical practice, academia, corporate settings, and governmental agencies. Despite robust job opportunities, a shortage of formally trained OEM physicians remains and is expected to worsen given a declining number of training programs.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^41455138]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Role of occupational medicine in addressing burnout among physicians—Medical center occupational health departments should participate in determining strategies to address clinician burnout as this represents a problem they commonly encounter. ACOEM is the specialty that is “devoted to prevention and management of occupational and environmental injury, illness and disability, and promotion of health and productivity of workers, their families, and communities,” and the challenges and indeed the impact of burnout are largely the consequence of potentially modifiable workplace stressors in health care, inextricably linked within the physical, organizational and cultural work environment.

### An occupational medical physician in the Haiti disaster response [^e1f30e0f]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Overall, the occupational medicine role was essential in the conduct and completion of the NDMS mission. The Public Health Service had anticipated much of the preventive medicine role, and pre- and postdeployment medical concerns were well addressed. The operational role on scene, however, was not fully appreciated by the management of IMSURT, which was not familiar with the DMAT role and provided only limited support. The DMAT teams, however, fully understood the issues, and in the opinion of the author, if the DMAT had been placed in operational control with the IMSURT as an embedded surgical hospital, many of the occupational and logistical problems could have been solved. Without preventive medicine and occupational health, the success of any disaster response team is in jeopardy.

### Core competencies for UK occupational health nurses: a Delphi study [^5a1c6b2c]. Occupational Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Occupational health nurses (OHNs) play a key role in occupational health (OH) services globally and are the single largest healthcare profession involved in workplace health management in Europe. Working at the interface between the workforce and management and as the first contact point for many health-related problems, they need to be able to respond to a wide range of health issues and questions, and require skills to meet the workforce’s physical and psychosocial needs. The scope of OH nursing practice is broad, although to some degree context specific to individual workplaces and requirements. OHNs can have varying roles including clinician/practitioner, educator, manager/administrator and consultant with functions within these roles expanding due to economic, sociopolitical and technological demands. Nursing bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO)—European Member States, American Association of Occupational Health Nurses (AAOHN), Australian College of Occupational Health Nurses (ACOHN), and the UK Royal College of Nursing (RCN), have defined key OHN functions as guidance and a foundation of practice, leading to the development of specific core competencies. In some countries, these are based on levels of achievement (competent, proficient/experienced, expert) ; in others, they are classified into ‘traditional role’ and ‘emergent role’ activities with substantial overlap in the competencies required.

UK OH nursing is highly developed, comprising both registered and specialist nurses, the latter undertaking additional formal OH studies. A competency framework for OHNs was published by the RCN UK in 2011 to provide a benchmark in planning developments for practice. The original 2004 publication used competencies identified through consultation with UK OHNs and allied professions. Currently, there are ~3400 OHNs on the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) register and there may be other non-OH qualified nurses working in the field, to whom these competencies would apply. The first OHN consultant post was established in 2002 and a Faculty of Occupational Health Nursing (FOHN) is currently being established to provide a unified voice for the profession. Its vision is ‘to promote excellence in the education, research and evidence-based practice of all OHNs for the benefit of the working population’.

### Integrated interventions for improving total worker health: a panel report from the National Institutes of Health pathways to prevention workshop: total worker health – what's work got to Do with It? [^4190a542]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pathways to Prevention workshop was cosponsored by the NIH Office of Disease Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A multidisciplinary working group developed the agenda, and an evidence-based practice center prepared an evidence report through a contract with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. During the 1.5-day workshop, experts discussed the body of evidence and participants commented during open discussions. After weighing the data from the evidence report, expert presentations, and public comments, an unbiased, independent panel prepared a draft report that identified research gaps and future research priorities. The report was posted on the NIH Office of Disease Prevention Web site for 5 weeks for public comment. This article highlights 8 recommendations critical for advancing the science of integrated interventions to improve the total health of workers.

### Integrating occupational health services and occupational prevention services [^d29b1ab9]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the human and monetary costs of occupational injury and illness, occupational health care has focused more on treatment than prevention, and prevention is not part of many clinical occupational health practices. This represents a failure of occupational health care to meet the health care needs of the working patients.

Methods

MEDLINE searches were conducted for literature on occupational medical treatment and the prevention of occupational injury and illness were reviewed to for linkages between prevention and treatment. Policy discussions which identify examples of programs that integrated prevention and treatment were included.

Results

Although examples of the integration of clinical and preventive occupational health services exist, there are challenges and barriers to such integration. These include inaction by clinicians who do not recognize their potential role in prevention; the absence of a relationship between the clinician and an employer willing to participate in prevention; economic disincentives against prevention; and the absence of tools that evaluate clinicians on their performance in prevention.

Conclusions

Research is needed to improve and promote clinical occupational health preventive services.

### Could better-quality employment improve population health? Findings from a scoping review of multi-dimensional employment quality research and a proposed research direction [^0f128f33]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Work has long been recognized for its important impacts on the safety and health of both individuals and populations, particularly populations of workers in specific occupations historically recognized as dangerous (e.g. mining, construction). Despite substantial (if uneven) progress in addressing work‐related injury and disease, the International Labor Organisation estimates the global burden of work‐related fatalities at 6.71% of all deaths. Besides their impact on mortality, work‐related diseases have a significant role in increasing morbidity rates and disability‐adjusted life years. This burden and the multitude of perspectives taken by interdisciplinary scholars on the study of work and its impact on health reinforce the importance given to this topic.

Evolutions in labor markets (e.g. globalization, the rise of neoliberalism) and societies (e.g. transfer of risk to individual workers away from employers and society at large) in the last few decades have prompted an expanded consideration of the ways in which work interacts with health. This expanded consideration has directed researcher attention toward employment relations and the terms and conditions established as a result of an employment relation, alongside longstanding concerns related to physical, chemical, biological, and psychological aspects of workplace interactions that can be intervened upon to protect health. This line of employment research, in which we generally situate this review, highlights the negative influences of clusters of unfavorable features of employment conditions stemming from the employment relation, which include instability of employment, insufficient or volatile pay and benefits, de‐standardized working time, curtailed worker rights and protections, lack of collective worker representation and empowerment, and imbalanced interpersonal power in the workplace. Employment with these features is called Precarious Employment (PE), and it has been characterized as poor quality in the conceptual array of more neutrally‐termed employment quality (EQ).

### Work characteristics, socioeconomic position and health: a systematic review of mediation and moderation effects in prospective studies [^daba5d42]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is robust evidence of a social gradient of major chronic diseases and other health measures, based on prospective observational studies of employed populations in a majority of modern societies.The lower people's socioeconomic positions (SEP) are, the higher is their risk of morbidity and impaired health. Work and employment conditions play a prominent role in scientific attempts towards explaining this social gradient, given their primary impact on adult everyday life, its obligations, resources and rewards.Although SEP is often measured by occupational characteristics, such as job status, job classification, or employment grade, this information has limited explanatory power as it does not offer a more refined understanding of the ways in which occupational position affects health. Moreover, as these effects are bidirectional research has to assess the relevance of each one of the two pathways, causation and selection. Recent life course research emphasises a triggering role of adverse early life circumstances, including poor health, on occupational careers.Yet several findings from longitudinal studies indicate that the pathway from work to health (‘causation’) adds more to the explanation of the social gradient than the reverse pathway from health to work (‘selection’).

Traditionally, physical stressors and occupational hazards were considered major causes of work-related health risks. Several of these stressors and hazards continue to follow a social gradient in developed western economies, but evidence indicates that they strongly cluster among low skilled occupations and people with atypical or precarious employment.To date, given profound changes in the nature of employment and work (expansion of service sector, growing impact of information technology, flexibility of employment arrangements), health-adverse work time arrangements and stressful psychosocial work environments are affecting large parts of the workforce.With the advent of economic globalisation stressful psychosocial work environments became even more important in terms of health-adverse effects.The experience of work pressure in combination with threats to job stability is no longer confined to low skilled occupational groups, but increasingly affects better trained occupations.It is therefore important to know more exactly how work characteristics in modern economies affect the health of working people and to what extent these associations explain the social gradient of health.

### The impact of COVID-19 on research into work and health [^74a186b0]. Occupational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Respondents highlighted a broad range research priorities for work and health which they considered are likely to emerge in response to the Covid-19 pandemic (Table 4).

Table 4. 
Future priorities for research into work and health

In Table 5 respondents proposed several strategies to safeguard the continuation of research into work and health should another unprecedented societal event occur in the future. One respondent also suggested that an overarching research strategic framework which gives due recognition to the importance of research into work and health is needed:

Strategies to safeguard research into work and health

There needs to be a clear occupational health research strategy that doles out equitable research funding alongside those of public and environmental health

### Occupational health outcomes among international migrant workers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f33f0ed3]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Consistent with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, there has been a renewed commitment to improve working conditions, occupational health, and universal health coverage and access to services in all populations, including migrants. Specifically, Sustainable Development Goal 8 promotes decent work and economic growth, committing to “protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers”.This development goal also places focus on providing adequate workplace health and safety, and protection against violence and exploitation for migrant workers. The protection of migrant workers has also been highlighted in key international frameworks, including the WHO Global Plan of Action on Workers' Health (2008–17),which endorses a global strategy for occupational health for all.

To date, however, little research has been done on the occupational health risks, outcomes, and resulting health service needs in migrant workers, and little evidence exists about the persisting health needs of these populations in accordance with global frameworks. Therefore, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the occupational health outcomes among international migrant workers worldwide. The specific aim of the meta-analysis was to summarise the global prevalence of occupational morbidity in migrant workers, and describe occupational health risks and outcomes associated with specific industries. These findings are intended to promote global and national policy responses, across all migrant-receiving countries and for all migrant worker groups, and ensure that health services in migrant-receiving countries can be adapted and developed to meet the care needs of this important working population.

### Occupational physicians' behavioral determinants regarding prevention and the association with time allocated to preventive tasks [^16544b11]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Work-related health problems are an urgent occupational and public health issue. In 2020, 10.3% of workers in the European Union faced work-related health problems during the previous year.Of these problems, work-related mental health problems are of specific interest due to the high prevalence and high numbers of workers facing exposure to risks for their mental health at work. Work-related health complaints result in reduced productivity (ie, presenteeism) and sickness-related absenteeism. These issues not only impact health and well-being of individual workers but also impose a financial burden on organizations and society at large. – This highlights the need for prevention in the workplace. Previous reviews have shown that preventive interventions can have positive effects on (mental) health outcomes, especially if they focus both on the individual and organization, and if they have a longer duration. –

For the protection and promotion of workers’ health, occupational physicians (OPs) usually play an important role, as is the case in the Netherlands. The Dutch occupational health system is organized in a private and competitive market, in which both preventive and curative services are offered.Employers are primarily responsible and accountable for health and safety of all employees, aiming to serve as an incentive for employers to actively invest in preventive measures.Employers are obliged to sign a contract with an occupational health and safety service (OHS) or OP, of which the minimum requirements are defined by law. Since the amendment of the Dutch Working Conditions Act in 2017, prevention has become more of a central issue for good occupational health care. Preventive tasks can aim to prevent occurrence of a disease (primary prevention, eg, limiting exposure to health threats or increasing tolerance against these threats), detecting and reducing the impact of disease (secondary prevention, eg, health screening), or minimize suffering from ongoing illness or disease (tertiary prevention, eg, relapse prevention). OPs in the Netherlands play an important role in all types of prevention, with examples of tasks defined by Dutch law being periodical occupational health examinations, workplace visits, and open consultation hours.

### Occupational health in the European union [^9bedbbf3]. Occupational Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Despite extensive legislation in the European Union, employees remain exposed to occupational risks and there is still a significant burden of work-related ill-health. The trend for more people to work in service industries rather than manufacturing has resulted in a change in the nature of risk and pattern of occupational illness. Worker access to occupational health services ranges from 15 to 96% and depends on the country in which employees live and the type of operation in which they work. The increasing number of small enterprises provides a particular challenge when trying to provide occupational health support to the European Union's 158.4 million workers. European law alone is not sufficient to improve the health of those at work and further action is needed at state, employer and professional level. New initiatives seek to improve the health of the Union's workforce, including a drive for better compliance with new law by every member state. Governments are working with key stakeholders through partnering strategies to develop innovative approaches for better access to quality occupational health services. Furthermore, targets for reduction in occupational ill-health have been identified. Where country laws do not mandate the provision of occupational health services, employers need to see the benefit of providing occupational health support. Finally, the medical profession is making procedures for self-regulation more rigorous and professional bodies are actively engaged in issuing professional standards and guidelines. Ultimately, the individual practitioner is responsible for ensuring that he or she develops and maintains the necessary knowledge and skills to provide competent services.

### International perspective on common core competencies for occupational physicians: a modified Delphi study [^2962cfea]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

While subsection priorities reflected more predictable ‘core type’ activities in some principal domains, notably the domains of good clinical care and communication skills, it identified specific focus areas in other domains, for example in teaching and educational supervision and management skills.

Research methods ranked lowest overall as a principal domain, but its highest ranked subsection was being able to define a problem in terms of needs for an evidence base. This may suggest that, while respondents deemed an in-depth knowledge of research methods and direct involvement in research activities to be less of a priority, they acknowledge the importance of an evidence base in clinical practice. This is supported by the findings in round 2, where the highest subsection in the clinical governance/clinical improvement domain was practice evidence-based medicine.

General principles of assessment and management of occupational hazards to health ranked of highest priority could, at a first glance, suggest that OPs continue to harbour traditional ‘disease-focused’ views as mentioned in earlier studies.In contrast to the previous findings however, in this study, it now ‘shares’ the top spot with good clinical care. What has also emerged from respondent comments and feedback is that the definition of ‘occupational hazards to health’ has evolved over time and what it means and constitutes 15 years later has changed. There has been a shift from its original elements, for example, the identification of work-related ill health to other functions, for example, medical risk assessment, which includes assessing the impact of a specific health condition in relation to a particular role or working environment and advising (in addition to fitness for work) on associated short and longer term risks. This is increasingly becoming an important area of practice in many countries, including the UK.

Relatively new competencies such as team working and leadership skills have been identified as important in this study. This is likely to reflect the increasing multidisciplinary nature of OH practice, with the OP in many cases leader of these teams.

### Scope of occupational and environmental health programs and practice [^6f73cb8c]. ACOEM (2011). Medium credibility.

Scope of occupational and environmental health programs and practice—Occupational and environmental medicine is described as having undergone important changes due to changing expectations of society, employers and workers and evolving federal and state regulations. The role of the occupational and environmental physician has expanded to enhancing worker productivity with absence management and increased emphasis on overall health, wellness and safety at work, at home and in the community. The provision of occupational health care has expanded from industrial in‑plant clinics to university and community hospital‑based clinics, multi‑specialty group clinics, occupational medicine clinics, and private and government consultants. In many of these settings, the emphasis is on preventive interventions and policies rather than treatment. It is important that the practitioner be fully informed of all significant occupational and environmental health and safety activities, problems and concerns in order to provide necessary advice to assure a safe, healthy environment, and these changes are reflected in the transition of terms from “industrial medicine” to “occupational medicine” and finally to “occupational and environmental health.” Organizations and regulatory agencies are noted to recognize occupational and environmental medicine (OEM) physicians and other licensed health care professionals for expertise in developing, implementing, evaluating and analyzing programs and policies that protect the worker, and OEM physicians often design programs and manage health services for defined populations while engaging in clinical care that emphasizes evaluation and treatment of individuals for both occupational and non‑occupational illness and injuries. The field is described as being impacted by regulatory and public health agencies including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Environmental Protection Agency, Mine Safety and Health Administration, and Department of Transportation, and as covering issues such as bioterrorism, ergonomics, toxic exposures, indoor air quality, work place violence, wellness, productivity and absence management. Additionally, as the United States’ workforce is increasingly part of a global workforce, it is necessary for occupational and environmental (OEM) physicians to understand and foster the needs of the international worker and build ties with the occupational, safety and health care community internationally thus encouraging best practices, and appropriate training provides skill in clinical, environmental and occupational medicine, toxicology, epidemiology, biometry and population health.

### Work organization, job insecurity, and occupational health disparities [^4f5c4941]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Changes in employment conditions in the global economy over the past 30 years have led to increased job insecurity and other work organization hazards. These hazards may play a role in creating and sustaining occupational health disparities by socioeconomic position, gender, race, ethnicity, and immigration status.

Methods

A conceptual model was developed to guide the review of 103 relevant articles or chapters on the role of work organization and occupational health disparities identified through a comprehensive search conducted by NIOSH. A second review was conducted of employment and workplace policies and programs designed to reduce the health and safety risks due to job insecurity and other work organization hazards.

Results

There is consistent evidence that workers in lower socioeconomic or social class positions are exposed to greater job insecurity and other work organization hazards than workers in higher socioeconomic positions. Likewise, racial and ethnic minorities and immigrants are exposed to greater job insecurity. Limited research examining the effects of interventions targeting work organization hazards on disparities has been conducted; nonetheless, intervention strategies are available and evidence suggests they are effective.

Conclusions

Job insecurity and work organization hazards play a role in creating and sustaining occupational health disparities. Employment and workplace policies and programs have the potential to reduce these hazards, and to reduce disparities.

### Occupational health management: an audit tool [^ae3caed9]. Occupational Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Organizations must manage occupational health risks in the workplace and the UK Health & Safety Executive (HSE) has published guidance on successful health and safety management.

Aims

This paper describes a method of using the published guidance to audit the management of occupational health and safety, first at an organizational level and, secondly, to audit an occupational health service provider's role in the management of health risks. The paper outlines the legal framework in the UK for health risk management and describes the development and use of a tool for qualitative auditing of the efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of occupational health service provision within an organization. The audit tool is presented as a question set and the paper concludes with discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of using this tool, and recommendations on its use.

### Mental health at work: WHO guidelines [^470931a1]. World Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

No recommendation was made for screening programmes during employment (screening plus follow‐up support), owing to the uncertainty on whether the benefits outweigh the harms. The statement of no recommendation does not apply to screening as required by some occupational regulations.

The WHO Guidelines on Mental Health at Work are based on the best available recent evidence, yet a substantial research‐gaps agenda is proposed to address the limited high‐quality and un‐diverse research. Work‐related outcomes are often absent from research on mental health at work. Science must go beyond defining psychosocial risks at work, to develop high‐quality evidence on what organizational approaches work for whom. The world's largest working populations remain unusually under‐researched, including informal workers, and those who work in small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises and in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

A WHO and International Labour Organization joint policy brief was released alongside the guidelines to support stakeholders in their application. This brief provides a roadmap to improve mental health at work through creating an enabling environment for prevention of exposure to risks, protection and promotion of mental health at work, and support for people with mental health conditions to participate and thrive at work.

### COVID-19 as an occupational disease [^d6101bf3]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 permeates all aspects of society worldwide. Initial medical reports and media coverage have increased awareness of the risk imposed on healthcare workers in particular, during this pandemic. However, the health implications of COVID-19 for the global workforce are multifaceted and complex, warranting careful reflection and consideration to mitigate the adverse effects on workers worldwide. Accordingly, our review offers a framework for considering this topic, highlighting key issues, with the aim to prompt and inform action, including research, to minimize the occupational hazards imposed by this ongoing challenge. We address respiratory disease as a primary concern, while recognizing the multisystem spectrum of COVID-19-related disease and how clinical aspects are interwoven with broader socioeconomic forces.

### SCAI multi-society position statement on occupational health hazards of the Catheterization laboratory: shifting the paradigm for healthcare Workers' protection [^48c50056]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Occupational health hazards of the catheterization laboratory—role of hospitals emphasizes that hospitals have the legal responsibility to monitor and assure worker safety and occupational radiation exposure and further have a “fiduciary type” responsibility with an implicit responsibility not only to maintain and calibrate present imaging systems but also to equip catheterization laboratories with the most modern equipment (imaging and protective) established to offer benefits to the safety and welfare of their workforce. Calibration of the X-ray system, modernization with updated features, replacement of outdated imaging systems, and equipment maintenance are the responsibilities of the hospital. The statement adds that hospitals and health care systems should recognize that foregoing protective equipment and wellness processes to save expenditures at the expense of the long-term health of their workers is ultimately more costly, and that professional societies play a key role to help establish what is considered reasonable and necessary for best practice in radiation safety and clinician wellness. The overarching goal is a laboratory design that achieves a completely radiation-safe environment that eliminates the need for personal protective apparel and thereby mitigates the orthopedic consequences.

### Occupational health services now and in the future: the need for a paradigm shift [^3b0543a7]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Occupational health services (OHS) evolved in response to the needs of hazardous industries and on the premise that work was harmful. In the developed world, most of these industries have disappeared, and classical occupational diseases are uncommon.

Evidence

The evidence now is that most work is safe and safe work is good for health. Access to OHS is inconsistent, and there is no continuity of care for workers who move to another employer or leave work because of ill health.

Consensus Process

OHS therefore care for survivor populations and generally those in large enterprises who need OHS the least. From a societal viewpoint, OHS are not fit for purpose. They have not adapted to the evolving small business and more informal work sector. The health impact of long-term worklessness is large and the workless need access to the competencies of OHS.

Conclusion

In the future, OHS should develop to meet the needs of the working-age population and to maximize the functional capacity.

### Differences between men and women in their risk of work injury and disability: a systematic review [^079dd5cb]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Occupational health research that is sensitive to sex/gender differences (hereinafter the interconnected dimensions of sex/gender will also be referred to as “men and women,” unless otherwise specified) has the potential to expand our understanding of the health determinants of workers and is strongly recommended for targeted and inclusive work modification and hazard prevention strategies.Yet, amidst the considerable amount of occupational health research examining sex/gender differences, existing reviews on the scope of potential differences in work injury and work disability in men and women are limited. A systematic review of mostly cross‐sectional studies by Campos‐Serna et al.reporting on the prevalence of work‐related health outcomes had found that women were at higher risk of poor physical and mental health than men. Two other review studies also reported that different psychosocial and work organization exposures based on the gender compositions of different occupations were associated with a higher risk for women of poor mental health,and injury, illness and mortality.However, these reviews were focused on a narrow field of physical and psychosocial occupational exposures related to work‐related injury and disability. Accordingly, knowledge gaps remain on differences in risk of work injury and work disability for men and women with the same occupational exposures, including some associations that may not have been studied or reported. Furthermore, previous reviews had only examined sex and gender differences in occupational exposure‐related outcomes according to the gendered segregation of the labor force (across occupations) but did not compare differences in occupational health outcomes of men and women within the same occupations. We can hypothesize that men and women in the same occupation are more similar in terms of work‐related gender roles. Therefore, if differences in work exposures and health outcomes persist among different occupational groups, these are less likely to be due to gendered roles and expectations in relation to the labor market. By comparing the work injury and work disability outcomes of men and women for the same types of exposures, research can better inform where preventive policies and practices might be required to address occupational health disparities.

The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize evidence from research studies from the last decade that examined differences between men and women in their risks of work injury and work disability‐related outcomes associated with the same types of occupational exposures both across occupations and within the same occupations.

### Addressing environmental health: clinician training and practice of environmental medicine-ACOEM guidance statement [^8ed4eee3]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) guidance—scope and definitions in environmental and occupational medicine emphasize the role of OEM clinicians and quantify environment-attributable mortality, stating that the World Health Organization estimated that “in 2016, 24% of global deaths and 28% of deaths in children under 5 years old were due to ‘modifiable environmental factors.’” Environmental health is defined by the American Public Health Association as “the branch of public health that focuses on the relationships between people and their environment, promotes human health and well-being, and fosters healthy and safe communities,” with occupational health “frequently and accurately considered a subset of environmental health, focusing on the health and safety of workers,” and OEM described as “the clinical practice of evaluating, diagnosing, and managing illnesses and injuries caused by both occupational and environmental exposures.” Training and credentialing details include that “Under the American Board of Preventive Medicine (ABPM), residency training is required for certification in the medical specialty of OEM,” and “OEM certification is strongly recommended for physicians who wish to focus on environmental medicine,” while the specialty remains less recognized given “the small number of practicing physicians certified in OEM and the undersupply of OEM residency training programs.” The page also notes common exposure sources across air, water, soil, and food, regulatory history “leading to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970,” and introduces the concept that “The term ‘exposome’ has been proposed to describe an individual’s unique environmental exposures throughout their life.”

### The role and scope of occupational therapy in Africa [^c7e91a8c]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Occupational therapy (OT) is a global health profession that promotes participation in meaningful occupations to enhance well-being, particularly for persons with disabilities. Occupational therapy is relatively new in many African countries and there is limited research regarding the role of OT in this region. Thus, this study aims to understand the role and scope of OT in Africa by exploring its unique contribution to healthcare and cultural considerations for practicing OT in various African contexts.

Methods

We conducted an exploratory qualitative descriptive study involving semi-structured interviews with 15 occupational therapists from 11 African countries. Interview questions focused on participants' work activities, rewards and challenges of their work, and perceived contribution to healthcare. We audio-recorded and transcribed interviews followed by inductive thematic analysis.

Results

All participants described maintaining multiple roles. Four main themes (with sub-themes) emerged: advocacy (clients and the profession), collaboration (multi-disciplinary team, professional support, and internationally), maintaining core OT principles (occupation, function, participation, empowerment, and holistic practice), and contextual considerations (community-based services, practice approaches, sustainability, cultural norms, and spirituality).

Conclusions

Occupational therapists working in African contexts have a unique and challenging role involving advocacy and collaboration. They need to maintain core OT values whilst addressing contextual considerations to ensure culturally relevant practice.Implications for RehabilitationOccupational therapists have an important role in promoting health and well-being; however, practice is influenced by the cultural context.Occupational therapists in Africa maintain multiple roles, including advocacy for their clients and the profession, and collaboration within a multidisciplinary team, for professional support and internationally.African occupational therapists need to be rooted in core OT principles whilst considering their unique context to ensure culturally relevant practice.

### The impact of COVID-19 on research into work and health [^ac2f7b82]. Occupational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

While the literature highlights some of the practical challenges of delivering research during the pandemic, work describing the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic for research in the field of work and health (e.g. interventional studies and occupational epidemiological research) is currently unavailable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the impact for the continued development and delivery of research into work and health during the pandemic period, and to identify potential priorities in this area of research which are likely to follow in the future. This study targeted researchers representing a broad range of disciplines.

Our study focused on the following questions:

1. What impact has the Covid-19 pandemic had on the continuation of research into work and health?
2. What opportunities have arisen to optimize the development and delivery of research into work and health in the UK during the Covid-19 pandemic?
3. What lessons could be learned to safeguard and facilitate the progression of rigorous and high-quality research into work and health should similar disruptions to research occur in the future?
4. What priorities for research into work and health are likely to emerge in response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

### Responsibilities of the occupational and environmental medicine provider in the treatment and prevention of climate change-related health problems [^f67bc452]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Occupational and environmental medicine (OEM) responsibilities for climate change—workers face direct and indirect health impacts tied to job type and underlying risks, and OEM providers/ACOEM roles are identified. Workers are uniquely susceptible to the health hazards imposed by environmental changes, and the guidance focuses on North American workers and describes the responsibilities of the OEM provider in responding to these health challenges. Occupational health care providers and the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) are uniquely suited to promote protection of the health of US working populations, with many working groups susceptible due to job type (eg, outdoor workers, laborers, athletes, wildland firefighters) or underlying risks (eg, respiratory illness, heart disease, pregnancy); direct effects include heat-related illness, respiratory disease due to reduced air quality, and increased allergy induction, and indirect effects include illness during disaster response, stress and mental illness from traumatic events, and increased susceptibility to vector-borne disease.

### Associations, unions and everything in between: contextualising the role of representative health worker organisations in policy [^6354a6c4]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Roles of RHWOs in health policy processes

It is important to recognise the linkages between health workforce policy and health sector reform and to note that RHWOs’ support or opposition of health reform packages are shaped by their impact on health workers (ie, opposing an expansion of health services due to potential negative impacts on remuneration). RHWOs for the same occupational group might also hold diverse viewpoints on health system structure and reform, and health workers have formed cause-focused organisation in response to specific aspects of health reform (eg, Indian Doctors for Ethical Practice, Doctors for America). Finally, RHWOs might engage in matters of public policy, such as the climate crisis, gender-based violence and prejudicial actions and behaviours from state authorities. The role of RHWOs in these aforementioned policy domains is highly dependent on political context and labour relations in a particular jurisdiction.

Depending on the context and occupation, RHWOs are also involved in the regulation of health occupations.Diverse regulatory mechanisms for the health workforce exist across the world, involving combinations of self-regulation, coregulation, direct government regulation or voluntary regulation and variously engaging with RHWOs in these models.The role of regulatory bodies, such as professional councils, and RHWOs are conceptually distinct and governed by different institutional frameworks.That said, in practice, the membership of regulatory organisations and representative organisations might overlap and result in considerable collaboration between the two, for example, by working together to establish professional regulation and standardsas well in the form of regulatory capture.

Professional councils or commissions, particularly in many LMICs, are statutory organisations that exist via legislation but involve self-regulation as their decision-making bodies are comprised of membership from the professional group.The National Medical Commission of India exists via an Act of Parliament, the National Medical Commission Act 2019, but consists primarily of doctors in leadership and decision-making positions.These councils are mandated with setting standards of ‘entry’ into the profession (ie, education, licensing), maintaining quality and standards and overseeing ethical practices. In some contexts, such as the USA, the regulatory bodies overseeing health worker education are non-governmental (eg, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education is an independent, non-profit organisation).

### The impact of employment status, income, and occupation on the association between workplace benefits and health-related work absences [^3a3d688e]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Workplace benefits such as paid sick leave and employer‐sponsored health insurance play a crucial role in shaping workers' ability to take time off due to illness or injury. Access to these benefits has been associated with improved health outcomes, reduced financial strain, and lower presenteeism (working while sick), which can negatively affect both individual and public health. However, access to these workplace benefits is highly variable across different segments of the workforce, raising questions about how effectively they facilitate time off when needed.

Nationally, approximately 78% of civilian workers in the U.S. have access to employer‐sponsored health insurance, while only 77% have access to paid sick leave—and this coverage drops substantially for part‐time and low‐wage workers. Workers in part‐time roles are 43% less likely to receive paid sick leave compared to their full‐time counterparts, despite often working in high‐contact service occupations where illness transmission risks are elevated. These coverage gaps raise important questions about who is both eligible for and able to make use of workplace benefits—questions that are central to informing more equitable employment and health policies.

The United States is the only wealthy nation with no federally mandated sick leave law, leaving this governance to the states. Currently, less than half of the states have mandatory paid sick leave laws, resulting in heterogeneity in the provision of paid sick leave across the United States. While the Family and Medical Leave Act mandates companies with greater than 50 employees offer long‐term leave with job protection‐typically defined as up to 12 weeks‐, this leave is unpaid and does not provide short‐term leave for illness or injury.

Such gaps are concerning not only given the potential benefits of paid sick leave (e.g. greater likelihood of staying home when sick, thereby reducing the spread of infectious diseases and allowing for adequate recovery). The role of paid sick leave on time away from work among workers facing financial constraints—such as those without full‐time employment or those with lower incomes—is unclear. Use of sick leave may also vary based on type of occupation, as certain industries such as manufacturing, food service, and retail, or occupations such as production, service, and sales, may discourage or restrict leave‐taking despite formal policies, but there is a dearth of data on this issue.

### On the importance of primary and community healthcare in relation to global health and environmental threats: lessons from the COVID-19 crisis [^00882cfc]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Connections of P&CHC

The connection between P&CHC and occupational health (OH) is well established. This is important for better prevention of chronic conditions (such as musculoskeletal or mental health disorders) that lead to absenteeism or early departure from the labour force.Efforts to improve workers’ physical and mental health include raising awareness among managers, improving the physical working environment, humanising social relations at work and offering programmes dedicated to encouraging disabled people to return to work. Equally important is the health surveillance of workers especially for physical, chemical or biological hazards at work.

In this respect, COVID-19 presents an almost unique instance where occupational and environmental risk factors have overlapped, generating a health, social and economic impact of a magnitude not seen before. Failure of OH control at work will affect many individuals; failure of control in the community will result in many sick workers. Hence, the close coordination between P&CHC, OH, EPH and enforcement authorities is essential.

P&CHC can play two critical roles: one, as partners to public health policymakers and agencies in contributing to monitoring impacts and serving as ‘anchor institutions’for implementing local solutions and innovative approaches to safeguarding community health; and two, an essential role in community building, social cohesion and resilience.

### Managing implementation: roles of line managers, senior managers, and human resource professionals in an occupational health intervention [^897f9986]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To contrast line managers', senior managers', and (human resource) HR professionals' descriptions of their roles, tasks, and possibilities to perform them during the implementation of an occupational health intervention.

Methods

Interviews with line managers (n = 13), senior managers (n = 7), and HR professionals (n = 9) 6 months after initiation of an occupational health intervention at nine organizations.

Results

The groups' roles were described coherently, except for the HR professionals. These roles were seldom performed in practice, and two main reasons appeared: use of individuals' engagement rather than an implementation strategy, and lack of integration of the intervention with other stakeholders and organizational processes.

Conclusions

Evaluation of stakeholders' perceptions of each other's and their own roles is important, especially concerning HR professionals. Clear role descriptions and implementation strategies, and aligning an intervention to organizational processes, are crucial for efficient intervention management.

### A knowledge infrastructure for occupational safety and health [^96c4308f]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) professionals should use scientific evidence to support their decisions in policy and practice. Although examples from practice show that progress has been made in evidence-based decision making, there is a challenge to improve and extend the facilities that support knowledge translation in practice. A knowledge infrastructure that supports OSH practice should include scientific research, systematic reviews, practice guidelines, and other tools for professionals such as well accessible virtual libraries and databases providing knowledge, quality tools, and good learning materials. A good infrastructure connects facilities with each other and with practice. Training and education is needed for OSH professionals in the use of evidence to improve effectiveness and efficiency. New initiatives show that occupational health can profit from intensified international collaboration to establish a good functioning knowledge infrastructure.

### Long working hours, occupational health and the changing nature of work organization [^b2e495ba]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of long working hours on health has been of major concern since the late 19th Century. Working hours are again increasing in the US.

Methods

An overview of historical, sociological, and health-related research presented at an international conference on long working hours is discussed as an introduction to a special section in this issue.

Results

Research indicates that long working hours are polarizing along class lines with professionals working regular though longer hours and less well-educated workers having fewer though more irregular hours. Extended and irregular hours are associated with acute reactions such as stress and fatigue, adverse health behavior such as smoking, and chronic outcomes such as cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disorders.

Conclusions

Improved methodologies are needed to track exposure to long working hours and irregular shifts longitudinally. Research should focus on the adverse impact that sleep-deprived and stressed workers may have on the health of the public they serve. A variety of protective efforts should be undertaken and evaluated.

### The role of state public health agencies in national efforts to track workplace hazards and the relevance of state experiences to nanomaterial worker surveillance [^be6a1ea5]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This essay examines the role state public health agencies could play in the surveillance of emerging workplace hazards including nanotechnology.

Methods

This essay describes existing state occupational health surveillance programs in order to demonstrate their potential applicability, and limitations, in regards to nanomaterial worker surveillance.

Results

State public health agencies have access to information and an ability to put surveillance information to use in ways that complement those of industry, academia, regulatory agencies, and federal partners.

Conclusions

Some state public health agencies have significant experience with occupational health surveillance and are therefore valuable partners in the development and implementation of nanotechnology worker surveillance programs. Including states in emerging hazard surveillance enhances surveillance activities and builds state capacity to help workers.

### Scope of occupational and environmental health programs and practice [^ae8b51ec]. ACOEM (2011). Medium credibility.

Absence and disability management outlines evaluation of work capacity, accommodations, and rehabilitation pathways. Disability management programs assess reasons for workers' poor performance or absence from work due to illness or injury and determine when individuals are well enough to return to work safely; closely related is the primary role of evaluating illness conditions that render work unsafe and require job accommodations. Frequently, the workplace can be used for rehabilitating workers, especially where selective work can be provided on a temporary, limited basis, and disability management is expanding to identify individuals and worker populations who are at increased risk of poor performance because of health issues and to find positive means to enhance health and productivity in the workforce.

### Trial-based economic evaluations in occupational health: principles, methods, and recommendations [^ddad7da9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Perspective

An essential aspect of an economic evaluation is its perspective. Perspective refers to the “point of view” taken to identify relevant costs and consequences for inclusion in the evaluation. The chosen perspective may be that of any relevant stakeholder or an aggregate of stakeholders such as a societal perspective. The perspective determines which costs and consequences are included. In the societal perspective, for example, all costs and consequences are considered irrespective of who pays or benefits, whereas only those borne by employers are included when the employer's perspective is applied. Given this fact, the perspective is a critical element in an analysis and should therefore be stated explicitly.

The OHS interventions are typically initiated by company management, either to comply with the law, in an effort to save money (ie, reduced sickness absence costs), or for moral reasons.Consequently, most economic evaluations of such interventions are performed from the employer's perspective,,but other perspectives may also be relevant, for example, worker's, insurer's, and societal perspective. When the employer's perspective is applied, key worker outcomes, such as the value of worker health, are often not included in the analysis, but simply the health-related expenses incurred by an employer (eg, productivity implications). This is a critical oversight, as occupational health is essentially about worker health. A societal perspective is particularly useful to consider as the perspective in a study, as it provides insight into the net effect across all stakeholders. Hereby, it better ensures that the societal costs of an intervention are less than the benefits experienced by all stakeholders, rather than simply the company's costs being less than its benefits.This information will ensure that there is a net societal benefit, rather than simply cost shifting from one stakeholder to another. In addition, the disaggregated information on costs and consequences from a societal perspective provides a good sense of their distribution across stakeholders. Such information can be the launch pad for bargaining between them.This may be of particular importance in countries with dual-payer (eg, The Netherlands) and universal health care systems (eg, The United Kingdom), because employers generally bear most of the costs of OHS interventions, whereas in such jurisdictions the health care system and/or government reaps a large part of their benefits (ie, reduced medical spending).Therefore, it is recommendable to supplement findings from the employer's perspective with those from other relevant perspectives, particularly the societal one.

### Perceived mental health skills and competence among occupational health physicians [^f23ed26c]. Occupational Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A large proportion of the world’s disease burden is attributable to mental disorders. Mental health problems in occupational health (OH) service consultations are increasing. Promoting mental health through collaboration between workplaces and OH services with different practices might serve as a tool to empower employees through individual employee and workplace-level interventions. Common processes between OH services and the workplace, such as a workplace survey and action plan, are important in building a need-based mental health intervention at the workplace.

According to the International Labor Organization Convention No. 161, OH services handle preventive functions and are responsible for advising the employer, the employees and their representatives. The most research done concerns work ability and return to work. OH services might be essential in preventing work disability and promoting return-to-work processes between working life and specialist medical care. In addition to individual employee-level support, OH services support the entire work community. The collaboration between workplaces and OH services is based on contract requirements, dialogue and the definition of roles.

Concerns have risen in Finland that the Occupational Safety and Health Act (738/2002), risk assessment and workplace surveillance might not be sufficient to identify mental health load and work stress. Traditional risk assessment in terms of exposure concentrations known to be harmful is not sufficient to identify mental load and stress to target need-based measures for employees. Occupational medicine is not enough to handle societal mental health challenges in working life. Actions to the individual employee may lead to medicalization. Proactive collaboration between workplaces and OH services might increase psychological safety at the workplace and help to prevent absenteeism from work due to mental health issues.

Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) are an essential means to translate competencies into observable and measurable clinical practices. In OH specialist physician training, mental health issues are not readily shown in the EPAs, and education has been fragmented into several different courses. None of these courses handle proactive collaboration between workplaces and OH services or community-level actions. Therefore, in order to be able to offer high-quality education, we need a new perspective on mental well-being and mental health education in the curriculum and training of OH specialist physicians to better meet the needs of working life. High-quality training enables the OH physician to reach sufficient expertise to implement the best practices of OH services.

### Development and maturation of the occupational health services research field in the United States over the past 25 years: challenges and opportunities for the future [^c8b4efc2]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Work is an important social determinant of health; unfortunately, work-related injuries remain prevalent, can have devastating impact on worker health, and can impose heavy economic burdens on workers and society. Occupational health services research (OHSR) underpins occupational health services policy and practice, focusing on health determinants, health services, healthcare delivery, and health systems affecting workers. The field of OHSR has undergone tremendous expansion in both definition and scope over the past 25 years. In this commentary, focusing on the US, we document the historical development and evolution of OHSR as a research field, describe current doctoral-level OHSR training, and discuss challenges and opportunities for the OHSR field. We also propose an updated definition for the OHSR field: Research and evaluation related to the determinants of worker health and well-being; to occupational injury and illness prevention and surveillance; to healthcare, health programs, and health policy affecting workers; and to the organization, access, quality, outcomes, and costs of occupational health services and related health systems. Researchers trained in OHSR are essential contributors to improvements in healthcare, health systems, and policy and programs to improve worker health and productivity, as well as equity and justice in job and employment conditions. We look forward to the continued growth of OHSR as a field and to the expansion of OHSR academic training opportunities.

### Could better-quality employment improve population health? Findings from a scoping review of multi-dimensional employment quality research and a proposed research direction [^980e44c3]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the added interpretive complexity, expanded research approaches used to study the spectrum of employment quality may be particularly useful for thinking about improving population health and making progress on health inequities. In many ways, researchers focused on the interaction of employment with health have adapted the biomedical mind frame, wherein exposure to a hazard— precariousness in employment—leads to a risk of an unwanted health outcome. This perspective is an important one, serving to build awareness of precarious employment not only as a social determinant of health and health inequalities but also of the complex initiatives required to measure and track its burden and mitigate its impact as evidence of its growth and influence has accumulated. Yet, while research on precarious employment has confirmed that it undermines health and well‐being, this research is not able to show that features of employment might be configured such that employment of high quality might be used as a tool for population health improvement. If employment with certain features can actually improve health beyond protecting it from deterioration, knowing what factors to build into an employment situation to bolster worker health and well‐being is just as important as knowing what factors to avoid to prevent or limit harm to workers. Such clarity is furthermore important for health equity; because precarious employment is health‐harming, we must redouble our efforts to curtail it as well as find ways to improve the health and well‐being of those impacted. Indeed, broader aspirational job quality constructs that include facets of employment quality have garnered attention, such as the International Labor Organisation's decent work, and the United States Department of Commerce's Job Quality. Approaches such as the Total Worker Health® (TWH) program of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (United States) state as goals “that all work should both be safe and enhance the health and well‐being of workers” (p. 6, emphasis added). That is, the formulation of all three ideas suggests we might think of high‐quality jobs as those that do not expose people to hazards that can cause injury or disease, but also as those jobs that might help people move toward a stronger state of health and overall well‐being. If researchers focused on employment quality are to contribute to a dialogue about employment's health‐promoting potential as part of broader constructs like job quality, employment's health‐advancing potential should be clarified.

### Scope of occupational and environmental health programs and practice [^379e641f]. ACOEM (2011). Medium credibility.

Occupational and environmental health programs—chemical hazard assessment and worker protection emphasize proactive evaluation and interim safeguards. Processes should be in place for toxicological assessment of new chemicals prior to introduction in the workplace, and OEM and OEH personnel should recommend appropriate protection and surveillance of workers in keeping with data available or until appropriate data are received.

### Dissecting the effect of workplace exposures on workers' rating of psychological health and safety [^64f25274]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Some studies have documented that the relationship between psychosocial work exposures and mental and physical health outcomes differs for men and women. 13, 14, 15, 16 As such, there is also the potential that the relationship between psychosocial work exposures and the psychological health and safety might differ for men and women, or for those with more masculine or feminine roles in relation to the labor market. Feminine labor market roles include having a greater responsibility for child care or other household responsibilities, working fewer hours relative to one's partner, and working in female‐dominated occupational groups, whereas masculine labor market characteristics include being the sole wage earner and working in male‐dominated occupational groups. 17 In addition, from a life course perspective, the relationships between psychosocial exposures and psychological health and safety might also differ across age groups. 18 Consequently, the secondary objective of this study is to examine the extent to which the relationship between psychosocial work exposures and psychological health and safety differ for men and women, for those with masculine and feminine labor market roles, and across age groups.

Recognition that an individual's job could affect the likelihood of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 created challenges for investigators who sought to understand and prevent the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Considerable research resources were devoted to separating the effects of occupational from nonoccupational risk factors. This commentary highlights results from studies that adjusted for multiple nonoccupational risk factors while estimating the effects of occupations and occupational risk factors. Methods used in these studies will prove useful in future infectious disease epidemics and pandemics and may potentially enrich studies of other occupational infectious and noninfectious respiratory diseases.

### The interaction between general practitioners and occupational health professionals in relation to rehabilitation for work: a Delphi study [^06d31985]. Occupational Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Anecdotally, communication between general practitioners (GPs) and occupational health professionals is poor and acts as a barrier to successful rehabilitation for work. It is not known how widely this view is held by the many stakeholders in rehabilitation for work, or how important the observation is in its effect.

Methods

A Delphi study was conducted by initial semi-structured telephone interview, followed by a three-round collation and feedback of opinion by e-mail. The 25 participants were identified by suggestion within the study process for their position as key informants within a wide range of stakeholders.

Results

The process generated a consensus statement which identifies the extremely important nature of rehabilitation for work, the crucial role by GPs, the central role of occupational health professionals in case management and the barrier represented by the often very poor communication between them.

Conclusion

The way forward is to improve communication by mutual education and understanding and a team approach to rehabilitation strategy. This may be facilitated by the GPs who work in occupational health and disability assessment and the involvement of other health professionals to great benefit for all stakeholders.

### Patients' experiences, needs, and expectations of cooperation between medical specialists and occupational health physicians: a qualitative study [^980c3c7b]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

We used a thematic analysis according to Braun and Clarketo explore the patients' needs and expectations regarding this cooperation. COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) was used in this study.This study was part of a larger qualitative investigation on CWIC. Patients' motives for discussing work with their medical specialists and their needs in CWIC have been extensively described elsewhere.The data collection for the study took place from September to October 2020. To interpret the study results, it is essential to understand the Dutch occupational health care system—an explanation of which can be found in Box 1.

Box 1. Occupational Health Care in the Netherlands

In the Netherlands, the OHP has two main roles.First, the OHP acts as gatekeeper to employers during the assessment of employee sick leave, which is regulated by the Gatekeepers Improvement Act.Second, the OHP provides the employer with expert advice in the field of prevention and health and safety management.In both roles, the OHP uses his or her expertise to advise the employee and employer on workplace adjustments, work task adjustments, and working hours; refers the employee to other health care practitioners (eg, a medical specialist, psychologist, or physiotherapist); and—during a period of absenteeism—guides the return-to-work process. In practice, most resources are spent on sick leave management, because the Gatekeepers Improvement Act requires that the employer ensure there is an OHP available for the patient, and the patient is obliged to consult this OHP.Occupational health physicians in the Dutch system most often work for an occupational health service, which have contracts with employers. Some OHPs are self-employed and directly contracted by an employer. This period of contact with the OHP lasts at most 2 years from the start of sick leave, during which the employer pays at least 70% of the patient's salary. Should the patient reach the end of this 2-year period while still not successfully returned to work, the insurance physician—who works for the Employee Insurance Agency commissioned by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment—comes into play. The role of the insurance physician is to assess the patients' general work capacity by comparing this with the expected capacity for a person of similar age and educational background, from a social security perspective, in light of a disability benefits application. It should be noted that in the Netherlands not everyone has access to an OHP. Self-employed workers can arrange access to occupational health care themselves, but this is not compulsory by law. Therefore, 80% of self-employed choose not to contract an occupational health service due to, for example, the high costs of these contracts.

### Biomarker research in occupational health [^3be849cd]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

A variety of biomarkers have been used to study worker populations, and these studies have achieved different levels of success in the improvement of occupational health.

Methods

Successful application of biomarker research is dependent upon several important factors: ability to identify hazardous substances from the exposure to a variety of substances, relevance to the development of disease, and usefulness for health risk assessment.

Results

Besides the traditional biomarkers for exposure, biological effects, and health risk, new biomarkers for susceptibility and genome-wide responses are being used to improve our understanding of occupational health at a higher and, perhaps, more precise level.

Conclusions

In addition, there is a continued need to develop and apply biomarkers that can be used to provide real-time detection of excessive exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace, especially from unexpected fugitive emissions. These topics are discussed in the review.

### An urgent call to address work-related psychosocial hazards and improve worker well-being [^fdfff5c9]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

6.5 | Increase the number and diversity of professionals skilled in preventing and addressing psychosocial hazards

There is a lack of mental health literacy nationally and a shortage of professionals who are knowledgeable about work-related psychosocial hazards. There are calls for training psychologists and occupational health professionals so that there are more professionals in occupational health psychology (OHP), but the response in terms of training new investigators and practitioners has not been sufficient.There is a need for more emphasis by government agencies, universities, professional associations, employers, and unions to increase the investment in training occupational health psychologists. There is also a need to bridge OHP and occupational safety and health to support a more central role for OHP in the OSH field.Additionally, it is useful to expand the knowledge base of OSH. For example, the Australian Institute of Health and Safety has developed a core OSH body of knowledge on psychosocial hazards for generalist OSH practitioners.Also, the role of Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) needs to be expanded and modernized to make them more impactful, including having EAPs provide both individually focused services and organizational-level interventions.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^41284d71]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Occupational health services—preplacement evaluation, data release, and record retention—state that medical information release follows the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and that records must be retained, while certain job-related evaluations may be required before start with designated-agency certifications when applicable. The data should be available to medical providers if the new employee wishes to release the information to them according to HIPAA of 1996 rules, and the medical record must be kept for 30 years following termination of employment. Other evaluations, such as drug testing, commercial driver certification, baseline medical status before working with hazardous chemicals, immunization status, examinations for respirator clearance, or tuberculosis surveillance status may be required before starting work, and some roles require certification by agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or Department of Transportation (DOT).

### Advent of occupational health services research [^838493c3]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

After lagging behind health services research in general health care, research is now examining health services provided to workers suffering occupational injuries and illnesses. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Workers' Compensation Health Initiative, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality), and the Canadian Institute for Work and Health co-sponsored a June, 1999, conference to explore research needs in this area. Fundamental tenets for advancing occupational health services research include: adopting the goal of improving occupational health care, including better integration of preventive and curative care; creating standardized interstate occupational health care data sets that include medical, economic, and patient perspectives; better defining quality in occupational care and developing appropriate performance measures; in addition to medical costs, assessing social, economic, medical and functional outcomes of care; considering the connections between work and health, including general health services; and addressing the need to train qualified occupational health services researchers.

### The grip on health intervention to prevent health problems among workers with a lower socioeconomic position: a pilot implementation study [^ca056eb4]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Evaluation of the Training of OHPs

Between July 2019 and October 2020, six sessions of the training were provided to 36 OHPs. See Table 2 for the main characteristics of these OHPs. Two of these sessions were provided online because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The training was rated, on average, 8.2 on a scale from 1 to 10. Role playing and the possibility to interact with each other were rated most positive. Suggested improvements for the training related to more practice time for role playing and to the relevance of provided information, as for some OHPs, not all information was new.

TABLE 2 
Characteristics of Occupational Health Professionals Who Participated in the Training

Implementation of the Grip on Health Intervention

In the following section of the Results, we will describe implementation (ie, what is delivered and how?) by reach, dose delivered, fidelity, and quality of delivery, taking contextual factors into account that may affect or affected implementation of Grip on Health.

Reach

Thirteen OHPs delivered the intervention in practice. These professionals were absenteeism consultants or employability coaches (n = 3), occupational nurses or employability coaches (n = 3), work ability specialists (n = 2), occupational social workers (n = 2), occupational physicians (n = 2), and one occupational labor expert (n = 1). Twenty-three OHPs did not deliver the intervention in practice. These professionals were absenteeism consultants or employability coaches (n = 7), occupational nurses or employability coaches (n = 4), work ability specialists (n = 4), occupational physicians (n = 4), occupational labor expert (n = 3), and one return to work coordinator (n = 1). The main reasons for OHPs to not deliver the intervention are described in Box 1.

### Sick leave assessments of workers with subjective health complaints: a cross-sectional study on differences among physicians working in occupational health care [^f57f5eb8]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims: To obtain more insight into differences in sick leave assessments of workers with subjective health complaints, we studied sick leave assessments among Dutch occupational and insurance physicians, and explored possible determinants for these differences. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 50 occupational and 43 insurance physicians in the Netherlands. They all assessed sick leave (complete, partial or no) of nine video case vignettes of workers with subjective health complaints and gave their opinion on the complaints, sick leave and health status. Data were analyzed via a multinomial regression approach, using generalized estimating equations in SPSS. Results: Compared to occupational physicians, complete sick leave was less likely to be assessed by insurance physicians (odds ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.56-0.97). For occupational physicians, psychological diagnoses, private issues and reduced work ability had more influence on the outcome of the sick leave assessment than for insurance physicians. Conclusion: There are differences in sick leave assessments for workers with subjective health complaints between physicians working in the same occupational health system; insurance physicians are stricter in assessing complete sick leave than occupational physicians. These differences may be explained by differences in roles, tasks and perspectives of the physician in occupational health care.Implications for Rehabilitation Sick leave assessments of workers with subjective health complaints.•The current study showed that there are differences between occupational physicians and insurance physicians in sick leave assessments for workers with subjective health complaints.•These differences may be based on different perspectives, roles and tasks of physicians.•Physicians working in the rehabilitation and occupational health system should be more aware of the impact of these differences on their assessments and advices.•Better communication and collaboration between physicians, and more insight into and clarification of the perspectives may result in more agreement between physicians' sick leave assessment and advice towards workers.

### Occupational differences in the prevalence and severity of long-COVID: analysis of the coronavirus (COVID-19) infection survey [^177e96fd]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic created new challenges for workers, employers, occupational and public health. Long-COVID is compounding to these challenges, mainly related to sustaining employment and return-to-work for those affected. Our findings show that long-COVID differences are evident across industries and occupations. Professional occupations, including jobs in teaching and education, IT, welfare and healthcare, demonstrated that the risk of infection may not be the only driving force. Our findings of increased risk of long-COVID in the health and social care industries support that some health conditions are prescribed as industrial diseasesand highlight other sectors and occupations that require further attention. Scientific evidence is essential to understand the mechanisms resulting in long-COVID, how occupation influences prevalence and severity and whether working conditions and protective measures affect the risk of developing long-COVID or interact with long-COVID to increase the impact on activities.

### Performance and quality measurement in occupational health services: current status and agenda for further research [^fc8dc0a1]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

There is growing interest in evaluating the impact and effectiveness of occupational healthcare services (OHS). Managed care networks, case and disease management, worker health promotion, and utilization review services have proliferated in OHS, usually without scientifically based, objective measures of their impact on the quality of care, outcomes, or costs. Performance and quality improvement (QI) efforts in OHS are different from those in general health care because the population, range of conditions, setting of care, and primary outcomes of interest differ considerably. However, scientific knowledge resulting from the application of QI in general health care can provide a useful framework for the development of measures in OHS.

Methods

We describe the development, selection, and evaluation of OHS performance and quality measures, and propose a research agenda.

Conclusions

Quality and performance measures in OHS should address common work-related conditions with high costs, suboptimal outcomes, or unclear parameters for ideal practices. They should reflect stakeholder priorities. Measures should be precise and quantifiable, clearly specified, reliable, valid, and sensitive to important changes. They should be based upon data that can be collected and analyzed at a reasonable cost and effort. The focus of measurement should be on situations where improvement can be achieved by those directly involved in OHS delivery, through defined approaches. Appropriate severity and case-mix adjustment may be especially problematic in OHS. Confidentiality, regulatory concerns, and appropriate use of results must be considered in the development and use of OHS measures. Research is needed to identify, develop, and validate OHS-specific measures, to establish risk adjustment methods, and to test the utility of this information in improving OHS.

Occupational health—surveillance for medically vulnerable workers is designed to identify and mitigate infectious risk, recognizing that immune-compromised workers are at greater risk of infection and complications from many workplace infections. Although laboratory and animal husbandry protocols should be designed to protect all staff, additional work restrictions may be appropriate in some cases, ideally developed in collaboration with the worker’s other treating physicians. Similarly, pregnancy increases medical risk for pathogens, and pregnant staff should also be offered counseling and appropriate accommodation.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^9491b8d5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Dilute urine samples—dilution is the most common cause of an invalid sample, and a combination of low creatinine (below 20 mg/dL) and specific gravity is used to indicate that a sample is dilute; in the case of dilute urine, the creatinine concentration of the sample can be used to normalize drug concentrations. Expert panel members commented that dilution is usually the result of deliberate water loading. For patients with a history of dilute urine samples, providers should advise the patient to decrease water intake prior to sample collection, collect samples first thing in the morning, collect samples before work or on days off if heavy hydration is required for occupation, and consider the use of an alternative matrix. There are some health conditions that can cause unusually high or low specific gravity and low creatinine, but a dilute urine sample from an underlying condition such as Diabetes Insipidus is very rare; providers should first advise appropriate hydration levels as a test for an underlying etiology of dilute samples.

### Using systematic review in occupational safety and health [^3b53b6c9]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Evaluation of scientific evidence is critical in developing recommendations to reduce risk. Healthcare was the first scientific field to employ a systematic review approach for synthesizing research findings to support evidence-based decision-making and it is still the largest producer and consumer of systematic reviews. Systematic reviews in the field of occupational safety and health are being conducted, but more widespread use and adoption would strengthen assessments. In 2016, NIOSH asked RAND to develop a framework for applying the traditional systematic review elements to the field of occupational safety and health. This paper describes how essential systematic review elements can be adapted for use in occupational systematic reviews to enhance their scientific quality, objectivity, transparency, reliability, utility, and acceptability.

### Therapy-based allied health delivery in residential aged care, trends, factors, and outcomes: a systematic review [^e6661594]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Allied health workforce

In Australia, occupational therapists (37%, n = 783), physiotherapists (44%, n = 2874), podiatrists (84%, n = 928), dieticians (81%, n = 787), exercise physiologists (77%, n = 192), psychologists 87%, n = 185), social workers (61%, n = 219), and speech pathologists (86%, n = 692) were commonly employed part-time as subcontractors. Allied health assistants (75%, n = 2238) and diversional therapists (71%; n = 2258) were the only allied health workers that were more commonly employed by facilities in permanent part-time roles, rather than as a subcontractor. In a 2020 report allied health assistants made up 22% (n = 2992) of all allied health positions in Australian RACFs however the number of all allied health workers in the sector has been declining from 2013.

Surveys demographics in Canada, the US, and the Netherlands suggest that the workforce, specifically occupational therapists, social service workers, and physiotherapists, is predominately female, holds a university degree, and is experienced in aged care. In Canada and the Netherlands, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists were predominately part time while the US occupational therapists and assistants were more likely to be full time (72%, n = 101).

Allied health roles

Information on the roles performed by allied health in RACFs was limited. Mobility was an important aspect of physiotherapy care in Dutch and Canadian studies. Dutch physiotherapists also reported that falls prevention, advice on mobility transfers, and management of pressure ulcers were a common aspect of their role. US social workers reported that common tasks in their role included attending quarterly care plan meetings and providing emotional support to families. One US study found that the scope of occupational therapy practice, specifically sleep interventions, in RACFs is limited by lack of skills, resources, and facility culture.

Role substitution was discussed in two studies. In RACFs in Norway swallow assessments were conducted by speech therapists (7.4%), occupational therapists (6.6%), physiotherapists (3.3%), nutritionists (1.6%) and overall were more likely to be conducted by nursing staff (92.6%; n = 121). An Australian survey found that residents with depression were just as likely to be referred to an occupational therapist as a psychologist.

### Association between mental work and biological aging: the mediating role of visceral adiposity index [^621648ff]. Innovation in Aging (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, with the increasing prevalence of intellectual labor globally and the rising challenge of population aging, understanding the impact of occupation type on biological aging is of growing importance. By investigating the relationships between occupation type, work intensity, and biological aging, this study aims to provide theoretical support for evidence-based health interventions. We hypothesize that, compared to manual workers, mental workers experience more severe biological aging. Furthermore, we propose that work intensity and VAI may play mediating roles in this relationship. Future research should further validate these hypotheses and explore more effective strategies to address the impact of occupation on health and aging.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^3905e470]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

System-based solutions for clinician burnout—Burnout is described as a widespread occupational hazard, and although past efforts focused on individual risk factors and resilience, there is growing appreciation of system-based problems (such as documentation burden of the electronic health record, cognitive load, and over-scheduling/lack of control over workflow) and the need for system or organizational interventions. Shanafelt et al., enumerate 9 organizational strategies to promote physician well-being: acknowledge and assess the problem; harness the power of leadership; develop and implement targeted interventions; cultivate community at work; use rewards and incentives wisely; align values and strengthen culture; promote flexibility and work-life integration; provide resources to promote resilience and self-care; and facilitate and fund organizational science.

### Unique knowledge, unique skills, unique role: aboriginal and torres strait islander health workers in queensland, Australia [^406f39f2]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Box 1 
Definition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Worker in the Queensland Health Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Worker Career Structure 2009

A Queensland Health Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Worker is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person who:

Works within a primary healthcare framework to achieve better health outcomes and better access to health services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals, families and communities.
Is required to hold the specific Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary healthcare qualification.
Advocates for the delivery of services in accordance with the Cultural Respect Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health 2004–2009 (Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council).

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Worker positions are ‘identified’ positions (see IRM 1.13–12). There is a genuine occupational requirement that the occupants of these positions are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.

Notwithstanding the unique nature of the A&TSIHW role within Australia’s state-based health workforces, lack of understanding of the distinctive skills, scope and value associated with its function remains pervasive.This manifests in different ways including poor recognition of the role’s purpose and scope; misunderstanding of role boundaries; lack of respect for reporting lines; and in demands that A&TSIHWs assist other professionals with often menial tasks.These factors coalesce in the lack of any clear models of care that operationalise the ‘ideal’ of supporting the profession as a member of a multidisciplinary team. Empirical papers and commentaries spanning several decades and different jurisdictions, reviewed in 2018,demonstrate the A&TSIHWs’ role has devolved in some cases to ‘glorified taxi drivers’.The same review observed a common assumption that the A&TSIHWs’ primary function was to facilitate non-Indigenous health professionals' own professional practice, rather than engage in distinctive work that could improve the acceptability, accessibility and appropriateness of services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients.Such pervasive lack of understanding of the A&TSIHW role has been described as leading to lower self-worth and high levels of stress among those working as A&TSIHWs, damaging individual career trajectories, role retention and ultimately service-wide cultural safety.

### 'Beyond the cushion': a study of occupational therapists' perceptions of their role and clinical decisions in pressure care [^b1c17d08]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Occupational therapists are frequently involved in pressure care management in rehabilitation and community settings. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of occupational therapists about their role within pressure care and the influences on clinical decisions in this area.

Methods

A grounded theory approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine occupational therapists who had provided pressure care to clients within the Hunter Region of Australia. Data were analysed using the constant comparative method.

Results

The occupational therapy (OT) role in pressure care is diverse and shaped by contextual factors in the workplace. Informants perceived uncertainty surrounding some aspects of their role in pressure care, and with perceptions of other health professionals about their role. OT clinical decisions in pressure care are influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors including OT knowledge and experience, client centred approaches and the availability of resources. Relationships between study themes were summarised in a diagram to articulate the factors contributing to the perceptions of OT's about their role in pressure care.

Conclusions

There is a need for further investigation into the role and clinical decision making of therapists involved in pressure care. Occupational therapists need to promote their role in pressure care to other health professionals.
