## Question

macrolide duration for chronic sinusitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about macrolide duration in chronic rhinosinusitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing acute bacterial rhinosinusitis from chronic rhinosinusitis and whether the evidence for macrolides applies to each. Then, I should verify the most recent high-credibility guidelines and what they actually recommend for macrolide use and duration in CRS. Next, I will review the pivotal randomized trials and meta-analyses to understand dosing, duration, and timing of benefit. After that, I need to stratify by phenotype (CRSsNP vs CRSwNP), inflammatory endotype, and special populations. I will then weigh risks, resistance, and cardiovascular safety. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic recommendation and double-check that it aligns with guideline direction and the strength of evidence.

> Let me first confirm the disease context and definitions so I don't conflate entities. Chronic rhinosinusitis is defined as persistent symptomatic sinonasal inflammation for more than 12 weeks, and importantly, CRS is primarily an inflammatory disorder rather than a persistent bacterial infection, which explains why prolonged antimicrobial therapy often targets immunomodulation rather than eradication of organisms [^111Fh2bq]. I should confirm that short-course macrolide regimens used for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are not directly applicable to CRS; the FDA-labeled 3–5 day azithromycin courses are for ABRS and do not address CRS pathophysiology or the need for sustained anti-inflammatory effects [^112K8Kfw] [^113r1VsR].

> Next, I should review guideline direction, and I need to be careful not to overstate older recommendations. Historically, some guidelines hinted macrolides might be reasonable in selected CRSsNP, but more recent, high-credibility statements are cautious: EPOS 2020 concluded evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against long-term antibiotics in adult CRS, particularly given cardiovascular risks, and the AAFP 2023 advises considering long-term macrolides only selectively in patients at low risk of adverse effects, while contemporary AAO-HNS updates recommend against routine antimicrobial therapy for CRS without acute exacerbation [^116S7TsS] [^111Rue5E] [^116qeL12]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance here: these are not absolute prohibitions; they emphasize nonroutine use and call for judicious selection rather than blanket endorsement [^116qeL12].

> I will now examine the randomized trials to anchor duration and dosing. The most consistent signal for benefit comes from a 12-week roxithromycin RCT in CRSsNP, which showed improved SNOT-20, saccharin transit, and endoscopy at 3 months, with a post hoc signal that low IgE patients fared better, though durability beyond 3 months was variable [^114uHCQS]. Wait, let me verify the azithromycin data: the MACS trial used 500 mg daily for 3 days then 500 mg weekly for 11 weeks and found no end-of-treatment benefit, but a delayed response in a subset 12 weeks after completion; this delayed effect complicates interpretation and raises questions about dosing adequacy and phenotype selection [^112aqJ2P] [^111hf1vB]. I should also confirm the clarithromycin regimen from the MACRO trial: 250 mg twice daily for 2 weeks then 250 mg once daily for 10 weeks; importantly, clarithromycin did not outperform placebo for SNOT-22 at 6 months, tempering enthusiasm for routine use despite plausible anti-inflammatory mechanisms [^114ZHhtv].

> Let me consider meta-analyses to gauge consistency and magnitude. A Cochrane review found moderate-quality evidence that 3 months of a macrolide modestly improved disease-specific quality of life in CRSsNP at the end of treatment, but the effect size was small and not sustained 3 months later, reinforcing the need for careful patient selection and expectation setting [^115NsxWK]. A 2019 meta-analysis suggested that 24 weeks of low-dose macrolide might outperform shorter courses in CRSsNP, but I should double-check the quality and heterogeneity; given the small trials and potential bias, this signal should be interpreted cautiously and not generalized to CRSwNP or mixed populations [^116VB3Ji].

> Now, I need to stratify by phenotype and endotype because response appears heterogeneous. Evidence favors potential benefit in non-type 2, neutrophil-predominant CRSsNP with low IgE, whereas type 2/eosinophilic CRSwNP generally does not respond to macrolides and may be better served by corticosteroids, doxycycline for short-term polyp reduction, or biologics in refractory cases; this aligns with both mechanistic expectations and clinical trial subgroup signals [^116S7TsS] [^111Fh2bq] [^116fEZyT]. Hold on, I should verify that guideline summaries concur: multiple contemporary reviews emphasize that macrolides, if considered at all, are more plausible in CRSsNP and not recommended for routine use in CRSwNP, which matches the trial landscape [^116fEZyT] [^116S7TsS].

> I should confirm dosing and duration details so the recommendation is actionable. Practical regimens studied include roxithromycin 150 mg daily for 12 weeks, azithromycin 500 mg daily for 3 days then 500 mg weekly for 11 weeks, and clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily for 2 weeks then 250 mg once daily for 10 weeks; all are 12-week courses, and the immunomodulatory effects are thought to require weeks to manifest, which supports a minimum 3-month trial when used [^114uHCQS] [^112aqJ2P] [^114ZHhtv]. Wait, let me reconsider the azithromycin weekly schedule: although convenient, the negative end-of-treatment results in MACS raise concern about underdosing relative to daily regimens, so if a macrolide is chosen, daily dosing may be preferable based on available RCTs, acknowledging the evidence is mixed [^112aqJ2P] [^114uHCQS].

> Next, I should review safety, resistance, and monitoring so I don't understate risks. Macrolides carry gastrointestinal adverse effects, drug–drug interactions via CYP3A4 for some agents, and a signal for increased cardiovascular events with long-term use; thus, baseline ECG and QT risk assessment are prudent, and ongoing use warrants periodic clinical review for efficacy and adverse effects [^116izf7c] [^111Rue5E]. I need to ensure I address resistance: prolonged macrolide exposure can drive macrolide-resistant pneumococci, so therapy should be time-limited and coupled with stewardship principles; repeated or prolonged macrolide courses without clear benefit should be avoided [^1122RpZY] [^114bSWeV]. But wait, what if the patient has persistent purulence suggesting bacterial contribution? In that case, endoscopically guided cultures can refine diagnosis and occasionally guide targeted therapy during exacerbations, though routine culture is not universally required in stable CRS [^114QSqQp].

> I should double-check special populations and contexts. In children, evidence is sparse and guidelines generally do not recommend routine macrolides for CRS; if considered for recalcitrant disease, durations and safety data are extrapolated from adult literature and pediatric airway disease experience, so caution and specialist input are advised [^116dTpGn]. In cystic fibrosis–related CRS, macrolides may be used for their immunomodulatory effects in the lower airway, but CF-specific CRS data are limited and decisions should be individualized with attention to bacterial ecology and potential drug interactions [^115RpSD6]. Post-surgical patients are another common scenario; a recent meta-analysis suggested no meaningful quality-of-life benefit from long-term macrolides after ESS, though a small improvement in endoscopic scores was observed, so expectations should be modest and phenotype-driven [^115evo3F].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic, evidence-aligned recommendation, and I will keep verifying each element against guidelines and trials. For carefully selected adults with CRSsNP, normal or low IgE, refractory to optimized intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation, a 12-week course of a macrolide can be considered as a time-limited trial, with preferred options including roxithromycin 150 mg daily or clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily for 2 weeks then 250 mg daily for 10 weeks; azithromycin 500 mg daily for 3 days then 500 mg weekly for 11 weeks is less favored given negative end-of-treatment data but may still be reasonable in select cases with close follow-up [^114uHCQS] [^114ZHhtv] [^112aqJ2P]. I should confirm that benefit is reassessed at 3 months and that therapy is discontinued if there is no clinically meaningful improvement, given the lack of durable benefit in high-quality syntheses and the potential for harm with prolonged exposure [^115NsxWK] [^116izf7c].

> Finally, I need to ensure the overall care pathway remains guideline-concordant. First-line therapy for CRS is high-volume saline irrigation plus topical corticosteroids; systemic corticosteroids or short-course doxycycline can be considered for CRSwNP in selected patients; macrolides, if used, are adjunctive and phenotype-targeted, not routine; and antibiotics should not be prescribed for CRS without evidence of bacterial infection or as a mandatory prerequisite for imaging or surgery [^111Fh2bq] [^116qeL12] [^112sLPyg]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while older narratives sometimes implied broad utility, the weight of contemporary evidence and guidelines supports a restrained, endotype-informed approach with explicit stop criteria and safety monitoring, which I have incorporated here [^116izf7c] [^111Rue5E].

For chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), **12 weeks** of low-dose macrolide therapy (e.g. azithromycin 250 mg three times weekly or clarithromycin 250 mg daily) is the most evidence-based duration, with benefits emerging after 4–8 weeks and peaking by 12 weeks [^115NsxWK]. For CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), **routine macrolide therapy is not recommended** due to limited benefit; if considered for refractory cases, a 12-week trial may be used with close monitoring [^114ZHhtv]. Prolonged therapy beyond 12 weeks is not supported by current evidence and may increase adverse effects and resistance risk [^116izf7c] [^114bSWeV].

---

## Evidence supporting macrolide therapy in CRS

Macrolides have **immunomodulatory effects** — including reduced proinflammatory cytokines, impaired neutrophil recruitment, and inhibition of bacterial biofilm formation — that may benefit CRS, particularly in non-eosinophilic, neutrophil-predominant disease [^111Rp4ur] [^113WJMbG].

---

### Clinical trials and studies

- **Roxithromycin trial**: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 64 patients with CRSsNP showed significant improvements in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20) scores, saccharin transit time, and nasal endoscopy after 12 weeks of roxithromycin 150 mg daily [^114uHCQS].

- **Azithromycin trial**: An RCT of 60 patients with CRS (with or without polyps) found no significant difference between azithromycin and placebo at 12 weeks, but a delayed benefit was observed 12 weeks after completion, with 50% improvement in the azithromycin group versus 9% in the placebo group [^116S7TsS].

- **Meta-analysis**: A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs (608 patients) found that low-dose macrolides for 24 weeks significantly improved quality of life in CRSsNP, whereas shorter durations (8–12 weeks) showed no significant benefit [^116VB3Ji].

---

## Recommended duration of macrolide therapy

Based on current evidence, **the recommended duration** of macrolide therapy for CRS is:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| CRSsNP (non-eosinophilic, neutrophil-predominant) | 12 weeks (low-dose macrolide) | High (RCTs, meta-analysis) [^114uHCQS] [^115NsxWK] |
| CRSwNP (routine use) | Not recommended | High (guidelines, RCTs) [^112sLPyg] [^114ZHhtv] |
| CRSwNP (refractory cases, trial basis) | 12 weeks (low-dose macrolide) | Moderate (expert opinion, limited RCTs) [^114uHCQS] [^116fEZyT] |
| Prolonged therapy beyond 12 weeks | Not recommended | High (guidelines, safety concerns) [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and symptom improvement timeline

Patients typically begin to experience symptom improvement within **4–8 weeks** of initiating macrolide therapy, with maximal benefit observed by **12 weeks**. Common improvements include reduced nasal congestion, decreased nasal discharge, improved sense of smell, and enhanced quality of life [^114uHCQS] [^114MDzHB].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of prolonged macrolide therapy

Prolonged macrolide therapy (> 12 weeks) is associated with several **risks and adverse effects**, including:

- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort are common [^notfound].

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevated liver enzymes and rare hepatic injury [^114QSqQp].

- **Cardiovascular risks**: Prolonged QT interval and potential cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions [^116izf7c].

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Increased risk of macrolide-resistant bacterial strains [^1118aFEZ].

Given these risks, **prolonged macrolide therapy beyond 12 weeks is not recommended** unless clearly indicated and closely monitored [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other antibiotic regimens

Compared with other antibiotic regimens, macrolides have **unique immunomodulatory properties** that may benefit CRSsNP. However, evidence supporting routine antibiotic use in CRS is limited, and macrolides are not universally effective across all CRS phenotypes [^115NsxWK] [^111Fh2bq].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus **recommend selective use** of macrolides in CRSsNP, particularly in patients with non-eosinophilic, neutrophil-predominant inflammation. Routine use in CRSwNP is not recommended due to limited efficacy and potential risks [^111iWaeX] [^116izf7c].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing duration of therapy

Patient-specific factors influencing macrolide duration include **disease phenotype** (CRSsNP vs. CRSwNP), inflammatory endotype (non-eosinophilic vs. eosinophilic), response to therapy, and risk of adverse effects. Therapy should be individualized based on these factors, with close monitoring of clinical response and adverse effects [^111iWaeX] [^116S7TsS].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The recommended duration of macrolide therapy for CRS is **12 weeks** of low-dose macrolide therapy for CRSsNP, particularly in non-eosinophilic, neutrophil-predominant cases. Routine use in CRSwNP is not recommended, and prolonged therapy beyond 12 weeks is not supported by current evidence due to potential risks and limited additional benefit.

### Macrolide therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis: a meta-analysis [^1164z9YE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to systematically review patient-reported outcomes of long-term macrolide therapy, compared with any other treatment, for adults with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Data Sources

EMBASE and PubMed databases were searched in October 2011.

Review Methods

A total of 1216 citations were screened initially by a single author, 23 full-text manuscripts were evaluated by 2 authors using structured data abstraction forms to assess for inclusion criteria and study quality, and 3 studies were included in the final review.

Results

This review finds that 3 prospective clinical studies have evaluated the effect of macrolide therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis. Based on the limited data, there is limited scientific evidence to support the use of long-term macrolide therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis.

Conclusion

Further clinical research is needed to determine whether there may be a subgroup effect based on the underlying inflammatory disease process.

### Tissue reparative effects of macrolide antibiotics in chronic inflammatory sinopulmonary diseases [^113WJMbG]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

It is well established that macrolide antibiotics are efficacious in treating sinopulmonary infections in humans. However, a growing body of experimental and clinical evidence indicates that they also express distinct salutary effects that promote and sustain the reparative process in the chronically inflamed upper and lower respiratory tract. Unlike the anti-infective properties, these distinct effects are manifested at lower doses, usually after a relatively prolonged period (weeks) of treatment, and in the absence of an identifiable, viable pathogen. Long-term, low-dose administration of macrolide antibiotics has been used most commonly for sinusitis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, asthma, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. It is associated with down-regulation of nonspecific host inflammatory response to injury and promotion of tissue repair. Although large-scale trials are lacking, the prolonged use of these drugs has not been associated with emergence of clinically significant bacterial resistance or immunosuppression. Long-term, low-dose administration of 14- and 15-membered ring macrolide antibiotics may represent an important adjunct in the treatment of chronic inflammatory sinopulmonary diseases in humans.

Antibiotic Utilization and Role

Historically, the antibiotics prescribed for CRS have been chosen empirically as swabs for culture have not been routinely taken in clinical practice. The choice of agent and the duration of its prescription has varied considerably based on the clinician's training and experience and the clinical setting. A number of guidelines have been developed to rationalize antibiotic prescription for this indication, but there are practical challenges in applying treatment guidelines (particularly those developed in different healthcare environments), including variable treatment costs and antibiotic resistance rates. The global consumption of broader spectrum antibiotics nearly doubled from 2000 to 2015 and prescribing for CRS remains one of the most common indications. Furthermore, in some countries, many antibiotics are dispensed without a prescription.

Although a number of antibiotics are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating ARS or unspecified RS, no antibiotic has FDA approval for specifically treating CRS. Despite this, antibiotics are still commonly prescribed for this indication. The antibiotic classes most commonly prescribed for CRS consultations in the United States between 2006–2010 were penicillins/beta-lactams (33%), macrolides (26%) and quinolones (19%). In a 2015 survey, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was the drug of choice for adult and pediatric CRS patients among private practitioners in South Korea, whereas hospital-based doctors preferred macrolides for adult CRS patients and third-generation cephalosporins for pediatric CRS patients. In a 2018 survey of members of the American Rhinologic Society, most respondents prescribed non-macrolide antibiotics and macrolide antibiotics "occasionally" for CRSwNP, and non-macrolide antibiotics "sometimes" and macrolide antibiotics "occasionally" for CRSsNP (with sometimes defined as more often than occasionally). Presumably, these antibiotic choices reflect sensitivities for the most commonly cultured organisms and the influence of some early studies that suggested efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanate.

SYNOPSIS OF GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATION

Table I provides a synopsis of recommendations regarding systemic oral antibiotics from several recently published guidelines: the International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Rhinosinusitis (ICAR) 2021, the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) 2020, the Chinese Society of Allergy and Chinese Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Guideline (CSACSO) from 2020, the Clinical Practice Guideline (Update): Adult Sinusitis (CPGAS) from 2015, and the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) update from 2014. Oral and topical corticosteroids are often recommended in combination with antibiotics.

Whereas earlier guidelines usually included antibiotics as a recommended treatment of CRS, more recent guidelines suggest antibiotics be regarded as an optional treatment for CRS, in association with topical and/or systemic corticosteroids, saline rinses and surgery.(,–) Whereas in 2007, long term macrolide therapy received a class A recommendation from the EPOS for the treatment of CRSsNP, 307 after subsequent publications by Wallwork et al. and Videler et al. the EPOS recommendation was downgraded from A to C (not including exacerbations) in 2012. The EPOS 2020 steering group made recommendations using the GRADE system, and their overall recommendation was "uncertain" due to the relatively low quality of the available evidence. EPOS 2020 called for studies with larger population sizes, and placebo-controlled randomized trials of long-term macrolides are currently underway.

ICAR 2021 recommended against non-macrolide antibiotics for CRSwNP, except in acute exacerbations. Macrolides were considered as an option for treatment of both CRSsNP and CRSwNP, but the optimal drug, dosage and treatment duration were not defined due to the limited published data.

The Chinese Society of Allergy and Chinese Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines recommend long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy for CRSsNP patients with neutrophilic inflammatory patterns and low IgE levels, but no antibiotics for CRSwNP patients. Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy post-surgery was discussed to improve the subjective and objective symptom scores, reduce polyp size and delay polyp recurrence. Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy was recommended for corticosteroid-resistant CRSwNP patients, neutrophil-dominant nasal polyps, persistent edema of nasal mucosa, and purulent nasal discharge.

### Anti-inflammatory effects of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^113rfK1v]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Apart from their obvious antibiotic effects, the macrolides have some potentially useful immunomodulatory properties. Which pathway dominates the clinical effect is debatable. Favoring the anti-inflammatory effects are the substantial in vitro data and serum concentrations well below minimal inhibitory concentrations for several pathogens. Furthermore, tissue reparative effects are seen in diffuse panbronchiolitis regardless of the presence of P. aeruginosa, a pathogen not sensitive to macrolide antibiotics. Clinical studies support the view that prolonged treatment is likely to be beneficial in most patients who have CRS. The evidence concerning CRS is still weak because placebo-controlled trials are missing. One should remember, however, the general lack of placebo-controlled trials even in the "more established" medical management of CRS. The concern for an increasing incidence of macrolide-resistant bacterial strains must be taken seriously. Therefore the authors advocate repeated nasal cultures during macrolide therapy. It is hoped that the future will bring larger, prospective, randomized, controlled trials that will investigate the efficacy and safety of macrolides in CRS.

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE

Despite the high utilization of antibiotic treatment of CRS, there is a paucity of high quality prospective studies. For treatment of CRS with antibiotics for less than 3 weeks, the majority of studies focus on the treatment of AECRS. While there are several non-placebo controlled studies and two published double-blind randomized controlled trials (DBRCTs) on the role of prolonged treatment with macrolide antibiotics for CRS, there are few studies evaluating nonmacrolide therapies. Herein we will review the available evidence.

For the purposes of this discussion, three to four weeks or less is considered a 'short-term' antibiotic course and greater than three to four weeks is a considered a 'long-term' course. In general practice, the duration of courses is usually shorter than 10 days. The aim of short-term antibiotic courses is to treat suspected acute bacterial infections causing exacerbations.

There have been only two small placebo-controlled studies investigating the effect of short-term antibiotics in CRS, excluding studies focused only on acute exacerbations of CRS (AECRS). Sabino et al. studied patients with acute exacerbations of CRS with or without polyps and found that after a two-week course of amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg twice daily (n = 21) or placebo (n = 11), both groups exhibited overall improvement on day 14 compared to day 0 (p < 0.01). Van Zele conducted a three-arm study comparing a 20-day course of doxycycline, oral methylprednisolone and placebo in 47 patients with CRSwNP (either recurrent after surgery or with grade 3 or 4 polyps) and found reduced postnasal drip symptom scores at week 2, but no significant differences for all other symptoms and time points. Van Zele demonstrated significantly greater polyp shrinkage in the antibiotic treatment arm vs. placebo at 12 weeks post-treatment. The antibiotic effects were of a much lower magnitude than those seen in the corticosteroid arm and were probably not of clinical significance.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116S7TsS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and macrolide therapy — are characterized by limited evidence for antibiotics in AE-CRS, with only one small randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial reporting similar overall improvement in 2 weeks for amoxicillin–clavulanate twice-daily (n = 21) versus placebo (n = 11), both groups receiving saline rinses and topical steroids, and the study powered to detect a 10% difference at the 14 day mark; a retrospective study found no difference in quality of life between culture-driven versus empiric antibiotics, although long-term endoscopy scores improved with culture-driven therapy; current guidance notes the evidence does not strongly support antibiotics in AE-CRS and makes no specific recommendations. Macrolide antibiotics — a special circumstance — have short-term use not generally recommended for acute sinusitis, but long-term use may be considered for patients with non-type 2 CRS; only 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized long-term trials exist, with roxithromycin significantly improving symptoms and nasal endoscopy in CRSsNP, whereas a 12-week course of weekly azithromycin failed to show end-of-course improvement but 12 weeks post-completion 50% reported improvement or cure versus 9% with placebo; studies suggest that in CRS without nasal polyposis, with near-normal eosinophil counts, and resistant to corticosteroid therapy, macrolides may be a therapeutic option.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

Some unanswered questions in CRS antibiotic research are listed in Table II. Several expert guidelines call for RCTs to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. 3,72 Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics have an impact on patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomised studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties, and so studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. 73 Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, and the majority of the unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for respiratory disease caused by viruses. 73 Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics. 3

Regarding medical management for chronic rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, long-term, EPOS2020 2020 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend for or against long-term antibiotics in adult patients with CRS, particularly in the light of potentially increased risks of cardiovascular events for some macrolides.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^111hf1vB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

The study of a 12-week course of azithromycin failed to show a significant improvement in subjective or objective outcomes at the completion of the course. However, 12 weeks after completion of the antibiotics, 50% of the AZM group reported an improvement or cure compared to 9% in the placebo group (p < 0.05). The single dosing per week is a notable feature of this study and the authors felt that AZM may have been ineffective due to underdosage.

Macrolides have been shown to reduce TH1-mediated non-eosinophilic inflammation when used for durations of at least three months. It may be that there are specific endotypes that will respond better to macrolides than others.

There are no published DBRCTs of long-term non-macrolide antibiotics in CRS, but there are a few studies with less rigorous experimental designs. Dubin et al. performed a study of non-macrolide antibiotics for the treatment of CRSsNP. In this study, culture-directed antibiotics (clindamycin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate) were given to patients with CRSsNP. Sequential computerized tomography (CT) scans were obtained at 3 and 6 weeks and compared to baseline scans. There was an improvement in CT scores between baseline and week 3, but no significant improvements between week 3 and week 6. The authors concluded that a longer course of antibiotics may achieve radiographic improvement and disease resolution in some patients. Study weaknesses included a small analysable sample size (n = 16), a lack of a washout period and the inclusion of patients who were already on antibiotics (an average of four previous antibiotics courses).

There are few published studies of long-term oral non-macrolide antibiotics for the treatment of CRSwNP. Several open-label studies studied the effects of doxycycline but the results have been inconsistent.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^115zEWBo]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — long-term macrolide antibiotics: Long-term use of macrolide antibiotics has been popularized by reports suggesting that macrolides have anti-inflammatory effects; however, clinical studies showing beneficial effects are quite limited and do not clearly differentiate effects in CRSsNP or CRSwNP. In a prospective randomized controlled trial, 90 patients with CRSsNP or CRSwNP were randomly assigned to medical vs surgical treatment; medical therapy consisted of erythromycin 500 mg twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 250 mg twice daily for 10 weeks, plus alkaline nasal irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids for 12 weeks, and both groups improved with no significant differences between groups. A randomized, placebo-controlled investigation of roxithromycin at 150 mg/d for 12 weeks showed a statistically significant change from baseline in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 score at 12 weeks in the roxithromycin group that was not seen with placebo. In another study, 60 patients with CRSsNP or CRSwNP were randomized to azithromycin 500 mg/d for 3 days and then 500 mg weekly for 11 weeks versus placebo, and no significant differences were found between groups at the end of treatment.

### Factors of success of low-dose macrolides in chronic sinusitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VB3Ji]. The Laryngoscope (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the prognostic factors that predict favorable outcomes of low-dose macrolides (LDMs) in treating chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Methods

Randomized controlled trials studying the effects of LDMs in treating CRS were included. Data were pooled for meta-analysis. Primary outcome was Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT). Six prognostic factors: CRS subtypes, serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E level, membered lactone ring of macrolides, concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), and dosage and duration of the LDMs were assessed by subgroup analyses.

Results

Ten studies (608 patients) met the inclusion criteria. LDMs and placebo were not different in SNOT improvement (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.69 to 0.24). Subgroup analyses showed that the effects favored LDMs in the patients with CRS without polyps (SMD = -0.64, 95% CI: -1.01 to -0.27) compared to CRS with polyps, and the patients receiving a half dose (SMD = -0.64, 95% CI: -1.01 to -0.27) compared to a very low dose. There was no difference in SNOT improvement between LDMs plus standard treatment compared to standard treatment (SMD = -0.52, 95% CI: -1.57 to 0.53). Subgroup analyses showed that the effects favored LDMs in the patients receiving LDMs for a duration of 24weeks (SMD = -1.68, 95% CI: -2.40 to -0.95) compared to 8 and 12weeks. There was no difference between the 14-membered and 15-membered ring LDMs. Assessment of concurrent ESS found mixed results. Serum IgE level could not be assessed.

Conclusions

LDMs provided favorable outcomes in patients with CRS without polyps. A half dose of macrolides should be given for a duration of 24weeks.

### The role of macrolides and doxycycline in chronic rhinosinusitis [^114dQHKk]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy has become an important adjunct in the management of recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) because of some antibiotics' immunomodulatory properties even at subtherapeutic antimicrobial levels. Macrolide antibiotics, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, decrease production of proinflammatory cytokines, impair neutrophil recruitment, inhibit bacterial biofilm formation, and improve mucus quality. Doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, inhibits the activity of matrix metalloproteinases in CRS with nasal polyposis. This article reviews the clinical applications for macrolide and doxycycline use in CRS, considerations for dosing and duration of treatment, and important side effects and drug interactions associated with these medications.

### Role of antibiotics in sinusitis [^114GUfmC]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Sinusitis is a leading reason for outpatient antibiotic use, but symptoms are nonspecific. We review potential methods that might enhance the ability to appropriately prescribe antibiotics.

Recent Findings

The evidence base for antibiotic use in acute rhinosinusitis is strongest in studies with stringent entry criteria. In less restrictive studies antibiotics and placebo perform equally. Bacteria from nasopharyngeal swabs in adults correlate with sinus cultures. A recent study showed that antibiotics shortened the duration of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) symptoms in children. Tellingly, over 2000 children with symptoms were screened to enroll less than 10% who fulfilled the study's stringent criteria. In chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), two grade 1 studies on efficacy of long-term macrolide therapy showed conflicting results. Odontogenic sinusitis is underappreciated and frequently fails to grow on culture because of presumed difficulty in growing anaerobes.

Summary

There is currently no grade 1 evidence to support antibiotic use in CRS; however, studies to date have not been conducted in patients with isolated purulent sinusitis. Future use of cultures to direct antibiotic therapy, such as nasopharyngeal swabs in adults with ARS or endoscopically guided cultures, may aid in targeting antibiotic therapy more effectively.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: macrolide in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis after endoscopic sinus surgery [^115evo3F]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of macrolide antibiotics therapy in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) receiving endoscopic sinus surgery.

Data Sources

PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library.

Review Methods

The electronic databases were comprehensively searched on June 2, 2022, for randomized controlled trials on macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of patients undergoing CRS endoscopic surgery. The primary outcome measures were the sinonasal outcome test (SNOT) score and the visual analog scale (VAS) score. The secondary outcome measures were the nasal endoscopy score (NES), the sinus computed tomography score, and adverse events.

Results

A total of 8 studies were included, involving 606 patients who used macrolide for a long time. Meta-analysis showed that no significant difference was observed in SNOT (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.38 to 0.13, I² = 0%) and VAS (SMD = -0.10; 95% CI, -0.88 to 0.68, I² = 81%) between the macrolide and placebo groups. However, macrolide outperformed the placebo in improving NES (SMD = -0.32; 95% CI, -0.62 to -0.03, I² = 21%). The use of macrolide did not increase the incidence of adverse events.

Conclusion

Long-term use of macrolide after CRS surgery may not significantly improve the quality of life and disease severity of the patients but may play a role in improving postoperative NES in patients with CRS. There is still no sufficient evidence to determine whether the disease phenotype of CRS or the patient's race will affect the efficacy of long-term use of macrolide after CRS.

### Medical therapies for adult chronic sinusitis: a systematic review [^111Fh2bq]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic sinusitis is a common inflammatory condition defined by persistent symptomatic inflammation of the sinonasal cavities lasting longer than 3 months. It accounts for 1% to 2% of total physician encounters and is associated with large health care expenditures. Appropriate use of medical therapies for chronic sinusitis is necessary to optimize patient quality of life (QOL) and daily functioning and minimize the risk of acute inflammatory exacerbations.

Objective

To summarize the highest-quality evidence on medical therapies for adult chronic sinusitis and provide an evidence-based approach to assist in optimizing patient care.

Evidence Review

A systematic review searched Ovid MEDLINE (1947-January 30, 2015), EMBASE, and Cochrane Databases. The search was limited to randomized clinical trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Evidence was categorized into maintenance and intermittent or rescue therapies and reported based on the presence or absence of nasal polyps.

Findings

Twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria: 12 meta-analyses (> 60 RCTs), 13 systematic reviews, and 4 RCTs that were not included in any of the meta-analyses. Saline irrigation improved symptom scores compared with no treatment (standardized mean difference [SMD], 1.42 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.84]; a positive SMD indicates improvement). Topical corticosteroid therapy improved overall symptom scores (SMD, -0.46 [95% CI, -0.65 to -0.27]; a negative SMD indicates improvement), improved polyp scores (SMD, -0.73 [95% CI, -1.0 to -0.46]; a negative SMD indicates improvement), and reduced polyp recurrence after surgery (relative risk, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79]). Systemic corticosteroids and oral doxycycline (both for 3 weeks) reduced polyp size compared with placebo for 3 months after treatment (P < .001). Leukotriene antagonists improved nasal symptoms compared with placebo in patients with nasal polyps (P < .01). Macrolide antibiotic for 3 months was associated with improved QOL at a single time point (24 weeks after therapy) compared with placebo for patients without polyps (SMD, -0.43 [95% CI, -0.82 to -0.05]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Evidence supports daily high-volume saline irrigation with topical corticosteroid therapy as a first-line therapy for chronic sinusitis. A short course of systemic corticosteroids (1–3 weeks), short course of doxycycline (3 weeks), or a leukotriene antagonist may be considered in patients with nasal polyps. A prolonged course (3 months) of macrolide antibiotic may be considered for patients without polyps.

### Macrolides for the treatment of chronic sinusitis, asthma, and COPD [^117PD7Rd]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

In addition to their well-known antimicrobial activity, macrolides possess immunomodulatory properties that may confer beneficial effects to patients with respiratory diseases associated with chronic inflammation. These properties include attenuation of inflammatory responses in the lung, mucoregulatory properties, and effects on bronchial responsiveness. Macrolides increase mucociliary clearance, improve sinusitis symptoms, and decrease nasal secretions and polyp size in patients with sinusitis. They also have been shown to modify the inflammatory response associated with chronic sinusitis. In patients with asthma, macrolides have been reported to reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and improve pulmonary function, and have historically been selected for their "steroid-sparing" effect. Preliminary data from studies of patients with COPD have shown improvements in symptom scores and FEV(1) after macrolide treatment. As biological response modifiers, macrolides have the potential to improve the outcomes of patients with inflammatory airway diseases. Large scale, placebo-controlled clinical trials designed to assess long-term efficacy and safety in these diseases are warranted.

### Long-term, low-dose macrolide antibiotic treatment in pediatric chronic airway diseases [^116dTpGn]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis

CRS is a common chronic airway disease in pediatrics. The treatment includes short-term anti-infective therapy, intranasal steroid therapy, nasal irrigation, and endoscopic sinus surgery, but there are still 20% of patients whose symptoms are difficult to control after standard internal and surgical treatment, which is called recalcitrant CRS. At present, it is believed that CRS is a group of heterogeneous diseases caused by the interaction of multiple factors, and its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely clear. Infection, abnormal anatomical structure, abnormal ciliary movement, chronic inflammation, tissue remodeling, systemic and environmental factors, etc. alone or interaction may lead to the persistence of CRS. Bacterial biofilm formation and superantigen formation are important mechanisms for evading host immune response and could be important factors for the persistence of recurrent and recalcitrant CRS inflammation. Besides, CRS is a disease in which local tissue inflammation is strongly biased toward Th2 inflammation. Therefore, medicine to prevent the formation of bacterial biofilm and inhibit Th2 inflammation has become one of the options for the treatment of recalcitrant CRS.

Based on the macrolide effects, researchers have successively used macrolides in the treatment of CRS. An early study published in 2003 showed that clarithromycin [5–8 mg/(kg·day), 8–15 weeks] have a certain therapeutic significance for pediatric CRS; however, due to the lack of placebo control, this study has some limitations. Regrettably, there have been no large-sample, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials targeting children. A meta-analysis from 2018 showed that LLMAT can significantly improve nasal endoscopy and computed tomography scores in adult CRS patients, clarithromycin 500 mg BID for 2 weeks and 250 mg QD for 6 weeksand azithromycin 250 mg QD for 12 weekscould be used as a reference. LLMAT can theoretically relieve symptoms and improve the endoscopic performance of CRS; however, the current clinical evidence is susceptible to random biases due to lack of power, and it is still not clear about the indications and prognostic effects of long-term macrolide therapy in children with CRS based on current evidence. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct large sample randomized controlled trials to provide evidence. Routine macrolide therapy is not recommended by the latest guidelines for children with CRS, but based on theoretical benefits, it could be considered as an alternative therapy after weighing the advantages and disadvantages in the children with recalcitrant CRS.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114Rs9Za]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — assessment before prescribing antibacterial therapy: The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with CRS if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination. Evidence strength is a strong recommendation based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are limited in number but demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm when limiting the indiscriminate use of antibiotics for CRS treatment. Benefits include avoiding therapy designed to address an infectious condition when no infection exists; prevent harm and adverse effects from therapy that is not beneficial; limit induced bacterial resistance; reduce cost, while risks include possibly missing or delaying therapy for a bacterial infection that does not have obvious discolored or purulent nasal discharge. The word "significant" is used to allow for clinician judgment regarding the severity of the purulence and the impact on the patient; the word "persistent" is used to limit making a judgment on a single observation. Exceptions note that macrolide antibiotics may exhibit anti-inflammatory properties that may provide therapeutic benefits for select CRS patients, although the data for macrolide antibiotics in CRS treatment are mixed. Supporting context clarifies that antibiotic therapy has had a role in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, which is characterized by purulent nasal drainage that persists for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms or worsens within 10 days after an initial improvement.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps in adults [^111nqUKK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common health problem which significantly affects quality of life. A wide range of medical and surgical therapies have been used to treat CRS. Both systemic and topical antibiotics are used with the aim of eliminating infection and inflammation, altering bacterial biofilm formation, reversing ostial occlusion and improving symptoms. Various groups of systemic antibiotics have been studied; clinical cure rates reported are inconsistent and range from 50% to 95%.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and adverse reactions associated with systemic antibiotic therapy for CRS in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; CENTRAL (2010, Issue 2); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 10 June 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic antibiotics with placebo for chronic rhinosinusitis in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data independently, compared results and resolved disagreements by discussion. We assessed treatment effect by calculating the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of cure at a specific time point for each trial. We used mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous variables (severity scores, duration of symptoms, etc.).

Main Results

We included one study involving 64 patients. We assessed the overall risk of bias in this study as high. The study reported that roxithromycin could reduce the mean response score of patients by 0.73 points on a 1 to 6-point scale (95% CI 0.32 to 1.14, P = 0.0005) compared to those on placebo at three months after the start of treatment. This study also used sinonasal outcome test-20 (SNOT-20) comparing between pre and post-treatment at six, 12 and 24 weeks. The mean change in SNOT-20 from baseline at 24 weeks in the roxithromycin group was not significantly more than in the placebo group, at 0.27 points (95% CI -0.24 to 0.78, P = 0.30) on a 0 to 5-point scale.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence from one small study to support the use of systemic antibiotics for the curative treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. Further good quality trials, with large sample sizes, are needed to evaluate the use of antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^116GSbUg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on current evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and will also summarize the current guidelines.

### Clinical implications of the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides on sinusitis [^116Ea3Z4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This article reviews the treatment of chronic sinusitis with macrolides. Chronic sinusitis is often the result of bacterial infections that lead to chronic inflammation with thickening of the sinus mucosa and hypersecretion of mucus. In addition to their anti-infective properties, some macrolides possess immunomodulatory effects. These macrolides have been used successfully to treat diffuse panbronchiolitis, a progressive inflammatory lung disease, and may be useful for treatment of asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. The clinical benefits of macrolides in patients with chronic sinusitis include decreased nasal secretions and postnasal drip, with improvement in nasal obstruction. In vivo and in vitro studies show that some macrolides affect neutrophil chemotaxis and infiltration, inflammatory cytokine production, mucus production, and the transportability of airway secretions. These findings indicate that macrolides are promising agents for treating chronic inflammation of the airways.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^114uHCQS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Several other non placebo-controlled randomized studies compared parallel, short term antibiotics regimes in cases of CRS.(,–) Fan et al. found that patients in a higher dose clarithromycin group demonstrated better nasal symptom, Lund-Kennedy and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20) scores at weeks 2 and 4 compared with both baseline values and the low dose clarithromycin group. Namyslowski et al. showed improvement in CRS or AECRS symptoms at days 3 to 5 in patients taking amoxicillin/clavulanate, compared to those taking cefuroxime. However, by days 15 to 18, there was no significant difference in clinical cure rates or bacteriologic eradication between the groups. The other five studies had some nuanced results, but to summarize, showed no difference in symptomatology outcomes between head-to-head comparisons of various antibiotics given in short term courses. The absence of a placebo arm in these studies precludes substantive conclusions. A minority of these studies evaluated outcomes after one month.

There have been a number of studies of the efficacy of long-term macrolide and non-macrolide antibiotics in CRSsNP and CRSwNP. Several phase 4 studies have demonstrated symptom improvement, but each study has methodological flaws that limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the results. These studies have been reviewed in great detail elsewhere.

To date, there have been only two published DBRCTsof long-term antibiotic therapy for CRS. Both studies evaluated 12-week treatment with macrolides: Wallwork et al. evaluated roxithromycin at 150mg daily in 64 patients with CRSsNP, while Videler et al. evaluated azithromycin (AZM) 500mg once per week in 60 patients with CRS with or without polyps.

Wallwork et al. observed a significant improvement in SNOT-20 scores, saccharin transit time and nasal endoscopy in the treatment group (all p < 0.05). When the groups were subdivided post hoc into low (< 200μg/L) and high (> 200μg/L) immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, the low IgE group treated with roxithromycin had significant improvements in saccharin transit time, endoscopy and IL-8 in nasal lavage. Some patients maintained this improvement for more than three months but others did not, and the initial improvement in symptoms failed to maintain significance at long term follow up.

### Systemic and topical antibiotics for chronic rhinosinusitis [^115NsxWK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Systemic and topical antibiotics are used with the aim of eliminating infection in the short term (and some to reduce inflammation in the long term), in order to normalise nasal mucus and improve symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2015, Issue 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 September 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing systemic or topical antibiotic treatment to (a) placebo or (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - gastrointestinal disturbance. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) and anaphylaxis or other very serious reactions. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (293 participants), all of which compared systemic antibiotics with placebo or another pharmacological intervention. The varying study characteristics made comparison difficult. Four studies recruited only adults and one only children. Three used macrolide, one tetracycline and one a cephalosporin-type antibiotic. Three recruited only patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, one recruited patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and one had a mixed population. Three followed up patients for 10 to 12 weeks after treatment had finished. Systemic antibiotics versus placebo Three studies compared antibiotics with placebo (176 participants). One study (64 participants, without polyps) reported disease-specific HRQL using the SNOT-20 (0 to 5, 0 = best quality of life). At the end of treatment (three months) the SNOT-20 score was lower in the group receiving macrolide antibiotics than the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -0.54 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.10), corresponding to a moderate effect size favouring antibiotics (moderate quality evidence). Three months after treatment, it is uncertain if there was a difference between groups. One study (33 participants, with polyps) provided information on gastrointestinal disturbances and suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) after a short course of tetracycline antibiotic compared with placebo. We are very uncertain if antibiotics were associated with an increase in gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.50) or skin irritation (RR 6.67, 95% CI 0.34 to 128.86) (very low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids One study (60 participants, some with and some without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with placebo; all participants also used saline irrigation and 70% used intranasal corticosteroids. Disease-specific HRQL was reported using SNOT-22 (0 to 110, 0 = best quality of life). Data were difficult to interpret (highly skewed and baseline imbalances) and it is unclear if there was an important difference at any time point (low quality evidence). To assess patient-reported disease severity participants rated the effect of treatment on a five-point scale (-2 for "desperately worse" to 2 for "cured") at the end of treatment (three months). For improvement in symptoms there was no difference between the antibiotics and placebo groups; the RR was 1.50 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.79; very low quality evidence), although there were also slightly more people who felt worse after treatment in the antibiotics group. There was no demonstrable difference in the rate of gastrointestinal disturbances between the groups (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.10). General HRQL was measured using the SF-36. The authors stated that there was no difference between groups at the end of treatment (12 weeks) or two weeks later. Systemic antibiotics versus intranasal corticosteroids One study (43 participants, without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with intranasal corticosteroids. Patient-reported disease severity was assessed using a composite symptom score (0 to 40; 0 = no symptoms). It is very uncertain if there was a difference as patient-reported disease severity was similar between groups (MD -0.32, 95% CI -2.11 to 1.47; low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics versus oral corticosteroids One study (28 participants, with polyps) compared a short course of tetracycline antibiotic (unclear duration, ˜20 days) with a 20-day course of oral corticosteroids. We were unable to extract data on any of the primary efficacy outcomes. It is uncertain if there was a difference ingastrointestinal disturbances (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.14) or skin irritation (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 19.62) as the results for these outcomes were similar between groups (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found very little evidence that systemic antibiotics are effective in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. We did find moderate quality evidence of a modest improvement in disease-specific quality of life in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps receiving three months of a macrolide antibiotic. The size of improvement was moderate (0.5 points on a five-point scale) and only seen at the end of the three-month treatment; by three months later no difference was found. Despite a general understanding that antibiotics can be associated with adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, the results in this review were very uncertain because the studies were small and few events were reported. No RCTs of topical antibiotics met the inclusion criteria. More research in this area, particularly evaluating longer-term outcomes and adverse effects, is required.

Macrolides are regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) due to their favorable effects on patient outcomes. These drugs decrease sputum production, thereby improving pulmonary function. Moreover, these effects are independent of dosing with respect to clarithromycin, erythromycin, and roxithromycin. The marked success of macrolides in this disease is a direct effect of impeding the inflammatory cascade. With their abilities to reduce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, ameliorate the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways, and reduce mucus secretion, macrolides are able to improve pulmonary function and quality of life in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases of the airways. Although prolonged use of macrolides raises concerns of increased adverse effects, data do not support such occurrences. With respect to concerns of resistance, it should be noted that in Japan, where macrolides are part of the treatment for DPB, these agents continue to be used effectively as antimicrobial agents. Therefore, the potential benefits of the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides in other conditions such as cystic fibrosis, chronic sinusitis, asthma, and chronic bronchitis are under investigation.

### The clinical effectiveness of clarithromycin versus endoscopic sinus surgery for adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps (MACRO): a pragmatic, multicentre, three-arm, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 4 trial [^114ZHhtv]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

A paucity of evidence regarding use of endoscopic sinus surgery and antibiotics in managing chronic rhinosinusitis has contributed to a five-times variation in endoscopic sinus surgery rates, as well as variation in the use of antibiotics. The main aim of the present trial was to compare the clinical effectiveness of endoscopic sinus surgery or 3 months of clarithromycin treatment alongside intranasal medication in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps.

Methods

In this pragmatic, three-arm, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 4 trial, participants were recruited from 20 secondary and tertiary care sites in the UK. Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with chronic rhinosinusitis remaining symptomatic following appropriate medical therapy (intranasal corticosteroids, saline nasal irrigations, and a short course of antibiotics) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive endoscopic sinus surgery (within 6 weeks of randomisation if waiting lists allowed) plus intranasal medication, clarithromycin (250 mg twice a day for 2 weeks then 250 mg once a day for 10 weeks) plus intranasal medication, or placebo plus intranasal medication. Intranasal medication comprised intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigations. Participants were allocated with an automated, web-based secure randomisation system in permuted blocks of varying size (block sizes of three and six), stratified by the presence of polyps and trial site. Participants and site teams were masked to the clarithromycin and placebo allocations, including for outcome assessment. The primary outcome measure was the total score on the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) quality-of-life questionnaire at 6 months after randomisation, with analysis by intention to treat (ITT; available-case basis). Adverse reactions were assessed in the safety population (clarithromycin and placebo), and serious adverse events in the ITT population (all groups). The trial was registered on the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN36962030, and EudraCT, 2018–001100–11, and is complete, with optional long-term follow-up ongoing.

Findings

Between Nov 1, 2018, and Oct 13, 2023, 514 participants (181 [35%] female and 333 [65%] male), with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (n = 410) or chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (n = 104), were recruited and randomly assigned to receive endoscopic sinus surgery (n = 171), clarithromycin (n = 172), or placebo (n = 171), all with intranasal medication. SNOT-22 scores at 6 months after randomisation were significantly lower (at the 98.33% confidence level after Bonferroni adjustment) in the endoscopic sinus surgery group than in the clarithromycin group (adjusted mean difference -18.13 [98.33% CI -24.26 to -11.99], p < 0.0001) and placebo group (-20.44 [-26.42 to -14.46], p < 0.0001). 6-month SNOT-22 scores did not differ significantly between participants randomly assigned to clarithromycin versus placebo (-3.11 [-8.56 to 2.33], p = 0.17). Ten serious adverse events occurred in nine participants (two events in two [1%] of 172 participants allocated to clarithromycin, three events in three [2%] of 171 allocated to placebo, and five events in four [2%] of 171 allocated to endoscopic sinus surgery), none of which were fatal.

Interpretation

The MACRO trial shows that endoscopic sinus surgery has clinical effectiveness in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, providing significantly improved disease-specific quality of life at 6 months. Conversely, the trial findings do not support routine long-term use of low-dose clarithromycin. Endoscopic sinus surgery should be recommended if intranasal medication alone is unable to achieve symptom control.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^11618bS1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis — antibiotic duration and adverse events: the guideline recommends 5 to 7 days of empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected ABRS instead of 5 to 10 days, citing a systematic review finding no difference in clinical success for antibiotics given for 3 to 7 days versus 6 to 10 days and similar success when 5 days were compared with 10 days; adverse events are common with antibiotic therapy with an average event rate of 15% to 40%, and antibiotic therapy increases adverse event rate on average by 10% to 12% over placebo with an odds ratio of 1.8 to 2.1; the incidence of adverse events is lower when antibiotics are given for 5 days instead of 10 days (odds ratio, 0.79), so short courses should be considered for patients with less severe illness.

Adult sinusitis update — evidence for placebo versus antibiotic therapy and delayed prescription: In an RCT of delayed versus immediate or no antibiotic treatment in 405 adults with acute uncomplicated respiratory infections (20% with acute rhinosinusitis), delayed strategies resulted in similar symptom burden and duration but significantly reduced antibiotic use and associated adverse events; a systematic review of 11 studies confirmed these findings, and another review included 15 RCTs with the caveat that only ~50% of clinically diagnosed ABRS had positive bacterial cultures, while in adults spontaneous recovery with placebo or no treatment is common (46% after 1 week and 64% after 2 weeks), serious complications are rare (0.57–5.89 per 10,000 cases), antibiotic treatment provides only marginal benefit (NNTB = 18), and adverse events are more frequent with antibiotics (13 per 100 more compared to placebo or no treatment, NNTH = 8).

### Long-term, low-dose macrolide antibiotic treatment in pediatric chronic airway diseases [^112kCoEE]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Therefore, it is urgent to investigate the field with respect to the non-anti-infective effect of macrolide antibiotics in children. Chronic airway diseases in children include chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), bronchial asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), BO, etc. The above diseases are all related to one or more of the aspects involving respiratory tract infection and/or injury, chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract, mucus hypersecretion, damage to the mucociliary clearance system, and abnormal epithelial regeneration of the body, and these aspects could interact as causes and effects and vicious circle, causing the diseases protracted. The ideal long-term and low-dose macrolides are drugs with small adverse reactions, a long half-life, and little effect on other combined drugs. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) oxidase is a superfamily of heme, which is involved in the metabolism of most drugs. CYP450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4) is the most common one of the CYP450 family. Azithromycin has a long half-life, which makes weekly administration possible. Compared with other macrolide drugs, azithromycin does not affect the activity of CYP3A4, and has become a research hotspot. In recent years, the evidence-based medical evidence of the anti-inflammatory effects of macrolide antibiotic therapy to treat chronic airway inflammation in children has gradually increased. For example, macrolides represented by azithromycin were used to reduce airway inflammation in children with severe asthma, CF, non-CF bronchiectasis, etc. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the evidence of the usage of long-term, low-dose macrolide antibiotic therapy (LLMAT) in the treatment of chronic airway diseases in children and the progress in recent years and provide clinical references.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^111Rp4ur]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Macrolides inhibit protein synthesis, exerting their antimicrobial effect by preventing the bacterial ribosome from translating messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) into new proteins. Macrolide antibiotics have a range of activities, being bacteriostatic against many strains of commonly cultured respiratory tract pathogens. However, macrolides also possess several anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities that may be important in their role in the treatment of CRS. The immunomodulatory properties of macrolides are shared by the 14-membered lactone ring macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin) and the 15-membered lactone ring macrolides (azithromycin). The precise mechanism of the immunomodulatory properties is unknown, though it has been proposed that macrolides inhibit mucus hypersecretion, activate mucociliary function, modulate the production of cytokines and chemokines, have a suppressive effect on lymphocytic activity and inhibit bacterial functions such as quorum-sensing and biofilm formation.

Antibiotic penetration into the sinonasal mucosa and mucus beyond the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) would be anticipated to be required for efficacy. While a few studies report observing MIC, there is limited evidence of correlation with clinical efficacy. A small randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery who were given either doxycycline or roxithromycin immediately preoperatively were found to have therapeutic concentrations in the sinus tissue and serum, but not in mucus. This finding provides another reason why non-macrolide antibiotics have not been found to be effective for the treatment of CRS

### Macrolides and airway inflammation in children [^1169RotN]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

For more than 20 years macrolide antibiotics have been used to treat chronic inflammatory airway diseases based on their immunomodulatory activity. Macrolide antibiotics down-regulate damaging prolonged inflammation as well as increase mucus clearance, decrease bacterial virulence and prevent biofilm formation. Initially shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in diffuse panbronchiolitis and in steroid-dependent asthma, long-term macrolide therapy has now been shown to significantly reduce exacerbations and improve lung function and quality of life in children with cystic fibrosis. They have also proven beneficial in Japanese children and adults with chronic sinobronchitis especially when there is nasal polyposis. Long-term macrolides have also proven clinically beneficial in some patients with plastic bronchitis. Adverse reactions are few and generally self-limited when used at the recommended dosage for immunomodulation.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^115RpSD6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Cystic fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition caused by a mutation in the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein, which leads to impaired chloride ion transport and consequently viscous mucus, mucociliary dysfunction and bacterial colonization of the upper and the lower airway tract. CRS is almost universal in patients with CF, and the resulting morbidity and impact on quality of life have become better recognized in recent years. The increasingly longer lifespan of CF patients may result in more patients requiring treatment for CF-related CRS.

The lower airway of CF patients tends to have polymicrobial colonization, and there is a growing appreciation of the close correlation between upper and lower airway microbial populations. Clinical experience suggests that reducing the bacterial load in the airways leads to symptom improvement. However, achieving this can be particularly challenging as, apart from the polymicrobial nature, bacteria exist in different phenotypes and niches, which may have a great impact on their sensitivity to antibiotics. Bacteria can be in a planktonic state in the mucus and within surface biofilms, and the number of intramucosal bacteria in CF CRS patients has been observed to be significantly higher than in idiopathic CRS.

Longitudinal studies of the microbiota of CF patients suggest that the bacterial organisms in the lower airway tract of CF patients tend to be relatively constant over time, other than during temporary changes associated with acute infections or treatment. Given the strong correlation between upper and lower airway microbial populations, it could be inferred from these observations that the CF CRS bacterial population is also resistant to change.

There is little consensus on the optimal use of antibiotics in CF-related CRS. Nebulized tobramycin and oral fluoroquinolones are often prescribed. Macrolides have demonstrated some efficacy in both upper and lower airways, but there are limited studies specifically performed in CF CRS patients. There is some evidence that adding CFTR modulating agents such as Ivacaftor and Trikafta or DNAse mucolytics such as Dornase alpha to concurrent antibiotic courses increases the therapeutic efficacy.

Pediatric CRS

Generally accepted medical treatment algorithms in the pediatric CRS population are not dissimilar to adults with idiopathic CRS, but there is even less evidence on which to base recommendations. No high-level evidence supports short or long term antibiotics, but an empiric broad-spectrum systemic antibiotic trial may be trialled.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) surgical management — preoperative medical therapy prerequisite: The surgeon should not endorse or require a predefined, one-size-fits-all regimen or duration of medical therapy as a prerequisite to sinus surgery for an adult with CRS, with evidence strength described as a "Recommendation based on RCTs and meta-analyses" and a "Level of confidence in the evidence. High". Benefits include to "Avoid delays in surgery; reduce costs; avoid adverse effects of medications that are unlikely to benefit the patient", while risks include "Misinterpretation of this recommendation as a reason to withhold or limit any or all medical therapy for CRS". Supporting text emphasizes that although candidacy often follows prior appropriate medical therapy, the type and duration "should not be defined by a singular, one-size-fits-all medical treatment algorithm", and an SR of "387 distinct clinical trials" showed wide variation in preoperative regimens. A recent international consensus "noted that an aggregate grade of evidence for oral nonmacrolide antibiotic therapy for either greater than or less than 3 weeks in CRS without polyposis could not be ascertained" and "recommends against nonmacrolide antibiotics for less than 3 weeks to treat sinusitis with polyposis outside of an acute exacerbation", with "no recommendation… for greater than 3 weeks", which "suggests that necessitating oral antibiotic therapy across all CRS patients before considering surgical candidacy is not supported in the current literature". A notable subtype exception is "a fungal ball", for which "the treatment is exclusively surgical (see KAS 4)".

### Lack of efficacy of long-term, low-dose azithromycin in chronic rhinosinusitis: a randomized controlled trial [^112aqJ2P]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In persistent chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), conventional treatment is often insufficient. Long-term, low-dose administration of macrolides has been suggested as a treatment option. The MACS (Macrolides in chronic rhinosinusitis) study is a randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of azithromycin (AZM) in CRS.

Methods

We describe a group of patients with recalcitrant CRS with and without nasal polyps unresponsive to optimal medical and (in 92% also) surgical treatment. Patients were treated with AZM or placebo. AZM was given for 3 days at 500 mg during the first week, followed by 500 mg per week for the next 11 weeks. Patients were monitored until 3 months post-therapy. The assessments included Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22), a Patient Response Rating Scale, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Short Form-36 (SF-36), rigid nasal endoscopy, peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF), Sniffin' Sticks smell tests and endoscopically guided middle meatus cultures.

Results

Sixty patients with a median age of 49 years were included. Fifty per cent had asthma and 58% had undergone revision sinus surgery. In the SNOT-22, Patient Response Rating Scale, VAS scores and SF-36, no significant difference between the AZM and the placebo groups was demonstrated. Nasal endoscopic findings, PNIF results, smell tests and microbiology showed no relevant significant differences between the groups either.

Conclusion

At the investigated dose of AZM over 3 months, no significant benefit was found over placebo. Possible reasons could be disease severity in the investigated group, under-dosage of AZM and under-powering of the study. Therefore, more research is urgently required.

### Long-term treatment with clarithromycin and carbocisteine improves lung function in chronic cough patients with chronic rhinosinusitis [^1164yq4F]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chronic cough is a common complaint. Because the pathophysiology of chronic cough is complicated, the management of chronic cough is challenging. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has examined the effect of macrolide antibiotics in chronic cough patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. The purpose of this study is to determine the changes in lung function for chronic cough patients with chronic rhinosinusitis who are treated by clarithromycin and carbocisteine.

Materials and Methods

Thirty-two chronic cough patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were recruited. Patients using inhaled corticosteroids and/or a bronchodilator, asthmatic patients, and patients with abnormal findings on auscultation and/or chest X-ray examination were excluded from this study. The patients received low-dose clarithromycin treatment for 3 months. Both before and after the treatment, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses, lung function test, peripheral blood test, and sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-20) were applied.

Results

Both the lung function and Lund-MacKay CT scores were improved by the long-duration therapy with macrolide antibiotics. The change in obstructive pulmonary function and the improvement of the CT score in each subject were significantly correlated. SNOT scores also improved after the treatment.

Conclusions

The macrolide antibiotics treatment has beneficial effects on lung function in non-asthmatic chronic cough patients with normal chest X-ray findings. The improvement of chronic rhinosinusitis may have some role in the lung condition. Upper respiratory tract examination and treatment may be useful for the management of chronic cough.

### The evidence base for the optimal antibiotic treatment duration of upper and lower respiratory tract infections: an umbrella review [^1115KrVP]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

Many trials, reviews, and meta-analyses have been performed on the comparison of short versus long antibiotic treatment in respiratory tract infections, generally supporting shorter treatment. The aim of this umbrella review is to assess the soundness of the current evidence base for optimal antibiotic treatment duration.

Methods

A search in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection was performed on May 1, 2024, without date and language restrictions. Systematic reviews addressing treatment durations in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), acute sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or pharyngotonsillitis were included. Studies from inpatient and outpatient settings were included; reviews in paediatric populations were excluded. Outcomes of interest were clinical and bacteriological cure, microbiological eradication, mortality, relapse rate, and adverse events. The quality of the reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool, risk of bias of all included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (version 1), and overall quality of evidence according to GRADE.

Findings

We identified 30 systematic reviews meeting the criteria; they were generally of a low to critically low quality. 21 reviews conducted a meta-analysis. For CAP outside the intensive care unit (ICU; 14 reviews, of which eight did a meta-analysis) and AECOPD (eight reviews, of which five did a meta-analysis), there was sufficient evidence supporting a treatment duration of 5 days; evidence for shorter durations is scarce. Evidence on non-ventilator-associated HAP is absent, despite identifying three reviews (of which one did a meta-analysis), since no trials were conducted exclusively in this population. For sinusitis the evidence appears to support a shorter regimen, but more evidence is needed in the population who actually require antibiotic treatment. For pharyngotonsillitis (eight reviews, of which six did a meta-analysis), sufficient evidence exists to support short-course cephalosporin but not short-course penicillin when dosed three times a day.

Interpretation

The available evidence for non-ICU CAP and AECOPD supports a short-course treatment duration of 5 days in patients who have clinically improved. Efforts of the scientific community should be directed at implementing this evidence in daily practice. High-quality RCTs are needed to underpin even shorter treatment durations for CAP and AECOPD, to establish the optimal treatment duration of HAP and acute sinusitis, and to evaluate shorter duration using an optimal penicillin dosing schedule in patients with pharyngotonsillitis.

The guideline covers the use of macrolide in adults (> 16 years) where the duration of treatment exceeds that usually employed to treat an acute infection and the dosage is less than that usually employed to treat an acute infection. Such usage is considered to be exerting an effect through mechanisms other than a direct antibacterial one, commonly described as immunomodulatory mechanisms. We have characterised this as long-term, low-dose usage.

In addition, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) has looked at safety issues surrounding the long-term use of macrolides at both patient and population levels to help to formulate pragmatic guidance in this area based on the best available evidence combined with clinical experience.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114QSqQp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis — antibiotic use and diagnostic evaluation during exacerbations: Despite the limited evidence of the efficacy of short- and long-term antibiotics for routine CRS treatment, the use of antibiotics in CRS patients may be appropriate if bacterial infection results in acute exacerbation, and evidence of purulence within the middle meatus or nasal cavity of a symptomatic CRS patient may reasonably indicate that bacterial infection is contributing to exacerbation. To assess for the presence of sinonasal purulence, anterior rhinoscopy, oropharyngeal examination, or nasal endoscopy can be performed before prescribing antibiotic therapy, and repeated physical examination seems preferable to reflexive antibiotic usage or indiscriminately repeated CT scans. Specific recommendations regarding antibiotic choice, dosage, and treatment duration are not sufficiently supported by published data, but antibiotic selection based on endoscopically guided cultures may provide clinically meaningful improvements in nasal findings and patient-reported symptoms. Known side effects of antibiotic use include gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, liver enzyme disruptions, and Clostridium difficile colitis, and there are pertinent concerns about the development of multidrug-resistant bacteria from the inappropriate and injudicious use of antibiotics.

### Telithromycin new product overview [^112vmfx6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs), including community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and acute bacterial sinusitis, contribute substantially to health care costs in the United States. Although many prescriptions for antibiotics are written each year for the treatment of CARTIs, most are prescribed on an empiric basis. Concerns about the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and the changing pattern of pathogens isolated from subjects with CARTIs have raised questions about the empiric treatment paradigm. When choosing appropriate antimicrobial therapy for CARTIs, physicians must consider not only the spectrum of activity of antibiotics but also the potential risk of resistance. Telithromycin is the first member of the ketolide class, a new family of antimicrobials structurally related to the macrolides, to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CARTIs. The spectrum of activity of telithromycin includes common typical and atypical causative pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections, including antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Clinical trials have shown that telithromycin is as effective as traditionally used antimicrobial agents in the treatment of mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and acute bacterial sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^116HBEpY]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Results

Between 2013 and 2015, 931 015 consultations for the 13 included indications led to antibiotic prescriptions. This subset — which focused on common conditions, but excluded chronic and recurrent cases, repeat prescriptions, and antibiotic prophylaxis — covered about 20% of total antibiotics being prescribed (for any condition) during the study period. The most common indications were acute cough and bronchitis (386 972, 41.6% of the included consultations), acute sore throat (239 231, 25.7%), acute otitis media (83 054, 8.9%), acute sinusitis (76 683, 8.2%), cellulitis (54 610, 5.9%), and acute cystitis (53 010, 5.7%). Durations of antibiotic treatment for the included indications showed poor guideline adherence for several indications (fig 1 and supplementary figs S1-S8).

Fig 1
Durations of antibiotic prescriptions for various indications

For all conditions grouped together, about 1.3 million days beyond the durations recommended by guidelines (table 2), which remained the same during 2013–15.

Table 2
Percentage of antibiotics with a duration exceeding guideline recommendations for all patients and antibiotics

COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Most of the excess days were due to respiratory indications (table 2). Antibiotic treatments for respiratory indications, including otitis media, accounted for more than two thirds of the total prescriptions considered, and 80% or more of these treatment courses exceeded guideline recommendations (table 2). A notable exception was acute sinusitis, for which only 9.6% (95% confidence interval 9.4% to 9.9%) of prescriptions were longer than the seven days recommended by the PHE 2013 guidance. For some indications, guidelines recommend longer durations for patients who are more unwell, such as those with pneumonia and a CRB65 (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, 65 years and older) score of 1 or 2, or a range of appropriate durations (supplementary table S1). A much smaller proportion of patients received antibiotic prescriptions exceeding these upper boundaries (table 2 and supplementary table S3).

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^111cLH1r]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — nonmacrolide antibiotics: Short-term versus long-term antibiotic courses are defined as "3 weeks or less" versus "3 weeks or more". In a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that "enrolled 47 adult patients with CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)", a "20-day" doxycycline arm (n = 14) was compared with a "20-day taper of methylprednisolone (n = 14)" and "a 20-day course of placebo (n = 19)", with doxycycline showing "significant improvements in polyp size" over "12 weeks" versus placebo, while other 1990s RCTs used "10 days" of nonmacrolide antibiotics without placebos. For prolonged therapy, a prospective cohort "assessed 40 adult CRS patients" randomly assigned to "a 3-week course of doxycycline (n = 21) or a 6-week course of doxycycline (n = 19)", and at completion there was "no significant difference" in surgical candidacy failure rates "(71% and 68% failed)", nor in patient-reported symptoms or radiologic scores; taken together, "this Level 2b study" and limited evidence "provided an argument against the use of prolonged (6-week) courses of nonmacrolide antibiotics for the routine treatment of CRS", and "nonmacrolide antibiotic therapy is not recommended for CRS patients based on the evidence".

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^111QGUh3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline update — key changes include extension of watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as an initial management strategy to all patients with uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) regardless of severity, and clarification of the recommended timeline for the diagnosis, conservative management and antibiotic treatment of ABRS. Changes also include a change in recommendation to first-line antibiotic therapy for ABRS amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, from amoxicillin alone; addition of aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) as a chronic condition that modifies management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS); and three new key action statements on managing CRS that focus on the use of biologics (recommend against when patients do not have polyps and educate patients about them when they do) and a recommendation against the empiric use of antibiotics for CRS solely as a third-party requirement for surgery or imaging.

### Efficacy and safety of long-term low-dose clarithromycin in patients with refractory chronic sinusitis after endoscopic sinus surgery: a prospective clinical trial [^114MDzHB]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To observe the efficacy and safety of postoperative long-term low-dose oral administration of clarithromycin in patients with refractory chronic rhinosinusitis (RCRS), to explore the characteristics of postoperative microbiota in the nasal cavity in patients with RCRS, and to compare the differences and changes in microbiota in the nasal cavity before and after medication.

Methods

This was a prospective, self-controlled study. Eighteen patients with RCRS who had persistent symptoms after endoscopic sinus surgery and standard therapy with normal immunoglobulin E and eosinophil level were included. Low dose (250 mg, once daily) clarithromycin was orally administrated for 12 weeks. Symptom severity and endoscopic findings were evaluated before, after 4 weeks, and 12 weeks of treatment, and nasal cavity microbiota was analyzed simultaneously.

Results

A total of 18 patients with RCRS were enrolled and 17 patients completed the study. Four weeks after oral administration of clarithromycin, significant improvement was observed in subjective symptoms including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and general discomfort, as well as endoscopic findings including general surgical cavity condition, rhinedema, and rhinorrhea (P < .05). After continuous treatment to the 12th week, symptoms showed significant improvement compared with baseline, and endoscopic score showed significant improvement compared with both baseline and 4 weeks after treatment. Analysis of middle nasal meatus flora revealed a significant decrease of Streptococcus pneumoniae after 12 weeks of clarithromycin treatment (P < .05), while the richness, composition, and diversity were similar before and after treatment. Patients enrolled experienced no adverse drug reaction or allergic reaction, nor clinical significant liver function impairment observed.

Conclusion

Postoperative low-dose long-term oral administration of clarithromycin in patients with RCRS can improve the clinical symptoms and facilitate the mucosal epithelialization, with good tolerance and safety. The efficacy of clarithromycin in patients with RCRS may be related to its regulatory effect on nasal cavity microbiota.

### IDSA clinical practice guideline for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children and adults [^113MGQ1k]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, second-line, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to do not use macrolides (clarithromycin and azithromycin) for empiric therapy due to high rates of resistance among S. pneumoniae (~30%).

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^116CdfMG]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Older adults were more likely than younger adults and children to receive antibiotics without diagnostic documentation of an appropriate indication and were far more likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly macrolides. Azithromycin was prescribed to nearly one-quarter of adults aged 50 years or older with an ARI, regardless of diagnosis, laboratory testing, symptom duration, or medical history, including to 58% of those older adults given a prescription who lacked an indication for antibiotic treatment. Azithromycin also accounted for more than one-quarter of prescriptions among those adults diagnosed as having pharyngitis and sinusitis, even though it is not the first-line agent for either condition. A concerning increase in macrolide use for these conditions has been previously noted in both adults and children. Choosing a macrolide when amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is the recommended first-line antibiotic is a potential patient safety issue; GAS and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are more likely to be resistant to macrolides than to amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. While all antibiotics have potential risks, macrolides have also been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

### Anti-inflammatory effects of macrolides: applications in chronic rhinosinusitis [^114RsgzE]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The anti-inflammatory effects of macrolides are significant. The clinical impact on diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) has improved 10-year survival from 12% to more than 90% for these patients. The immunomodulatory activity of macrolides has been a source of mechanistic research as well as clinical research in non-DPB inflammatory airway disease. Suppression of neutrophilic inflammation of the airways has been demonstrated as the most robust immunomodulatory response from 14- and 15-membered ring macrolides. The inhibition of transcription factors, mainly nuclear factor-kB and activator protein 1, from alterations in intracellular cell signaling drives this mechanism. The suppression of interleukin-8 to a range of endogenous and exogenous challenges characterizes the alterations to cytokine production. The inflammatory mechanisms of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have been a major non-DPB focus. Macrolides have been trialed in more than 14 prospective trials and are the focus of numerous research projects. Evidence for a strong clinical effect in CRS is mounting, but results may be tempered by researchers' inability to characterize the disease process. Eosinophilic dominated CRS is unlikely to respond, based on current research understanding and data from clinical trials. This article discusses the current concepts of macrolides and their application in the management of CRS.

American Academy of Pediatrics — antibiotic duration: The optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis has not received systematic study, and recommendations based on clinical observations have varied widely from 10 to 28 days of treatment. An alternative suggestion is that antibiotic therapy be continued for 7 days after the patient becomes free of signs and symptoms, which results in a minimum course of 10 days.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^115Lxx2S]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment for respiratory tract infections to combat antimicrobial resistance

Most bacterial RTIs show equal efficacy with fewer adverse events in shorter compared to standard antibiotic courses in clinical trials. This is based on the principle of 'shorter is better', initially conceived one decade ago. However, there are two notable exceptions: otitis media among children under the age of two and streptococcal pharyngitis, in which shorter first-line antibiotic courses are less effective than standard antibiotic courses.

Over the last few decades, most guidelines have recommended standard antimicrobial therapy durations of seven to ten days for lower RTIs. However, few randomised clinical trials have been conducted to determine the minimal effective treatment durations. Despite the low number of patients included in some of these studies, shorter treatment durations, such as two to three days, have been demonstrated not to be inferior to longer durations in terms of clinical efficacy. Initially advocated for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the early 2000s, an increasing body of evidence suggests that shorter durations of antibiotics are also effective in treating most RTIs (Table 2). Some recent clinical guidelines, like the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book, advocate for five-day courses of antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis, COPD exacerbations, and community-acquired pneumonia. Despite this evidence, most clinicians still use standard or longer courses.

Type of antibiotic prescribed for respiratory tract symptoms and conditions

Upper respiratory tract infections are treated with macrolides or broad-spectrum antibiotics in fewer than 10% of the cases where an antibiotic is prescribed, although there is high practice variation. For patients where an indication for an antibiotic is uncertain, there is practically no use of macrolides and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Macrolides and broad-spectrum antibiotics are prescribed for sinusitis for just under 10% of cases when there is no indication for an antibiotic. Similarly, patients with tonsillitis, bronchitis/bronchiolitis, and pneumonia are treated with first-, second- or third-choice antibiotics in around 80% of cases (Fig. 5, Supplementary Appendix 6).

### Appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in veterans with community-acquired pneumonia, sinusitis, or acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a cross-sectional study [^113Axt3P]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Studies that have assessed antibiotic appropriateness in acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) with a likely bacterial etiology have focused only on antibiotic choice and ignored other important aspects of prescribing, such as dosing, drug-drug interactions, and duration of treatment.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing practices in outpatients with acute bacterial RTIs (community-acquired pneumonia [CAP], sinusitis, or acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis [AECB]).

Methods

This retrospective, cross-sectional study enrolled outpatients with CAP, sinusitis, or AECB who were evaluated in a Veterans Affairs emergency department over a 1-year period. Using electronic medical records, trained research assistants completed data-collection forms that included patient characteristics (eg, marital status, history of alcohol abuse), diagnosis, comorbidities, concurrent medications, and antibiotics prescribed. To assess antimicrobial appropriateness, a trained clinical pharmacist reviewed the data-collection forms and applied a Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI), which rated the appropriateness of a medication using 10 criteria: indication, effectiveness, dosage, directions, practicality (defined as capability of being used or being put into practice), drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions, unnecessary duplication, duration, and expensiveness (defined as the cost of the drug compared with other agents of similar efficacy and tolerability). Previous studies have found good inter- and intrarater reliabilities between a clinical pharmacist's and an internal medicine physician's MAI ratings (kappa = 0.83 and 0.92, respectively).

Results

One hundred fifty-three patients were included (mean age, 58 years; 92% male; and 65% white). Overall, 99 of 153 patients (65%) had inappropriate antibiotic prescribing as assessed using the MAI. Expensiveness (60 patients [39%]), impracticality (32 [21%]), and incorrect dosage (15 [10%]) were the most frequently rated problem. Penicillins, quinolones, and macrolides were the most common antibiotic classes prescribed inappropriately. A history of alcohol abuse was associated with a lower likelihood of inappropriate prescribing compared with no history of alcohol abuse (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.32; 95% CI, 0.10–0.98), while patients who were married were more likely to receive inappropriately prescribed antibiotics than those who were not married (AOR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.25–5.59).

Conclusions

Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing based on the MAI criteria was common (65%) in this selected patient population with acute bacterial RTIs, and often involved problems with expensiveness (39%), impracticality (21%), and incorrect dosage (10%). Future interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing should consider aspects beyond choice of agent.

### Hidden epidemic of macrolide-resistant pneumococci [^1122RpZY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Macrolide Resistance and Treatment Guidelines

In the United States, guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired RTIs have been established by a number of groups, including the American Thoracic Society, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership. The clinical relevance of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae has been addressed in updates to these groups' guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and in a report published by the Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group convened by CDC. The consensus among these guidelines is that empiric therapy should be stratified based on likely cause, treatment setting (inpatient versus outpatient), and the risk for pneumococcal antimicrobial resistance. In general, all 3 guidelines recommend that monotherapy with macrolides should be restricted to specific patient subgroups (i.e. those with no coexisting cardiopulmonary disease and no risk factors for infection with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae [e.g. recent antimicrobial drug use]). For outpatients with risk factors for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae, current recommended treatment options include combination therapy with a β-lactam (such as high-dose amoxicillin or high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate) plus a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone. The increased use of fluoroquinolones has been associated with the emergence and spread of resistance to these agents, and local clonal dissemination of S. pneumoniae strains with very high-level resistance to penicillin has been reported in the United States. Although the prevalence of these resistant isolates remains low, such findings emphasize the necessity for local resistance patterns to be considered when prescribing empiric antimicrobial drug therapy for patients with community-acquired RTIs.

The Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership guidelines for the treatment of acute microbial rhinosinusitis also highlight the need to consider the increasing prevalence of pneumococcal resistance when making treatment choices, with patients divided into categories dependent on their recent exposure to antimicrobial drugs. Similarly, a recent American Thoracic Society statement on the management of acute microbial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease emphasizes the need to consider local resistance patterns when prescribing antimicrobial drugs.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — associations and treatment include that up to 30% to 80% of patients with CRS have been documented to have AR, and NAR was found in 26% of patients with CRS. Because CRS is an inflammatory disease, INS are indicated for treatment, and for CRS associated with suspected bacterial infection, a longer duration of therapy beyond the usual 10 to 14 days is suggested; concurrent oral steroids have been shown to be of benefit, especially in CRSwNP.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116pDK81]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult rhinosinusitis scope and definitions — the target patient for this guideline is aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, where rhinosinusitis is defined as inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity and uncomplicated rhinosinusitis is defined as rhinosinusitis without clinically evident extension of inflammation outside the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity at the time of diagnosis. Rhinosinusitis may be classified by duration as acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) if less than 4 weeks' duration, or as CRS if lasting more than 12 weeks, with or without acute exacerbations; ARS may be classified further by presumed etiology into acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) or viral rhinosinusitis (VRS), and distinguishing presumed bacterial versus viral infection is important because antibiotic therapy is inappropriate for the latter. When patients have 4 or more annual episodes of ABRS, without persistent symptoms in between, the condition is termed recurrent ARS (RARS). Nearly all experts agree that CRS begins after 12 weeks duration, and we agree with other guideline groups that define ARS as up to 4 weeks' duration; very limited data are available on rhinosinusitis lasting 4 to 12 weeks, sometimes called subacute rhinosinusitis, and we do not distinguish rhinosinusitis in this time frame as an explicit entity in the guideline with decisions individualized.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116fEZyT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) — The last decade has seen a rise in the availability of biologics for the management of a variety of conditions including, more recently, CRSwNP, and these therapies are primarily directed towards the products of T2 inflammation: dupilumab (IL-4/13), omalizumab (IgE), and mepolizumab (IL-5). Finally, the role of antibiotics in CRSwNP remains uncertain and studies have not specifically looked at the type of underlying inflammation when evaluating their efficacy. The best evidence to date indicates that chronic topical or intravenous antibiotics for CRS with nasal polyps is not recommended, but select oral antibiotics, especially the macrolide class, may be beneficial because of their anti-inflammatory effects. However, the recommendations in Soler et al were derived from studies comprising a heterogeneous population of CRS patients of whom a majority had CRSsNP, and given our greater understanding of endotyping, it remains uncertain if the positive effects noted in CRSwNP resulted from a mixed endotype as opposed to the presumed T2 signature of CRSwNP in general.

Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy is effective in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. The mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect and how this differs from corticosteroids remains unclear. The effect of clarithromycin and prednisolone on interleukin-5, interleukin-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor production by cultured chronic sinusitis nasal mucosa was examined in the study.

Study Design and Methods

Nasal mucosa was obtained from 11 patients with chronic sinusitis. This tissue was cultured for 24 hours in the presence of clarithromycin or prednisolone at a variety of concentrations. Cytokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay.

Results

Clarithromycin and prednisolone each produced significant reductions in interleukin-5, interleukin-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor production. There was no significant difference between the effects of clarithromycin and prednisolone.

Conclusion

Macrolide antibiotics are capable of inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and are as potent as prednisolone. This mechanism is likely to be at least partly responsible for the clinical efficacy of macrolide antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis.

### A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of long-term doxycycline therapy on exacerbation rate in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112DPBv1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Our negative primary outcome is important because, despite limited evidence, long-term doxycycline has been more commonly prescribed than azithromycin to patients with COPD within the United Kingdom. Although our headline findings may deter this generic approach, this may also obscure a useful role for doxycycline within certain subsets of patients. Age, smoking status, and sex did not influence the response to doxycycline, but we found that doxycycline reduced exacerbations among those with severe COPD better than among those with moderate or very severe COPD. Weaker exacerbation reduction among those with worse spirometry measurements has been observed previously in bronchodilator studies, perhaps reflecting differences in exacerbation pathophysiology accompanying increasing disease severity.

Our data also suggest that the effectiveness of doxycycline in reducing exacerbations was influenced by the patient's baseline eosinophil count. Although not considered in previous comparable COPD prophylactic antibiotic studies, a similar interaction has been observed in one 3-month study of azithromycin and trials of long-term antibiotics targeting other inflammatory respiratory diseases. In a post hoc analysis, Vermeersch and colleagues found that long-term azithromycin commenced at the onset of a severe exacerbation reduced treatment failure, particularly among those with blood eosinophil counts < 300 cells/μl at the exacerbation onset. An elevated blood eosinophil count in chronic rhinosinusitis was found to predict a poor response to long-term macrolide therapy, and long-term doxycycline may worsen outcomes among those with coexisting asthma or elevated baseline serum IgE concentrations. Furthermore, although tetracyclines offer immunomodulatory benefits to some individuals with asthma, these benefits may be absent among those with coexisting COPD.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^117BuRsZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — initial management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) states: "Clinicians should offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) for adults with uncomplicated ABRS with assurance of follow-up", and "The duration of watchful waiting may depend on the factors and timing under which the diagnosis was originally made". Evidence qualifiers include "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A", "Level of Confidence in Evidence: Medium", and "Policy level: Recommendation". The update specifies "reduced watchful waiting to 3 to 5 days duration from time of diagnosis", while prior guidance "endorsed watchful waiting without an antibiotic… even when signs and symptoms had persisted for 10 days or longer". Patient preference has a "Large role for shared decision-making for watchful waiting vs. antibiotic therapy". Exceptions include "Complicated sinusitis, immune deficiency, or coexisting bacterial illness", and the clinician should consider age, general health, cardiopulmonary status, co-morbid conditions, and factors suggesting "severe" disease when assessing suitability; the guideline notes "the strengthening of the recommendation of watchful waiting to the default initial therapy", with allowance to differ "when the clinician believes that 'severe' disease requires antibiotic therapy".

### Study protocol, rationale and recruitment in a European multi-centre randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in primary ciliary dyskinesia [^1118aFEZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, we developed patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) for children, adolescents and adults with PCD and parent caregivers. PROs are now accepted by both the FDA and EMA as primary or secondary endpoints in clinical trials and provide unique information on how new medications and treatments affect daily symptoms and functioning. These measures assess several domains of health-related quality of life, including respiratory and sinus symptoms, physical and social functioning, and the perceived burden of treatment. PROs have now been routinely incorporated into randomized trials of new medications in CF and non-CF bronchiectasis, providing critical information about efficacy and impact on daily functioning. This will be the first trial to utilize these new PCD-specific PROs.

Hearing impairment will be evaluated by audiometry and tympanometry partly as an outcome measure for the efficacy of azithromycin maintenance therapy and simultaneously also as a safety measure due to reports of ototoxicity as an adverse reaction of azithromycin. Besides hearing impairment, emergence of antibiotic resistance will also be monitored in the trial as this has been raised as a concern after previous RCTs with azithromycin maintenance therapy showed increased resistance among common respiratory pathogens.

The challenges of this study may be the wide age range which includes both paediatric and adult PCD patients, and differences in routine management between the trial sites. The trial is designed as a multi-centre study with participation in several European countries due to the rarity of PCD. However, even with recruitment at six trial sites, distributed across five European countries, it is still necessary to include a wide age range to recruit enough patients. With regard to the challenge of differences in routine management between the trial sites, then this is reduced by standardising part of the antibiotic treatment regimen per trial protocol and by excluding PCD patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa from participation in the RCT. The decision to exclude patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection from the trial is based on the great variation in treatment practises of Pseudomonas aeruginosa between the participating trial sites and because chronic infection introduces a high level of treatment activity, with high dose systemic antibiotic treatment being the most critical confounder.

Statement 6 — treatment failure for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis specifies that if the patient fails to improve or worsens despite being on an appropriate antibiotic for 3–5 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, and if ABRS is confirmed, the clinician should change the antibiotic; the recommendation is based on expert opinion and first principles for changing therapy with a preponderance of benefit over harm, with an action statement profile citing quality improvement opportunity, aggregate evidence quality Grade D with use of rescue antibiotic in RCTs, level of confidence in evidence moderate, benefits of preventing complications, detecting missed diagnosis, and instituting effective therapy, and risks or costs including delay in changing therapy if the patient fails to improve and medication costs.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis in adults [^114AXRN3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on diagnostic criteria for chronic rhinosinusitis. By convention, the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis are similar to those of acute rhinosinusitis but last more than 8 weeks. Diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and computed tomography scan of the sinuses or rhinoscopy. Treatment options are numerous and, for the most part, not evidence based. They include antibiotics, nasal or oral corticosteroids, antihistamines, naval lavage, decongestants, immunotherapy, and surgery. Which diagnostic and therapeutic options to exercise when, is the focus of this article.

### Evaluating long-term benefits of chronic azithromycin. furthering our quest for precision medicine [^1153wM4A]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Interest in macrolides as a treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) arose in the 1990s, when the effect of erythromycin on clinical outcomes in diffuse panbronchiolitis, a severe inflammatory airway disease predominantly seen in older East Asian men, was recognized. After initial reports of benefit, several randomized, placebo-controlled trials of azithromycin were conducted in adults and children with CF, with and without Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA; Table 1).

Table 1.
Randomized, Placebo-controlled Clinical Trials of Azithromycin

Based on these trials, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) guidelines recommend chronic azithromycin (AZM) for individuals with persistent PA and consideration of its use for those without PA. However, antagonism between AZM and inhaled tobramycin has been observed in vitro and in a secondary analysis of inhaled aztreonam trials, raising concern about its safety and efficacy.

### Maximal medical therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis: a survey of Chinese otolaryngologists [^113Po5pi]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical practice patterns in maximal medical therapy (MMT) before endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) by Chinese otolaryngologists. An anonymous web-based survey of MMT was performed. This survey assessed types of therapies, the frequency of use, duration of use, and demographic data of respondents. A total of 134 (26.8%) questionnaires were completed and returned. The majority (62.69%) of respondents would consider surgery less than 3 months after commencing MMT, 33.58% would wait 3 to 6 months. Intranasal corticosteroid sprays, saline irrigation, oral antibiotics, oral mucolytics, and oral Chinese herbals were the most commonly used therapies and listed as "often (> 70%)". Macrolides were most commonly antibiotics prescribed among the clinicians surveyed (51.49%). Intranasal corticosteroid sprays, oral antibiotics, oral mucolytics, nasal saline irrigations, and oral Chinese herbals are most commonly prescribed by the majority of Chinese otolaryngologists as MMT for CRS. Current practice patterns of MMT among Chinese otolaryngologists are not uniformly based on evidence-based guidelines.

### Long-term macrolide treatment of chronic inflammatory airway diseases: risks, benefits and future developments [^1138o3xP]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Macrolide antibiotics were discovered over 50 years ago and following their use as antimicrobials it became apparent that this group of antibiotics also possessed anti-inflammatory properties. Subsequent clinical trials showed benefits of macrolides as long-term adjuncts in the treatment of a spectrum of chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases, particularly diffuse panbronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, post-transplant bronchiolitis obliterans and more recently chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The evidence for efficacy of macrolides in the long-term treatment of chronic asthma and bronchiectasis is less well established. The mechanism(s) of action of macrolides in the treatment of these diseases remains unexplained, but may be due to their antibacterial and/or anti-inflammatory actions, which include reductions in interleukin-8 production, neutrophil migration and/or function. Macrolides have additional potentially beneficial properties including anti-viral actions and an ability to restore corticosteroid sensitivity. The increased prescribing of macrolides for long-term treatment could result in the development of microbial resistance and adverse drug effects. New macrolides have been developed which do not possess any antimicrobial activity and hence lack the ability to produce microbial resistance, but which still retain immunomodulatory effects. Potentially novel macrolides may overcome a significant barrier to the use of this type of drug for the long-term treatment of chronic inflammatory airway diseases.

Drafting the guideline and making recommendations

The GDG reviewed each clinical question during the regular meetings and consensus was reached. Having generated evidence profiles for each of the clinical questions, the GDG as a whole then considered the importance of each of the outcomes for each clinical question and proceeded to grade the overall body of evidence for critical and important outcomes.

The GDG went on to decide on the direction and strength of recommendations considering the quality of the evidence, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, and the values and preferences of patients and others. GRADE specifies two categories of strength of a recommendation as presented in table 4.

Table 4
Explanation of the terminology used in BTS recommendations

From the outset, it was acknowledged that there would be little high-quality evidence for some of the clinical questions identified. GPPs were developed by consensus in areas where there was no quality evidence but the GDG felt that some guidance based on the clinical experience of the GDG might be helpful to the reader. These are indicated as shown below.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^112LGSeu]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data were obtained from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a primary care electronic database that contains anonymised data on patients, practices, and consultations and is representative of the general UK population, with consultation and prescribing rates similar to national data. We used the same data extract that was previously used to evaluate which antibiotics are prescribed for different conditions in England. This extract was limited to English practices that participated in THIN and provided data for at least one full calendar year between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015. The prescription-diagnosis linkage is described in detail elsewhere. For the current analyses, we included only prescriptions for oral antibiotics linked to one of several indications: acute sinusitis, acute sore throat, acute cough and bronchitis, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute otitis media, acute cystitis, acute prostatitis, pyelonephritis, cellulitis, impetigo, scarlet fever, and gastroenteritis. We excluded chronic and recurrent conditions, operationalised by excluding consultations explicitly coded as such and consultations where patients received antibiotics for a condition of the same body system (respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, or skin) in the 30 days before the current antibiotic prescription. In addition, we excluded prescriptions that were explicitly coded as a repeat prescription or were part of a sequence of prescriptions where the same antibiotic was prescribed every month for at least six months or covered more than 162 exposure days over a period of 180 days. Actual durations of antibiotic prescriptions for the 13 indications considered were compared with durations recommended in English guidance provided by Public Health England (PHE) — using the PHE 2013 guidance for the main analysis (see table 1 and supplementary table S1): acute sinusitis, acute sore throat, acute cough and bronchitis, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of COPD, acute otitis media, acute cystitis, acute prostatitis, pyelonephritis, cellulitis, impetigo, scarlet fever, and gastroenteritis.

### Radiographic resolution of chronic rhinosinusitis without polyposis after 6 weeks vs 3 weeks of oral antibiotics [^116mpxaS]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Maximal medical therapy is poorly defined in chronic sinusitis treatment.

Objective

To objectively evaluate the radiographic response of chronic rhinosinusitis without polyposis after 3 and 6 weeks of oral antibiotics.

Methods

Thirty-five patients with confirmed chronic sinusitis without polyposis (disease apparent on initial computed tomography [CT] with appropriate symptom duration) were prescribed 6 weeks of antibiotics. When possible, culture-directed antibiotics were used; otherwise clindamycin was used empirically. A CT was performed after 3 and 6 weeks of therapy. CTs were then graded by the Lund-Mackay system. Demographic data were reviewed.

Results

Of the 35 patients, 16 underwent all 3 CT scans and completed all 6 weeks of antibiotics. Three patients completed only 3 weeks of antibiotics, and 16 did not undergo the interval 3-week CT. Six patients (38%) had statistically significant improvement in their CT scans between weeks 3 and 6. In this subset of patients who improved, 37% of their overall radiographic improvement occurred in the 3- to 6-week treatment interval. No prognostic variables predicted which patients would radiographically improve after 3 weeks of antibiotics.

Conclusion

Some patients achieve radiographic improvement and disease resolution after the completion of a 3-week course of antibiotics. Therefore, maximal medical therapy for chronic sinusitis may consist of longer than 3 weeks of therapy to ensure maximal benefit.

Clinical questions, patient centred outcomes and literature search

Clinical questions were formulated in the PICO (patient, intervention, comparison and outcome) format. The PICO framework was used to define the scope of the guideline and formed the basis of the literature search. The initial search was completed in February 2017, with a subsequent search perfumed later in 2017 by York University. Systematic electronic database searches were conducted to identify all papers which might potentially be included in the guideline. For each question, the following databases were searched: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process, Embase and PubMed. The search strategy is available for review in online appendix 1.

In line with GRADE, a series of patient-centred outcomes were identified by the group when the scope was agreed (see table 1).

This executive summary will alert clinicians to key evidence-based statements in a multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. Included in the guideline are 17 boldfaced action statements: 3 on viral rhinosinusitis, 7 on acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, and 7 on chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis. Evidence profiles that accompany each statement are summarized to show why it was made and how it can be implemented. Guideline statements regarding acute rhinosinusitis focus on diagnosing presumed bacterial illness and using antibiotics appropriately. Guideline statements regarding chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis focus on appropriate use of diagnostic tests. Surgical therapy is not discussed.

### Antibiotic therapy duration in US adults with sinusitis | Less is more… [^112WeJFk]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

We generated estimates that accounted for the complex sample design with use of weighted analyses. We grouped antibiotics as penicillins, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, azithromycin, or other. We categorized azithromycin separately because of its unique pharmacokinetic characteristics. When azithromycin prescriptions were excluded, 91. 5% of antibiotic courses were 10 days or longer,
7. 6% were 7 days, and 0. 5% were 5 days. More than two-thirds of antibiotic courses and 91% of nonazithromycin antibiotic courses prescribed for the treatment of acute sinusitis in adults were 10 days or longer, even though the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends 5 to 7 days of therapy for uncomplicated cases.

3 Notably, no penicillin or tetracycline prescriptions were for 5-day courses, and only 5% of antibiotic prescriptions were for 7-day courses of penicillins, tetracyclines, or fluoroquinolones. Although 7- to 10-day courses are recommended for patients at high risk or who have experienced failure of initial treatment, 3 it is unlikely that such cases represent most patients in our study. Earlier work has shown that 90% of patients with sinusitis that is treated with antibiotics do not require additional antibiotic therapy. 4 Shorter durations of antibiotic therapy for sinusitis have been associated with similar outcomes and fewer drug-related adverse events compared with longer durations.
5. Greater than 20% of prescriptions were for a 5-day course of azithromycin, a course that clinicians and patients often find convenient.

However, the Infectious Diseases Society of America explicitly recommends against the use of azithromycin for the treatment of sinusitis because of its known association with the development of drug resistance. 3 In addition, because of high and persistent concentrations of azithromycin in tissue, 5 days of azithromycin therapy approximates 10 days of erythromycin therapy; therefore, a shorter course of treatment with azithromycin does not involve a shorter duration of antibiotic exposure. 6.

### Antibiotics for sinusitis… [^112ymV5H]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Don't routinely prescribe antibiotics for acute mild-to-moderate sinusitis unless symptoms last for ten or more days OR symptoms worsen after initial clinical improvement. Most sinusitis in the ambulatory setting is due to a viral infection that will resolve on its own. Despite consistent recommendations to the contrary, antibiotics are prescribed in over 80% of outpatient visits for acute sinusitis. Sinusitis accounts for 16 million office visits and $5. 8 billion in annual health care. Sources: AAO-HNSF Updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses in primary care. Annually, it accounts for 15% to 20% of adult antibiotic prescriptions and costs more than $20 million in patient visits.

Current recommendations strongly support not prescribing antibiotics within the first week of illness for mild to moderate sinusitis. A meta-analysis published in 2012 in the Archives of Internal Medicine states that some randomized controlled trials showed that patients assigned to antibiotics had a 7% to 14% higher rate of improvement in symptoms. However, these researchers concluded that the potential harms from use of antibiotics to manage sinusitis, including adverse effects, increased risk of antibiotic resistance, and cost, clearly outweigh the potential minor benefits. A Cochrane review compiled data from 59 studies that involved the use of a variety of antibiotics to manage simple maxillary sinus infection in primary care settings. Studies that compared antibiotics with placebo showed that, in most cases, symptoms improved within two weeks, regardless of whether the participant received an antibiotic or not.

The review found that, in addition to patient-related adverse effects, antibiotic use poses the risk of increased resistance to antibiotics among community-acquired pathogens.
