## Question

I have a patient with microadenoma manifesting as hyperprolactinaemia and hypothyroidism. they have been lost to follow-up and have just returned. Should I check a cortisol?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a morning cortisol level should be checked in a patient with a known prolactin-secreting pituitary microadenoma and coexisting hypothyroidism who has returned after being lost to follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk of ACTH deficiency relative to tumor size and history. Then, I should verify how concurrent central hypothyroidism affects the threshold for screening. Next, I will review guideline positions on hypopituitarism screening in microadenomas, especially when patients are returning after a gap in care. After that, I should weigh risks, benefits, and cost-effectiveness. Finally, I will outline the practical testing approach and confirm when dynamic testing is warranted.

> Let me first confirm the risk context: a microadenoma under 10 mm generally carries a lower risk of hypopituitarism than a macroadenoma, but risk is not zero and depends on stalk effect, apoplexy, or prior treatment, and I need to remember that men with macroprolactinomas can have meaningful rates of secondary adrenal insufficiency, which, while not directly applicable to a microadenoma, underscores that prolactinomas can affect multiple axes depending on size and mass effect [^114GXqxB] [^112cQ73g] [^113iW1S7].

> Wait, let me verify how central hypothyroidism influences this decision. I initially thought "one pituitary axis is already impaired, so I should assume others are too", but that's too strong a conclusion, so I should correct that: central hypothyroidism is a red flag that mandates evaluation for broader hypopituitarism, but it does not by itself prove ACTH deficiency. Still, its presence increases the pretest probability and supports screening the HPA axis in a returning patient whose status is uncertain [^113UB9pj] [^115Md3hA] [^114vceZP].

> Next, I should review the guideline stance on microadenomas. The Endocrine Society suggests routine endocrine testing for hypopituitarism in macroincidentalomas but not in microincidentalomas that remain clinically and radiographically stable, implying that microadenomas have a very low risk of new hypopituitarism when stable. However, this patient is not an incidentaloma, is a prolactinoma, and is returning after a lapse in care, which changes the calculus toward reassessing pituitary function, and newer Pituitary Society guidance supports periodic hormonal re-evaluation in patients with microadenomas or macroadenomas at 1–2 years or sooner if new symptoms arise, reinforcing a broader surveillance mindset on return visits [^114GXqxB] [^1126WmaK] [^117BdH5o].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical risk-benefit balance. Morning cortisol is inexpensive, widely available, and noninvasive, and missing secondary adrenal insufficiency can have serious consequences, whereas false positives in this context are manageable with confirmatory testing. Given the patient already has documented central hypothyroidism and an uncharacterized interval since last pituitary assessment, the net benefit clearly favors screening the HPA axis now [^113UB9pj] [^114vceZP].

> I will now examine the testing approach. A single 8–9 am serum cortisol is a reasonable first screen, with commonly used thresholds where cortisol less than about 3–5 mcg/dL suggests adrenal insufficiency and greater than about 15–18 mcg/dL reliably excludes it, while intermediate values warrant dynamic testing. If the morning cortisol is indeterminate, I should confirm with a standard ACTH stimulation test or an insulin tolerance test depending on availability and contraindications, and I should also remember that in the setting of recent pituitary surgery or apoplexy, early postoperative cortisol interpretation differs, though that is not this patient's scenario today [^114x2nk8] [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the cortisol is low and I jump to replacement immediately? I should double-check that I do not replace glucocorticoids solely on a single low morning cortisol without corroboration, because dynamic testing avoids overtreatment and clarifies the diagnosis. If secondary adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, I should initiate physiologic hydrocortisone and provide stress-dosing education, and if it is excluded, I can avoid unnecessary steroids and continue routine pituitary surveillance with clinical review and interval labs as appropriate [^114vceZP] [^112qNmQW].

> Let me reconsider the broader pituitary context. Since central hypothyroidism is present, I should confirm that the full pituitary panel is up to date, including free T4, TSH interpreted in the central context, IGF-1, and sex steroids with gonadotropins as indicated, because guidelines recommend a comprehensive baseline screen for hypopituitarism in patients with sellar lesions, and this ensures we do not miss additional deficits that might influence management or follow-up planning [^114vceZP] [^113UB9pj].

> Final decision: Yes, I should check a morning cortisol now. The combination of a pituitary microadenoma, documented central hypothyroidism, and a lapse in follow-up creates a sufficient risk signal to justify HPA axis screening, and guidelines support reassessment of pituitary function at return visits, with morning cortisol serving as a pragmatic first step followed by dynamic testing if results are intermediate or clinical suspicion remains high [^117BdH5o] [^113UB9pj] [^114x2nk8].

Yes, you should **check a morning cortisol** in this patient. A pituitary microadenoma with hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism increases the risk of **secondary adrenal insufficiency** [^113UB9pj], and guidelines recommend screening all pituitary axes — including the HPA axis — at baseline and after any significant interval without follow-up [^114vceZP] [^117BdH5o]. A single 8–9 am cortisol is a simple, cost-effective screen [^114x2nk8]; if it is low or indeterminate, confirm with an ACTH stimulation test [^112bJ85b]. Early detection of adrenal insufficiency prevents morbidity and guides safe initiation or adjustment of hormone therapy [^112qNmQW].

---

## Clinical rationale for checking cortisol

- **Risk of hypopituitarism**: Pituitary microadenomas can impair multiple axes, and coexisting hypothyroidism signals broader pituitary dysfunction [^113UB9pj] [^111hgRjq].

- **Guideline support**: Endocrine Society and Pituitary Society recommend baseline screening of all pituitary axes, including morning cortisol, in patients with pituitary adenomas [^113UB9pj] [^114vceZP].

- **Clinical consequences**: Untreated secondary adrenal insufficiency can cause fatigue, hyponatremia, hypotension, and adrenal crisis, especially during stress or illness [^notfound].

---

## Recommended approach to cortisol testing

- **Initial screening**: Obtain an 8–9 am serum cortisol; values < 3 µg/dL suggest adrenal insufficiency, > 15 µg/dL generally exclude it, and intermediate values require dynamic testing [^114x2nk8].

- **Confirmatory testing**: Use the ACTH stimulation test (250 µg) if morning cortisol is low or indeterminate; a peak cortisol < 18 µg/dL indicates secondary adrenal insufficiency [^notfound].

- **Clinical correlation**: Interpret results with symptoms, signs, and other pituitary labs to guide replacement and follow-up [^113UB9pj].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal cortisol results

If cortisol is **low**, initiate glucocorticoid replacement (e.g. hydrocortisone 15–25 mg/day in divided doses) and provide stress-dosing education [^notfound]. If cortisol is **normal**, continue routine surveillance and reassess if symptoms or labs change [^117BdH5o].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| Pituitary microadenoma with hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism | Check morning cortisol (8–9 am) |
| Morning cortisol < 3 µg/dL or indeterminate | Perform ACTH stimulation test |
| Confirmed secondary adrenal insufficiency | Initiate glucocorticoid replacement |
| Normal cortisol | Continue routine surveillance |

---

Given the patient's pituitary microadenoma, hyperprolactinemia, and hypothyroidism, **checking a morning cortisol is indicated** to screen for secondary adrenal insufficiency and guide safe management [^114vceZP].

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (pitNETs) — screening and evaluation include the following: There is currently no consensus on routine MEN1 screening in pitNETs, but it is reasonable to screen for hyperparathyroidism by checking serum calcium in all patients with a pitNET, and if hyperparathyroidism is not present, the likelihood of MEN1 is low. Endocrine testing for pituitary hormonal excess should be performed for all patients with pitNETs whether incidental or symptomatic; prolactin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) should be checked to screen for prolactinoma and acromegaly, respectively. If signs or symptoms of hypercortisolism are present, patients should be screened for Cushing disease with a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, 24-hour urine free cortisol, and/or late-night salivary cortisol levels. Patients with lesions > 6 mm or symptoms should be screened for hypopituitarism with serum free thyroxine (free T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), morning cortisol, IGF-1, testosterone in men, and menstrual history evaluation in premenopausal women.

1.1.2 Evidence

Evidence to support screening for hypopituitarism in patients with an incidentaloma also comes from small observational studies. In combined data in micro- and macroincidentalomas, hypopituitarism was present in seven of 66 and 19 of 46 patients. Deficits of gonadotropins (not associated with hyperprolactinemia) were detected in up to 30% of patients, of the ACTH/cortisol axis in up to 18%, thyroid axis in up to 28%, and GH axis in up to 8%.

Different approaches can be taken to the initial evaluation of the patient for hypopituitarism. Some Task Force members recommend a minimal screening with the measurement of free T 4, morning cortisol, and testosterone levels, whereas others recommend that the initial evaluation should also include the measurement of TSH, LH, and FSH and IGF-I. A broad initial approach to this testing is favored by some to avoid the repeated blood sampling that would be needed to confirm a central origin of target organ deficiencies should they be detected. Low gonadotropin levels in postmenopausal women provide evidence of hypopituitarism and in men exclude primary hypogonadism when testosterone levels are low. Similarly, normal or low TSH levels help distinguish a pituitary etiology of hypothyroidism when the free T 4 is low. Gonadal function can be assessed in premenopausal women by history and examination. If baseline testing suggests hypopituitarism, further stimulation tests of the pituitary-adrenal or GH-IGF-I axis should be performed.

### Clinical and diagnostic characteristics of hyperprolactinemia in childhood and adolescence [^116dchXd]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Pituitary adenoma is the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia, which is a rare endocrine disorder encountered in pediatric patient care. Epidemiological and clinical information about hyperprolactinemia in childhood and adolescence is limited. Clinical signs of hyperprolactinemia are very heterogeneous. In girls, disturbances in menstrual function and galactorrhea may be seen, whereas in boys, headache, visual disturbances, delayed pubertal development and hypogonadism are often present. Owing to the ease of ordering a serum prolactin measurement, an evidence-based, cost-effective approach to the management of this endocrine disorder is required. Before a diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is made, drug use, renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and parasellar tumors should be excluded. The main objectives of treatment are normalization of prolactin level, adenoma shrinkage, and recovery from clinical signs related to hyperprolactinemia. In patients with microadenoma, invasive or non-invasive macroadenoma, and even in patients with visual field defects, dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment. Surgical treatment is indicated in patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to medical treatment or who have persistent neurological signs. Radiotherapy should be considered as a supportive treatment for patients in whom surgery fails or medical response is not achieved.

Hyperprolactinemia — cabergoline outcomes in micro- and macroprolactinomas show high biochemical and clinical response rates. In a placebo-controlled study, cabergoline treatment (0.125–1.0 mg twice weekly) for 12–24 months in prolactin-secreting microadenomas resulted in normalization of prolactin levels in 95% of patients and restored menses in 82% of women with amenorrhea. In a prospective study of 26 treatment-naive macroprolactinomas, normoprolactinemia was achieved within 6 months in 81% of patients receiving 0.25–2 mg cabergoline weekly, and 92% exhibited significant tumor shrinkage. In a retrospective series of 455 patients, cabergoline normalized prolactin levels in 92% of patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or a microprolactinoma and in 77% of 181 patients with macroadenomas; additionally, 80% of men with macroadenomas or microadenomas experience prolactin normalization after dopamine agonist therapy.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112LEBCA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The evaluation for hypersecretion should include an assessment for prolactin, GH, and ACTH hypersecretion. Evidence is strongest for the need to measure a serum prolactin level in all patients presenting with an incidentaloma. Ideally, for patients with large macroincidentalomas, the laboratory should measure prolactin levels in diluted serum to ensure that levels are not falsely lowered by a hook effect in the assay. Hyperprolactinemia was found in five of 42 patients with microincidentalomas at initial evaluation, but in other studies none of 22 developed a prolactin elevation on prospective follow-up. In other studies, prolactinomas were detected in seven of 46 patients with incidentalomas (micro and macro combined). In macroincidentalomas, prolactin levels were elevated in two of 16. In a large autopsy study, 39.5% of the adenomas detected (most microadenomas) were found to stain positive for prolactin. These data might suggest that prolactinomas are very common among pituitary incidentalomas, which is contrary to the literature. Autopsy data should cautiously be considered representative of incidentalomas presenting in life because the autopsy studies lack clinical data, and prolactin staining may not have been associated with clinically relevant circulating hyperprolactinemia. Patients with hyperprolactinemia could receive a trial of dopamine agonist therapy so long as it is recognized that mild/moderate elevations may be due to stalk compression from a lesion other than a prolactinoma. In these patients, tumor shrinkage is unlikely, and growth of the incidentaloma is still possible, so continued follow-up with repeat imaging is warranted. The treatment of hyperprolactinemia has been recently reviewed.

Management

Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery remains the treatment of choice for most patients with acromegaly, and patients with visual compromise as a result of a pituitary adenoma compressing the optic apparatus should still undergo pituitary surgery promptly. Other patients could be treated medically until the pandemic subsides. Medical treatment options are somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs), octreotide long-acting release (LAR), lanreotide depot and pasireotide LAR, pegvisomant and cabergoline (used off-label). Medical therapies can be effective in providing symptomatic relief, control GH excess or action, and potentially reduce tumor size (except pegvisomant, which does not have direct antiproliferative effects). Preoperative medical therapy has been reported to improve surgical outcomes in some, but not all studies. Pasireotide, which potentially can induce QTc prolongation, should be used with caution in patients who are taking, either as prophylaxis or treatment, medications for COVID-19 (azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine), which can also have an effect on QTc interval. Furthermore, as hyperglycemia is very frequent in patients treated with pasireotide and needs close monitoring at start of the treatment, this treatment should be reserved for truly resistant cases, with large tumors and who cannot have surgery yet. Notably, lanreotide depot, cabergoline or pegvisomant can be administered by the patient or a family member and therefore an in-person visit to a clinic is not required. If SRLs that require health care professional administration are required, raising the dose may allow the interval between injections to be extended beyond 4 weeks while maintaining disease control. Virtual visits can be implemented to monitor the patient's course and response to medical therapy during the pandemic. Careful management of comorbidities associated with acromegaly remains an essential part of patient care.

Prolactinomas

Hyperprolactinemia may be physiological in origin or arise because of an underlying pathophysiologic cause, medication use or laboratory artifact. Therefore, an initial evaluation for hyperprolactinemia should include a comprehensive medication history, a thorough evaluation for secondary causes, including primary hypothyroidism, and a careful assessment for clinical features of hyperprolactinemia, including hypogonadism and galactorrhea. Unless a secondary cause of hyperprolactinemia can be established definitively, further investigation is indicated to evaluate the etiology of hyperprolactinemia.

Fig. 1
Prolactin levels for long-term dopamine agonist dependence in patients with microprolactinomas. (A) Patients without long-term dependence on DAs exhibited significantly lower baseline PRL levels compared to those with DA dependence (108.9 µg/L, IQR 60–166 µg/L vs. 199 µg/L, IQR 133–270 µg/L, p = 0.05). Receiver operating curves (ROC) for long-term dopamine agonist dependence in patients with microprolactinomas. (B) The estimated PRL threshold for discriminating long-term DA dependence was 290 µg/L (AUROC = 0.73, 95% CI 0.55–0.92, p = 0.03; sensitivity = 90%, specificity = 80%)

There were no deaths among patients with a microadenoma. Surgical morbidity included rhinoliquorrhea in one patient, requiring transsphenoidal revision with autologous fat graft and dural patching. Two patients experienced transient hyponatremia. Post-surgery, one patient (2%) developed thyrotrophic insufficiency, and another (2%) developed corticotrophic insufficiency, contrasting with their baseline conditions. There were no reported instances of vascular injuries, meningitis, or abscesses.

Early and long-term follow-up

Early follow-up took place three months after pituitary surgery. Thereby, serum PRL values decreased significantly, from 133 µg/L (IQR 70–199 µg/L) to 13 µg/L (IQR 6–34 µg/L), p < 0.001. Postoperative normalization of PRL levels was obtained in 32 patients (74%). None of the patients were lost to long-term follow-up. After a median follow-up of 78 months (IQR 31–147 months), there was a significant decrease in PRL values along with the control of hypogonadism. No significant differences in other endocrinopathies (i.e. secondary hypothyroidism, secondary adrenal insufficiency) were observed. Remission achieved withupfront surgery alone (without the need for long-term DA therapy) was observed in 31 patients (71%), while recurrence was noted in 13 patients (29%). DA therapy was ultimately required in 12 (26%) patients, with 3 (7%) receiving bromocriptine and 11 (19%) receiving cabergoline. Moreover, the prevalence of headaches significantly improved following the control of hyperprolactinemia in the long term (Table 2).

Recurrence monitoring in Cushing disease — Recurrence is a more significant problem in adults, with one study reporting that after initial remission, 23% of adults with microadenomas and 33% with macroadenomas had recurrence, and overall recurrence rates vary from 15–66% within 5–10 years of initially successful surgery. Clinicians should evaluate patients for possible CD recurrence when the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis recovers, and then annually, or sooner if they have clinical symptoms; early recovery (within 6 mo) of HPA axis function may indicate an increased risk of recurrence. Elevated late-night serum/salivary cortisol is one of the earliest biochemically detectable signs of recurrence and almost always precedes elevated urine cortisol, and because diagnostic accuracy of proposed predictors is not high enough regarding long-term outcomes, clinicians must monitor every patient in remission from CD for the possibility of recurrence. Rarely, residual adrenocortical tissue can regrow due to prolonged adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) hypersecretion; if patients become cushinoid after bilateral adrenalectomy, clinicians should test endogenous cortisol secretory capacity by withholding glucocorticoid for 24 hours and checking serum/salivary cortisol levels; recurrence after ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor resection generally reflects metastasis.

Pituitary tumor–related and idiopathic hyperprolactinemia — patients with large nonfunctioning pituitary tumors, craniopharyngiomas, or granulomatous infiltration of the hypothalamus can develop hyperprolactinemia because of pituitary stalk compression or dopaminergic neuronal damage, and in 226 patients with histologically confirmed nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas, a prolactin level greater than 94 µg/liter reliably distinguished between prolactinomas and nonfunctioning adenomas; dopamine agonist therapy lowers prolactin levels and improves symptoms in patients with stalk compression, but it is not definitive therapy for a nonfunctioning adenoma; fewer than 10% of patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia ultimately are found to harbor a microadenoma and progression from a microadenoma to a macroadenoma is rare; spontaneous normalization of prolactin levels occurs in approximately 30% of patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia; and it is important to determine whether patients with hyperprolactinemia also have acromegaly because prolactin is elevated in up to 50% of patients with GH-secreting tumors.

Preoperative evaluation

Clinical examination

The diagnosis relied on preoperative clinical and biochemical evaluations, following a standardized protocol for pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outlined below. Baseline characteristics encompassed patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and the clinical manifestations prompting their presentation (i.e. headache, visual deficits, galactorrhea, amenorrhea in women, low libido/erectile dysfunction in men).

Biochemical evaluation

PRL levels were evaluated using the immunoradiometric PRL assay, employing serum dilution to overcome the high-dose PRL hook effect. The presence of macroprolactin was regularly examined. The upper limit for PRL levels was set at 20 µg/L. In terms of pituitary axis deficits, partial hypopituitarism was defined as impaired secretion of one or more pituitary hormones. Secondary adrenal insufficiency was identified by low cortisol levels (< 50 nmol/L) in the serum or normal cortisol levels with inadequate responses to the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test or insulin tolerance test. The diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism relied on finding low-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and a low free thyroxin (FT4) level. A deficiency in gonadotropins or central hypogonadism was considered if gonadotropin levels were low-normal alongside low estradiol/testosterone levels.

Neuroimaging assessment

MRI scans were conducted using a 1.5- or 3-Tesla system, encompassing a Proton/T2-weighted whole-brain examination that included unenhanced, contrast-enhanced, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and post-contrast-enhanced overlapping studies in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes focused on the sellar region. A tumor with a diameter ranging from 1 to 10 mm was categorized as a microadenoma. The invasiveness of the cavernous sinus was described using the Knosp classification. Immunohistochemical confirmation with a PRL antibody, in line with the WHO classification of neuroendocrine tumors, served as the gold standard for diagnosis.

### Hypopituitarism patterns and prevalence among men with macroprolactinomas [^113iW1S7]. Pituitary (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Men with prolactin-secreting tumors usually harbor macroadenomas. The degree of pituitary dysfunction may vary among different adenoma size subgroups, as is recovery after treatment. Our study purpose was to characterize hypopituitarism and recovery after treatment in men with macroprolactinomas.

Methods

A retrospective study, including a consecutive group of 81 men with pituitary macroadenomas (≥ 10 mm) and hyperprolactinemia (> 7×ULN). Patients were divided into three categories according to adenoma size at presentation: 10–19 mm (group A), 20–39 mm (group B), and ≥ 40 mm (group C). We compared total testosterone, gonadotropins, cortisol, thyroid hormones and hemoglobin levels at presentation and after treatment.

Results

Eighty-one patients were included; 24, 31 and 26 patients in groups A, B and C, respectively. Pretreatment hypogonadism prevalence was 75.0, 93.5 and 90.9% (p = 0.046; A vs B and C), central hypocortisolism - 0, 6.9 and 33.3% (p = 0.005), and central hypothyroidism - 6.7, 17.9 and 26.1% (NS) in groups A, B and C, respectively. Only 26.7% of all patients presented with hypocortisolism and/or hypothyroidism (42.9% in group C). Anemia (Hb < 13.5 g%) was detected in 31.3, 57.1 and 80.0% in groups A, B and C, respectively (p = 0.04). Larger adenoma diameter correlated strongly with lower FT4 levels following treatment (r = -0.42, p = 0.043).

Conclusions

Macroprolactinomas in men caused partial hypopituitarism, affecting testosterone in all adenoma size groups and cortisol more in patients with larger adenomas. However, most of the men did not have pituitary hormones affected, beside testosterone. Most patients recovered central hypocortisolism but not hypothyroidism following treatment.

Endocrine Society hyperprolactinemia — pituitary MRI during pregnancy and tumor growth risk states: We recommend against the use of routine pituitary MRI during pregnancy in patients with microadenomas or intrasellar macroadenomas unless there is clinical evidence for tumor growth such as visual field compromise. Microadenomas are highly unlikely to expand during pregnancy, and in a review including 457 pregnant women harboring microadenomas, 2.6% developed symptomatic tumor growth, with studies that examined tumor growth using imaging techniques observing risk somewhat higher (4.5–5%); because the risk is so low, pregnant patients with microadenomas may be followed by clinical examination during each trimester.

### How early can one diagnose Cushing's disease? An early diagnosis in a case of prepubertal Cushing's disease [^111RuZAg]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cushing's disease is very rare in children, and the diagnosis is frequently delayed by several years.

Objective

We report a case of prepubertal Cushing's disease with a medical history of only 9 months. This case illustrates the difficulties involved in diagnosing children at the early stage of the disease.

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old prepubertal boy presented with rapid weight gain accompanied by a decreasing growth velocity and hirsutism. Thyroid function tests and growth factor levels were normal, thus excluding hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency. Cushing's syndrome was confirmed by elevated 24-h urinary free cortisol levels, increased diurnal cortisol levels, and a lack of cortisol suppression in the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Further tests to investigate the source of the hypercortisolism showed the following results: Basal morning adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was normal. The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test led to a 51% decrease in cortisol level. In the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test, ACTH and cortisol increased only by 28%. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finally revealed a microadenoma in the anterior pituitary, thus establishng the diagnosis of Cushing's disease. Upon diagnosis, the patient underwent transsphenoidal surgery. Histological analysis confirmed an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma.

Conclusion

This case illustrates the difficulties associated with the clinical, biochemical, and radiological diagnoses of Cushing's disease in children. Early diagnosis remains a challenge because test results often do not match standard diagnostic criteria.

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH

The diagnostic workup for hyperprolactinemia is shown in Fig. 2. As reported in Table 1, a number of physiologic (pregnancy, breastfeeding, stress, exercise, food intake, and sleep) and pathologic conditions (chronic kidney and liver failure, primary hypothyroidism, compression of the pituitary stalk by a non–PRL-secreting pituitary tumor or different parasellar mass, and granulomatous infiltration of the hypothalamus), as well as several drugs (mainly antidepressants, dopamine receptor blockers, dopamine synthesis inhibitors, oral contraceptives, gastrointestinal medications, neuroleptics, and antipsychotics) can induce symptomatic hyperprolactinemia. Before a correct diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is made, such conditions must be investigated and excluded. Attention should be paid to medical history, concomitant medications, and biochemical assessment. This is particularly true in the case of modest PRL elevations, which only occasionally may mask the presence of a prolactinoma, as in clinical case 2. To ascertain the diagnosis of a PRL-secreting pituitary tumor, a single measurement of serum PRL without excessive venipuncture stress is strongly recommended. Breast examination in patients with galactorrhea should not be performed immediately before PRL assessment because any nipple stimulation might result in PRL increase. A level above the upper limit of normal (25 μg/L in women, 20 μg/L in men) raises diagnostic suspicion. Conversely, dynamic testing of PRL secretion based on the administration of TRH, L-dopa, nomifensine, and domperidone does not find clinical application currently. In uncertain conditions, sampling can be repeated after overnight fasting on a different day in 2 to 3 samples in time course at 15- to 20-minute intervals to minimize the effect of PRL pulsatile secretion. PRL levels > 250 μg/L generally confirm the diagnosis of prolactinoma, albeit PRL increase over 200 μg/L can be also seen in case of non–PRL-secreting tumor mass, such as nonfunctioning pituitary tumors. In presence of a serum PRL level > 500 μg/L, the diagnosis of macroprolactinoma can be ruled in. Once other causes of hyperprolactinemia (see previous section) have been excluded, a radiological confirmation with pituitary imaging, mainly based on gadolinium-enhanced MRI is required. Over the past 20 years, pituitary MRI has progressively replaced computed tomography with IV contrast enhancement because the latter is less effective than MRI in visualizing small tumors on the one hand and in shaping the extension of large or giant tumors on the other. Nowadays, a pituitary computed tomography scan is recommended only when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, such as in patients with cardiac pacemakers, implanted cardiac defibrillators; internal pacing wires; clips for cerebral, carotid, or aortic aneurysm; cochlear implants; any implant held in by magnet; Swan-Ganz catheter; and pregnancy. In the latter circumstance, the use of pituitary MRI is not recommended except in the case of clinical confirmation of tumor growth suggested by sudden impairment in the visual field, and MRI should be performed without gadolinium after the second trimester of pregnancy. In those patients with macroadenomas impinging the optic chiasm, a visual field examination is recommended, whereas visual testing is not mandatory for patients with microadenomas.

### Pituitary imaging is indicated for the evaluation of hyperprolactinemia [^1123MniR]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the signs and symptoms associated with hyperprolactinemia and establish guidelines for a minimal serum PRL level for which pituitary imaging is indicated.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Reproductive endocrinology clinic in a university hospital.

Patient(S)

One hundred four consecutive patients with hyperprolactinemia, mean age 30 ± 6.5 (range 19–44) years.

Intervention(S)

Classification of clinical symptoms, serum hormone measurements, and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Incidence of presenting symptoms, serum PRL levels, and pituitary tumor size.

Result(S)

Median (range) PRL value was 82.6 ng/mL (25–1,342). Reported symptoms from most to least common were infertility (48%), headaches (39%), oligoamenorrhea (29%), galactorrhea (24%), and visual changes (13%). Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 2 of 104 (1.9%) patients. Of 86 patients who had pituitary imaging, 23 (26%) had normal findings and 63 (74%) had pituitary tumor; of these, 47 (55% of total imaged) had microadenomas and 16 (19% of total imaged) had macroadenomas. There was a statistically significant association between the tumor size and the PRL level. However, 11% of the patients with microadenomas had PRL levels > 200 ng/mL, and 44% of the patients with macroadenomas had PRL levels between 25 and 200 ng/mL.

Conclusion(S)

The most common symptoms in the population studied were infertility and headaches. Coexisting thyroid disease was an uncommon finding. Most patients had a pituitary tumor on MRI. Although tumor size correlated with the serum PRL level, some macroadenomas were detected in women with only moderately elevated PRL values. On the basis of these findings, pituitary imaging should be obtained to identify pituitary tumors in all patients with persistently elevated PRL levels.

Pituitary incidentaloma — hypopituitarism evaluation recommendation and approach: 1.1.2 We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma with or without symptoms also undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hypopituitarism (1|⊕⊕⊕○). Evidence from small observational studies reported hypopituitarism in seven of 66 and 19 of 46 patients, with deficits detected in up to 30% (gonadotropins), up to 18% (ACTH/cortisol), up to 28% (thyroid), and up to 8% (GH). Initial evaluation approaches vary: some Task Force members recommend minimal screening with free T4, morning cortisol, and testosterone, whereas others include TSH, LH, FSH, and IGF-I; interpretive notes include that low gonadotropins in postmenopausal women provide evidence of hypopituitarism and in men exclude primary hypogonadism when testosterone is low, normal or low TSH helps identify central hypothyroidism when free T4 is low, and if baseline testing suggests hypopituitarism, further stimulation tests of the pituitary-adrenal or GH-IGF-I axis should be performed.

### Preoperative assessment for pituitary surgery [^112bJ85b]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Evaluation of pituitary function is essential before pituitary surgery. In hyperprolactinaemic patients with a pituitary macrolesion, tumoral secretion of prolactin must be distinguished from 'disconnection' hyperprolactinaemia; serum prolactin > 200 mcg/l is virtually diagnostic of a macroprolactinoma whereas levels < 80 mcg/l usually indicate 'disconnection'. The prolactin 'hook effect' should be excluded. A minimum set of pre-operative endocrine tests should include serum electrolytes, cortisol (at 08.00–09.00 h), free-T4, TSH, prolactin, oestradiol/testosterone, LH, FSH and IGF-1. Some clinicians will choose to perform pre-operative Synacthen or insulin tolerance testing to further define ACTH reserve. If basal cortisol, Synacthen or insulin tolerance test results are abnormal, steroid supplementation is indicated for at least the first 48 h after surgery. If pre-operative basal cortisol is < 100 nmol/l, replacement steroids should be continued until the time of post-operative pituitary function testing (6–8 weeks after surgery). In patients with pre-operative basal cortisol > 450 nmol/l, peri-operative glucocorticoid replacement is unnecessary and further cortisol levels should be checked a few days after surgery. Most clinicians defer detailed evaluation of growth hormone reserve until after surgery. Diabetes insipidus is rarely a problem before surgery in patients with pituitary adenomas but may occur post-operatively. Close co-operation between anesthetic, endocrine and surgical teams is strongly recommended.

### UK practice on incidentally detected non-functioning pituitary microadenomas: analysis of two national surveys during a 12-year interval [^116auHEK]. Pituitary (2023). Medium credibility.

Approximately 97%, 95% and 88% of 2021 survey respondents would screen for hypopituitarism, measuring LH, FSH and gonadal hormones, TSH and paired free T4 and morning cortisol, respectively. Interestingly, 6.7% would measure plasma and urine osmolalities aiming to investigate for diabetes insipidus. It is of note that dynamic testing for the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis would be performed by a higher number of clinicians in the 2009 survey (30.4% vs 11.4%), whereas morning cortisol would be used more frequently by the 2021 survey participants (87.9% vs 62.6%). At baseline, most clinicians share the opinion of screening for hypopituitarism, and request investigations as suggested by the 2016 Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline on hormonal replacement in adults with hypopituitarism. The 2011 Endocrine Society guidelines on pituitary incidentalomas recommend screening for hypopituitarism for all microincidentalomas, particularly for tumours sized between 6 and 9 mm. The 2021 German guideline on the diagnosis of clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas similarly recommends screening for all anterior pituitary hormones at initial presentation, except for cortisol, in which measurement is recommended for larger tumours only (≥ 6 mm). Others stipulate the evaluation for any form of hypopituitarism is unnecessary for smaller tumours (< 5 mm), but for clinicians to consider assessment for those measuring > 5 mm. Debate most likely arises due to variance in the reported rates of hypopituitarism. Furthermore, whilst some provide guidance based on size of microadenoma, evidence to support a specific threshold is still lacking. Of note, two recent studies with a comparatively large cohort of clinically NFPAs were unable to demonstrate a significant difference in the prevalence of hypopituitarism between those smaller than 5 mm and those sized 5–9 mm.

### Low immediate postoperative serum-cortisol nadir predicts the short-term, but not long-term, remission after pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease [^116qVGdS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Surgical outcome

The lack of international consensus on the definition of cure after transphenoidal surgery for Cushing's disease makes the interpretation of reported outcome figures difficult. Most authors use the clinical resolution of symptoms and one or more of the biochemical parameters of normalisation of 24 h urinary free cortisol levels, low late-night saliva cortisol, normal midnight serum cortisol or suppression of cortisol after low-dose dexamethasone test. Due to this lack of consensus and the heterogeneity of patient populations, there is considerable variation in the reported immediate postoperative remission rate, ranging from 55 to 95% The best results are obtained in patients with non-invasive microadenomas with cure rates as high as 93%, and with a marked reduction in the remission rate with increasing tumour diameter and extrasellar extension. Our results of 84% in remission at 3 months and 95% in remission at 1 year are in accordance with the literature. It is worth noting that all of our patients completed follow-up, while in other published series, up to 30% of the patients were lost to follow-up, which may have biased the results.

In this study, with a mean follow-up of 5.7 years (68 months), five out of 19 patients had a late recurrence. This high recurrence rate (26%) may represent the "natural, but underreported, history of the disease" or the consequence of our surgical practise. Few complications were recorded in this series, with zero surgical complications and three patients with new hormonal deficits, which may reflect a cautious attitude during resection or extirpation of the tumour. On the other hand, long-term follow-up was performed on all patients and will tend to give a higher recurrence rate. In a large study on late recurrences of Cushing's disease after initial successful surgery, 215 patients were followed for a mean of 45 months, and the actuarial recurrence rate after 5 years was 25.5%. Atkinson et al. reported a 9.6-year recurrence rate of 22%. In a newly published report, the recurrence rate was 65.6% with follow-up of 14 ± 10 years, whereas mean time to recurrence was 2.4 ± 1.7 years.

The reported long-term recurrence rates for other endocrine active pituitary adenomas, like growth hormone secreting tumours, are considerably lower, ranging from 2 to 6%. The higher recurrence rate seen in Cushing's disease indicates a different tumour biology, which makes surgical cure more difficult.

In patients with a clinical suspicion for glucocorticoid excess, laboratory screening is therefore suggested, and detection of subclinical hypercortisolism should be followed by evaluation for possible Cushing's disease.

We suggest that clinicians not treat asymptomatic patients harboring microprolactinomas with dopamine agonists, and we suggest treatment with a dopamine agonist or oral contraceptives for patients with microadenomas who have amenorrhea. We suggest that with careful clinical and biochemical follow-up, therapy may be tapered and perhaps discontinued after at least 2 yr in patients who no longer have elevated serum prolactin and have no visible tumor remnant on MRI.

2.1 Evidence

The options for treatment of patients with asymptomatic, clinically nonfunctioning pituitary incidentalomas are conservative follow-up without surgery (Fig. 1) or immediate surgery despite the lack of indications for this. Conservative follow-up was recommended with the recognition that the proper algorithm for this and its appropriateness and safety have not been tested prospectively. Few data are available for or against a nonsurgical approach to management of asymptomatic pituitary incidentalomas. Therefore, evidence in support of these guidelines also relied on the clinical experiences of the Task Force members.

The proper algorithm for endocrine testing during this follow-up has not been tested as prospectively conducted endocrine testing of patients with pituitary incidentalomas who were followed without surgery has only been reported in 49 patients. Follow-up endocrine testing is recommended for patients with macroincidentalomas because they are at risk of developing hypopituitarism. Of the macroincidentalomas followed prospectively, worsening hypopituitarism developed in one of seven and three of 28 patients, all of whom had enlargement of their tumors. Hypopituitarism also developed in four of 37 and one of 248 patients who developed apoplexy on follow-up. Follow-up endocrine testing was recommended despite the paucity of data because of the potential high risk to the patient of untreated hypopituitarism. In a meta-analysis of incidentaloma studies, new endocrine dysfunction developed overall in 2.4% of patients per year. It is unclear how often new hypopituitarism develops in the absence of tumor growth. Rapid growth may increase the risk of new hypopituitarism. Routine follow-up endocrine testing is not required for microincidentalomas whose clinical picture does not change because the risk of developing new hypopituitarism is extremely low. In previous studies, none of the pituitary microincidentalomas followed prospectively was reported to be associated with changes in pituitary function.

### Undetectable postoperative cortisol does not always predict long-term remission in Cushing's disease: a single centre audit [^114d8x3m]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

An undetectable postoperative serum cortisol has been regarded as a definition of cure in Cushing's disease. However, we noted disease recurrence amongst patients with Cushing's disease despite undetectable postoperative cortisol levels, and this led us to audit our data. We have also previously assessed surgical outcome for acromegaly and microprolactinoma for a single surgeon. The aims of this study were two-fold: (i) to investigate the treatment and surgical outcome of patients with Cushing's disease. In particular, we wished to compare the data with outcome for other pituitary tumours in our centre; and (ii) to determine whether undetectable cortisol following surgery is predictive of long-term cure for Cushing's disease.

Patients and Methods

We performed a retrospective audit of 97 patients; mean age 39.1 (range: 14–82) years, 78/97 (80.4%) female, mean follow-up 92 months (range: 6 months to 29 years), with Cushing's disease seen in our unit between 1969 and 1998. We documented diagnostic investigation, immediate surgical outcome and disease recurrence in these patients.

Results

All patients had elevated urinary free cortisol (mean 1270.6 nmol/l, range: 327–3245 nmol/l). In total, 95.5% of patients did not suppress with low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing. Hypokalaemia (K < 3.2 mmol/l) was present in 15.6% of patients; 17.5% of patients did not show cortisol suppression with high-dose dexamethasone and 15.8% of patients did not show an ACTH rise of > 50% following corticotrophic releasing hormone (CRH) administration. There was no significant (> 3) gradient in ACTH or cortisol following CRH during inferior petrosal sinus sampling in 27.3% of patients who had the test. A pituitary tumour was demonstrated on imaging in 55.8% of patients; 10.3% were macroadenomas. Mortality rate following trans-sphenoidal surgery was 1%. Following surgery, the immediate postoperative remission rate (undetectable postoperative cortisol) was 68.5%. However, 11.5% of these patients developed disease recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 36.3 months. Considering microadenomas, Cushing's disease patients had an immediate postoperative remission rate of 63.2% which is significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared to a remission rate of 91.1% in acromegaly. Additionally, new postoperative gonadotrophin deficiency (13.9%) and TSH deficiency (25.8%) was higher in patients with Cushing's disease compared to patients with acromegaly or microprolactinoma. Immediate postoperative remission rates improved from 50% in the first decade of a surgeon's career to consistently above 60% in the second and third decades, demonstrating a trend which may be attributed to surgical experience.

Conclusions

(i) Despite strict criteria for immediate postoperative remission and recurrence, undetectable postoperative cortisol is not always predictive of long-term remission. (ii) Despite an aggressive surgical approach, immediate postoperative remission rates for Cushing's disease are lower compared to other microadenomas. The development of new pituitary hormonal deficiency following surgery is also commoner than that seen amongst other microadenomas. These data have important implications for the follow-up of patients with Cushing's disease.

### Galactorrhea: rapid evidence review [^1158ahkE]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Galactorrhea is the production of breast milk that is not the result of physiologic lactation. Milky nipple discharge within one year of pregnancy and the cessation of breastfeeding is usually physiologic. Galactorrhea is more often the result of hyperprolactinemia caused by medication use or pituitary microadenomas, and less often hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, cirrhosis, pituitary macroadenomas, hypothalamic lesions, or unidentifiable causes. A pregnancy test should be obtained for premenopausal women who present with galactorrhea. In addition to prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, renal function should also be assessed. Medications contributing to hyperprolactinemia should be discontinued if possible. Treatment of galactorrhea is not needed if prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are normal and the discharge is not troublesome to the patient. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland should be performed if the cause of hyperprolactinemia is unclear after a medication review and laboratory evaluation. Cabergoline is the preferred medication for treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Transsphenoidal surgery may be necessary if prolactin levels do not improve and symptoms persist despite high doses of cabergoline and in patients who cannot tolerate dopamine agonist therapy.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism? [^112qNmQW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Pituitary surgery/apoplexy

All patients with sellar/parasellar tumours should be subjected to an assessment of HPA axis function, with perhaps the exception of those with pituitary microadenomas who are at a very low risk of ACTH deficiency. Patients should undergo post-operative interrogation of the HPA axis regardless of whether they had pre-operative ACTH deficiency as there is potential for these patients to gain functional recovery providing that viable normal pituitary tissue remains in situ.

ACTH deficiency is the most common deficit observed in pituitary apoplexy occurring in 50–80% of cases. Due to its high frequency and potentially life-threatening effects, empiric parenteral corticosteroid is administered, when possible preceeded by blood drawing for serum cortisol levels. Pituitary function can recover following surgical decompression. Therefore post-operative re-assessment of the HPA axis is required.

A 08.00 h plasma cortisol can be measured on day 1–3 post-operatively in patients not treated with glucocorticoids and day 3–5 in patients covered with glucocorticoids once the dose is tapered down to physiological replacement with the second dose of hydrocortisone given early in the afternoon (if hydrocortisone is used) and the morning dose of hydrocortisone not given until after the sample is drawn. However, there are conflicting opinions regarding what constitutes a safe level of 08.00 h plasma cortisol. Patients with a 08.00 h unstressed cortisol of > 400 nmol/L have an extremely low risk of ACTH deficiency and no further dynamic testing of the HPA axis is required. Conversely, patients with a post-operative 08.00 h cortisol of < 100 nmol/L are invariably ACTH deficient and glucocorticoid replacement should be commenced. Patients with a 08.00 h cortisol between these values require definitive testing.

The alternative, and our preferred, approach is to routinely perform a dynamic test of HPA axis function 6–8 weeks post-operatively. This has the advantage of facilitating early discharge of patients post-operatively on empiric glucocorticoid replacement rather than waiting for day 3–5 cortisol values and may better identify those patients with later recovery of cortisol secretion.

### Outcomes of pituitary apoplexy: a comparison of microadenomas and macroadenomas [^112wjhq3]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to assess clinical characteristics of apoplexy of pituitary microadenomas compared to macroadenomas.

Methods

We retrieved clinical records of patients > 18 years old, hospitalized in Rambam hospital between January 2001 and October 2017, with pituitary apoplexy and follow-up of at least one year. We compared clinical course and outcomes of apoplexy between patients with microadenomas and macroadenomas, and between patients who received conservative or surgical treatment. Statistical analysis was done using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney tests.

Results

Twenty-seven patients with pituitary apoplexy were included in the final analysis: mean age was 40.7 ± 12.5 years, 13(48%) were female, 7(26%) had microadenomas, and 21(78%) harbored clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Upon admission, hyponatremia, random cortisol level of < 200 nmol/L, and secondary hypothyroidism, were evident in 6/20, 8/18, and 4/18 patients with macroadenoma and 1/5, 2/5, and 1/6 patients with microadenoma, respectively (P = 1.0). Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was evident in 9/12 men with macroadenoma. In 12 macroadenoma patients, the tumor abutted the optic chiasm, of whom eight had visual field defects. Fifteen patients with macroadenoma and two with microadenoma underwent transsphenoidal surgery. Median follow-up was 3 years. At last follow-up visit, patients with microadenoma had lower rates of corticotropic deficiency or secondary hypothyroidism compared to macroadenoma patients (1/7 vs. 13/20 respectively, p = 0.033). Only two patients with macroadenomas had persistent visual field defects. Outcomes were comparable between conservative and surgical treatment groups.

Conclusions

Long term pituitary hormone deficiencies are more common in pituitary apoplexy patients with macroadenomas. Apoplexy of pituitary microadenoma carries a more favorable prognosis.

2.0 Follow-up testing of the pituitary incidentaloma

2.1 Patients with incidentalomas who do not meet criteria for surgical removal of the tumor should receive nonsurgical follow-up (2|⊕⊕○○) with clinical assessments and the following tests:

2.1.1 MRI scan of the pituitary 6 months after the initial scan if the incidentaloma is a macroincidentaloma and 1 yr after the initial scan if it is a microincidentaloma (1|⊕⊕○○). In patients whose incidentaloma does not change in size, we suggest repeating the MRI every year for macroincidentalomas and every 1–2 yr in microincidentalomas for the following 3 yr, and gradually less frequently thereafter (2|⊕⊕○○).

2.1.2 VF testing in patients with a pituitary incidentaloma that enlarges to abut or compress the optic nerves or chiasm on a follow-up imaging study (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕). We suggest that clinicians do not need to test VF in patients whose incidentalomas are not close to the chiasm and who have no new symptoms and are being followed closely by MRI (2|⊕○○○).

2.1.3 Clinical and biochemical evaluations for hypopituitarism 6 months after the initial testing and yearly thereafter in patients with a pituitary macroincidentaloma, although typically hypopituitarism develops with the finding of an increase in size of the incidentaloma (1|⊕⊕○○). We suggest that clinicians do not need to test for hypopituitarism in patients with pituitary microincidentalomas whose clinical picture, history, and MRI do not change over time (2|⊕⊕○○).

2.2 Patients who develop any signs or symptoms potentially related to the incidentaloma or who show an increase in size of the incidentaloma on MRI should undergo more frequent or detailed evaluations as indicated clinically (1|⊕⊕○○).

### Clinical biology of the pituitary adenoma [^117WrVYs]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

A normal pregnancy course is anticipated for most patients with a pituitary adenoma. Although most adenomas are small, and pregnancy-induced enlargement is negligible, some patients may exhibit symptomatic adenoma enlargement requiring urgent management. Surgical indications include vision loss and uncontrolled hypercortisolism in patients with corticotroph adenomas. Due to the rare but serious risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, specialized care is required. Vaginal delivery is preferred in women with a microadenoma. However, for a woman with a macroadenoma with visual impairment or severe headache, most would suggest cesarean section.

Results

Patient population

We were able to identify 429 patients who were treated via the transsphenoidal approach for tumors of the sellar and parasellar region from April 2006 to January 2019 in our clinical neurosurgical department. Sixty-two patients with hormone-producing adenoma causing Acromegaly and M. Cushing were excluded due to their distinct preoperative cortisol levels (Fig. 1). Fifty-nine patients were excluded due to histopathological diagnosis of tumors other than pituitary adenoma (meningioma, Rathke's cleft cysts, hypophysitis) due to their distinct clinical outcome. In total, 97 patients were lost to follow-up endocrinological data at 1 year.

Fig. 1
Flowchart describing the number of patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria and showing the number of patients included for analysis (n = 211)

We were able to include 211 patients for further analysis. Comparing the numbers over the years, we observed a trend towards increasing numbers of surgeries performed for transnasal pituitary adenoma resection (number of cases included between 2006 and 2012, n = 72; 2013–2019, 139 cases).

Median age was 56 years with a range of 20–86 years. Sixty percent (n = 127) were male and 40% (n = 84) female patients. Median preoperative KPS was 90% (range 20–100%). 97.6% of the patients suffered from pituitary macroadenoma, and only 5 patients presented with progressive hormone-inactive pituitary microadenoma (only selected cases such as patients presenting with tumor growth on follow-up imaging leading to the indication of surgical removal (2.4%)).

Hypopituitarism diagnosis — initial testing and thresholds include early morning fasted pituitary profiles, prioritized screening for diabetes insipidus (DI), and cortisol cutoffs for adrenal insufficiency (AI). An early morning fasted pituitary profile should be arranged, and if DI is strongly suspected, a non-fasted morning blood sample for serum sodium and osmolality should be collected first because patients with complete DI often present with hypernatremia, avoiding the need for a protracted water deprivation test. For AI, a cortisol level < 3 µg/dL indicates AI while a cortisol level > 15 µg/dL reliably excludes AI, with dynamic testing ordinarily used for intermediate results but possibly delayed during the pandemic. Central hypothyroidism is suggested by a low free T4 with low/normal TSH, and central hypogonadism is suggested by low serum testosterone with low/normal gonadotrophins in non-obese males or low estradiol with low/normal gonadotrophins in pre-menopausal women with amenorrhea or in post-menopausal females.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1111aFv6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

1.1–1.1.1 Values and preferences

The recommendations for screening for hypersecretion needed to balance the potential benefits of early detection with the relatively low likelihood of finding certain abnormalities in a given patient and the costs and burden of potentially unnecessary testing.

Screening for certain hormone hypersecretion syndromes was considered important, even if the patient was asymptomatic or if the abnormality was unlikely in the patient population. Screening for hyperprolactinemia was considered essential because of the potential for successful treatment with an oral dopamine agonist. Screening for GH excess with a serum IGF-I level was recommended because early detection of a GH-secreting tumor, which would likely be asymptomatic, could reduce long-term morbidity and increase the likelihood of surgical cure. Some consider screening also for glucocorticoid excess in all patients, but others may limit screening to patients for whom there is a clinical suspicion, due to the high false-positive rate and low rate of true-positive testing in the former group of patients.

1.1–1.1.1 Remarks

The pros and cons of detailed vs. limited screening for hypersecretion syndromes (other than for prolactinoma) were debated, and the Task Force was split on this point. The quality of evidence for or against one particular testing strategy was weak.

Recommendation

1.1.2 We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma with or without symptoms also undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hypopituitarism (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of a lactotroph adenoma can be inferred in most patients based on the presence of a pituitary adenoma and an elevated prolactin level, which is typically proportionate in magnitude to adenoma size. Pituitary imaging (MRI or CT) is therefore a key step in the investigation of hyperprolactinemia. Evaluation for hypopituitarism is also necessary.

Management

Although observation and routine follow-up with serial prolactin levels and imaging is acceptable for patients who are asymptomatic and who have a microadenoma, most patients diagnosed with a prolactinoma will require treatment. Dopamine-agonists (DA) can normalize prolactin levels and lead to reduction in size of the lactotroph adenoma. In patients who have a microadenoma and who are not seeking fertility, hormone-replacement therapy may also be appropriate if serum prolactin is routinely followed and imaging performed as necessary.

Medical therapy can be managed effectively and efficiently via VVs coupled with laboratory/imaging studies as needed. However, in all patients in whom a DA will be initiated, it is critical that a comprehensive psychiatric history is obtained prior to commencing treatment. Patients may not readily volunteer their psychiatric history and may not appreciate the relevance of such information. For example, until specifically questioned about their psychiatric history, the patient described in the illustrative case (Box 2) did not report a history of severe depression, suicide attempt and prolonged psychiatric hospitalization 8 months prior to presentation with hyperprolactinemia. At the time of the visit, he was not taking any psychiatric medications and was not under the care of a mental health team. Given this patient's significant psychiatric history, lack of ongoing psychiatric care, and the well-recognized adverse effects of DA therapy, including increased impulsivity, depression and psychosis, a DA was not initiated. Counseling on potential DA side-effects is crucial, as they may also present in individuals with no prior psychiatric history. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic when there is reduced access to routine medical and mental health care, patients who develop symptoms of severe depression may not have ready access to mental health services, or may not seek care. Therefore, it is particularly important to make patients aware of these potential side effects and the critical importance of reporting them.

In the small number of patients for whom medical therapy is not possible and where surveillance is not appropriate (e.g. macroprolactinoma with visual loss) the risks and benefits of surgical intervention will need to be carefully weighed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, more specifically with respect to endocrine evaluation, PS 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain baseline screening for hypopituitarism in all patients with sellar lesions by measuring levels of fT4, TSH, morning cortisol, ACTH, LH, FSH, and IGF-1. Measure testosterone in men and estradiol in women as needed. Obtain dynamic testing of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis if morning cortisol levels suggest hypocortisolism. Consider obtaining dynamic testing for GHD in selected patients after correction of other pituitary hormone deficiencies. Do not obtain gonadal hormonal testing in premenopausal women with regular menses.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1115gKUp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Pituitary incidentaloma — prolactin assessment and management: The evaluation for hypersecretion should include an assessment for prolactin, and evidence is strongest for the need to measure a serum prolactin level in all patients presenting with an incidentaloma; ideally, for patients with large macroincidentalomas, the laboratory should measure prolactin levels in diluted serum to ensure that levels are not falsely lowered by a hook effect in the assay. Reported findings include hyperprolactinemia in five of 42 microincidentalomas at initial evaluation with none of 22 developing a prolactin elevation on prospective follow-up, prolactinomas detected in seven of 46 incidentalomas, prolactin elevations in two of 16 macroincidentalomas, and in a large autopsy study 39.5% of adenomas stained positive for prolactin. Patients with hyperprolactinemia could receive a trial of dopamine agonist therapy, recognizing that mild/moderate elevations may be due to stalk compression; in these patients, tumor shrinkage is unlikely and growth is still possible, so continued follow-up with repeat imaging is warranted.

### Non-functioning pituitary adenomas: indications for pituitary surgery and post-surgical management [^1146FzCP]. Pituitary (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic non-functioning pituitary adenomas

Surgical resection of non-functioning microadenomas is not indicated since tumor growth is rare (3–13%) with less than 5% growing > 1 cm during long-term follow-up. Management of non-functioning microadenomas is outside the scope of this review.

Management strategies of asymptomatic non-functioning macroadenomas vary greatly. The median rate of tumor enlargement in macroadenomas has been reported to be 0.6 mm/year. Conservative management is recommended for macroadenomas not reaching the optic chiasm with regular surveillance of tumor status and endocrine function (Fig. 1). However, treatment decisions should be individualized and based on age, pituitary function, and patient preference. Surgery may be favored in younger patients given the higher lifetime probability of tumor growth and discouraged in older patients with comorbidities and risk of surgical complications.

Despite NFPAs usually have a slow growth rate, some may enlarge and become symptomatic. Biochemical evaluation for hypopituitarism should therefore be considered every 6–12 months during conservative management because remaining pituitary function may deteriorate by tumor enlargement. Radiological assessment by MRI should be repeated within 6–12 months after initial tumor detection; if no progression is detected, MRI can be performed less often. The timing of visual field follow-up usually depends on the distance between the adenoma and the optic chiasm.

Perioperative endocrine care

Patients with confirmed secondary adrenal insufficiency should be adequately treated with glucocorticoid (GC) replacement therapy and stress GC doses should be administered during the perioperative period (Table 1). Perioperative GC therapy is also frequently used in patients with intact hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) function. The rationale is to cover these patients in case adrenal insufficiency develops during the surgical procedure. Cortisol response to major surgical stress has been shown to last for 48 h in healthy subjects. Based on this, it has been suggested to discontinue GC therapy 48 h after surgery. However, in many centers, GC therapy is administered in tapering doses and then discontinued when proper re-evaluation of HPA has been performed.

Patients with preoperative overt central hypothyroidism should receive thyroxine replacement therapy before surgery. Patients with severe hypothyroidism have increased risk of surgical complications. Therefore, in case of non-emergency surgery, it is suggested to wait until thyroxine replacement therapy has been initiated and optimized.

### UK practice on incidentally detected non-functioning pituitary microadenomas: analysis of two national surveys during a 12-year interval [^114sJZKX]. Pituitary (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the clinical practice on the diagnosis and management of presumed microNFPAs has evolved in the UK. Currently, although a small rate of clinicians would consider imaging follow-up beyond 5 years, there is variability in the frequency of the imaging intervals and the number of MRIs chosen to be performed until discharge. Old age at tumour detection and lesion < 6 mm are main factors dictating decision to discharge. Yearly biochemical surveillance is performed by a considerable number of clinicians in the absence of tumour growth or clinical symptoms, despite international recommendations to the contrary. The uncertainty and lack of a unified approach to the management of microNFPAs highlighted by our study is shaped by the shortage of evidence exploring the long-term natural history of these tumours and necessitates generation of robust data on the risks of new hypopituitarism and clinically relevant tumour growth. Such risks must, in turn, be balanced against the potential impact of long-term surveillance on both patient and health care resources.

### Ten-year clinical follow-up of a cohort of 51 patients with macroprolactinemia establishes it as a benign variant [^1154fnNT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Macroprolactinemia is a common finding in patients with hyperprolactinemia. There are no published long-term follow-up studies.

Objective

The aim of this study was to describe findings after prolonged follow-up in a previously published cohort of patients with macroprolactinemia.

Study Population

We studied 51 patients identified as having macroprolactinemia after polyethylene glycol precipitation.

Design

Clinical assessment and serum prolactin assay were repeated in 51 patients with macroprolactinemia after a median follow-up of 9.9 yr (range, 9–11 yr).

Results

Median age at presentation was 41 yr (range, 18–55 yr). Mean serum prolactin concentration at presentation was 1885 mU/liter, and after follow-up 1370 mU/liter. At follow-up, headache had been experienced in 12 patients (24%) and oligomenorrhea in five (10%). Galactorrhea was present in only two patients (4%). No visual deterioration was noted in 50 patients. One had a transient bitemporal hemianopia. No patients developed an autoimmune condition. Microadenoma had been identified in four patients at presentation with no new pituitary imaging abnormalities identified at follow-up.

Conclusions

During prolonged follow-up, no symptomatic progression was noted in any of our patients. This study suggests that patients with macroprolactinemia and normal concentrations of monomeric prolactin can be reassured, and extended endocrine review of such patients is not required.

### Management of incidental pituitary microadenomas… [^115jVkuC]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The incidental finding of a pituitary microadenoma is not uncommon. Studies have suggested a 10 percent prevalence of pituitary microadenomas in the general population. Current recommendations for the evaluation of such an incidental finding are controversial. Some experts suggest extensive laboratory evaluation to determine levels of prolactin, growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone.

The following management strategies were assessed: expectant management, with further testing performed only if endocrinologic or neurologic symptoms such as amenorrhea, galactorrhea or visual field problems develop; prolactin screening, with hyperprolactinemia confirmed by a repeat test and treated with bromocriptine; an endocrinologic screening panel that includes determination of prolactin, somatomedin C and cortisol levels after administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone; and follow-up of MRI scans. The model included issues such as the expected natural history of an incidental asymptomatic pituitary microadenoma, test characteristics, outcomes of pharmacologic and surgical interventions, quality of life, and costs of testing and treatment. Determination of the prolactin level was found to be the most cost-effective management strategy for patients with asymptomatic, incidental pituitary microadenomas.

An endocrine screening panel and follow-up MRI provided slightly greater quality-adjusted survival than expectant management, although the cost increased substantially. The authors conclude that, while this study does not resolve the debate about conservative versus aggressive management of these lesions, it does provide evidence for a reasonable approach to patients with asymptomatic pituitary microadenomas. They note that the low prevalence of other endocrinopathies in patients with incidental pituitary microadenomas suggests that further evaluation of patients with normal prolactin levels confers little benefit and is not cost effective. Follow-up with MRI scanning provides no better clinical results than hormone screening.

### ACTH-secreting pituitary microadenomas are associated with a higher prevalence of central hypothyroidism compared to other microadenoma types [^115aCYHP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Unlike pituitary macroadenomas, microadenomas (micros) are not commonly associated with hypopituitarism. In clinical practice, we have observed that patients with ACTH-secreting micros have a higher than expected prevalence of central hypothyroidism (HT), and we speculated that this effect might be because of glucocorticoid-induced suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

Objective

To determine whether there is a difference in the prevalence of central HT among ACTH micros compared to other types of microadenoma, and if so, to investigate whether this is directly related to the degree of hypercortisolism.

Design, Setting and Patients

Retrospective study of 149 newly diagnosed patients with pituitary micros: 34 ACTH-secreting, 72 prolactin-secreting (PRLomas) and 43 clinically nonfunctioning adenomas (NFAs).

Main Outcomes Measures

Prevalence of central HT, correlation between normalized free T4 or TSH vs normalized urinary free cortisol (UFC) or salivary cortisol.

Results

The prevalence of central HT was significantly higher in the ACTH compared to the non-ACTH adenomas: 18% (ACTH), 1% (PRL) and 0% (NFAs). The mean normalized free T4 was lower in the ACTH micros compared to the non-ACTH micros (1.29 ± 0.06 vs 1.50 ± 0.23, P = 0.0001). There was no correlation between the degree of hypercortisolism, as reflected by 24-h urine free cortisol and salivary cortisol, and free T4 or TSH levels among the ACTH adenomas. Similarly, there were no differences in mean UFC or salivary cortisol between ACTH adenomas with and without central HT. Following transsphenoidal adenomectomy, central HT recovered in three of six patients with ACTH micros.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that patients with ACTH-secreting microadenomas should always, at a minimum, undergo testing for central HT. However, given the potential for recovery of thyroid function following cure of Cushing disease, we recommend withholding thyroid hormone replacement until after pituitary surgery.

### Medical management of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas [^111vh77w]. Pituitary (2002). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas are a common cause of reproductive/sexual dysfunction. Once other causes of hyperprolactinemia have been excluded with a careful history and physical examination, routine chemistries, a pregnancy test and a TSH, imaging with MRI or CT will delineate the size and extent of the tumor. Medical therapy is the initial treatment of choice. When infertility is the primary indication for treatment, bromocriptine use has an extensive safety experience and is preferred. However, for other indications, cabergoline appears to be more efficacious and better tolerated. Transsphenoidal surgery remains an option, especially for patients with microadenomas, when medical therapy is ineffective.

2.0 Follow-up testing of the pituitary incidentaloma

Recommendations

2.1 Patients with incidentalomas who do not meet criteria for surgical removal of the tumor should receive nonsurgical follow-up (2|⊕⊕○○), with clinical assessments and the following tests:

2.1.1 MRI scan of the pituitary 6 months after the initial scan if the incidentaloma is a macroincidentaloma and 1 yr after the initial scan if it is a microincidentaloma (1|⊕⊕○○). In patients whose incidentaloma does not change in size, we suggest repeating the MRI every year for macroincidentalomas and every 1–2 yr in microincidentalomas for the following 3 yr and gradually less frequently thereafter (2|⊕⊕○○).

2.1.2 VF testing in patients with a pituitary incidentaloma that enlarges to abut or compress the optic nerves or chiasm on a follow-up imaging study (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕). We suggest that clinicians do not need to test VF in patients whose incidentalomas are not close to the chiasm and who have no new symptoms and are being followed closely by MRI (2|⊕○○○).

2.1.3 Clinical and biochemical evaluations for hypopituitarism 6 months after the initial testing and yearly thereafter in patients with a pituitary macroincidentaloma, although typically hypopituitarism develops with the finding of an increase in size of the incidentaloma (1|⊕⊕○○). We suggest that clinicians do not need to test for hypopituitarism in patients with pituitary microincidentalomas whose clinical picture, history, and MRI do not change over time (2|⊕⊕○○).

Radiological pituitary abnormalities

Of the 376 patients in whom dedicated pituitary MRI had been performed, 35 (9.3%) had a pituitary abnormality. Details regarding the pituitary abnormalities found are presented in Table 3. Of the 35 pituitary abnormalities, 17 were diagnosed with adenomas. Non-functioning microadenoma (n = 14) were the most common abnormality, followed by empty sella syndrome (n = 8), Rathke's cleft cyst (n = 5), other cystic formations (n = 4), functioning microadenoma (n = 1), functioning macroadenoma (n = 1) and spontaneous pituitary haemorrhage (n = 1). One patient had a microadenoma, but it had not been ascertained whether it was functioning or non-functioning.

Table 3.
Pituitary lesions identified in cohort.

The two functioning adenomas were prolactinomas. The patient with macroprolactinoma presented with a 3-year history of CH but no pituitary symptoms. The other patient had galactorrhoea secondary to a microprolactinoma, which has been diagnosed 23 years after the first CH attack. In terms of treatment, the two prolactinomas were treated with dopamine agonists but did not require surgery. Treatment led to a partial improvement of the CH attacks in the patient with a macroprolactinoma but had no impact in the patient with the microprolactinoma.

Two patients had pituitary symptoms. Besides the patient who presented with galactorrhoea secondary to a microprolactinoma that was diagnosed 23 years after the first CH attack, another patient had menstruation changes and hirsutism with a pituitary microadenoma, in whom pituitary blood profile was not available and who was lost to follow-up despite several attempts to contact her.

Of note, one patient with a microadenoma showed a slightly elevated IGF-1 level but with normal GH level and no signs of acromegaly; on prolonged follow up of 9 years, the microadenoma remained unchanged on serial MRI scans and the IGF-1 level fluctuated between being slightly elevated or normal with normal GH levels. This patient was deemed to have non-functioning microadenoma.

Notably, in the 203 patients who had a routine MRI followed by a subsequent pituitary MRI, 10 additional pituitary lesions were detected, including five pituitary microadenomas, but none required any specific treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of pituitary adenomas… [^111nwLfJ]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance Pituitary adenomas may hypersecrete hormones or cause mass effects. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are important. Observations. Treatments include transsphenoidal surgery, medical therapies, and radiotherapy. Prolactinomas account for 32% to 66% of adenomas and present with amenorrhea, loss of libido, galactorrhea, and infertility in women and loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility in men; they are generally treated with the dopamine agonists cabergoline and bromocriptine. Growth hormone–secreting tumors account for 8% to 16% of tumors and usually present with enlargement of the lips, tongue, nose, hands, and feet and are diagnosed by elevated insulin-like growth factor 1 levels and growth hormone levels; initial treatment is surgical. Medical therapy with somatostatin analogues, cabergoline, and pegvisomant is often also needed.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone –secreting tumors account for 2% to 6% of adenomas and are associated with obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and other morbidity. Measurement of a late-night salivary cortisol level is the best screening test but petrosal sinus sampling for ACTH may be necessary to distinguish a pituitary from an ectopic source. The primary treatment of Cushing disease is adenoma resection and medical therapies including ketoconazole, mifepristone, and pasireotide. Hyperthyroidism due to thyroid-stimulating hormone–secreting tumors accounts for 1% of tumors and is treated with surgery and somatostatin analogues if not surgically cured. Clinically nonfunctioning adenomas account for 15% to 54% of adenomas and present with mass effects; surgery is generally required, although incidentally found tumors can be followed if they are asymptomatic.

Conclusions and Relevance Patients with pituitary adenomas should be identified at an early stage so that effective treatment can be implemented. For prolactinomas, initial therapy is generally dopamine agonists. For all other pituitary adenomas, initial therapy is generally transsphenoidal surgery with medical therapy being reserved for those not cured by surgery.

Supporting evidence notes that prospective endocrine testing of nonsurgically followed patients "has only been reported in 49 patients", that among macroincidentalomas "worsening hypopituitarism developed in one of seven (8) and three of 28 (25) patients, all of whom had enlargement of their tumors", and that "new endocrine dysfunction developed overall in 2.4% of patients per year". The text also states, "Routine follow-up endocrine testing is not required for microincidentalomas whose clinical picture does not change because the risk of developing new hypopituitarism is extremely low".

### Medical therapy of macroprolactinomas in males: I. prevalence of hypopituitarism at diagnosis. II. proportion of cases exhibiting recovery of pituitary function [^112cQ73g]. Pituitary (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia frequently causes secondary hypogonadism through central suppression of gonadotropin secretion. Macroprolactinomas (> 1 cm diameter) are more common in males and may additionally cause more generalised hypopituitarism. Recovery of the thyrotropic and/or corticotropic axes is well described following selective adenomectomy, but remains poorly defined in relation to medical (dopamine-agonist) therapy of macroprolactinomas. We therefore performed a retrospective examination of case records of male patients who had received medical therapy alone for macroprolactinoma between 1980–2001 (n = 35) and in whom tumor shrinkage was documented by interval pituitary imaging (reported throughout by a single neuroradiologist). Mean prolactin level at baseline was 59,932 mU/L (median 31,400; range 3,215–332,000); mean period of follow up was 4.2 years (median 2.6; range: 1.0–15). Defects of the following axes were evident at diagnosis: LH/FSH-testosterone (n = 27; 77%), TSH-T4 (n = 14; 41%-not including one case with pre-existing 1 degress hypothyroidism), ACTH-cortisol (n = 8; 23%). Overall, 14 men (40%) were deficient in 1 axis, seven (20%) in 2 axes and seven (20%) in 3 axes. Growth hormone secretory status was not systematically evaluated. In all but 6 patients, prolactin levels fell to normal or near-normal levels (mean 764 mU/L; median 260; range: < 10–4,833). Of the patients in whom adequate reassessment had been performed, thyrotroph function recovered in 4/9, corticotroph function in 4/6 and gonadotroph function in 16/26 cases. In four cases (11%) previously described, development of visual impairment as a result of the chiasmal traction syndrome necessitated a dose reduction in medical therapy to allow a degree of controlled tumor re-expansion. The prevalence at diagnosis of TSH and ACTH deficiency in men with macroprolactinomas was 41% and 23%, respectively. Among eight patients with insufficiency of TSH and/or ACTH secretion who underwent complete interval reassessment over several years of treatment, recovery of at least one axis occurred in six cases (75%). This study highlights the importance of screening ACTH- and/or TSH-deficient men during dopamine agonist therapy in order to identify cases where hypopituitarism has resolved.

### Disorders of prolactin secretion [^11499abz]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas are a common cause of reproductive/sexual dysfunction. Once other causes of hyperprolactinemia have been excluded with a careful history and physical examination, routine chemistries, and an assay for TSH, MR imaging, or CT will delineate the size and extent of the tumor. Medical therapy is the initial treatment of choice. When infertility is the primary indication for treatment, bromocriptine use has an extensive safety record and is preferred. For other indications, cabergoline seems to be more efficacious and better tolerated. Transsphenoidal surgery remains an option, especially for patients with microadenomas, when medical therapy is ineffective.

### Pituitary neoplasm nomenclature workshop: does adenoma stand the test of time? [^114ZHjmF]. Journal of the Endocrine Society (2021). High credibility.

Pituitary neoplasms — epidemiology and clinical outcomes — Pituitary tumors account for about 15% of all intracranial masses, and population surveys indicate that pituitary adenomas affect health outcomes in about 1 in 1000 persons; autopsy and imaging studies show that 10% to 15% of the population harbor undiagnosed pituitary neoplasms. Among clinically significant pituitary adenomas that undergo resection, about 15% are locally invasive, and pituitary carcinomas are exceptionally rare, accounting for ≤ 0.5% of invasive lesions. Subclinical adenomas account for more than 99% of pituitary neoplasms and do not affect life expectancy. Among the 1% of pituitary clinically significant neoplasms, prevalence is prolactin-secreting 50–60%, nonfunctioning 20–40%, growth hormone (GH)-secreting 10–15%, and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-secreting 5–8%. Untreated nonsecreting adenomas enlarge in up to 25%, with growth generally very slow, ranging from 0.4 mm to 1.0 mm/year. For invasive recurrent macroadenomas, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) ranges from 1.1 to 3.6; in untreated acromegaly, the SMR is 2.0 to 3.0 but falls to that of the general population with effective hormonal control. In Cushing disease, over 90% of patients have microadenomas and up to 80% can be controlled by surgery, and disease control reduces hypercortisolemia-driven SMR from 3.7 to 1.2.

Endocrine assessment

According to clinical guidelines, all patients with pituitary macroadenomas and larger microadenomas (6–9 mm), with or without symptoms, should undergo laboratory assessment in order to detect hormonal hypersecretion or hypopituitarism (Table 1).

Table 1
Summary of the pre-, peri- and postoperative management of NFPAs

CH central hypothyroidism, DI diabetes insipidus, GC glucocorticoid, GH growth hormone, GHD growth hormone deficiency, HPA hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal, HPG hypothalamus-pituitary–gonadal, MRI magnetic resonance imaging, NFPA non-functioning pituitary adenoma, SAI secondary adrenal insufficiency, TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone

Growth hormone (GH) deficiency and hypogonadism are the most commonly found deficits followed by central hypothyroidism and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Panhypopituitarism is present at diagnosis in 6–29% of patients. DI is a rare finding at diagnosis of NFPAs. Therefore, in patients presenting with DI and a pituitary mass, other tumors than NFPAs should be considered.

At diagnosis, 25–65% of patients with NFPAs present with hyperprolactinemia caused by pituitary stalk compression. It is important to distinguish between a prolactinoma and a NFPA since treatment strategies for these two conditions differ, i.e. dopamine agonist therapy being the treatment of choice for prolactinomas. In a retrospective analysis of 117 patients with prolactinomas and NFPAs, it was found that NFPA patients most often had a prolactin (PRL) level < 100 ng/mL (~ 2000 IU/L) whereas levels > 250 ng/mL (~ 5000 IU/L) were exclusively seen in patients with prolactinomas. There is a large grey zone between these two thresholds where individual clinical judgement needs to be used when deciding the primary choice of treatment.

Pituitary incidentaloma — size-based values and preferences for hypopituitarism screening indicate that the Task Force more strongly favored routine testing for hypopituitarism in macroincidentalomas and larger microincidentalomas, for example 6–9 mm, and not necessarily in smaller microincidentalomas; routine screening among smaller microincidentalomas may not be necessary because the rate of hypopituitarism appears very low, although hypopituitarism can occur in microadenomas, and a 1-cm size cutoff may be arbitrary when considering risk.

### Pituitary adenomas: an overview [^114mFT3d]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas and nonfunctioning adenomas are the most common types of pituitary adenomas. Patients with pituitary adenomas may present initially with symptoms of endocrine dysfunction such as infertility, decreased libido, and galactorrhea, or with neurologic symptoms such as headache and visual changes. The diagnosis may also be made following imaging done for an unrelated issue in an asymptomatic patient; this is termed a pituitary incidentaloma. Oversecretion of hormones from a dysfunctional pituitary gland may result in classic clinical syndromes, the most common of which are hyperprolactinemia (from oversecretion of prolactin), acromegaly (from excess growth hormone), and Cushing disease (from overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone). In the diagnostic approach to a suspected pituitary adenoma, it is important to evaluate complete pituitary function, because hypopituitarism is common. Therapy for pituitary adenomas depends on the specific type of tumor, and should be managed with a team approach to include endocrinology and neurosurgery when indicated. Dopamine agonists are the primary treatment for prolactinomas. Small nonfunctioning adenomas and prolactinomas in asymptomatic patients do not require immediate intervention and can be observed.

### Hyperprolactinemia [^114d4tBq]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

In several respects prolactin is unique among anterior pituitary hormones. The primary regulation of prolactin secretion is mediated through hypothalamic inhibition, and the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia can be established without the use of stimulation or suppression tests. Documenting the presence of hyperprolactinemia is not difficult-the challenge is in identifying the cause of the hormone hypersecretion. With immunoradiometric assays falsely low levels of prolactin are occasionally seen in patients with macroadenomas and very high serum prolactin (the hook effect). Macroprolactin should be suspected when a patient with hyperprolactinemia does not present with typical clinical symptoms, and all hyperprolactinemic sera should be screened for macroprolactin. With prolactinomas, prolactin levels generally parallel tumor size. Prolactin secreting macroadenomas are typically associated with levels that exceed 250 microg/l and may exceed 1,000 microg/l. Large non-functioning adenomas also lead to hyperprolactinemia but levels virtually never exceed 94 microg/l. Acquired and isolated prolactin deficiency is rare.

Supporting evidence notes that most patients with prolactin levels higher than 250 μg/liter will harbor a prolactinoma and that macroprolactinomas (> 10 mm in diameter) are typically associated with prolactin levels greater than 250 μg/liter, and that moderately elevated prolactin may occur with large nonfunctioning adenomas.

### Reversible weight gain and prolactin levels – long-term follow-up in childhood [^116iSrnS]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

In adult patients weight gain is a frequent complaint of hyperprolactinaemia and it has been associated with a high prevalence of obesity. Normalization of prolactin (PRL) levels result in weight loss. The nature of this link is poorly defined. In this report we describe a 14 year-old female with primary amenorrhea and persistent progressive weight gain. The patient's height, weight and BMI were 152 cm, 70 kg, and 30.3 kg/m2, respectively. Basal hormonal investigation showed normal free thyroxin, TSH, IGF-I, cortisol and ACTH values. Serum PRL level was very high (16,278 mIU/l; normal range 63–426 mIU/l). Magnetic resonance imaging scan showed the presence of a pituitary microadenoma. Treatment with the non-selective dopamine agonist pergolide caused a significant reduction of serum PRL concentration with a remarkable decrease of body weight. During follow-up, repeat MRI scan revealed disappearance of the microadenoma. The reduction of the daily dose of pergolide was associated with an increase of serum PRL with significant weight gain. A further reduction of body weight was subsequently observed with an increase of pergolide dosage. Serum PRL measurement may be useful as part of the endocrine work-up of obese children with a history of unexplained recent weight gain, especially if associated with pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction. The relationship between PRL secretion and weight change needs to be examined in prospective larger studies.

Results

Baseline

The data of 167 CD patients attending the Centre between December 2001 and December 2021 were collected. The information regarding 41 patients were not included in the analysis because of insufficient follow-up data (i.e. patients referred for second opinion or for diagnostic workup or those with follow-up < 1 year from first line treatment). The remaining 126 patients presented a median age at diagnosis of 39 [31–50 years]; the female: male ratio was 3:1. The median follow-up was 130.5 months [72.5–201.5]. The patients' clinical features at the time of diagnosis are outlined in Table 1.

Table 1
The patients' clinical features at the time of diagnosis

N: the number of patients presenting the feature; tot: the number of patients whose data regarding that feature were available.

The median UFC levels were 3.2 times the ULN [2–5.6]. Almost half of the cohort presented moderate cortisol excess (45/98, 45.9%), with lower proportions of the patients presenting mild (26/98, 26.5%) and severe disease (22/98, 27.6%).

Most of the patients (91/113, 80.5%) had a microadenoma, including 29/91(31.9%) with negative imaging. The remaining 22 patients (19.5%) had a macroadenoma.

Results

Out of 19 patients, 15 had microadenoma and four had macroadenoma. Out of 18 women, one had primary amenorrhoea, 12 had secondary amenorrhoea and the other five were eumenorrheic. Four women had primary infertility and two had secondary infertility. Two women had primary hypothyroidism and were on adequate doses of levothyroxine at the time of entry in the study. Two patients with macroprolactinoma had morning cortisol < 275.9 mmol/l. Insulin tolerance test demonstrated normal cortisol and GH responses in both of these patients. In none of these patients, was there any suggestion of extension of pituitary mass into third ventricle on MRI.

Serum PRL normalized in 18 out of 19 patients after 1 month and in one patient within 6 months of cabergoline therapy. Median PRL level decreased from 118.6 μg/L at baseline to 10.4 μg/L at 3 months (P < .001) and 9.4 μg/L at 6 months (P < .001).

### Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112o9XQJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Although silent somatotroph-secreting tumors are rare, evaluation for the possibility is recommended. In a prospective study, one of 11 macroincidentalomas were found to have an elevated IGF-I consistent with subclinical GH excess, and in another study, two of 13 incidentalomas that were surgically removed were positive on immunohistochemistry for GH. One series of 3048 autopsies reported 334 pituitary adenomas, of which 1.8% stained positive for GH. Because the initial treatment for a GH-secreting tumor is surgery and GH-secreting microadenomas can be cured surgically in almost all cases, screening for a GH-secreting tumor by measurement of an IGF-I level is warranted. If this is elevated, further evaluation for GH excess is suggested.

Screening for glucocorticoid excess due to a possible corticotroph tumor may also be considered when this is suspected clinically. In the series of 3048 autopsies, 13.8% of 334 pituitary adenomas stained positive for ACTH. No systematic screening of incidentalomas for subclinical glucocorticoid excess has been reported. However, patients with adrenal incidentalomas may have Cushing's syndrome-associated morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and osteoporosis, so in a patient with a pituitary incidentaloma subclinical Cushing's disease could also be associated with these morbidities. In patients with a clinical suspicion for glucocorticoid excess, laboratory screening is therefore suggested. Detection of subclinical hypercortisolism should be followed by evaluation for possible Cushing's disease. The screening and evaluation of Cushing's disease has been reviewed in the "Diagnosis of Cushing's Syndrome: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline".

The Task Force does not recommend the routine measurement of plasma ACTH levels in patients with incidentalomas. However, some of the Task Force members often measure ACTH because a small percentage of incidentalomas may be silent corticotroph tumors, and occasionally plasma ACTH levels are elevated in patients harboring these tumors despite the lack of clinical manifestations of cortisol excess.

In patients whose personal or family history suggests the possibility of a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, additional screening and follow-up as appropriate to the suspected syndrome should be undertaken.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement on management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^111c5HrQ]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (pitNETs) in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) — surgical risks and follow-up are outlined as follows: Surgery for pitNETs provides the highest chance of cure and should be performed by an experienced neurosurgeon at a high-volume center, with new endocrine deficiencies occurring in 5% to 15% of patients postoperatively and arginine vasopressin deficiency occurring in < 30% of patients, usually transient. Although no randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that serial monitoring with imaging improves outcomes, it is reasonable for macroadenomas to repeat imaging at 6 months, annually for 3 years and then less frequently if stable, and for microadenomas to repeat imaging annually for 3 years; reassurance without follow-up imaging may be considered for microadenomas < 5 mm in size. Patients who receive radiation therapy should be monitored long-term because the risk of developing hypopituitarism (< 50%) is higher than with surgery alone (< 30%).

### Cushing's disease: clinical manifestations and diagnostic… [^116tJuez]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Although the adenomas of Cushing's disease secrete excessive amounts of ACTH, they generally retain some negative feedback responsiveness to high doses of glucocorticoids. Ectopic sources of ACTH, usually in the form of extracranial neoplasms, are generally not responsive to negative feedback with high doses of glucocorticoids. However, some overlap exists in the response to negative feedback between pituitary and ectopic sources of excessive ACTH. 4 However, when Cushing's syndrome is still strongly suspected based on the clinical findings, negative tests should be repeated; the tests should also be performed again in three to six months.
4. A newer approach is to combine a CRH stimulation test with a dexamethasone suppression test. The patient takes 0. 5 mg of dexamethasone every six hours for two days; two hours after the last dexamethasone dose is taken, 1 μg per kg of CRH is administered intravenously.

Blood for a plasma cortisol measurement is drawn 15 minutes after the CRH injection. A plasma cortisol level exceeding 1. 4 μg per L is considered positive for Cushing's syndrome. 21 Another approach to the patient with suspected pseudo-Cushing's syndrome is to treat the underlying process and retest the patient in a few months. 5 In this instance, the hypercortisolism of pseudo-Cushing's syndrome should correct spontaneously if treatment of the underlying process is successful. Once hypersecretion of cortisol is confirmed, the next step is to determine whether the pathologic state is ACTH dependent or ACTH independent. This can be accomplished through measurement of the late-afternoon ACTH level. Late-afternoon timing is important because ACTH levels are normally low at that time. Patients who have been surgically treated for Cushing's disease require careful long-term follow-up and monitoring for signs and symptoms of tumor recurrence.

The pituitary adrenal axis must be evaluated six to 12 months after surgery to determine the potential need for lifetime exogenous steroid replacement therapy. Patients with panhypopituitarism subsequent to surgery require lifetime monitoring and titration of hormone therapy. All patients who need glucocorticoid replacement therapy should be given careful instructions about the effects of stress and illness on glucocorticoid dosages. In addition, these patients should wear appropriate medical alert labels.

### Prognostic factors of long-term remission after surgical treatment of Cushing's disease [^113L4CnY]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Transsphenoidal surgery is the main treatment of patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas. Although biochemical remission occurs in most patients undergoing operations at specialized centers, the recurrence risk is significant. Visualization of microadenomas on preoperative imaging and confirmation of ACTH-positive adenomas have been associated with higher remission rates. Low cortisol levels in the first 2 weeks postoperatively have been associated with durable remission; however, recurrence cannot be excluded by any cortisol threshold. The decision to perform a pituitary reoperation is based on this parameter; the protocols are institution specific. Patients with Cushing's disease warrant lifelong endocrinologic surveillance.

### Pituitary microadenoma with hypopituitarism presenting as hyponatremia [^113zy4qq]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

The incidence of pituitary adenoma has been increasing these days. Majority of the cases are incidental findings on imaging; and these patients may be asymptomatic without any laboratory abnormalities. However, a non-functional sellar mass can initially present with hypopituitarism. The patient being described is an elderly female who presented with severe hyponatraemia. She has history of recurrent admissions for hyponatraemia in the past. Her biochemical evaluation revealed hypopituitarism and magnetic resonance imaging of brain showed pituitary microadenoma. Hyponatraemia as a presenting feature of hypopituitarism due to pituitary microadenoma is an uncommon scenario.
