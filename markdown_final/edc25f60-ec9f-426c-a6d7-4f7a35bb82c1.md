## Question

Are there any specific dental procedures that may require antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with prosthetic joint replacements?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether any dental procedures require antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent prosthetic joint infection in patients with prosthetic joint replacements, and if so, which ones and under what circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most current guideline positions from major societies. Then, I should verify the strength and quality of the evidence base. Next, I will examine procedure-specific considerations and whether any subgroup or timing exceptions apply. After that, I need to weigh potential benefits against harms and costs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and note any stewardship caveats and communication needs with orthopedic colleagues.

> Let me first confirm the core recommendation from the most authoritative sources. The 2025 AAOS/AAHKS clinical practice guideline advises avoiding routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures in patients with hip or knee replacements, concluding that prophylaxis does not reduce the risk of subsequent periprosthetic joint infection, and this aligns with the ADA's longstanding position that prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent PJI [^117XUgB3] [^113DfsjS].

> Wait, let me verify the strength and quality of evidence behind that stance. The AAOS rates the quality of evidence as low and the strength of the option as limited, reflecting predominantly observational data without randomized trials, yet multiple large cohort and case-control studies consistently show no association between dental procedures and PJI and no protective effect of prophylaxis, including a Taiwanese cohort of 57,066 matched patients and a 2025 meta-analysis of 157,466 patients, as well as a large Korean database analysis of 591,602 patients [^115igYqW] [^112jJyoG] [^1125jr99] [^112PwKhf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "invasive" dental procedures. I initially thought extractions, implants, or periodontal surgery might warrant prophylaxis because of higher bacteremia risk, but I should double-check the data. The Berbari case-control study found no increased PJI risk with high- or low-risk dental procedures and no reduction with prophylaxis, and a large English case-crossover analysis of 9,427 late PJI admissions found no temporal association with invasive dental procedures, suggesting that even procedures like extractions or implants do not increase PJI risk in a way that prophylaxis would mitigate [^113Fsyao] [^111MEQrc] [^114krkX5].

> I need to check whether any subgroup or timing exceptions change this. The AAOS notes that most evidence pertains to primary THA/TKA and that data are sparse for high-risk arthroplasty populations such as revision cases, immunocompromised patients, or those with prior PJI; in these scenarios, the certainty is low and decisions should be individualized, ideally via shared decision-making with the orthopedic surgeon, while acknowledging that the microbiology of PJI is predominantly staphylococcal rather than oral streptococci, which further weakens the biologic rationale for dental prophylaxis [^111MjKDb] [^112SYCr6] [^113uR73G].

> Next, I should review harms and costs to ensure the risk–benefit calculus is sound. Unnecessary dental prophylaxis is common, with studies showing roughly 80% of prescriptions discordant with guidelines, substantial annual costs near $59 million, and increased risks of adverse reactions including C. difficile, with clindamycin disproportionately implicated; taken together, these harms and costs outweigh any unproven benefit in routine cases [^113E8yL4] [^111ARgyb] [^111YDZ28].

> Let me consider procedure timing around arthroplasty, because that sometimes drives practice. The AAOS suggests that elective dental procedures may reasonably be delayed for up to 3 months after joint replacement to avoid transient bacteremia during the early healing phase, but this is a consensus recommendation based on biological plausibility rather than direct evidence, and it does not imply that prophylaxis is needed if a procedure is performed; acute dental infections should be treated promptly regardless of timing [^115sGqUu] [^113ymHPN].

> I should confirm whether topical antiseptic rinses change the equation. The AAOS advises against routine preprocedural chlorhexidine rinses for patients with hip or knee replacements, citing insufficient evidence of benefit in reducing bacteremia or PJI, so mouthrinse prophylaxis should not be used as a substitute for systemic antibiotics or as a routine adjunct [^113DhBQQ] [^11188Vck].

> But wait, what if the patient is within 2 years of implantation or has specific comorbidities; does that alter prophylaxis needs. Historical guidance once emphasized a 2-year high-risk window, but contemporary evidence and guidelines have moved away from routine prophylaxis even in earlier postoperative periods; individualized consideration may be given in exceptional high-risk scenarios after discussing with orthopedics, but the default remains no prophylaxis absent compelling patient-specific risk factors [^115FJ8dz] [^113DfsjS] [^111MjKDb].

> Putting this together, I should state the clinical bottom line clearly. No dental procedure, including invasive treatments such as extractions, implants, periodontal surgery, or scaling and root planing, requires routine antibiotic prophylaxis solely to prevent prosthetic joint infection in patients with standard-risk hip or knee replacements, and this applies across diagnostic, preventive, restorative, endodontic, and surgical categories; prophylaxis should be avoided for this indication, with care individualized only for exceptional high-risk patients in consultation with the orthopedic team [^117XUgB3] [^113DfsjS] [^112SYCr6].

> Finally, I need to ensure stewardship and communication are explicit. Dentists should document shared decision-making when patients request prophylaxis despite counseling, avoid clindamycin when antibiotics are actually indicated for other reasons due to C. difficile risk, and coordinate with orthopedic surgeons to align messaging; maintaining excellent oral hygiene and treating active dental infections promptly are the most reliable strategies to reduce potential hematogenous risk, if any, from oral sources [^113uR73G] [^111YDZ28] [^111jiUDp].

In general, **antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended** for dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joint replacements [^113DfsjS] because there is no evidence that it prevents prosthetic joint infection (PJI) [^1125jr99] and it carries risks of adverse reactions and resistance [^111YDZ28]. Prophylaxis may be considered only for **high-risk patients** (e.g. immunocompromised, prior PJI, or within 2 years of joint replacement) undergoing invasive dental procedures (extraction, periodontal surgery, implant placement) after consultation with the orthopedic surgeon [^112SYCr6] [^111MjKDb]. Routine prophylaxis is not indicated for low-risk patients or noninvasive procedures [^117XUgB3].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

The **ADA 2015 guidelines** state that prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures for patients with prosthetic joint implants to prevent PJI [^113DfsjS] [^1119a7SY]. The **AAOS 2025 guidelines** similarly advise against routine systemic prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures in patients with hip or knee replacements [^117XUgB3] [^115igYqW].

---

## Evidence supporting current guidelines

Multiple studies and meta-analyses show **no association** between dental procedures and PJI and **no reduction in PJI risk** with prophylactic antibiotics [^113Fsyao] [^1125jr99]. A large cohort study found no temporal association between invasive dental procedures and late PJI, further supporting the guideline recommendations [^111MEQrc].

---

## Risks associated with antibiotic prophylaxis

Antibiotic prophylaxis carries potential risks, including:

- **Adverse drug reactions**: Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other adverse effects [^112SYCr6].

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Increased risk of developing resistant bacterial strains [^111YDZ28].

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Increased risk, particularly with certain antibiotics such as clindamycin [^1152Zp8b] [^1166M6Ty].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

Certain patient-specific factors may **increase the risk of PJI** and could influence the decision to use prophylactic antibiotics:

- **Immunosuppression**: Patients with compromised immune systems [^114uThxt].

- **History of prosthetic joint infection**: Previous PJI significantly increases risk [^111MjKDb].

- **Recent joint replacement**: Within 2 years of prosthetic joint placement [^111hctyT].

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or other chronic conditions [^1125jr99].

---

## Dental procedures and their associated risks

Dental procedures vary in their **association with bacteremia and potential PJI risk**:

| **Procedure category** | **Examples** | **Associated risk** |
|-|-|-|
| Noninvasive | - Routine examinations <br/> - Radiographs <br/> - Denture adjustments | - Minimal risk <br/> - No prophylaxis recommended |
| Invasive | - Tooth extractions <br/> - Periodontal surgery <br/> - Dental implant placement <br/> - Root canal treatment | - Moderate risk <br/> - Prophylaxis not routinely recommended |
| High-risk patients | - Immunocompromised <br/> - Prior PJI <br/> - Recent joint replacement | - Prophylaxis may be considered after consultation |

---

## Clinical decision-making process

When deciding whether to administer antibiotic prophylaxis, clinicians should consider:

- **Patient-specific risk factors**: Immunosuppression, prior PJI, recent joint replacement, comorbidities [^111MjKDb].

- **Type of dental procedure**: Invasive procedures may warrant consideration in high-risk patients [^112SYCr6].

- **Consultation with orthopedic surgeon**: Collaborative decision-making is recommended for high-risk patients [^112SYCr6].

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making should incorporate patient values and preferences [^113uR73G].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, **routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended** for dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joint replacements [^113DfsjS]. Prophylaxis may be considered for high-risk patients undergoing invasive procedures, but decisions should be individualized and made in consultation with the orthopedic surgeon [^112SYCr6]. The focus should remain on maintaining good oral hygiene and preventing dental infections through regular dental care [^111toCuM].

Management of patients with prosthetic joints undergoing dental procedures — clinical recommendation states that, in general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection. For patients with a history of complications associated with their joint replacement surgery who are undergoing dental procedures that include gingival manipulation or mucosal incision, prophylactic antibiotics should only be considered after consultation with the patient and orthopedic surgeon, and a complete health history is always recommended when making final decisions regarding the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. The clinical reasoning provided is that there is evidence that dental procedures are not associated with prosthetic joint implant infections, that antibiotics provided before dental care do not prevent prosthetic joint implant infections, that there are potential harms of antibiotics including risk for anaphylaxis, antibiotic resistance, and opportunistic infections (e.g. Clostridium difficile), that the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis may not exceed the harms for most patients, and that the individual patient's circumstances and preferences should be considered when deciding whether to prescribe prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical recommendation and rationale — prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints: The 2014 Panel judged with moderate certainty that there is no association between dental procedures and the occurrence of PJIs. Consistent with the ADA's methods, when there is moderate certainty of no association, the strength of the recommendation is against, and against means that evidence suggests not implementing this intervention or discontinuing ineffective practices. On this basis, the Panel states: In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection. The Panel also made the assumption that the evidence regarding hip and knee joint infections can be extrapolated to all joints because, to our knowledge, no studies have been published addressing the relationship between dental treatment and infections of other types of prosthetic joints.

### Is routine antibiotic prophylaxis cost effective for total joint replacement patients? [^115sLo95]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2015). Low credibility.

The routine use of amoxicillin antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures for patients with total joint prostheses in place remains controversial. This analysis shows that the practice may not be cost-effective for patients in whom the risk of infection with dental work is low. However, specific data quantifying the risk and the impact prophylactic antibiotics can have is needed. Patients and physicians will need to continue to consider their use on an individual basis and should consider the risk of infection as well as the risk of adverse drug reaction when making treatment decisions.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures following total joint arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1125jr99]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a serious complication following total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Hematogenous spread, including from dental procedures, is a proposed mechanism for PJI. While prophylactic antibiotics (PAs) have traditionally been recommended before dental procedures in patients with joint prostheses, recent guidelines question their effectiveness. This study aimed to evaluate the association between dental antibiotic prophylaxis and PJI risk through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies included adult patients who had TJAs undergoing dental procedures, with and without antibiotic prophylaxis, and reported PJI outcomes. There were four retrospective cohort studies, encompassing 157,466 patients, that met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A random-effects meta-analysis with Hartung-Knapp adjustment was used to pool odds ratios (OR).

Results

Incidence of PJI ranged from 0.07 to 0.3% across included studies. There were no studies that demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in PJI rates among patients who received prophylactic antibiotics. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in PJI risk between antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups, with a slight, non-significant increase in risk among patients receiving antibiotics. Several studies identified other PJI risk factors, including revision arthroplasty, obesity, congestive heart failure, and diabetes with end-organ damage.

Conclusion

Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures in patients who have primary total hip or knee arthroplasty does not reduce the risk of PJI. Given the low overall incidence of PJI and the potential harms of unnecessary antibiotic use, including resistance and adverse effects, current evidence supports limiting prophylaxis to select high-risk populations. Updated clinical guidelines should reflect these findings to enhance antibiotic stewardship and reduce healthcare costs.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures — level of certainty categories define High, Moderate, and Low certainty in effect estimates. High indicates that "The body of evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative populations", is "unlikely to be affected strongly by the results of future studies", and is "established strongly by use of the best available evidence". Moderate indicates that "the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change" and that the statement is "based on preliminary determination from the current best available evidence, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by 1 or more factors". Low indicates that "More information could allow a reliable estimation of effects on health outcomes", that "The available evidence is insufficient to support the statement, or the statement is based on extrapolation from the best available evidence", and that reliability may be "limited by factors such as" those noted on-page.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in orthopedic prosthetic surgery [^1177oxQQ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The problem of prophylaxis in orthopedic implant surgery will become increasingly important and complex as the population ages and requires more arthroplasty procedures, and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria meanwhile also continues to rise. Energy spent preventing prosthetic joint infection is more effective than that expended in treating the infection of a prosthetic joint, once established. Preventive measures encompass a wide array of variables related to host response, wound environment, and microorganisms. Prophylaxis should address these areas in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. Antimicrobial prophylaxis remains the single most effective method of reducing the prevalence of infection after total joint arthroplasty. In the postoperative period, prophylaxis aims to protect the prosthetic joint against hematogenous seeding from oral, urologic, skin, or gastrointestinal sources. Currently, dental and urologic advisory statements provide recommendations for antimicrobial prophylaxis for high-risk patients with total joint arthroplasty undergoing high-risk procedures. Close collaboration between the orthopedic surgeon, urologist, or dentist and the infectious disease specialist is crucial for providing recommendations regarding prophylaxis in special circumstances. In these particular circumstances, individual decisions should be made based on clinical judgment.

Conclusions — evidence fails to demonstrate an association between dental procedures and prosthetic joint infection (PJI) or any effectiveness for antibiotic prophylaxis, and using antibiotics before dental procedures is not recommended to prevent PJI; additional case-control studies are needed to increase certainty to higher than moderate.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^111hctyT]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Given the varying guidelines and recommendations occurring over the course of the study period (updated prosthetic joint infection prophylaxis guidelines were published in 2013 and reaffirmed in 2015), we conducted sensitivity analyses varying the definition of what would qualify as an indication for joint-related prophylaxis (1) defining a 2-year window of appropriate antibiotic prescription after prosthetic joint placement (the highest-risk period for infection)and (2) using prior guidelinesper recommendations by Lockhart. Other sensitivity analyses estimating the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis included varying selection criteria within plausible scenarios of (1) continuous medical plan enrollment throughout the entire study period, (2) stratified years of estimates to reflect changes in practice and guideline recommendations, and (3) stratification of patients with and without a history of prosthetic joint diagnoses or procedures.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive characteristics of groups with visits identified as having an appropriate use of antibiotic prophylaxis and those that did not were compared using independent-samples t test for continuous variables and χ² test for categorical variables. Missing data (55 observations) were included in the analysis and are labeled in the multivariable analysis as unknown. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs with robust standard errors for association between patient-level and visit-level characteristics and appropriate antibiotic use. Also, in analyses that included multiple visits per patient (54.3% in the primary analysis), generalized estimating equations with a first-order autoregressive working matrix were used to estimate corresponding ORs and 95% CIs. Variables significant in unadjusted analyses or identified as factors associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis were included in the model. The most parsimonious model was selected by only including those final variables significantly associated with prescribing. SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc), was used for all analyses. A priori hypothesis tests were performed with a 2-sided α level of.05.

### Joint arthroplasty, dental treatment, and antibiotics: a review [^115sCsa5]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2002). Low credibility.

Many patients with artificial joints seek guidance from their dental and orthopaedic surgeons on whether they should take prophylactic antibiotics for routine dental treatment. Advice on this has been conflicting in the past, and other than a joint statement from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Dental Association, there has been little official guidance. In view of the lack of consensus, we have reviewed the relevant literature and have concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis should not be routinely given to all patients undergoing dental treatment but should be reserved for those patients deemed at high risk.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with a history of total joint replacement [^117BsDPy]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

As the population ages and people remain active into the 7th and 8th decades of life, the frequency of total joint replacement is increasing. Following joint replacement surgery, patients inevitably require various invasive procedures as part of their routine health maintenance, including, but not limited to, dental care, colonoscopy, cystoscopy, and cardiac catheterization. There is scant evidence to support the use of periprocedural prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of late total joint infection. The guidelines for the usage of periprocedural antibiotics have changed as knowledge of the pathophysiology of joint infection has evolved. We review the current recommendations from subspecialty academic organizations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing routine urologic, gastrointestinal, dental, and cardiac procedures after total joint replacement.

### Prevention of orthopaedic implant infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^1127Lgfw]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

The Prevention of Orthopaedic Implant Infection in Patients Undergoing Dental Procedures evidence-based clinical practice guideline was codeveloped by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American Dental Association. This guideline replaces the previous AAOS Information Statement, "Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Bacteremia in Patients With Joint Replacement", published in 2009. Based on the best current evidence and a systematic review of published studies, three recommendations have been created to guide clinical practice in the prevention of orthopaedic implant infections in patients undergoing dental procedures. The first recommendation is graded as Limited; this recommendation proposes that the practitioner consider changing the long-standing practice of routinely prescribing prophylactic antibiotic for patients with orthopaedic implants who undergo dental procedures. The second, graded as Inconclusive, addresses the use of oral topical antimicrobials in the prevention of periprosthetic joint infections. The third recommendation, a Consensus statement, addresses the maintenance of good oral hygiene.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis–related harms and resistance in patients with prosthetic joints are outlined, noting that there is a long-standing and increasing concern that repeated exposure to antibiotics is a risk factor for the development of resistant bacterial species. Although there are no data regarding the risk of developing a drug reaction from 1 dose of amoxicillin prescribed to prevent a distant site infection such as PJI, older regimens with intramuscular injections and multiple oral doses suggest that more people who are given antibiotic prophylaxis would experience drug reactions from penicillin-type drugs — some of which may be fatal — than would be prevented from developing PJI, and there also is an increased risk of experiencing adverse reactions with increasing patient age (that is, in patients 70 years or older). Prolonged treatment with antibiotics is associated with infections secondary to changes in the gastrointestinal microbial flora, and Clostridium difficile infection potentially can cause pseudomembranous colitis; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that annually there are approximately 250,000 people with C difficile infections that require hospitalization or already affect hospitalized patients, resulting in 14,000 deaths per year, and investigators have identified clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones as the inducing agents.

### Review of guidelines for dental antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections and need for dental stewardship [^115tzHcp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Dentists prescribe 10% of all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, writing more than 25.7 million prescriptions per year. Many are for prophylaxis in patients with prosthetic joint replacements; the American Dental Society states that "in general", prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended to prevent prosthetic joint infections. Orthopedic surgeons are concerned with the risk of implant infections following a dental procedure and, therefore, see high value and low risk in recommending prophylaxis. Patients are "stuck in the middle", with conflicting recommendations from orthopedic surgeons (OS) and dentists. Unnecessary prophylaxis and fear of lawsuits amongst private practice dentists and OS has not been addressed. We review The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology, American Dental Association, and American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons' guidelines on dental antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections. We provide experience on how to engage private-practice dentists and OS in dental stewardship using a community-based program.

### Prosthetic joint infection following invasive dental procedures and antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with hip or knee arthroplasty [^112jJyoG]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVES We aimed to clarify whether invasive dental treatment is associated with increased risk of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and whether prophylactic antibiotics may lower the infection risk remain unclear. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS All Taiwanese residents (N = 255,568) who underwent total knee or hip arthroplasty between January 1, 1997, and November 30, 2009, were screened. METHODS The dental cohort consisted of 57,066 patients who received dental treatment and were individually matched 1:1 with the nondental cohort by age, sex, propensity score, and index date. The dental cohort was further divided by the use or nonuse of prophylactic antibiotics. The antibiotic and nonantibiotic subcohorts comprised 6,513 matched pairs. RESULTS PJI occurred in 328 patients (0.57%) in the dental subcohort and 348 patients (0.61%) in the nondental subcohort, with no between-cohort difference in the 1-year cumulative incidence (0.6% in both, P = 0.3). Multivariate-adjusted Cox regression revealed no association between dental procedures and PJI. Furthermore, PJI occurred in 13 patients (0.2%) in the antibiotic subcohort and 12 patients (0.18%) in the nonantibiotic subcohorts (P = 0.8). Multivariate-adjusted analyses confirmed that there was no association between the incidence of PJI and prophylactic antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS The risk of PJI is not increased following dental procedure in patients with hip or knee replacement and is unaffected by antibiotic prophylaxis.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Berbari and colleagues, 2010 — critical appraisal: The population was selected on the basis of outcomes (with and without prosthetic joint infection), and risk factors were high- and low-risk dental procedures with and without antibiotics, using a case-control design. Cases were patients with a prosthetic hip or knee infection hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) from December 2001 through May 2006. For controls, paired matching was not performed; frequency matching by joint arthroplasty location resulted in exactly the same number of prosthetic hip (n = 164) and knee (n = 175) replacements in the case and control groups.

Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) risk after dental procedures — case-control evidence and review methods: The 2012 Panel "identified 1 study" providing direct evidence; Berbari and colleagues conducted a case-control study of "339 patients with infected hip or knee prostheses (cases)" matched with "339" controls at the "Mayo Clinic Care Network (Rochester, MN) from December 2001 through May 2006", with exposure "measured within the previous 6 months and 2 years" and classified as low-risk dental procedures (fluoride treatment, restorative dentistry, and endodontic treatment) and high-risk dental procedures (periodontal treatment, extraction, treatment of a dental abscess, oral surgery, and dental hygiene). Controls were matched on joint location, yielding "prosthetic hip (n = 164) and knee (n = 175) replacements among cases and controls". Regression modeling using odds ratios showed "no statistical association" for high-risk procedures without antibiotics at "6-months (OR = 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.4–1.7) or 2-years (OR = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4–1.6)", whereas with antibiotics results were "statistically significant at 6 months (OR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9), but not at 2 years (OR = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–1.1)". The 2014 Panel "considered the direct evidence" linking dental procedures to PJI and "did not conduct a meta-analysis" of observational studies due to potential confounding risk.

The Prevention of Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Periprosthetic Joint Infection in Patients Undergoing Dental Procedures Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies examining the influence of dental care and procedures on outcomes after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) as well as strategies to mitigate potential risks associated with dental care and procedures in patients with a TJA. The scope of this guideline includes the role of dental screening, antibiotic prophylaxis, use of antimicrobial mouth rinses, and timing of dental procedures before and after TJA. The population was limited to patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty because of a paucity of data on patients with other orthopaedic implants. Based on the best current available evidence, this guideline contains five options to assist all qualified clinicians, including orthopaedic surgeons and dental providers, considering the prevention of total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infections in patients undergoing dental procedures. It is also intended to serve as an information resource for professional healthcare practitioners and developers of practice guidelines and recommendations. In addition to providing pragmatic practice recommendations, this guideline also highlights gaps in literature and informs areas for future research and quality measure development.

AAOS prevention of THA and TKA PJI — potential benefits, harms, and decision-making note that there are several benefits and harms when considering dental screening prior to surgery, timing of dental procedures prior to surgery, and antibiotic prophylaxis in patients who have a THA or TKA who undergo a dental procedure; the ultimate goal is to limit and prevent PJI after THA or TKA, but prevention interventions must be weighed against patient inconvenience, patient and societal costs, and adverse clinical events such as Clostridioides difficile infection or antibiotic-resistant bacteria with widespread antibiotic use, and the decision to delay dental procedures, perform dental screening before TJA, or receive antibiotic prophylaxis should be made through a shared decision-making process.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) risk factors independent of dental procedures are described from a case-control study, in which postoperative wound drainage after arthroplasty had a strong association (OR = 18.7; 95% CI, 7.4–47.2), with additional postoperative associations for wound hematoma after arthroplasty (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3–9.5) and postoperative urinary tract infection (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.04–7.1). There were no data regarding whether use of prophylactic antibiotics decreased the risk of developing PJIs in patients with these specific postoperative conditions. Preoperative factors had significant ORs (ranging from 1.8 to 2.2), but some epidemiologists maintain that in case-control studies significant ORs of less than 4 may not be large enough to be clinically relevant and the upper limit of the 95% CIs for the preoperative factors did not include values of 4 or greater. Independent of having undergone a dental procedure, postoperative factors such as drainage or infection after undergoing arthroplasty were associated more strongly with PJI than having undergone previous surgery or arthroplasty of the index joint, being immunocompromised, or having a medical condition such as diabetes mellitus.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for prosthetic joint patients undergoing invasive dental procedures: time for a rethink? [^1128AFDb]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In the United States, it has been common practice to recommend that dentists provide antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before invasive dental procedures (IDPs) to prevent late periprosthetic joint infections (LPJIs) in patients who have prosthetic arthroplasties despite lack of evidence for a causal relationship between IDP and LPJI and a lack of evidence for AP efficacy.

Methods

A recent study quantified the IDP incidence over the 15-month period prior to LPJI hospital admissions in the United Kingdom for which dental records were available. A case-crossover analysis compared IDP incidence in the 3 months before LPJI admission with the preceding 12 months. The English population was used because guidelines do not recommend AP and any relationship between IDPs and LPJI should be fully exposed.

Results

No significant positive association was identified between IDPs and LPJI. Indeed, the incidence of IDPs was lower in the 3 months before LPJI hospital admission than that in the preceding 12 months.

Conclusion

In the absence of a significant positive association between IDPs and LPJI, there is no rationale to administer AP before IDPs in patients with prosthetic joints, particularly given the cost and inconvenience of AP, the risk of adverse drug reactions, and the potential for unnecessary AP use that promotes antibiotic resistance. These results should reassure orthopedic surgeons and their patients that dental care of patients who have prosthetic joints should focus on maintaining good oral hygiene rather than on recommending AP for IDPs. Moreover, it should also reassure those in other countries where AP is not recommended that such guidance is sufficient.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental or urological procedures following hip or knee replacement [^111zC6va]. The Journal of Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Reports of prosthetic joint infection associated with urological or dental procedures have prompted suggestions that these patients require antibiotic prophylaxis, but no guidelines have been agreed. We have polled orthopaedic surgeons, urologists, and dentists on this issue.

Methods

The questions asked were: could infection of a joint prosthesis result from a dental or urological procedure; does the risk of infection warrant patients informing their dentist or urologist about their joint replacement; should these patients have prophylactic antibiotics for (a) routine procedures and (b) lengthy procedures.

Results

Urologists and orthopaedic surgeons agreed that infection could probably result from urological procedures and that patients should definitely inform their urologist about their prosthesis. Orthopaedic surgeons thought that antibiotics were definitely indicated for routine and lengthy urological procedures while urologists thought antibiotics were probably indicated. Orthopaedic surgeons thought that infection probably could result from dental procedures, while dentists answered "don't know". Both groups agreed that patients should definitely inform their dentist about their prosthesis. Orthopaedic surgeons thought that antibiotics probably were necessary for routine and lengthy dental procedures, whereas dentists answered "probably not" and "don't know", respectively.

Conclusions

These results could provide the basis for a consensus regarding prophylactic antibiotic use in this growing patient population.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — prophylactic systemic antibiotics before dental procedures in hip or knee arthroplasty patients states that "Routine use of a systemic prophylactic antibiotic prior to a dental procedure in patients with a hip or knee replacement may not reduce the risk of a subsequent periprosthetic joint infection", with "Quality of Evidence: Low" and "Strength of Option: Limited". Evidence cited includes a cohort where "In 255,568 patients… within 2 years after arthroplasty" there was "no difference in PJI risk between those that received antibiotics and those that did not", a matched analysis where Berbari et al. reported no association "in 339 matched patients" and that "antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures did not decrease the risk of PJI", and a large "database analysis of over 1,952,917" that "found no association between a dental procedure… and risk of PJI" and that "the rates of PJI and revision were not different between patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis and those who did not". Benefits and harms note that "rates of PJI are reported as low as 1%", that "The direct societal cost… is significant", and that prophylaxis "may promote the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and increase the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection", while acknowledging practice context that "Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures after THA and TKA is a widely utilized practice".

### Is prophylactic antibiotic use necessary before dental procedures in primary and revision TKA? A propensity score-matched, large-database study [^112PwKhf]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The question of whether dental procedures increase the risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in patients who have undergone total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains controversial.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Are dental procedures associated with an increased incidence of PJI in the setting of either primary or revision TKA after controlling for relevant potentially confounding variables? (2) Is the administration of prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures associated with any differences in this risk? (3) Which factors are associated with increased incidence of PJI after dental procedures?

Methods

This nationwide, retrospective, comparative, large-database study evaluated 591,602 patients who underwent unilateral primary or revision TKA between 2009 and 2019 using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service data in South Korea, in which all people in South Korea were registered and to which all medical institutions must charge any procedures they performed. The study population was divided into 530,156 patients with dental procedures and 61,446 patients without dental procedures based on whether the patients underwent a dental procedure at least 1 year after the index surgery. After propensity score matching, patients were classified into a dental (n = 182,052) and a nondental cohort (n = 61,422). The dental cohort was then divided into two groups: 66,303 patients with prophylactic antibiotics and 115,749 patients without prophylactic antibiotics based on prophylactic antibiotic use. After propensity score matching, patients were categorized into prophylactic (n = 66,277) and nonprophylactic (n = 66,277) cohorts. Propensity score matching was used to control for covariates including posttraumatic arthritis associated with PJI risk according to the dental procedure and prophylactic antibiotic use among the cohorts. After propensity score matching, the standardized mean difference was confirmed to be less than 0.1 for all variables. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed.

Results

Dental procedures were not associated with an increase in PJI risk after primary (adjusted HR 1.56 [95% CI 0.30 to 8.15]; p = 0.60) or revision TKA (adjusted HR 1.74 [95% CI 0.90 to 3.34]; p = 0.10). Additionally, use of prophylactic antibiotics was not associated with a reduced PJI risk after the index surgery, either for primary (adjusted HR 1.28 [95% CI 0.30 to 5.42]; p = 0.74) or revision TKA (adjusted HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.45 to 1.23]; p = 0.25). Although surgery type and prophylactic antibiotic use exhibited no influence on PJI occurrence after dental procedures, posttraumatic arthritis was associated with PJI. The adjusted HR for posttraumatic arthritis was 4.54 (p = 0.046).

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that dental procedures were not associated with an increased risk of PJI for up to 2 years after the dental procedure in patients who underwent either primary or revision TKA. Based on these findings, there is insufficient rationale for the use of prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures in patients who have undergone primary or revision TKA.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^113E8yL4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

More than 80% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental procedures are unnecessary: clindamycin use, the presence of prosthetic joints, and residence in the western United States were associated with unnecessary prescribing. While antibiotic prophylaxis is appropriately prescribed for indicated dental procedures in patients with cardiac conditions, most antibiotic prophylaxis is prescribed to patients in whom guideline-identified risk factors are not present. Although prescribing is slowly improving, the high proportion of antibiotics that were found to be unnecessary in our study is worrisome. Implementing antimicrobial stewardship efforts in dental practices is an opportunity to improve antibiotic prescribing for infection prophylaxis.

2014 Panel case-control studies — associations between dental procedures and prosthetic joint infection (PJI) are summarized from 3 additional case-control studies. In a nested case-control study by Skaar and colleagues, the main results were not significant with HR = 0.78 [95% CI, 0.18–3.39]; OR = 0.56 [95% CI, 0.18–1.74]; p = 0.45 despite control participants being more likely to have undergone invasive dental procedures. In a study by Swan and colleagues, they identified 17 patients (of 1,641) in whom PJI developed more than 3 months postoperatively and 51 control patients, and calculated the OR as 1.53 (95% CI, 0.13–18.03). In a study by Jacobson and colleagues, there were 30 case participants with late (> 6 months after implant placement) PJI and 101 control patients, and from the published data the OR was 0.07 (95% CI, 0.01–0.56), implying that those undergoing dental procedures were at lower risk of developing PJI; however, these findings were noted as inconsistent with other studies in which investigators failed to show an association between dental procedures and PJI.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^11554yd4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Antibiotics are recommended before certain dental procedures in patients with select comorbidities to prevent serious distant site infections.

Objective

To assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures using Truven, a national integrated health claims database.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study. Dental visits from 2011 to 2015 were linked to medical and prescription claims from 2009 to 2015. The dates of analysis were August 2018 to January 2019. Participants were US patients with commercial dental insurance without a hospitalization or extraoral infection 14 days before antibiotic prophylaxis (defined as a prescription with ≤ 2 days' supply dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit).

Exposures

Presence or absence of cardiac diagnoses and dental procedures that manipulated the gingiva or tooth periapex.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a prescription dispensed before a dental visit with a procedure that manipulated the gingiva or tooth periapex in patients with an appropriate cardiac diagnosis. To assess associations between patient or dental visit characteristics and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, multivariable logistic regression was used. A priori hypothesis tests were performed with an α level of .05.

Results

From 2011 to 2015, antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed for 168 420 dental visits for 91 438 patients (median age, 63 years; interquartile range, 55–72 years; 57.2% female). Overall, these 168 420 dental visits were associated with 287 029 dental procedure codes (range, 1–14 per visit). Most dental visits were classified as diagnostic (70.2%) and/or preventive (58.8%). In 90.7% of dental visits, a procedure was performed that would necessitate antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk cardiac patients. Prevalent comorbidities include prosthetic joint devices (42.5%) and cardiac conditions at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis (20.9%). Per guidelines, 80.9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental visits were unnecessary. Clindamycin was more likely to be unnecessary relative to amoxicillin (odds ratio [OR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15). Prosthetic joint devices (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.22–2.41), tooth implant procedures (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.45–1.89), female sex (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17–1.25), and visits occurring in the western United States (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06–1.25) were associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis.

Conclusion and Relevance

More than 80% of antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental visits were unnecessary. Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in dental practices is an opportunity to improve antibiotic prescribing for infection prophylaxis.

### Capturing orthopaedic surgical site infection data and assessing dental recommendations with respect to total joint arthroplasty [^117BLaWu]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Greater documentation of patient history and clinical course is crucial for identifying factors that can influence surgical outcomes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have already begun public reporting of hospital data on readmission, complication, and infection rates and will soon launch a website to make physician-specific outcomes data public. The orthopaedic community has the opportunity to lead the way in ensuring that adequate and accurate data is collected to facilitate appropriate comparisons that are based on patients' true risk of complications and the complexity of treatment. Several studies have reported a link between oral pathogens and periprosthetic infection, although it remains unclear whether organisms unique to dental tissues are also present in osteoarthritic joints and tissues affected by periprosthetic joint infection. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Dental Association are aware of these concerns and have created guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients who have undergone total hip or knee arthroplasty and require high-risk dental procedures. Because these guidelines have received considerable criticism, recommendations that are based on scientific and case-controlled clinical studies and provide effective guidance on this important subject are needed.

Multivariable Analysis of Factors Associated With Unnecessary Antibiotic Prophylaxis Among 168 420 Dental Visits

Abbreviations: ADA, American Dental Association; ED, emergency department; PCP, primary care provider.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess whether our findings were robust to assumptions of selection criteria within a plausible range. In the event that medical coding missed a cardiac condition diagnosis, we limited our cohort to those patients continuously enrolled in the medical plan from 2009 until the date of the visit. In this continuous enrollment analysis, 60.1% (n = 101 231) of the cohort were included, and 80.2% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were defined as unnecessary. The 2003 guidelines for the prevention of prosthetic joint infections also changed during our study period (updated guidelines were published in 2013 [released online in 2012]) (Table 1). The results were similar after modifying our definition of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis with recommendations in the 2003 prosthetic joint infection guidelines(75.7% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were unnecessary overall [76.7% in 2011–2013 and 74.1% in 2014–2015]). The highest-risk period of a prosthetic joint infection after joint implant placement is 2 years. After including prosthetic joint placement within 2 years in our definition of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, 80.9% of antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental visits were unnecessary. A subanalysis of the cohort with visits clustered into episodes of care (n = 13 825), 82.7% of patients at the first visit, 84.6% at the second visit, and 84.3% at the third visit received unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis. Stratifying the overall cohort by the presence or absence of a prosthetic joint, 11.2% of patients with a prosthetic joint received appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis secondary to a concomitant cardiac condition (n = 71 651). After excluding those with a prosthetic joint, the percentage of visits with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased to 75.0% (n = 96 769). Similar characteristics were found to be associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis as identified in the full analysis (eTables 1, 2, and 3 in the Supplement).

Key Points

Question

Is there an association between invasive dental procedures (IDP) and late prosthetic joint infections (LPJI) in patients who did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis prior to IDP?

Findings

This cohort study of 9427 LPJI hospital admissions for which dental records were available from 15 months preceding admission found no evidence of a temporal association between IDP and LPJI.

Meaning

These findings refute recommendations to give antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with prosthetic joints prior to IDP, given the cost, adverse drug reaction risk, and potential for promoting antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Analysis of prosthetic joint infections following invasive dental procedures in england [^115FJ8dz]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study of 9427 patients with dental records who developed LPJI, time trend and case-crossover analyses found no evidence of a temporal association between IDP and LPJI. In the 1970s and 1980s, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis in individuals at high risk of LPJI undergoing IDP became well established and led US orthopedic surgeons to call for dentists to give antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with prosthetic joints. In 1988, the American Dental Association (ADA) sponsored a workshop to address this. Although there was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, they recommended its use until further evidence became available, and antibiotic prophylaxis was widely adopted by dentists. In 1997and 2003the ADA and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) jointly published advisory statements recommending antibiotic prophylaxis for just 2 years after joint replacement but lifelong for patients with medical conditions that might put them at increased LPJI risk. However, in 2009, the AAOS unilaterally recommended that clinicians consider antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients with joint replacements prior to any invasive procedure that may cause bacteremia. This caused confusion among dentists and their patients. Several subsequent attempts were made by AAOS and ADA, either together or alone, to produce guidance, but these efforts only increased uncertainty about whether to provide antibiotic prophylaxis or not. As a result, in 2014, the ADA's Council on Scientific Affairs assembled an expert panel to conduct a systematic review. They recommended: "In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures". Unfortunately, this advice lacked AAOS support. Consequently, there is still confusion among dentists and their patients, as well as ongoing pressure from orthopedic surgeons for their patients to receive antibiotic prophylaxis when undergoing IDP, and many dentists continue to give antibiotic prophylaxis for fear of being considered negligent.

Defining the strength of recommendation — strength of recommendation expresses the degree of confidence one can have in a recommendation and takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade-off between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and whether data exists on critical outcomes. Future evidence is very difficult to overturn recommendations based on many high quality randomized controlled trials that show a large effect, whereas it is much more likely to overturn recommendations derived from a few small retrospective comparative studies; consequently, recommendations based on the former are given a "strong" strength of recommendation and statements based on the latter are presented as "Options" with either a "limited" strength or, in the event of no supporting or only conflicting evidence, a "consensus" strength. For any "consensus" strength option, inclusion of a statement in the clinical practice guideline is at the discretion of the guideline development group.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures at risk of causing bacteremia among post-total joint arthroplasty patients: a survey of Canadian orthopaedic surgeons and dental surgeons [^1151T9j7]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2014). Low credibility.

To elicit current practice and attitudes toward use of antibiotic-prophylaxis among TJA patients prior to dental procedures, a cross-sectional survey of practicing Canadian orthopaedic (OS) and dental surgeons (DS) was undertaken. Of respondents, 77% of OS and 71% of DS routinely prescribe antibiotic-prophylaxis, but while 63% of OS advocate lifelong use, only 22% of DS choose to do so (P < 0.0001). Both groups nonetheless recognize the importance of treatment within 2-years post-TJA as per AAOS/ADA guidelines. However, greater duration of practice pointed to potential inadequacy of these guidelines based on reported experience with late-hematogenous infection post-TJA. While discrepancies in attitude toward antibiotic-prophylaxis between surgeon groups remain, both groups agreed that the evidence to support decision making regarding antibiotic-prophylaxis for TJA patients undergoing dental procedures remains inadequate.

### Appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2016–2018 [^1128pnob]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis is common yet unnecessary for many dental visits. In this analysis, our objective was to assess whether the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis has improved over time.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using dental visits from 2016 to 2018 (data analyzed in 2021) using medical and prescriptions claims data of patients from the U.S. with commercial dental insurance. Antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a ≤ 2 days' supply prescription dispensed within 7 days before a dental visit. Appropriateness of prophylaxis was defined on the basis of the manipulation of the gingiva/tooth periapex or oral mucosa perforation in patients with appropriate cardiac diagnoses. Associations between patient and visit characteristics and appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis were assessed using multiple Poisson regression.

Results

Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was highly prevalent in this cohort, ranging from 77.0% in 2016 to 78.5% in 2018. In the adjusted analysis, factors associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis included younger age, female sex, geographic region, rurality, type of antibiotic, and certain dental procedures. The factors associated with the highest risk of unnecessary prophylaxis in the adjusted analysis were orthodontic procedures and having a history of a prosthetic joint. Notably, the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time in the adjusted analysis.

Conclusions

Unnecessary prescription of antibiotic prophylaxis by dentists continues to be common. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies are needed to improve prescribing by dentists.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^11188Vck]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline — antiseptic/antimicrobial treatment before dental procedures in patients with a hip or knee replacement — in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that the use of an oral topical antiseptic wash is not necessary before a dental procedure in patients with a hip or knee replacement. Quality of Evidence: Consensus. Strength of Option: Consensus. The literature review did not identify any studies meeting inclusion criteria that evaluated topical antiseptic wash prior to a dental procedure for patients with a hip or knee replacement. The results of these studies indicate that chlorhexidine wash prophylaxis does not significantly reduce the level of bacteremia following dental procedures, and as a result, oral topical antiseptic wash is not recommended before a dental procedure in patients with a hip or knee replacement for the purpose of reducing the risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Periprosthetic joint infection is a devastating complication after total joint arthroplasty associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and rates of PJI are reported as low as 1%. This recommendation does not support the use of chlorhexidine wash, which will improve cost-effectiveness and resource utilization. Because of the lack of demonstrated harm and historical practices of oral, topical antiseptic washes, clinicians might be less willing to accept the guidelines and change practice, but adopting the guidelines is not resource-intensive or reliant on special needs and therefore would be highly feasible to implement with greater clinician acceptance.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures after total hip and knee arthroplasty does not decrease the risk of periprosthetic joint infection [^116ZcYQs]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication after total hip and total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA). While some guidelines no longer recommend routine use of prophylactic antibiotics for dental procedures, many surgeons continue to prescribe antibiotics for their THA/TKA patients. In a setting of increasing antibiotic resistance, it is important to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. This study aims to evaluate antibiotics prior to dental procedures and the association between dental procedures and PJI.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent THA/TKA between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was late-presenting PJI, occurring > 90 days after surgery. Patients were designated in the antibiotic group (2,000 mg of amoxicillin) or non-antibiotic group based on their surgeon's prophylaxis protocol. Dental-associated PJIs were considered if the patient had evidence of poor dentition or a recent dental procedure prior to the onset of PJI symptoms.

Results

There were 2,871 (26.4%) patients in the no antibiotics group and 8,023 (73.6%) patients in the antibiotics group. We found 27 (0.3%) late-presenting PJIs and 4 dental-associated PJIs. In the univariate and multivariable analyses, body mass index ≥ -30 and revision surgery were the only variables that increased the odds of late-presenting PJI. All 4 dental-associated PJIs occurred in patients prescribed antibiotics.

Conclusions

We found a low rate of late-presenting PJI. Routine antibiotics prior to dental procedures were not shown to affect the risk of late-presenting PJI. These findings suggest that routine antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures is not necessary after THA/TKA.

### Current concepts in prophylactic antibiotics in oral and maxillofacial surgery [^111W7fat]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is the use of antibiotics in the perioperative period to prevent surgical site infections from local flora. Specific guidelines and criteria exist to prevent these infections while also practicing antimicrobial stewardship. Most dentoalveolar procedures do not require antibiotic prophylaxis. For nondentoalveolar procedures, the decision to provide antibiotic prophylaxis is based on involvement of the respiratory, oral, or pharyngeal mucosa. Special considerations exist for patients at high risk for infective endocarditis, patients with head and neck cancer, and temporomandibular joint replacement procedures. This article discusses indications for antibiotic prophylaxis during oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^114yLAGG]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Dentists prescribe 1 in 10 antibiotic prescriptions and are the top specialty prescriber of antibiotics in the United States. Antibiotic prescribing by dentists is common, comprising almost 60% of prescriptions to Medicare Part D beneficiaries. While decreases in prescribing of antibiotics have been observed nationally, dental prescribing has remained steady. This is despite changes in clinical guidelines narrowing the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures.,

Prior infection prophylaxis guidelines recommended that patients with certain conditions (ie, patients with recent prosthetic joint implants) receive antibiotic prophylaxis before a dentist visit. The rationale for prophylaxis was that patients with these conditions have an increased risk for serious distant site infections (eg, infective endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections) secondary to bacteremia introduced during dental care. However, guidelines for the use of antibiotics for the prevention of infective endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections were revised in 2007 and 2013, respectively. The rationale for these revisions was secondary to poor evidence on the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis, lack of an association between endocarditis and joint infections and dental care, and the risk of antibiotic-associated adverse events. Antibiotic resistance, risk of Clostridioides difficile infection, and general adverse effects outweigh any potential benefit, which is likely to be small. Therefore, antibiotics before dental procedures are only recommended per guidelines in patients with cardiac conditions at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis undergoing invasive dental procedures.

While studies in outpatient primary medical care settings have demonstrated that 30% of antibiotics prescribed are unnecessary, no study has evaluated the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing by dentists. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures.

Study Definitions

Guidelines on the use of antibiotics for infective endocarditis prophylaxis are based on specific planned dental procedures and medical history. Recommendations in current and previous guidelines for the use of antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures are summarized in Table 1. For antibiotic prophylaxis to be indicated for the prevention of infective endocarditis, both the dental procedure and the medical history need to be consistent with guidelines. Dental procedures for which infective endocarditis prophylaxis is considered appropriate are all procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa (referred to as gingival manipulation herein). All CDT, Current Procedural Terminology, and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes associated with dental visits during the study period were assessed for gingival manipulation by 6 general and 6 specialty dentist raters. When raters disagreed, consensus was determined by an additional rater team of 3 general dentists and 1 oral surgeon. Patients with cardiac conditions that are associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from endocarditis are recommended to receive antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures that involve gingival manipulation. Cardiac conditions for which antibiotics are indicated per guidelines include prosthetic cardiac valve or material used for cardiac valve repair, previous infective endocarditis, certain congenital heart diseases, and cardiac transplant recipients with cardiac valvulopathy. Cardiac conditions occurring from 2009 until the date the antibiotic was dispensed were evaluated and defined consistent with previous investigators.,

Table 1.
Guideline Summary on the Use of Antibiotic Prophylaxis Before Dental Procedures

Antibiotics are not recommended for prosthetic joint infection prophylaxis, defined as recent (prior 2 years) or historical claims (Table 1). Before 2012, guidelines for prosthetic joint infection prophylaxis recommended antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with select comorbidities (eg, prosthetic joint plus cancer) (Table 1). Hospital and medical claims of any prosthetic joint implant or complication (eg, revision or infection) occurring before the antibiotic dispense date were defined consistent with previous investigators. Therefore, "appropriate" antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as a prescription dispensed before a dental visit with a procedure that manipulated the gingiva or tooth periapex (as defined by dental raters described in the previous paragraph) in patients with an appropriate cardiac diagnosis as indicated by guidelines. In the absence of cardiac conditions, antibiotic prophylaxis was considered unnecessary in the primary analysis.

Introduction

Replacing arthritic joints with prosthetic joints is one of the great advances of modern medicine, with 2.9 million joints replaced annually worldwide. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a leading cause of arthroplasty failure. Early infections, within 3 months of joint replacement, are considered the result of wound contamination at the time of the surgical procedure. Early infection rates in the 1950s were approximately 12%, but antibiotic prophylaxis before joint replacement and lamina airflow operating rooms have reduced this to 1% to 2%, and refocused attention on late PJIs (LPJIs), which occur 3 months or longer after joint replacement operations.

LPJI may result in prosthesis removal, or more rarely, in loss of limb or life. The cost of treating LPJI is 4- to 6-fold that of the original arthroplasty, and is projected to have cost $1.62 billion in the US in 2020, without taking account of the personal and societal costs of long-term disability or the impact on patients' quality of life. Therefore, LPJI is of significant concern for the 28 000 US orthopedic surgeons and more than 7 million individuals with prosthetic joints. Furthermore, the number of individuals with prosthetic joints is increasing rapidly, with approximately 4 million new hip and knee arthroplasties projected annually in the US by 2030. Although LPJI incidence is comparatively low, it remains the most common mode of failure of knee replacement and the second most common of hip replacement, and the incidence is projected to increase with the increasing number of arthroplasties being performed.

Adjusted Analysis

In multivariable analyses, unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time (Table 3). Patients 65 years and older and those aged 35 to 44 years had lower odds of being prescribed unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis compared with patients aged 18 to 34 years, while women (vs men; odds ratio [OR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17–1.25) had higher odds of unnecessary prescribing. Significant regional variation remained: compared with the Midwest, the Northeast and South had lower odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis, while the West (OR, 1.15, 95% CI, 1.06–1.25) had higher odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis. In addition, being in a rural location was associated with lower odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis. Dental procedures defined as diagnostic, preventive, oral and maxillofacial surgery, periodontics, and endodontics had lower odds of unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis compared with those without these CDT procedure categories; adjunctive general services, implant services (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.45–1.89), prosthodontics, orthodontics, and maxillofacial prosthetics had higher odds of unnecessary prescribing. Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was less common in patients with diabetes, immunocompromised conditions, or health care use in the previous 6 months, while having a prosthetic joint device (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 2.22–2.41) was associated with unnecessary prescribing compared with those not having a prosthetic joint. Finally, unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis was most associated with antibiotics falling into the "other" category, followed by clindamycin (OR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15), compared with amoxicillin.

### Analysis of prosthetic joint infections following invasive dental procedures in england [^111toCuM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study suggest that, in the absence of any increase in IDP prior to LPJI, there is no evidence to support a positive association between IDP and LPJI or the practice of administering antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with prosthetic joints undergoing IDP. The continuing use of antibiotic prophylaxis represents a large and unnecessary financial burden on individuals and the health care system as well as an unnecessary risk to patients, from adverse drug reactions, and society, owing to the potential development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and should cease. However, our data suggest that maintenance of good oral hygiene may be important in preventing the small number of LPJIs in which oral bacteria are implicated. In addition, our findings should provide reassurance to orthopedic surgeons, dentists, and their patients in countries where antibiotic prophylaxis use in patients with prosthetic joints is not currently recommended.

### Dental procedures as risk factors for prosthetic hip or knee infection: a hospital-based prospective case-control study [^113Fsyao]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The actual risk of prosthetic joint infection as a result of dental procedures and the role of antibiotic prophylaxis have not been defined.

Methods

To examine the association between dental procedures with or without antibiotic prophylaxis and prosthetic hip or knee infection, a prospective, single-center, case-control study for the period 2001–2006 was performed at a 1200-bed tertiary care hospital in Rochester, Minnesota. Case patients were patients hospitalized with total hip or knee infection. Control subjects were patients who underwent a total hip or knee arthroplasty but without a prosthetic joint infection who were hospitalized during the same period on the same orthopedic floor. Data regarding demographic features and potential risk factors were collected. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of variables with the odds of infection.

Results

A total of 339 case patients and 339 control subjects were enrolled in the study. There was no increased risk of prosthetic hip or knee infection for patients undergoing a high-risk or low-risk dental procedure who were not administered antibiotic prophylaxis (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.4–1.6), compared with the risk for patients not undergoing a dental procedure (adjusted OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4–1.1) respectively. Antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk or low-risk dental procedures did not decrease the risk of subsequent total hip or knee infection (adjusted OR, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.5–1.6] and 1.2 [95% CI, 0.7–2.2], respectively).

Conclusions

Dental procedures were not risk factors for subsequent total hip or knee infection. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures did not decrease the risk of subsequent total hip or knee infection.

Limitations and Public Health Implications

These results are not without limitations. The cohort is a convenience sample of US patients with commercial dental insurance. Therefore, our results may not be representative of the uninsured and underrepresents persons with Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Medicare does not generally cover dental care, and the state provision of dental benefits to adults with Medicaid is optional. As a result, these persons are not included in our sample unless supplemental commercial dental benefits were purchased. Due to limitations in the data set, the prescriptions cannot be directly linked with the health care encounter or prescriber. We adapted methods used by other investigators to link antibiotic prescriptions to health care encounters and exclude other indications for antibiotics. To increase the specificity of our antibiotic-related dental visits, we conservatively defined a cohort in which other indications for antibiotics are unlikely. In contrast to medical care providers, dentists rarely use diagnostic codes (ICD-9 or ICD-10-CM) and are reimbursed based on procedure codes (CDT). Therefore, it is difficult to associate a diagnosis with the prescription. To increase the likelihood that an antibiotic was prescribed for infection prophylaxis (vs treatment of an oral infection), the days' supply for the antibiotic prescription was limited to 2 days or less (whereas oral infections are likely to be treated for ≥ 3 days). We did not assess dental visits at which an antibiotic was indicated but not dispensed. Although the 2007 infective endocarditis guidelines significantly decreased the number of patients with a prophylaxis indication, data are conflicting regarding the association of this change with the incidence of endocarditis. However, the sole studywith results identifying an increase in infective endocarditis in the United States did not include dental visit data and was not able to adjust for increases in infective endocarditis observed with the opioid epidemic. So, it is difficult to elucidate the causal factor (dental visit vs substance misuse). We did not apply 2017 (after our study period) expert panel recommendations of clinical scenarios in which antibiotic prophylaxis may be appropriate in patients with prosthetic joints. All scenarios include patients with multiple comorbidities (eg, prosthetic joint plus uncontrolled diabetes and prosthetic joint plus immunocompromised state). Because the comorbidities in the expert panel recommendationsare similar to those in the 2003 prosthetic joint guidelines, we anticipate the results from the expert panel recommendations to be similar to the results from the 2003 prosthetic joint guidelines. Due to the difficulty in identifying specific diagnoses, we broadened the definition for certain conditions to include all cardiac transplantation (removing cardiac valvulopathy), all diabetes (vs just type 1), and all congenital heart diseases. Therefore, unnecessary prescribing is likely higher than our results indicate.

Importance

Dentists in the United States are under pressure from orthopedic surgeons and their patients with prosthetic joints to provide antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental procedures (IDP) to reduce the risk of late prosthetic joint infection (LPJI). This has been a common practice for decades, despite a lack of evidence for an association between IDP and LPJI, a lack of evidence of antibiotic prophylaxis efficacy, cost of providing antibiotic prophylaxis, and risk of both adverse drug reactions and the potential for promoting antibiotic resistance.

Objective

To quantify any temporal association between IDP and subsequent LPJI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used a case-crossover and time trend design to examine any potential association between IDP and LPJI. The population of England (55 million) was chosen because antibiotic prophylaxis has never been recommended to prevent LPJI in England, and any association between IDP and LPJI would therefore be fully exposed. All patients admitted to hospitals in England for LPJI from December 25, 2011, through March 31, 2017, and for whom dental records were available were included. Analyses were performed between May 2018 and June 2021.

Exposures

Exposure to IDP.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was the incidence of IDP in the 3 months before LPJI hospital admission (case period) compared with the incidence in the 12 months before that (control period).

Results

A total of 9427 LPJI hospital admissions with dental records (mean [SD] patient age, 67.8 [13.1] years) were identified, including 4897 (52.0%) men and 4529 (48.0%) women. Of these, 2385 (25.3%) had hip prosthetic joints, 3168 (33.6%) had knee prosthetic joints, 259 (2.8%) had other prosthetic joints, and 3615 (38.4%) had unknown prosthetic joint types. There was no significant temporal association between IDP and subsequent LPJI. Indeed, there was a lower incidence of IDP in the 3 months prior to LPJI (incidence rate ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; p = 0.002).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that there is no rationale to administer antibiotic prophylaxis before IDP in patients with prosthetic joints.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^114Vksmq]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Results

More than 3 million dental visits and antibiotic prescriptions were identified in the Truven commercial dental database during the study period of 2011 to 2015. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 168 420 eligible dental visits (or episodes of care) with antibiotic prophylaxis for 91 438 unique patients were included in this analysis (Figure 1). The characteristics of the sample are listed in Table 2. The median age of the cohort was 63 years (interquartile range, 55–72 years) and was majority female (57.2%). Overall, these 168 420 dental visits were associated with 287 029 dental procedure codes (range, 1–14 per visit). Most visits with antibiotic prophylaxis occurred in the midwestern United States (46.9%), followed by the southern United States (31.5%), and occurred in an urban setting (56.7%). Most dental procedures conducted during the dental visits with antibiotic prophylaxis were classified as diagnostic (70.2%), followed by preventive (58.8%), and involved some type of gingival manipulation and/or mucosal incision (90.7%). Comorbidities were common in the cohort, especially prosthetic joint devices (42.5%) and cardiac conditions at the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis (20.9%). Health care use in the previous 6 months was common, with half having a primary care visit (50.7%) and most having a specialty care visit (80.4%).

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^1166M6Ty]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Our results demonstrate that most antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis before dental visits are unnecessary. These findings are concerning because dentists prescribe a significant proportion of antibiotics and are the top prescribers of clindamycin in the United States. Antibiotics prescribed for infection prophylaxis by dentists have been associated with community-associated C difficile infection. One dose of clindamycin has an equivalent risk of C difficile compared with a prolonged course. Therefore, it is alarming that clindamycin was more likely to be inappropriately prescribed than amoxicillin. However, there was a significant decrease in antibiotic prophylaxis over the study period. This may indicate that the 2013 guidelines for the prevention of prosthetic joint infections are being applied to patient care.

These results are consistent with those from other countries, where 58% to 81% of dental antibiotic prescriptions are inconsistent with guidelines, particularly for infection prophylaxis. However, dentists are knowledgeable about and generally satisfied with the antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines. Regardless, 70% of dentists surveyed reported prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis when not indicated. Dentists in the United States identified factors associated with guideline-consistent antibiotic prescribing to be postgraduate education, urban locale, and a smaller patient panel. Reasons for higher antibiotic prescribing rates included increasing use of dental implants, an aging population, underinsurance driving antibiotics as an oral surgery substitute, slow adoption of new guidelines, lack of awareness of the role of dentists in antibiotic resistance, and physician and patient pressure. These characteristics are similar to those associated with physician antibiotic overprescribing. Therefore, antibiotic stewardship strategies shown to be effective in outpatient medical clinics may also improve antibiotic prescribing in dentistry. In fact, a recent example has provided early evidence that implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship in dental practices was effective.

### Analysis of prosthetic joint infections following invasive dental procedures in england [^116Xyn5s]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

LPJI is most often attributed to hematogenous seeding of bacteria from another anatomical site, and this led US orthopedic surgeons to recommend patients with prosthetic joints be given antibiotic prophylaxis prior to invasive dental procedures (IDP), a practice that is supported by more than 90% of US orthopedic surgeons. Nonetheless, there are little data to support a causal link between IDP and LPJI, and there has never been a randomized clinical trial of antibiotic prophylaxis efficacy in preventing LPJI, to our knowledge. Furthermore, microbiological studies suggest that oral streptococci are an uncommon cause of LPJI, accounting for less than 10% of infections. These reasons may explain why antibiotic prophylaxis use for patients with prosthetic joints is not advocated in many countries, including the United Kingdom. The annual cost of providing antibiotic prophylaxis in the US has been calculated at approximately $59 640 000, but this does not take into account the cost of adverse drug reactions caused by antibiotic prophylaxis, or the risk that antibiotic prophylaxis could contribute to selection of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

For antibiotic prophylaxis to be effective, there must be a positive temporal association between IDP and LPJI, but data on this are lacking. In the absence of this evidence, the demand on US dentists to provide antibiotic prophylaxis for IDP remains controversial. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a positive association between LPJI and IDP in the population of England where, because antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended, the association should be fully exposed.

Although clinical guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis across a wide array of surgical procedures have been proposed by multidisciplinary groups of physicians and pharmacists, clinicians often deviate from recommendations. This is particularly true when recommendations are based on weak data or expert opinion. The goal of this review is to highlight certain common but controversial topics in perioperative prophylaxis and to focus on the data that does exist for the recommendations being made.

### Antibiotic use in dermatologic surgery [^114QJ3Wh]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Few situations in dermatologic surgery require prophylactic antibiotics. The AHA has decreased the dose for endocarditis prophylaxis from antibiotics before and after the procedure to only 1 hour prior to the procedure. In the 1997 guidelines, fewer procedures are listed as requiring antibiotics compared with prior guidelines. In fact, several authors have questioned the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics. The sequela of endocarditis or an infected prosthetic joint are certainly serious and possibly life-threatening conditions, yet this should not be a justification for using a therapy that is not proven and has potential serious side effects of its own. The authors suggest not using antibiotics on clean or clean-contaminated wounds regardless of cardiac history. Patients with prosthetic joint replacements probably do not need prophylactic antibiotics in cutaneous surgery unless mucosa is invaded; in such cases the guidelines set by the ADA and the AAOS should be followed. The authors believe that antibiotics should be reserved for contaminated or infected wounds when their application is therapeutic. Table 2 contains a summary of the authors' recommendations for the use of antibiotics in cutaneous surgery. Each patient should be evaluated on an individual basis, and consultation with the patient's primary physician, cardiologist, or orthopedist should be sought when the need arises.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for infection prophylaxis before dental procedures, 2011 to 2015 [^116hH2yN]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Unadjusted Analysis

Of the 168 420 eligible dental visits with antibiotic prophylaxis, the most frequent antibiotics prescribed were amoxicillin (69.4%), followed by clindamycin (16.0%) (Table 2). Only 19.1% of antibiotics prescribed were appropriate; therefore, 80.9% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions before dental visits were discordant with guidelines. Those with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis had a lower percentage of amoxicillin prescribed but a higher percentage of cephalexin and other types of antibiotics than those with appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. Compared with those visits with appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, visits with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis were associated with a higher percentage of women, urban locations, and prosthetic joints but a lower percentage of diagnostic and preventive dental procedure categories, gingival manipulation, cardiac conditions, and previous health care use. There was also significant variation by US Census geographic region and the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis. The highest unnecessary prescribing was observed in the West (84.5% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were unnecessary in the West) and the lowest in the Northeast (78.2% of antibiotic prophylaxis prescriptions were unnecessary in the Northeast). Unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis decreased over time between 2011 and 2015 from 84.5% to 78.8% overall and across all geographic regions (P < .001) (Figure 2).

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^111jiUDp]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline summary on prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures emphasizes that "Periprosthetic joint infection is recognized as a devastating complication after total joint arthroplasty associated with increased morbidity and mortality", and that the consensus opinion "tries to weigh concerns for balancing infection in the mouth and infection risk potential for the new joint during the early phase post-arthroplasty". Regarding cost/resource use, "There is limited evidence to support cost effectiveness; however, this opinion does not accelerate resource utilization but rather considers delay and timing of delay in resource utilization". On acceptability, "This consensus opinion aims to give guidance that can be considered by the health care team members to maximize access to dental healthcare while minimizing any potential risk of transient bacteremia seeding a new joint replacement in the early prosthetic joint healing phase". For feasibility, "After dissemination of the clinical practice guideline, there should be limited obstacles to wider spread adoption", and "Communication between dentists and orthopedic surgeons is essential for care coordination". Operational considerations note that "For dental management of acute dental infection immediately after TJA while the patient is still in the hospital, this may assume the hospital or surgical facility has access to a dentist/oral and maxillofacial surgeon who will provide care in the hospital setting", and, after discharge, "this may warrant additional time delay in scheduling definitive dental invasive intervention to resolve dental infection while the patient is maintained on intravenous antibiotics". Future research needs are identified: "As limited research was available, investigations documenting dental treatment and type (grouped by hematogenous bacteremia potential) undertaken at specific time points after TJA in the early healing phase, then correlated with PJI outcomes, would be of benefit".

### I PREVENT bacterial resistance. An update on the use of antibiotics in dermatologic surgery [^115L4UaJ]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Prophylaxis may be given to prevent a surgical wound infection, infective endocarditis (IE), or infection of a prosthetic joint, but its use before cutaneous surgery is controversial. Our aim was to review the current literature and provide a mnemonic to assist providers in appropriately prescribing prophylactic antibiotics.

Methods and Materials

We reviewed the current literature, including the new guidelines provided by the American Heart Association (AHA).

Results

The new AHA guidelines recommend prophylaxis for patients with high risk of an adverse outcome from IE instead of high risk of developing IE. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and the American Dental Association also provide guidelines. Given the paucity of conclusive studies, prophylaxis against a surgical wound infection is based more on clinical judgment.

Conclusion

The mnemonic we propose, "I PREVENT", represents: Immunosuppressed patients; patients with a Prosthetic valve; some patients with a joint Replacement; a history of infective Endocarditis; a Valvulopathy in cardiac transplant recipients; Endocrine disorders such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus; Neonatal disorders including unrepaired cyanotic heart disorders (CHDs), repaired CHD with prosthetic material, or repaired CHD with residual defects; and the Tetrad of antibiotics: amoxicillin, cephalexin, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin.

### Diagnosis and prevention of periprosthetic joint infections [^115fRFFc]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) prophylaxis — In the absence of reliable evidence comparing other antibiotics and antibiotic combinations, including those listed in the guideline, it is the opinion of this work group that perioperative antibiotics should be selected based on principles of responsible stewardship, balancing the risk of PJI and antibiotic resistance. Selection should reflect the antibiogram of the individual institution, the individual risk factors of the patient, and multidisciplinary support of institutional infection control experts; there is no current reliable evidence to support one antibiotic versus the other. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus.

Regarding preventative measures for prosthetic joint infection, more specifically with respect to prophylaxis before dental procedures, AAHKS/AAOS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider delaying dental procedures after hip or knee replacement surgery based on the risk of transient bacteremia, the occurrence of an invasive surgical procedure, and treatment of an active dental infection:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Dental examination without probing, dental radiography or cone beam CT, denture adjustment procedures, clear orthodontic aligner (invisible braces) adjustment procedures, occlusal guard or bite splint adjustment|- Same day|
|Oral hygiene procedures, including dental cleaning, dental prophylaxis using a rubber cup and handpiece (without scaling) or periodontal probing (without scaling and/or root planing)|- 3 months|
|Orthodontic procedures, including banding or debanding orthodontic fixes or removable appliances, archwire adjustment, orthodontic mini-implant removal, orthodontic separate placement|- 3 months|
|Other noninvasive procedures, including suture removal, anesthetic injection, crown and bridge placement, dental restorative procedures, rubber dam clamp or matrix band wedge between teeth, impression taking, endodontic treatment (root canal therapy)|- 3 months|
|Scaling and/or root planing with manual (hand instruments) or ultrasonic scaler|- 3 months|
|Dental extraction, including single, multiple, impacted third molar|- 3 months|
|Oral surgery, including dental implant surgery, periodontal surgery, cleft palate surgery, piezoelectric surgery, osteosynthesis plate removal|- 3 months|
|Treatment of active dental infection|- Same day.|

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery: advisory statement 2008 [^114Z4yTG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic prophylaxis is an important component of dermatologic surgery, and recommendations in this area should reflect the updated 2007 guidelines of the American Heart Association, the American Dental Association with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines, and recent prospective studies on surgical site infection.

Objective

To provide an update on the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery for the prevention of infective endocarditis, hematogenous total joint infection, and surgical site infection.

Methods

A literature review was performed, expert consensus was obtained, and updated recommendations were created, consistent with the most current authoritative guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Dental Association with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

Results

For patients with high-risk cardiac conditions, and a defined group of patients with prosthetic joints at high risk for hematogenous total joint infection, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended when the surgical site is infected or when the procedure involves breach of the oral mucosa. For the prevention of surgical site infections, antibiotics may be indicated for procedures on the lower extremities or groin, for wedge excisions of the lip and ear, skin flaps on the nose, skin grafts, and for patients with extensive inflammatory skin disease.

Limitations

These recommendations are not based on multiple, large-scale, prospective trials.

Conclusions

There is a strong shift away from administration of prophylactic antibiotics in many dermatologic surgery settings, based on updated authoritative guidelines. These recommendations provide guidance to comply with the most current guidelines, modified to address dermatology-specific considerations. Managing physicians may utilize these guidelines while individualizing their approach based on all clinical considerations.

### Management of patients with orthopaedic implants undergoing dental procedures [^111Ho5ZT]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, in collaboration with the American Dental Association, has developed Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for the Management of Patients with Orthopaedic Implants Undergoing Dental Procedures. Evidence-based information, in conjunction with the clinical expertise of physicians, was used to develop the criteria to improve patient care and obtain best outcomes while considering the subtleties and distinctions necessary in making clinical decisions. The Management of Patients with Orthopaedic Implants Undergoing Dental Procedures AUC clinical patient scenarios were derived from indications of patients with orthopaedic implants presenting for dental procedures, as well as from current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and supporting literature to identify the appropriateness of the use of prophylactic antibiotics. The 64 patient scenarios and 1 treatment were developed by the writing panel, a group of clinicians who are specialists in this AUC topic. Next, a separate, multidisciplinary, voting panel (made up of specialists and nonspecialists) rated the appropriateness of treatment of each patient scenario using a 9-point scale to designate a treatment as Appropriate (median rating, 7 to 9), May Be Appropriate (median rating, 4 to 6), or Rarely Appropriate (median rating, 1 to 3).

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^111VZAf5]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Association between invasive dental procedures (IDPs) and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in the early postoperative period is summarized from two analyses: Thornhilll et al. (2022) evaluated IDPs in a 3-month period prior to 9427 late PJI hospital admissions, noting the incidence of IDPs was significantly lower in the three months prior to PJI admission and that causal organisms were identified in 4338 (46%), with only 9% oral streptococci. Subsequently, Thornhilll et al. (2023) assessed 2,344 PJI hospital admissions and found no significant positive association between IDPs (1,821, of which 18.3% had antibiotic coverage) and subsequent PJI, and these analyses suggest a lack of causal association between IDPs and PJIs. However, neither study examined the association within the first few months after joint replacement; regardless of whether a dental procedure is performed, the first three months after a joint replacement carry the highest risk for developing a PJI, and consequently it is prudent to avoid any procedures, including dental procedures, that could theoretically or actually further elevate the risk during this time.
