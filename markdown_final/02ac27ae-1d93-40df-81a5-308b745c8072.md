## Question

can pregnant take paxlovid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pregnant individuals can take Paxlovid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA label and whether pregnancy is a contraindication. Then, I should review animal reproductive tox data. Next, I will assess guidance from major public health authorities like WHO and professional societies. After that, I need to examine the available human data in pregnancy. I should also contextualize the maternal risks of untreated COVID-19. Then, I will consider ritonavir's historical pregnancy experience and lactation data for both components. Finally, I will synthesize recommendations for clinical implementation, acknowledge knowledge gaps, and state the bottom line with appropriate caveats [^117NpZgN] [^115D5xaw].

> Let me first confirm the regulatory starting point. The FDA labeling for Paxlovid states that human data on nirmatrelvir exposure in pregnancy are insufficient to define risks of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse outcomes, but pregnancy is not a contraindication and the label explicitly reminds prescribers that untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy carries maternal and fetal risks, shifting the decision to a risk–benefit analysis rather than a prohibition [^117NpZgN].

> I will now examine the animal reproductive toxicology because it frames biologic plausibility. Wait, let me verify the exposure margins and signals. For nirmatrelvir, rabbits showed reduced fetal body weights at about 11 times human exposure, with no adverse developmental outcomes at exposures three times human levels, whereas ritonavir showed no adverse developmental outcomes in rats and rabbits at exposures five to eight times human levels, which is reassuring at therapeutic human doses though not definitive for humans [^117NpZgN].

> Next, I should review global guidance. The WHO Living Guideline, summarized in a Cochrane review, issues a strong recommendation for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in those at highest risk of hospitalization, specifically including pregnant and lactating individuals, based on an overall benefit–risk judgment favoring prevention of severe disease progression in this population [^115D5xaw].

> Hold on, I should verify whether real-world human pregnancy data align with this stance. The evidence base is observational but growing: a cross-sectional survey of pregnant and lactating individuals reported no significant adverse maternal or infant outcomes with Paxlovid use, with dysgeusia and rebound being the most common experiences, and not specific to pregnancy, while an outcomes study of 114 pregnant patients documented few complications and no discontinuations, though an observed imbalance in preeclampsia and surgical site infection requires cautious interpretation given confounding by COVID-19 itself and limited power, and additional small early series similarly noted symptom resolution without fetal or neonatal complications, which together show no emergent safety signal to date [^116iPmXa] [^114VcuEt] [^114GCaZJ] [^112h62Lz].

> I need to contextualize these findings with known maternal–fetal risks from COVID-19 itself. Pregnant individuals have higher risks of severe disease and adverse obstetric outcomes, and both the Paxlovid and remdesivir FDA labels emphasize that untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy poses risks to mother and fetus, which weighs heavily in the risk–benefit calculus favoring treatment when clinically indicated [^117NpZgN] [^115LLaEX] [^113bj4nd].

> Let me consider ritonavir's historical pregnancy track record, since it is the boosting component here. The Paxlovid label references observational data for ritonavir without an identified increase in major birth defects, and antiretroviral experience demonstrates ritonavir-boosted regimens have lower total exposures during pregnancy without a clear teratogenic signal, with darunavir/ritonavir studies showing reduced exposure in pregnancy but preserved virologic outcomes, supporting the general acceptability of short ritonavir exposure in pregnancy as part of Paxlovid's 5-day course [^117NpZgN] [^112AJqj2] [^115rJoHs].

> Now, I should review lactation data as a proxy for perinatal exposure and overall safety margin. The FDA lactation section reports very low transfer of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir into human milk at approximately 1.8% and 0.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose, respectively, and a dedicated milk study of eight dyads corroborates minimal infant exposure with no reported infant adverse events, further supporting a low risk signal with short maternal courses [^111W7CNN] [^115E2aV5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I see a potential contradiction in resources and I should double-check it. One low-credibility review asserts that WHO has not approved any drug therapy as safe and effective for treating COVID-19 during pregnancy, but that statement is inconsistent with the WHO Living Guideline summarized by Cochrane, which strongly recommends nirmatrelvir/ritonavir including for pregnant and lactating patients, and under the FDA's PLLR framework, labeling often reflects limited pregnancy data without binary safe/unsafe categorizations, necessitating narrative risk–benefit counseling rather than categorical exclusion [^113bj4nd] [^115D5xaw] [^1127v51N].

> I should now translate this into practical implementation. For eligible pregnant patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at risk for progression, initiate Paxlovid as soon as possible and within 5 days of symptom onset, using the standard dose of 300 mg nirmatrelvir with 100 mg ritonavir orally twice daily for 5 days, with renal dosing adjustments for moderate and severe impairment per label, ensure tablets are swallowed whole, and specify numeric doses of each component in the prescription to avoid errors [^111aaoUJ] [^116VSfjT] [^11518f14].

> But wait, what about rebound and monitoring during pregnancy, and do we need extra fetal surveillance. Rebound phenomena have been described primarily in vaccinated populations and were commonly reported as nonserious in survey data, and mechanistic modeling suggests rebound dynamics are immunologic rather than teratogenic, while no special fetal monitoring is specified in the label beyond standard obstetric care adjusted to clinical severity, so routine obstetric follow-up with attention to maternal status is appropriate [^116iPmXa] [^117Fs8Ci] [^117NpZgN].

> Next, I should review professional consensus and any nuanced scenarios. ACOG advises that in coinfection with influenza and SARS-CoV-2, both oseltamivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir should be initiated, underscoring acceptance of Paxlovid during pregnancy when clinically indicated, and WHO's strong recommendation adds further support, with use tempered by individualized counseling under PLLR principles about limited but reassuring pregnancy-specific data and clear disease risks [^115ymEJP] [^115D5xaw] [^1127v51N].

> I need to ensure we acknowledge limitations transparently. There are no randomized trials in pregnant individuals, observational cohorts are relatively small, and long-term offspring follow-up data are limited, which reflects chronic gaps in pregnancy pharmacology and labeling emphasized by the FDA and academic reviews, reinforcing the need for inclusion of pregnant and lactating people in therapeutic studies and registries while not withholding indicated therapy in the interim [^1116yRKc] [^115ar8nT] [^111wJywQ].

> Bottom line, after weighing label guidance, animal data, global recommendations, human observational outcomes, and the risks of untreated disease, pregnant individuals can receive Paxlovid when clinically indicated, with shared decision-making that discusses limited but reassuring pregnancy and lactation data, clear maternal–fetal benefits of preventing severe COVID-19, and standard dosing with renal adjustments within 5 days of symptom onset, and pregnancy itself should not be a reason to withhold therapy [^117NpZgN] [^115D5xaw] [^111W7CNN] [^116iPmXa] [^111aaoUJ].

---

Pregnant patients can take **Paxlovid** (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) when benefits outweigh risks [^117NpZgN], consistent with FDA and WHO guidance [^115D5xaw]. Human pregnancy data are limited [^115ar8nT]; animal studies show no major teratogenicity at clinically relevant exposures [^117NpZgN], and observational data do not indicate a clear increase in major birth defects or miscarriage. Paxlovid is **recommended for pregnant patients** [^112h62Lz] with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression [^115D5xaw], started within 5 days of symptom onset [^111aaoUJ], with careful review of drug interactions and close monitoring.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **FDA guidance**: The FDA states that available human data are insufficient to assess risks of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal/fetal outcomes with nirmatrelvir [^117NpZgN]; ritonavir data do not show increased major birth defects, but miscarriage risk remains uncertain.

- **WHO guidance**: The WHO strongly recommends nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for non-severe COVID-19 in patients at highest risk of hospitalization, explicitly including pregnant and breastfeeding women [^115D5xaw].

- **ACOG guidance**: ACOG advises that pregnant patients with COVID-19 who meet criteria may receive nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; assess drug–drug interactions before prescribing.

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Observational studies in pregnant patients are limited but show **no clear increase in major birth defects or miscarriage** [^114GCaZJ]; animal studies likewise show no major teratogenicity at clinically relevant exposures [^117NpZgN]. Clinical outcomes from a cohort of 114 pregnant patients [^114VcuEt] indicate nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was **well tolerated with no medication discontinuations**, and most obstetric and medical outcomes were similar to those of untreated patients, although small sample size precluded multivariable modeling.

---

## Potential risks and benefits

The **benefits** of Paxlovid include reductions in COVID-19 severity, hospitalization, and death in high-risk patients [^115D5xaw], including pregnant individuals [^112h62Lz]. The **risks** are not fully characterized due to limited human pregnancy data [^115ar8nT]; animal studies show reduced fetal body weight at high exposures but no major teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses [^117NpZgN].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

Pregnancy-related changes in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion may affect Paxlovid pharmacokinetics [^114Hf2CX]; however, **no pregnancy-specific dosing adjustments are currently recommended**.

---

## Clinical monitoring and precautions

- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor for adverse effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms and potential hepatic effects.

- **Drug interactions**: Review all medications for interactions, as ritonavir is a strong CYP3A inhibitor.

- **Patient counseling**: Discuss potential risks and benefits, and advise reporting any adverse effects promptly.

---

## Alternative treatments

Alternative treatments include **Remdesivir**, an antiviral with limited pregnancy data but no clear increase in major birth defects or miscarriage in available reports [^115D5xaw] [^115LLaEX], and **Supportive care**, with symptomatic management and close monitoring remaining essential.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Use in pregnancy | Recommended when benefits outweigh risks [^117NpZgN] [^112h62Lz] |
| Timing | Initiate within 5 days of symptom onset [^111aaoUJ] |
| Monitoring | Close monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions |
| Alternative treatments | Remdesivir or supportive care if Paxlovid is contraindicated [^115LLaEX] [^115D5xaw] |

---

Pregnant patients can take **Paxlovid** when benefits outweigh risks, supported by limited human data and supportive animal and observational evidence [^117NpZgN] [^116iPmXa] [^114VcuEt]. It is recommended for high-risk pregnant patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, initiated within 5 days of symptom onset, with careful monitoring and review of potential drug interactions [^112h62Lz] [^111aaoUJ].

## References

### Paxlovid [^117NpZgN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Available data on the use of nirmatrelvir during pregnancy are insufficient to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published observational studies on ritonavir use in pregnant women have not identified an increase in the risk of major birth defects. However, these studies are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of miscarriage. There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy.

In an embryo-fetal development study with nirmatrelvir, reduced fetal body weights were observed in pregnant rabbits following oral administration at systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 11 times higher than the clinical exposure at the approved human dose of Paxlovid. No other adverse developmental outcomes were observed in animal reproduction studies with nirmatrelvir at systemic exposures (AUC) greater than or equal to 3 times higher than clinical exposure at the approved human dose of Paxlovid.

In embryo-fetal developmental studies with ritonavir, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed following oral administration to pregnant rats and rabbits at systemic exposures (AUC) 5 times (rat) or 8 times (rabbits) higher than the clinical exposure at the approved human dose of Paxlovid.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.

### Paxlovid [^111aaoUJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The 5-day treatment course of Paxlovid should be initiated as soon as possible following a diagnosis of COVID-19 has been made and within 5 days of symptom onset, even if baseline COVID-19 symptoms are mild. If a patient requires hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19 after starting treatment with Paxlovid, the patient should complete the full 5-day treatment course at the healthcare provider's discretion.

If the patient misses a dose of Paxlovid within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

Paxlovid, which includes both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets, can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken, or crushed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended dosage for Paxlovid is 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet). All three tablets should be taken together orally twice daily in the morning and at bedtime for 5 days.

- **Dosage in patients with renal impairment**: Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within Paxlovid. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^115D5xaw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

There are several therapeutic options for people with COVID-19. The choice of therapy depends on the severity of the illness, drug availability, route of administration, time from onset of symptoms to starting treatment, co-administered medication, and patient-specific factors such as age, pregnancy, or lactation. In people at the highest risk of hospitalization or progression to severe illness, including consideration for women who are pregnant or lactating, the WHO Living Guideline for Therapeutics and COVID-19 includes a strong recommendation for the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, in addition to symptomatic management (WHO 2023b).

Alternative therapeutics for people in this group include remdesivir, which requires intravenous administration, and, in some countries, the oral antiviral molnupiravir. Molnupiravir has a conditional recommendation for use by the WHO in people with non-severe COVID-19 who are at the highest risk of hospitalization, excluding pregnant or breastfeeding women, and children. It is noted at this time that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the refusal of the marketing authorization of molnupiravir; however, this drug is available outside the EU.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is not recommended by the WHO for people with severe COVID-19. Recommended therapeutics for these patients include corticosteroids, interleukin-6 receptor blockers (tocilizumab, sarilumab), remdesivir (an antiviral), and the Janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib, in addition to cardiorespiratory support measures as indicated (WHO 2023b).

### Characterization of the US Food and Drug Administration post-marketing commitments and requirements for pregnancy and lactation [^117RJ7ro]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). High credibility.

Enactment of the US Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA) in 2007 and the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR) in 2015 are important milestones, giving the FDA the authority to request studies in pregnant and lactating women. Our objective was to characterize trends of pregnancy and lactation-related postmarketing commitments (PMCs) and postmarketing requirements (PMRs) for new molecular entities approved by the FDA between 2000 and 2022.

Approval letters of original New Drug Applications (NDAs, N = 488) for new molecular entities were obtained from the FDA website. NDAs with pregnancy and lactation-based PMCs/PMRs were identified, and data was extracted. Data included PMC/PMR timelines and attributes of requested studies (type, design elements, and outcomes) when available.

- **Findings**: Fifty-nine NDAs included 92 PMCs/PMRs related to pregnancy and lactation. Forty-one NDAs had pregnancy-related PMRs/PMCs, four had lactation-related PMRs, and 14 had both. Most PMRs/PMCs were for nervous system medications (N = 33). Forty-seven NDAs specified safety data collection in infants in at least the first year of life. All pregnancy-related PMRs were issued after 2008, and most PMCs (N = 8) were issued before 2008.

- **Specifics**: Only one PMC requested a pharmacokinetic study in pregnant women. All lactation-related PMRs (N = 18) requested measurement of drug concentrations in breast milk, with one also requiring measurement of maternal blood concentrations. Eighty-nine percent of lactation-related PMRs were requested after 2015.

There was a steady increase in pregnancy and lactation-related PMRs following these regulatory changes.

### SPL drug information for zidovudine [^115yjSkC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of zidovudine PO (also known as Retrovir) in pregnant patients across all trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Animal studies have shown evidence of fetal harm. It is important to monitor plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 counts. Viral load should also be assessed. Standard glucose screening should be performed. A first trimester ultrasound is advised to determine gestational age, and a second trimester ultrasound can be used for both anatomical survey and further determination of gestational age.

Antiretroviral therapy is recommended for all patients during pregnancy, regardless of HIV RNA concentrations or CD4 cell count. The use of highly active antiretroviral combination therapy (HAART) to maximally suppress viral replication is the most effective strategy to prevent the development of resistance and to minimize the risk of perinatal transmission. HAART should be initiated as soon as pregnancy is recognized, or HIV is diagnosed. Current HIV guidelines recommend the use of zidovudine plus lamivudine as an alternative 2-NRTI backbone in patients who are pregnant or trying to conceive.

The drug zidovudine PO (also known as Retrovir) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug has been taken by a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an observed increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus. However, studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which remains uncertain in humans.

### Plasma lopinavir trough levels in a group of pregnant women on lopinavir, ritonavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine [^11462RXb]. AIDS (2007). Low credibility.

During pregnancy, the absorption of antiretroviral drugs may not be optimal; therefore, a prospective study was conducted to investigate the plasma levels of lopinavir in 26 HIV-infected pregnant women. Plasma lopinavir levels were examined in specimens obtained 12 hours post-dose. The lopinavir level was found to be subtherapeutic in four women (15.4%); one patient discontinued treatment and three (13.6%) with therapeutic levels of lopinavir had detectable HIV viral loads at the time of therapeutic drug monitoring.

### Paxlovid [^116VSfjT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

For patients with severe renal impairment, including those requiring hemodialysis, it is vital to ensure proper dosing. Patients should be instructed to take two 150 mg nirmatrelvir tablets with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet together once on Day 1. This should be followed by one 150 mg nirmatrelvir tablet with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet together once daily on Days 2–5. Patients should take their dosage at approximately the same time each day. On days when undergoing hemodialysis, advise them to take the Paxlovid dose after hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Administration instructions**: Inform patients to take Paxlovid with or without food at approximately the same time each day. Advise them to swallow all Paxlovid tablets whole, without chewing, breaking, or crushing them. Emphasize the necessity of completing the full 5-day treatment course and adhering to public health recommendations for isolation to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If a dose is missed within eight hours of the usual time, the patient should take it as soon as possible and continue with the regular dosing schedule. If a dose is missed by more than eight hours, the patient should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the scheduled time, without doubling the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

### Paxlovid [^111W7CNN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Risk summary: Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are present in human breast milk in small amounts (less than 2%). In a clinical lactation study involving eight lactating women, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir were estimated to be present in human milk at a mean weight-normalized infant daily dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day (1.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted daily dose) and 0.006 mg/kg/day (0.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted daily dose), respectively.

There are no available data on the effects of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered in conjunction with the mother's clinical need for PAXLOVID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PAXLOVID or the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should adhere to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

- **Data**: In a clinical pharmacokinetics study, eight healthy lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum were administered three oral doses every 12 hours (steady-state dosing) of 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The mean daily amount of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir recovered in breast milk was 0.752 mg and 0.027 mg, respectively. This represents 0.13% and 0.014% of the respective administered daily maternal doses (unadjusted for weight). The estimated daily infant dose, assuming average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, was 0.16 mg/kg/day and 0.006 mg/kg/day, accounting for 1.8% and 0.2% of the maternal dose, respectively, for nirmatrelvir and ritonavir.

### Comparing molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir efficacy and the effects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in animal models [^113oYe1t]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In vitro efficacy of nirmatrelvir against VOCs, infected cells were incubated with serial dilutions of nirmatrelvir in media containing 2 µM CP-100356, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor added to limit rapid compound efflux. Nirmatrelvir exhibited nanomolar potency against all tested VOCs, returning half-maximal (EC₅₀) and 90% maximal (EC₉₀) concentrations ranging from 21.1 to 327.6 nM and 32.8 to 421.4 nM, respectively, which recapitulated results of previous in vitro dose-response studies.

- **Prevention of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease in Roborovski dwarf hamsters**: We determined single-oral dose pharmacokinetics (PK) properties of nirmatrelvir delivered alone or in combination with ritonavir. Hamsters were administered 250 mg/kg nirmatrelvir with or without 83.3 mg/kg ritonavir. In the absence of ritonavir, 250 mg/kg nirmatrelvir delivered a plasma exposure level of 22,400 h × ng/ml. When combined with ritonavir, nirmatrelvir plasma exposure was 215,000 h × ng/ml, confirming that ritonavir, equivalent to its effect in human patients, efficiently slows nirmatrelvir metabolism in the dwarf hamsters. Previously, we have demonstrated that 250 mg/kg molnupiravir yields plasma exposure of N₄-hydroxycytidine, the systemic metabolite of molnupiravir, of 376 h × ng/ml in dwarf hamsters. Human patients taking paxlovid or molnupiravir show nirmatrelvir exposure of 28,220 h × ng/ml and N₄-hydroxycytidine exposure of 8200 h × ng/ml, respectively.

### Cyred EQ [^114kUT6J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Taking your pill: Before you start taking your pills, be sure to read these directions anytime you are not sure what to do. The right way to take the pill is to take one pill every day at the same time. Missing pills can increase the likelihood of pregnancy, including starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to become pregnant.

Many women experience spotting or light bleeding, or may feel sick to their stomach during the first 1 to 3 packs of pills. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill; the problem usually resolves itself. If it doesn't, consult your healthcare professional.

### Salvage regimens containing darunavir, etravirine, raltegravir, or enfuvirtide in highly treatment-experienced perinatally infected pregnant women [^111intJD]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Combination antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women with human immunodeficiency virus has dramatically decreased maternal-to-child transmission. Highly treatment-experienced pregnant patients have limited effective treatment options due to past toxicities and viral resistance. We present 8 pregnancies in 7 perinatally infected women successfully treated with salvage regimens containing darunavir, etravirine, raltegravir, or enfuvirtide.

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) for mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy and lactation [^116iPmXa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) is recommended to reduce the risk of hospitalization from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy. Data on its use in pregnancy, including prescribing patterns and patient experience (adverse effects, incidence of rebound), are limited. We performed a cross-sectional study in which we surveyed a cohort of vaccinated pregnant or lactating individuals with breakthrough COVID-19. Of 35 pregnant respondents, 51.4% were prescribed and 34.3% took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir; of these, 91.7% experienced dysgeusia and 50.0% had rebound (50.0% positive test result, 33.3% return of symptoms). Three of five lactating respondents were prescribed and two took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. There were no significant adverse outcomes. Unknown risk was the most common reason for declining nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. More research is needed to establish the safety of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in pregnancy and lactation, to improve public health messaging, and to increase uptake of this treatment.

### SPL drug information for fosamprenavir calcium [^114c5qWG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of fosamprenavir PO (also known as Lexiva) in pregnant patients during all trimesters, it should only be used if the benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. It is essential to monitor plasma HIV RNA and assess the viral load. CD4 counts should be regularly checked, and standard glucose screening should be performed. A first trimester ultrasound is necessary to confirm gestational age, while a second trimester ultrasound can be utilized for both anatomical survey and gestational age determination.

Antiretroviral therapy should be provided to all patients during pregnancy, irrespective of HIV RNA concentrations or CD4 cell count. Utilizing highly active antiretroviral combination therapy (HAART) to maximally suppress viral replication is the most effective strategy to prevent the development of resistance and minimize the risk of perinatal transmission. Fosamprenavir PO, also known as Lexiva, is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This medication has been administered to a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an observed increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus. Animal studies have indicated an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which remains uncertain in humans.

### Entresto [^114SbsJ8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

- **Pregnancy**: Advise female patients of childbearing age about the consequences of exposure to Entresto during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Ask patients to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Angioedema**: Advise patients to discontinue use of their previous ACE inhibitor or ARB and allow a 36-hour wash-out period if switching from or to an ACE inhibitor [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Assessment of the scope, completeness, and consistency of various drug information resources related to COVID-19 medications in pregnancy and lactation [^116Ky6zp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Drug use in pregnancy and lactation is challenging, particularly for pregnant and lactating women with critical clinical conditions such as COVID-19, due to inconsistent drug safety data. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the various drug information resources for the scope, completeness, and consistency of the information related to COVID-19 medications in pregnancy and lactation.

- **Methods**: Data related to COVID-19 medications from various drug information resources, such as text references, subscription databases, and free online tools, were used for comparison. The congregated data were analyzed for scope, completeness, and consistency.

- **Results**: Scope scores were highest for Portable Electronic Physician Information Database (PEPID), Up-to-date, and drugs.com compared to other resources. Overall completeness scores were higher for Micromedex and drugs.com (p < 0.05 compared to all other resources). The inter-reliability analysis for overall components by Fleiss kappa among all the resources was found to be 'slight' (k < 0.20, p < 0.0001).

	- Information related to older drugs in most of the resources provides in-depth details on components such as pregnancy safety, clinical data related to lactation, the effect of drug distribution into breast milk, reproductive potential/infertility risk, and pregnancy category/recommendations. However, for newer drugs, the information on these components was superficial and incomplete, with insufficient data and inconclusive evidence, which is statistically significant.

### Importance of inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women in COVID-19 therapeutic trials [^1116yRKc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Investigators are employing unprecedented innovation in the design of clinical trials to rapidly and rigorously assess potentially promising therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); this is in stark contrast to the continued near-universal regressive practice of exclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women from these trials. The few trials that allow their inclusion focus on post-exposure prophylaxis or outpatient treatment of milder disease, limiting the options available to pregnant women with severe COVID-19 to compassionate use of remdesivir, or off-label drug use of hydroxychloroquine or other therapies. These restrictions were put in place despite experience with these drugs in pregnant women. In this Viewpoint, we call attention to the need and urgency to engage pregnant women in COVID-19 treatment trials now in order to develop data-driven recommendations regarding the risks and benefits of therapies in this unique but not uncommon population.

### COVID-19 antiviral medication use among pregnant and recently pregnant US outpatients [^114Ja7yg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Pregnant people are at risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated complications. While withholding treatment from pregnant patients is not recommended, little is known about the frequency of antiviral medication use during pregnancy.

Using Medicaid and commercial insurance databases, we constructed a national claims-based cohort study of pregnant, recently pregnant, and nonpregnant female patients 18–49 years old with an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19 between 21 December 2021 and 30 September 2022. Outpatient treatment with a recommended antiviral medication was identified within 5 days of diagnosis using national drug codes in outpatient prescription drug claims. Propensity score–matched prevalence ratios (PRs) were used to compare antiviral treatment by pregnancy status.

A total of 412,755 publicly and privately insured patients with COVID-19 were identified, including 33,855 currently pregnant, 2,460 recently pregnant, and 376,440 nonpregnant female patients; 6.8% had a record of antiviral medication use, including 1.3% of pregnant, 5.4% of recently pregnant, and 7.3% of nonpregnant women. Most commonly, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir was administered. The prevalence of antiviral medication use was 67% lower among pregnant patients compared with nonpregnant patients (PR, 0.33 [95% confidence interval, .30–.36]), even among patients with ≥ 1 high-risk medical condition (0.29 [.25–.33]). Antiviral medication use was slightly lower among recently pregnant women with ≥ 1 high-risk medical condition than among nonpregnant women.

### Prescription medications for use in pregnancy-perspective from the US Food and Drug Administration [^1127v51N]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Obstetrical healthcare providers frequently field questions about the safety of medications recommended or prescribed to their pregnant patients. Most women use at least one medication during pregnancy; however, there is little information about the safety or appropriate dosing of many medications during this phase of life. In addition, the development of drugs for use in pregnant women lags behind the development of drugs intended for other sectors of the population. Our goal is to inform the obstetrics community about the US Food and Drug Administration's authority and their role in approving drugs for marketing.

- **Statutes and organization**: We begin with the statutes that led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration and its organization.
- **Drug development and review process**: We then cover drug development and the Food and Drug Administration review process, including the role of the advisory committee.
- **Drug approvals**: The different types of drug approvals are discussed, with some specific examples.
- **Drugs for obstetrics**: Finally, we enumerate the drugs specifically approved for use in obstetrics and contrast them with drugs commonly used by pregnant women and drugs used "off-label" during pregnancy.

The Food and Drug Administration is committed to protecting and advancing the public health of pregnant women by guiding the development and ensuring the availability of effective and safe therapeutics for obstetrical indications and for medical conditions during pregnancy. We hope this review will inspire more research addressing drug use during pregnancy.

### A mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 immunity predicts Paxlovid rebound [^117Fs8Ci]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), an oral antiviral medication targeting SARS-CoV-2, remains an important treatment for COVID-19. Initial studies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were performed in SARS-CoV-2 unvaccinated patients without prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, most individuals have now either been vaccinated and/or have experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. After nirmatrelvir/ritonavir became widely available, reports surfaced of "Paxlovid rebound", a phenomenon in which symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity would initially resolve, but after finishing treatment, symptoms and test positivity would return.

We used a previously described parsimonious mathematical model of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection to model the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in unvaccinated and vaccinated patients. Model simulations show that viral rebound after treatment occurs only in vaccinated patients, while unvaccinated (SARS-CoV-2 naïve) patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir do not experience any rebound in viral load. This work suggests that an approach combining parsimonious models of the immune system could be used to gain important insights in the context of emerging pathogens.

### SPL drug information for atazanavir sulfate [^115iFE2j]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of atazanavir PO (also known as Reyataz) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. It is essential to monitor CD4 counts and plasma HIV RNA. Viral load should be assessed, and neonates should be monitored for hyperbilirubinemia and signs of lactic acidosis. A first trimester ultrasound should be conducted to determine gestational age.

Atazanavir-containing regimens are recommended as alternative treatment options for use in pregnant patients and those trying to conceive. This drug must be administered with ritonavir during pregnancy. No dose adjustment is required during pregnancy with one exception: therapy-experienced patients during the second/third trimester coadministered either an H₂-receptor antagonist or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should receive atazanavir 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg once a day.

No dose adjustment is required postpartum; however, it is crucial to closely monitor for side effects as drug exposures may be higher during the first two months after delivery. The drug atazanavir PO (also known as Reyataz) is classified under category B2 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Assessment of the scope, completeness, and consistency of various drug information resources related to COVID-19 medications in pregnancy and lactation [^113bj4nd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to spread at an accelerated rate globally and poses a significant threat to human health. Global concerns were raised when the first case of COVID-19 was reported, leading to adverse outcomes and increased mortality rates in pregnant women. A woman's physiological and immunological changes during pregnancy predispose her to significant respiratory complications and susceptibility to specific intracellular pathogens. Evidence shows that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 face severe health impacts with a higher risk of pre-eclampsia, low birth weight, preterm birth, and other adverse obstetrical outcomes. Furthermore, critical cases of pregnant women and newborn infants infected with COVID-19 might require intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to manage severe respiratory failure conditions.

Despite remarkable advances in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and lactation, data remain sparse regarding the safe use of COVID-19 medications in this special population. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has not approved any drug therapy interventions or established any as safe and effective for treating COVID-19 during pregnancy and lactation. Many investigational drugs have been used intermittently as required for managing COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and lactation. Therefore, healthcare professionals must be knowledgeable about the adverse outcomes of drugs used in pregnancy and lactation.

Several drug information resources are available for this purpose.

### SPL drug information for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir [^113N1Qpx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir PO (also known as Viekira PAK) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it is advised to avoid use due to evidence of fetal harm in humans. Ribavirin is contraindicated for use during pregnancy (FDA pregnancy risk category X), in females who may become pregnant, or in men whose female partners are pregnant. Patients and their partners are required to use two reliable forms of effective contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices, barrier methods) during treatment and for six months post-therapy. Patients who are not willing to practice strict contraception should not receive treatment with dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and ribavirin. Females must also undergo a pregnancy test prior to the initiation of therapy, monthly during therapy, and for six months post-therapy. The drug ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir PO is classified under category X in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has such a high risk of causing permanent damage to the fetus that it should not be used in pregnancy or when there is a possibility of pregnancy.

### "If I know I am on the pill and I get pregnant, it is an act of God": Women's views on fatalism, agency and pregnancy [^112z5LYQ]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

- **Interviewer**: Do you feel like when it is kind of that time — do you feel like there's anything you can do to prevent a pregnancy sort of when it is your time?

- **Respondent**: Well, of course, I can use birth control or contraceptives, and probably wouldn't get pregnant.

Some women clearly articulated how contraceptives needed to be used to avoid pregnancy but still allowed that fate played a role. Inconsistent contraceptive use and contraceptive failures were often perceived as a gray area where destiny could coexist with control.

"I mean, I play a big part in whether or not I get pregnant, in the sense that it is my choice whether or not to have sex with this person, it is my choice whether or not to protect myself by wearing a condom, it is my — you know, so it is, like, my choice whether I want to go through with it or not, and the ending outcome — I mean, I don't have control over whether or not I get pregnant of course. But I have control over what steps I take. Am I taking my — you know, am I taking my pill regularly? So, there might, God might know. God knows, I don't know. I don't know when I'm meant to have a baby but there are certain steps that I can take to prevent me necessarily having a baby right now".

The above quote shows how agentic beliefs can be nested within fatalistic ones. This respondent related that she has the ability to exert some control over her reproductive outcomes by using contraception, but, ultimately God has control over whether she actually gets pregnant.

In another example of the interplay between fatalism and agency, contraceptive failure was sometimes viewed similarly.

### Pharmacological considerations on the use of antiretrovirals in pregnancy [^114Hf2CX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy reduces the chance of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Physiological changes during pregnancy can lead to lower exposure to antiretrovirals, possibly resulting in virological failure. For most antiretrovirals, data on exposure during pregnancy and transplacental passage are limited. This review summarizes the most recent information on pharmacokinetics, including transplacental passage, efficacy, as well as the safety of antiretrovirals during pregnancy.

- **Recent findings**: Intensive-sampling pharmacokinetic studies, as well as observational studies using sparse sampling, were performed to explore the exposure to antiretrovirals during pregnancy. Transplacental passage, efficacy (viral load at delivery and infection status of the newborn), and safety information were evaluated for several antiretrovirals.

- **Summary**: For most nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, recent research shows decreased exposure during pregnancy. However, the advantage of a general dose increase during pregnancy still remains unclear. For newer compounds and efavirenz, limited or no data on pharmacokinetics during pregnancy or transplacental passage are available, while the mechanisms of transplacental passage also remain unknown. For safety reasons, it will be important to monitor pregnancy outcomes in resource-limited settings during the implementation of the WHO guidelines, including the use of efavirenz during pregnancy.

### Drug safety: Pregnancy rating classifications and controversies [^113wNMsC]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

This contribution consolidates data on international pregnancy rating classifications, including the former U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Swedish, and Australian classification systems, as well as the evidence-based medicine system, and discusses discrepancies among them. It reviews the new Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR) that replaced the former FDA labeling system with narrative-based labeling requirements. PLLR emphasizes human data and highlights pregnancy exposure registry information. In this context, the review discusses important data on the safety of most medications used in the management of skin disease in pregnancy. There are also discussions of controversies relevant to the safety of certain dermatologic medications during gestation.

### Short-term pregnancy outcomes after nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment for mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^114GCaZJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

This descriptive study focuses on pregnant patients who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir therapy from April 16, 2022, through May 18, 2022. Patients were eligible for this treatment if they were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), had symptom onset within five days, did not require oxygen therapy or hospital admission, and had no contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. During the study period, 11 patients were identified as candidates for the treatment. Following a telehealth consultation, all patients agreed to receive nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, with seven patients completing the treatment. All patients who received the treatment experienced symptom resolution without needing additional care. All but one patient tolerated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir without immediate adverse effects, and no adverse fetal or neonatal effects were observed.

### Optimizing pharmacology studies in pregnant and lactating women using lessons from HIV: A consensus statement [^117BB3UD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

- **Infant sampling**: The most objective index of infant exposure to maternal drugs is drug concentration in infant plasma. Repeated dosing of the infant through frequent breastfeeding often results in limited changes in infant plasma concentration during the maternal dosing interval. Therefore, it is generally sufficient to collect 2–3 blood samples during a single dosing interval. Data describing the specific time of feeds and their duration are often difficult to collect and may be unnecessary. Other matrices to consider in assessing infant exposure are urine and intracellular drug concentrations. The use of dried blood spot and dried breastmilk spot as micro-sampling techniques are acceptable if validated assays are available, as reported for some non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors.

- **Estimation of infant dosing**: The preferred metric to describe infant dosing is the relative infant dose, estimated from the drug dose in maternal breastmilk (milk drug concentration multiplied by milk volume, where the average milk volume ingested is set to 150 mL/kg/day) and the usual weight-adjusted therapeutic dose in infants (where available) or adults. However, since the bioavailability of drugs in breastmilk is generally different from other standard vehicles, the relative infant dose should be interpreted with caution.

### Importance of prospective studies in pregnant and breastfeeding women living with human immunodeficiency virus [^111HFQ2d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency issued warnings on the use of dolutegravir and darunavir/cobicistat for treating pregnant women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It took 3–5 years to identify the risks associated with the use of these antiretroviral drugs, during which time pregnant women were exposed to these drugs in clinical care outside of controlled clinical trial settings. Across all antiretroviral drugs, the interval between the registration of new drugs and the availability of the first data on pharmacokinetics and safety in pregnancy is around 6 years.

In this viewpoint, we provide considerations for clinical pharmacology research to ensure safe and effective treatment for pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV and their children. These recommendations will lead to the timelier availability of safety and pharmacokinetic information necessary to develop safe treatment strategies for pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV and are applicable to other chronic disease areas requiring medication during pregnancy.

### Prezista [^115rJoHs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The exposure to total darunavir and ritonavir after intake of Prezista/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily and Prezista/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen was generally lower during pregnancy compared with postpartum.

- **Pregnancy and postpartum exposure**: Due to an increase in the unbound fraction of darunavir during pregnancy compared to postpartum, unbound darunavir exposures were less reduced during pregnancy as compared to postpartum. Exposure reductions during pregnancy were greater for the once daily regimen as compared to the twice daily regimen.

### SPL drug information for sofosbuvir [^113PN4JZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of sofosbuvir PO (also known as Sovaldi) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, there is insufficient evidence. Animal studies have failed to reveal evidence of fetal harm, and there are no controlled data in human pregnancy. Monotherapy is not recommended. In certain patient populations, sofosbuvir must be administered with ribavirin, which is contraindicated during pregnancy (FDA pregnancy risk category X) and in females who may become pregnant. The drug sofosbuvir PO (also known as Sovaldi) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### A comparison of FDA and EMA pregnancy and lactation labeling [^114bPh3t]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). High credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have a robust collaboration and dialogue around the need for data and the inclusion of pregnant and lactating individuals in clinical trials. Despite this collaboration, the two agencies have their own standards for the format and content of labeling for these populations. To understand these differences, the pregnancy and lactation labeling sections for 31 approved drugs were compared. Trends were assessed for language concordance and discordance related to use during pregnancy and lactation between the two agencies. Further analysis evaluated the presence of human data included in the labeling.

The EMA and the FDA had high discordance between pregnancy and lactation labeling language, in 68% and 71% of labeling, respectively. Only 10% of pregnancy labeling and 16% of lactation labeling include human data. Concordance in labeling language is not the norm but occurs when there is a sizeable body of human data, animal data suggesting a particular safety issue, drug mechanism of action information, or disease-specific considerations. This study highlights the need for more human data to inform prescribing decisions in these populations. The results also suggest that there is an opportunity for alignment in labeling across regions.

### SPL drug information for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir [^113HhNNP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir PO (also known as Technive) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir are contraindicated for use in pregnant females and males whose female partners are pregnant if administered in combination with ribavirin. The use of ribavirin may cause birth defects and death of the exposed fetus. Ribavirin therapy also may cause male-mediated teratogenicity and is contraindicated for use during pregnancy (FDA pregnancy risk category X), in females who may become pregnant, or in men whose female partners are pregnant. Studies of ribavirin indicate teratogenic effects, such as malformations of the skull, palate, eye, jaw, limbs, skeleton, and GI tract or embryocidal properties in all of the animal species tested.

Patients and their partners are required to use two reliable forms of effective contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices, barrier methods) during ribavirin treatment and for six months post-therapy. Patients who are not willing to adhere to the strict contraception requirements should not receive treatment with ribavirin. Females must also undergo pregnancy testing prior to initiation of therapy, monthly during therapy, and for six months post-therapy. The drug ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir PO (also known as Technive) is classified under category X in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has such a high risk of causing permanent damage to the fetus that it should not be used in pregnancy or when there is a possibility of pregnancy.

### Optimizing pharmacology studies in pregnant and lactating women using lessons from HIV: A consensus statement [^113xq4a8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). High credibility.

Dapivirine, an NNRTI to be used for preexposure prophylaxis as a 25 mg dapivirine vaginal ring, is expected to be used in lactating women as breastfeeding is supported in countries with a high incidence of HIV. Therefore, breastmilk and maternal concentrations during breastfeeding were assessed in a short course PK study in 16 healthy women. Low dapivirine levels were detectable in both breastmilk and maternal plasma. A terminal half-life of 39 hours in milk and 35.2 hours in plasma was reported, resulting in an estimated infant exposure of 65 ng/kg/day through breastmilk. A study on the safety and drug detection of the dapivirine vaginal ring in breastfeeding mother–infant pairs (NCT04140266) is planned, and a study on the safety of the dapivirine vaginal ring in pregnancy (NCT03965923) is recruiting. The latter study evaluates the maternal and infant safety of two preexposure prophylaxis methods (dapivirine vaginal ring and daily oral Truvada — emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in 750 HIV-uninfected pregnant women and their infants. The primary objectives are the safety of the mother and child, but they also include dapivirine levels in the mother during pregnancy and in the infant after delivery.

For all other new ARVs, to our knowledge, no information on planned pregnancy or lactation studies is available. It is imperative that this population, PLWHIV, be included in planned studies of new agents as described in Figure 3, where optimal timing and steps are proposed. A PK in pregnancy substudy should be part of all studies with participants, which is especially important for long-acting ARVs.

### Efficacy and safety of dolutegravir with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate HIV antiretroviral therapy regimens started in pregnancy (IMPAACT 2010/VESTED): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^117GmQYG]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy is important for both maternal health and the prevention of perinatal HIV-1 transmission; however, adequate data on the safety and efficacy of different ART regimens that are likely to be used by pregnant women are scarce. In this trial, we compared the safety and efficacy of three antiretroviral regimens started in pregnancy: dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

- **Methods**: This multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted at 22 clinical research sites in nine countries (Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, the United States, and Zimbabwe). Pregnant women (aged ≥ 18 years) with confirmed HIV-1 infection and at 14–28 weeks' gestation were eligible. Women who had previously taken antiretrovirals, except for up to 14 days of ART during the pregnancy, were excluded, as were women known to be pregnant with multiple fetuses or those with known fetal anomalies or a history of psychiatric illness. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using a central computerised randomisation system. Randomisation was performed using permuted blocks (size six) stratified by gestational age (14–18, 19–23, and 24–28 weeks' gestation) and country. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg and a once-daily oral fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate.

### Oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir use and clinical outcomes in pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^114VcuEt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

We documented the receipt of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir in 114 pregnant patients, with few associated complications. There were no cases of medication discontinuation from side effects. There were few differences in obstetric complications associated with nirmatrelvir–ritonavir. Notably, in the nirmatrelvir–ritonavir group, there was a significant increase in rates of surgical site infection and preeclampsia. This is one of the largest reports of pregnant individuals taking nirmatrelvir–ritonavir at the time of writing.

A strength of this study is its comparative analysis between those who did and did not receive nirmatrelvir–ritonavir, allowing for assessment of obstetric and COVID-19 outcomes. We cannot rule out differences in reasons for testing or types and severity of symptoms; however, 99.3% of patients had symptoms documented in the medical record. The observed lack of severe disease, indicated by only one COVID-19–related hospital admission, may relate to the high rate of COVID-19 vaccination in the cohort. We are unable to comment on the efficacy of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir in pregnant people without a history of vaccination.

There was an insufficient sample size to evaluate an association between the use of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir and more rare adverse outcomes. We were also unable to perform multivariable modeling to evaluate the association between nirmatrelvir–ritonavir and pregnancy outcomes, given the small number of individuals with the outcomes of interest.

Outpatient administration of oral nirmatrelvir–ritonavir to both unvaccinated and vaccinated symptomatic adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection decreases disease severity, hospitalization, and death. It is recommended for patients at risk for severe disease who present within 5 days of symptom onset, including pregnant individuals. Clinical trials of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir did not include pregnant people, and few reports have documented its use during pregnancy. This report provides information about the safety of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir during pregnancy.

### FDA drug labeling for pregnancy and lactation drug safety monitoring systems [^111wJywQ]. Seminars in Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

The product label required by the FDA for every drug approved for marketing in the US is a legal document that originates with the company that wants to market the drug, but it must be approved by the FDA. Despite the recognized limitations of registries, the FDA's new labeling rule, effective from July 1, 2015, has given the data available from post-marketing surveillance priority in the new label.

For this information to be maximally useful to both providers and consumers, providers must refer as many exposed consumers as possible to the registries, preferably prior to knowledge of the outcomes of the pregnancies. Consumers need to cooperate with the registries to share their health information with as much detail as possible. It will take years to accumulate a meaningful quantity of information in many of the registries, but they promise to be our best hope for useful counseling information in the future.

### Should pregnant women be included in phase IV clinical drug trials [^114kgCBF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Relatively few drugs, especially those recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, have published human pregnancy experience. Although all drugs contain animal reproduction data, these are usually not predictive of human risk. Clinical trials in pregnant women are rarely conducted because of ethical and legal concerns, and it may be many years before sufficient observational data are collected to guide clinical treatment decisions. Because many of these drugs will be used in pregnancy, human data are needed shortly after the drugs come to the market. Lack of human data leads to uncertainty over whether a drug can be safely prescribed for a pregnant patient. Unless there are compelling scientific and ethical reasons to exclude them, pregnant women should be included in phase IV clinical trials (postmarketing studies to obtain additional information, including the risks, benefits, and optimal use of a drug). This paper examines how physicians currently counsel pregnant women when there are no human data and proposes an alternative method in which knowledge regarding risks associated with the use of drugs during pregnancy can be enhanced in a clinical trial setting.

### Availability of safe and effective therapeutic options to pregnant and lactating individuals following the United States Food and Drug Administration Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule [^115ar8nT]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

To explore the extent and type of pregnancy and lactation data of newly approved prescription drugs, this study assessed whether the presented recommendations are data-driven, as required by the US Food and Drug Administration Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule implemented in 2015.

In this descriptive analysis, we reviewed pregnancy and lactation data of all new molecular entities approved between 2001 and 2020 in their most updated labeling. Information was collected regarding pregnancy and lactation risk statements, the source of pregnancy and lactation data, and the design and methods of pregnancy and lactation studies in the labeling.

Of the 422 new molecular entities, the key advisory statement for use of 133 (32%) drugs in pregnancy and 194 (46%) drugs in lactation were classified as "against use". Less than 2% of all drugs had a key advisory statement that supported their use during pregnancy or lactation. The sources of data regarding use in pregnancy were studies in humans and animals in 46 (11%) and 348 (82%) drugs, respectively. For use during lactation, data included studies in humans and animals in 23 (5%) and 251 (59%) drugs, respectively. The key advisory recommendation was consistent with the available human information in 4 (8%) drugs in pregnancy and 3 (13%) drugs in lactation.

Prescription drug labeling contains limited data to support informed decision-making for the use of prescription drugs during pregnancy and lactation. Close collaboration among stakeholders is required to enhance the availability of data in this population.

### Elzonris [^111AaH8Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy**: Based on its mechanism of action, Elzonris has the potential for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available data on Elzonris use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Animal reproduction or developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with tagraxofusp-erzs. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus.

	- The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4%, and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Lactation**: No data are available regarding the presence of Elzonris in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children from Elzonris, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose.

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**: Based on its mechanism of action, Elzonris may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

	- **Pregnancy testing**: Conduct pregnancy testing in females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating Elzonris treatment.

	- **Contraception**: Advise females to use acceptable contraceptive methods during Elzonris treatment.

### Veklury [^115LLaEX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Available data from a clinical trial (IMPAACT 2032), published reports, the COVID-PR pregnancy exposure registry, and compassionate use of remdesivir in pregnant individuals have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes following exposure in the second and third trimester. However, there are insufficient pregnancy data available to evaluate the risk of remdesivir exposure during the first trimester. A study evaluating the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir during pregnancy demonstrated no clinically relevant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant individuals. No dose adjustments are recommended in patients who receive Veklury during pregnancy [see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies, remdesivir demonstrated no adverse effect on embryo-fetal development when administered to pregnant animals at systemic exposures (AUC) of the predominant circulating metabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) that were four times (rats and rabbits) the exposure in humans at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data]. There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to…

### Low nirmatrelvir and ritonavir exposure through breastmilk: Analyzing milk concentrations and infant risk [^115E2aV5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). High credibility.

This research study investigates the intricate relationship among COVID-19, maternal and infant health, and breastfeeding practices, with a specific focus on assessing the transfer of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir into human milk. Our aim is to provide critical insights to those managing COVID-19 treatment in lactating individuals. The InfantRisk Center Human Milk Biorepository contained human milk and corresponding health information for eight mother-infant dyads exposed to standard doses of maternal nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (300 mg nirmatrelvir and 100 mg ritonavir taken orally twice daily for 5 days).

The primary outcomes measured were drug levels in milk using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and reporting the tolerance of the breastfed infant. Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir was measurable in all participants at a mean concentration of 33.48 ng/mL (ritonavir) and 729 ng/mL (nirmatrelvir). The estimated infant dose via milk was 0.0024 mg/kg/12h (ritonavir) and 0.054 mg/kg/12h (nirmatrelvir). The estimated relative infant dose was 0.19% (ritonavir) and 1.43% (nirmatrelvir), well under the standard 10% safety threshold. Among the eight infants exposed in this study, there were no reported adverse events.

Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir is the recommended treatment for ambulatory COVID-19 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection at high risk for progression to severe disease. Although its use is recommended in lactating women, there are no previous studies on the transfer of nirmatrelvir into human milk. The study findings endorse the approach of using nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in this context.

### Importance of prospective studies in pregnant and breastfeeding women living with human immunodeficiency virus [^11791Fe3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

In May and June 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued warnings on the use of the antiretroviral agents dolutegravir and darunavir/cobicistat for the treatment of pregnant women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A large observational study detected a 0.9% risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in infants delivered by women receiving dolutegravir around conception or early in the first trimester of pregnancy. This was considered a substantial risk relative to 0.1% NTDs observed with other antiretrovirals. This observation led to a recommendation that dolutegravir should only be used in adolescent girls and women of childbearing potential together with consistent and reliable contraception.

Use of the darunavir/cobicistat combination in pregnancy was associated with an average reduction in plasma darunavir concentrations of approximately 50% in pregnancy compared to postpartum, with concentrations in some individual pregnant women reduced by as much as 90%. Low darunavir exposure has been associated with an increased risk of treatment failure and may therefore increase the risk of HIV transmission to the infant. Cobicistat and ritonavir levels decrease by approximately 50%–60% during pregnancy, possibly leading to a reduced boosting effect. In the case of boosting with cobicistat, this led to a 50% reduction of darunavir exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) and an 89% reduction of darunavir minimum concentration (C_min), whereas the reductions in darunavir exposure and C_min when boosted with ritonavir were less remarked.

### Review of pregnancy labeling of prescription drugs: Is the current system adequate to inform of risks [^115BJfzH]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine designed to guide benefit/risk drug therapy decisions does not exist for pregnant women. Typically, studies are conducted in animals, which may not accurately reflect human benefits and risks. The human studies that do exist are limited and tend to show only an "association" between a particular drug therapy and an undesirable effect. This review outlines the challenges associated with assessing the benefits and risks of drug therapy during pregnancy, the history of the FDA regulations for labeling prescription drugs, and the strengths and weaknesses of the FDA pregnancy labeling system. Proposed changes to the system are also reviewed.

### Paxlovid [^11518f14]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Paxlovid consists of nirmatrelvir tablets co-packaged with ritonavir tablets. There are three distinct dosage packs available:

- **Paxlovid for oral use 300 mg;100 mg**: Co-packaged nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. For further details, see dosage and administration (2.2).
- **Paxlovid for oral use 150 mg;100 mg**: Designed for patients with moderate renal impairment. See dosage and administration (2.3).
- **Paxlovid for oral use - day 1 (300 mg;100 mg) and days 2–5 (150 mg;100 mg)**: Tailored for patients with severe renal impairment. Refer to dosage and administration (2.3).

It is critical that nirmatrelvir is co-administered with ritonavir. Failure to do so may result in nirmatrelvir plasma levels that are insufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.

Prescriptions must specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within Paxlovid. Completing the full 5-day treatment course and continuing isolation in accordance with public health recommendations are crucial to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: Workshop summary [^113tN6cY]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

The expert panel's recommendations for clinical care

Clinicians and patients must make decisions incorporating the available data on the maternal, fetal, and neonatal impact of disease; drug pharmacokinetics; maternal and neonatal safety; limitations of the data sources; and guidelines from scientific bodies if they exist. Panelists used examples of commonly used drugs such as acetaminophen, pseudoephedrine, and antihypertensive agents to illustrate the risk-benefit analysis undertaken to inform clinical practice.

When clinicians utilize any drug or counsel women about OTC medications, there needs to be a risk-benefit analysis. When there are multiple options, the drug with the most favorable benefit-risk ratio is utilized when considering the health of both the mother and her baby. There should be readily accessible information on drugs, which addresses the critical components needed to make clinical decisions for clinicians to apply this risk-benefit analysis. In the last 30 years, providers have relied heavily on the FDA's pregnancy labeling that classified drugs as A, B, C, D, and X. However, these categories were vague and often misleading. As of June 2015, all new medications approved by the FDA have a new pregnancy label. This label includes a narrative section with a risk summary, clinical considerations, and supporting data. A section on lactation provides data on the neonatal effects of the drug. In addition, the existence of drug registries is displayed. While the new label should represent a vast improvement in providing useful information, most drugs will no… (Note: The text is incomplete)

### Assessment of the scope, completeness, and consistency of various drug information resources related to COVID-19 medications in pregnancy and lactation [^111b2wuP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Drug use in pregnancy and lactation is challenging, especially in women with critical clinical conditions such as COVID-19, due to inconsistent drug safety data. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate various drug information resources for the scope, completeness, and consistency of COVID-19 medication information in pregnancy and lactation.

- **Methods**: Data related to COVID-19 medications from various drug information resources such as text references, subscription databases, and free online tools were used for comparison. The aggregated data were analyzed for scope, completeness, and consistency.

- **Results**: Scope scores were highest for Portable Electronic Physician Information Database (PEPID), Up-to-date, and drugs.com compared to other resources. The overall completeness scores were higher for Micromedex and drugs.com (p < 0.05) when compared to all other resources. The inter-reliability analysis for overall components by Fleiss kappa among all the resources was found to be 'slight' (k < 0.20, p < 0.0001). Information related to older drugs in most resources provides in-depth details on various components such as pregnancy safety, clinical data related to lactation, the effect of drug distribution into breast milk, reproductive potential/infertility risk, and pregnancy category/recommendations. However, information related to these components for newer drugs was superficial and incomplete, with insufficient data and inconclusive evidence, which is statistically significant.

### Rationale and design for an investigation to optimize selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment for pregnant women with depression [^116P8ApR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

The physiological changes of pregnancy can affect the pharmacokinetics of a drug, thereby affecting its dose requirements. Because pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in pregnant women have rarely been conducted, evidence-based dosing adjustments are seldom available. In particular, despite the fact that the use of antidepressants has become increasingly common, pregnancy-associated PK changes of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are largely unknown.

### FDA's proposed rule for pregnancy and lactation labeling: Improving maternal child health through well-informed medicine use [^117NhSej]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

For the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the May 29, 2008, publication of the Proposed Rule for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products heralded both an end and a beginning. It marked an end to the labeling initiative process that produced the Proposed Rule and the beginning of FDA's second-generation approach to labeling drugs and biologics for use during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and the childbearing years. These proposed changes reflect the extensive input and feedback FDA collected from clinicians and experts, and are designed to facilitate informed counseling about and prescribing of medicines for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or of childbearing potential.

The prescription drug label is FDA's communication tool — it is the place to clearly convey what is known about the safe and effective use of a drug in various populations. With the development and implementation of the Physician Labeling Rule (PLR), FDA transformed the prescription drug label into a better communication tool in which information is better organized, clearly presented, and more easily located. The Proposed Rule for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling is the final piece of PLR, creating a detailed and defined framework in which to present what is and is not known about the use of drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### SPL drug information for indinavir sulfate [^111VHHZP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of indinavir sulfate PO (also known as Crixivan) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. Monitor CD4 counts and plasma HIV RNA; viral load should be assessed. Perform standard glucose screening and monitor neonates for hyperbilirubinemia. A second trimester ultrasound can be used for both anatomical survey and determination of gestational age, while a first trimester ultrasound is used for gestational age. Antiretroviral therapy should be provided to all women during pregnancy, regardless of HIV RNA concentrations or CD4 cell count. Using highly active antiretroviral combination therapy (HAART) to maximally suppress viral replication is the most effective strategy to prevent the development of resistance and to minimize the risk of perinatal transmission. The drug indinavir sulfate PO (also known as Crixivan) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Juluca [^115KbPBg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Rilpivirine: Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 870 exposures to rilpivirine-containing regimens during pregnancy, resulting in live births (including over 660 exposed during the first trimester and over 210 exposed in the second/third trimester), there was no significant difference between the overall risk of birth defects for rilpivirine compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 2.1% (95% CI: 1.1% to 3.5%) and 0.9% (95% CI: 0.1% to 3.4%) following first and second/third trimester exposure, respectively, to rilpivirine-containing regimens.

Rilpivirine in combination with a background regimen was evaluated in a clinical trial of 19 HIV-1–infected pregnant subjects during the second and third trimesters and postpartum. Each of the subjects was on a rilpivirine-based regimen at the time of enrollment. Twelve subjects completed the trial through the postpartum period (6 to 12 weeks after delivery), and pregnancy outcomes are missing for six subjects. The exposure levels (C₀h and AUC) of total rilpivirine were approximately 30% to 40% lower during pregnancy compared with postpartum (6 to 12 weeks). The protein binding of rilpivirine was similar (> 99%) during the second trimester, third trimester, and the postpartum period [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. One subject discontinued the trial following fetal death at 25 weeks' gestation due to suspected premature rupture of membranes. Among the 12 subjects who were virologically suppressed at baseline (less than 50 copies/ml), the treatment appeared effective.

### Covid-19 antiviral medication use among pregnant and recently pregnant US outpatients [^114iGiSw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Pregnant individuals are at risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated complications. It is not recommended to withhold treatment from pregnant patients; however, little is known about the frequency of antiviral medication use during pregnancy.

- **Methods**: Using Medicaid and commercial insurance databases, a national claims-based cohort study was constructed. This included pregnant, recently pregnant, and nonpregnant female patients aged 18–49 years old, diagnosed with COVID-19 on an outpatient basis between December 21, 2021, and September 30, 2022. Outpatient treatment with a recommended antiviral medication was identified within five days of diagnosis using national drug codes in outpatient prescription drug claims. Propensity score-matched prevalence ratios (PRs) compared antiviral treatment by pregnancy status.

- **Results**: A total of 412,755 publicly and privately insured patients with COVID-19 were identified, including 33,855 who were currently pregnant, 2,460 recently pregnant, and 376,440 nonpregnant female patients; 6.8% had a record of antiviral medication use, including 1.3% of pregnant, 5.4% of recently pregnant, and 7.3% of nonpregnant women. Most commonly, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir was administered. The prevalence of antiviral medication use was 67% lower among pregnant patients compared with nonpregnant patients (PR, 0.33 [95% confidence interval, .30-.36]), even among patients with ≥ 1 high-risk medical condition (0.29 [.25-.33]). Antiviral medication use was slightly lower among recently pregnant women with ≥ 1 high-risk medical condition than among nonpregnant women.

### Prezista [^112AJqj2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Human data

Prezista/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily) in combination with a background regimen was evaluated in a clinical trial of 36 pregnant women during the second and third trimesters, and postpartum. Eighteen subjects were enrolled in each BID and QD treatment arms. Twenty-nine subjects completed the trial through the postpartum period (6–12 weeks after delivery), and 7 subjects discontinued before trial completion, 5 subjects in the BID arm and 2 subjects in the QD arm.

The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that exposure to darunavir and ritonavir as part of an antiretroviral regimen was lower during pregnancy compared with postpartum (6–12 weeks). Exposure reductions during pregnancy were greater for the once-daily regimen as compared to the twice-daily regimen [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Virologic response was preserved. In the BID arm, the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL were 39% (7/18) at baseline, 61% (11/18) through the third trimester visit, and 61% (11/18) through the 6–12 week postpartum visit. Virologic outcomes during the third trimester visit showed HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL for 11% (2/18) of subjects and were missing for 5 subjects (1 subject discontinued prematurely due to virologic failure). In the QD arm, the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL were 61% (11/18) at baseline, 83% (15/18) through the third trimester visit, and 78% (14/18) through the 6–12 week postpartum visit. Virologic outcomes during the third trimester visit showed HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL for none of the subjects.

### Comparative safety of antiretroviral treatment regimens in pregnancy [^115bP3K6]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Maternal antiretroviral treatment (ART) started before conception may increase the risk for adverse birth outcomes among women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but whether the risk differs by ART regimen is unknown.

- **Objective**: To compare the risk for selected birth outcomes by maternal ART regimen.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This observational birth outcomes surveillance study compared all live births and stillbirths with a gestational age of at least 24 weeks in eight geographically dispersed government hospitals throughout Botswana (approximately 45% of births nationwide). Data were collected from August 15, 2014, through August 15, 2016.

- **Exposures**: Births among HIV-infected women who started 3-drug ART regimens before their last menstrual period and did not switch or stop ART in pregnancy were considered to be ART exposed from conception.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes were any adverse birth outcome, including stillbirth, preterm birth (< 37 weeks), small size for gestational age (SGA; < 10th percentile of weight for gestational age), or neonatal death (< 28 days from delivery), and any severe adverse outcome, including very preterm birth (< 32 weeks), very SGA (< 3rd percentile of weight for gestational age), stillbirth, and neonatal death.

- **Results**: Information was available for 47,027 of 47,124 births (99.8%) at surveillance maternity hospitals (mean [SD] age of mothers, 26.86 [6.45] years). Among 11,932 HIV-exposed infants, 5,780 (48.4%) were ART exposed from conception. Adverse birth outcomes were more common among HI

### SPL drug information for darunavir ethanolate [^114ZfAWW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of darunavir ethanolate PO (also known as Prezista) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it is generally acceptable for use. The recommended dosage is 600 mg PO BID. Consider using 800 mg PO once daily in patients already stable on that dose before pregnancy. The drug darunavir ethanolate PO is classified under category B2 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but the available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### SPL drug information for saquinavir mesylate [^114k4BQv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of saquinavir PO (also known as Invirase) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Monitor CD4 counts and plasma HIV RNA; viral load should be assessed. Perform standard glucose screening. A first-trimester ultrasound is recommended for gestational age assessment. A second-trimester ultrasound can be used for both anatomical survey and determination of gestational age. Antiretroviral therapy should be provided to all patients during pregnancy, regardless of HIV RNA concentrations or CD4 cell count.

Using highly active antiretroviral combination therapy (HAART) to maximally suppress viral replication is the most effective strategy to prevent the development of resistance and minimize the risk of perinatal transmission. Begin HAART as soon as pregnancy is recognized or HIV is diagnosed. HIV guidelines recommend against the use of saquinavir-containing regimens during pregnancy. According to the guidelines, patients who become pregnant while taking saquinavir should be switched to an alternative treatment regimen.

Saquinavir PO (also known as Invirase) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage.
