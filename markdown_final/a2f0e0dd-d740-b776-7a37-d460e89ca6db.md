## Question

What antibiotics should you use for urosepsis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what antibiotics to use for urosepsis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate sepsis priorities and the time-to-antibiotics target. Then, I should verify which empiric parenteral regimens are recommended and why. Next, I will consider patient-specific risk factors that modify empiric choices, including prior cultures, allergies, and local resistance. After that, I need to check source control requirements and how they intersect with antibiotics. Finally, I will review de-escalation, duration, and special scenarios like ESBL or MRSA risk, and close with a concise, actionable summary anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the sepsis-first principle and timing. Urosepsis is a time-critical emergency; administer parenteral high-dose broad-spectrum antimicrobials within the first hour after recognizing sepsis, and do not delay for cultures, while still obtaining urine and two sets of blood cultures before antibiotics if this does not cause a meaningful delay [^7f7d95df] [^44832188] [^9a9ca191] [^d94fa974].

> Wait, let me verify the empiric regimens for sepsis due to complicated UTI. IDSA and EAU converge on third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones as initial options, with the choice tailored to severity, local epidemiology, and patient-specific risks; newer agents like cefiderocol or plazomicin are not recommended for empiric therapy in this setting, and aminoglycosides are generally avoided initially due to nephrotoxicity and inferior tissue penetration despite historical use in some summaries [^cd8ef029] [^6e983245] [^aced2141] [^a4f83f4e].

> Hold on, I should verify how to individualize empiric therapy. I need to check prior urine cultures to avoid agents with prior resistance, avoid fluoroquinolones if there was exposure in the past 12 months given resistance risk, and account for allergies, drug–drug interactions, and renal function; in sepsis, if a local antibiogram is available, consider selecting an agent with ≥ 90% susceptibility for septic shock or ≥ 80% for sepsis without shock to mitigate mortality risk from inappropriate empiric therapy [^a1cd4853] [^e76ae852] [^21bec297] [^25bb8edc] [^cc6759dd].

> I need to ensure I address source control because antibiotics alone are insufficient. Prompt relief of obstruction or drainage of abscesses is essential; in obstructive urosepsis from stones, early decompression with percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteral stenting reduces morbidity and mortality, and any foreign body such as an indwelling catheter should be removed or exchanged when feasible [^54f13156] [^5d237d8c] [^41b4985c].

> Next, I should review de-escalation and duration once cultures return and the patient stabilizes. Adapt therapy to culture and susceptibility results as soon as possible, and transition to oral therapy when clinically improving, hemodynamically stable, and an effective oral option exists; for bacteremic cUTI or pyelonephritis, 7 days total is reasonable if improving, whereas non-bacteremic cUTI can often be treated for 5–7 days, with longer durations reserved for slow response or prostatic involvement; in sepsis, total duration is counted from the first day of effective therapy, and shorter validated courses are acceptable with good clinical response and source control [^d5af9d6d] [^01e3d2cb] [^2e391f2e] [^fc1d9dae] [^dd9942a8].

> But wait, what if ESBL-producing Enterobacterales are suspected or confirmed. I should double-check the preferred approach: TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred if susceptible, with carbapenems reserved when resistance or toxicity preclude those options; piperacillin-tazobactam may be noninferior in some contexts, yet IDSA leans toward carbapenems in severe ESBL infections, so if I started piperacillin-tazobactam empirically and the patient is improving, I should reassess based on susceptibilities and clinical trajectory [^868445cc] [^7159bc0f].

> I will now examine special pathogens and coverage nuances. If there is concern for Pseudomonas, enterococci, or MRSA — often signaled by healthcare exposure, prior colonization, or severe immunocompromise — broaden empiric therapy accordingly with agents active against those organisms, then de-escalate once cultures clarify; for suspected MRSA, add vancomycin or linezolid initially and stop if cultures are negative [^cd8ef029] [^6e983245].

> Let me reconsider pediatric and other special populations briefly. Children with cUTI and sepsis generally require initial IV broad-spectrum therapy with early reassessment at 48 hours, with imaging to evaluate for obstruction or abscess if there is no timely improvement; durations are individualized, but the principles of early IV therapy, culture-directed de-escalation, and shortest effective course apply [^d49b6f40] [^e8c912dd].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought aminoglycosides might be a first-line empiric option for urosepsis because older summaries list them, but I should correct that. Contemporary IDSA guidance prioritizes beta-lactams, carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones for empiric therapy in sepsis due to complicated UTI, reserving aminoglycosides for select scenarios or as adjuncts given nephrotoxicity and limited tissue penetration, so I should not default to aminoglycoside monotherapy up front in unstable patients [^cd8ef029] [^6e983245].

> To synthesize, I should confirm the practical algorithm: within 1 hour of recognition, obtain cultures and start IV broad-spectrum therapy such as ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or a fluoroquinolone, chosen based on severity, prior cultures, local resistance, and allergies; pursue urgent source control for obstruction or abscess; de-escalate to culture-directed therapy within 48–72 hours; transition to oral therapy when stable; and treat for a total of about 7 days for bacteremic cUTI or 5–7 days for non-bacteremic cUTI, extending only if response is slow or prostatic disease is present, with all durations counted from the first day of effective therapy [^7f7d95df] [^cd8ef029] [^2e391f2e] [^fc1d9dae].

---

For urosepsis, start **parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour** [^7f7d95df] of recognition, ideally after obtaining urine and blood cultures [^9a9ca191] [^d94fa974]. Use a **third-generation cephalosporin** (ceftriaxone or cefepime) [^aced2141] or piperacillin-tazobactam [^6e983245]; add an aminoglycoside (gentamicin or amikacin) [^68d4e015] if resistance is suspected or the patient is critically ill. If ESBL-producing organisms are likely, use a carbapenem (ertapenem or meropenem) [^868445cc]. Adjust therapy to culture results [^d5af9d6d] and continue for 7–14 days, typically 7 days if the patient improves quickly and 10–14 days for slow response or complications [^fc1d9dae] [^dd9942a8]. Early **source control** (relief of obstruction or drainage) is essential [^54f13156] [^41b4985c].

---

## Initial empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should cover **Gram-negative rods** (especially E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas) and consider local resistance patterns [^cc6759dd]. Recommended regimens include:

| **Antibiotic regimen** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone, cefepime) | - First-line for most patients <br/> - Covers common uropathogens [^aced2141] |
| Piperacillin-tazobactam | - Broad coverage <br/> - Including Pseudomonas [^6e983245] |
| Carbapenem (ertapenem, meropenem) | - Suspected ESBL-producing organisms <br/> - Or severe sepsis/septic shock [^868445cc] |
| Aminoglycoside (gentamicin, amikacin) | Add if resistance suspected or patient is critically ill [^68d4e015] |

---

## Adjustment of antibiotic therapy

Adjust therapy based on **culture and susceptibility results** [^d5af9d6d] to the narrowest effective agent. Discontinue unnecessary coverage to reduce toxicity and resistance [^5165eba0].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

- **Typical duration**: 7–14 days, individualized to clinical response and complications [^fc1d9dae].
- **Shorter course**: 7 days if the patient improves rapidly and there are no complications [^dd9942a8].
- **Longer course**: 10–14 days for slow response, persistent bacteremia, or complications (e.g. abscess, prostatitis) [^e8b20eae].

---

## Adjunctive measures

Early **source control** — relief of obstruction, drainage of abscesses, or removal of infected devices — is critical to outcomes [^54f13156] [^41b4985c]. Supportive care with fluids, vasopressors, and close monitoring is essential [^e99613d8].

---

## Special considerations

- **ESBL-producing organisms**: Carbapenems are preferred; piperacillin-tazobactam is an alternative if susceptibility is confirmed [^868445cc] [^7159bc0f].
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Avoid empirically due to rising resistance and safety concerns; reserve for susceptible cases [^21bec297] [^0517785e].
- **Pediatric patients**: Use ampicillin plus aminoglycoside or a third-generation cephalosporin; adjust based on local resistance and clinical response [^d49b6f40].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Start broad-spectrum IV antibiotics within 1 hour** of recognition [^7f7d95df].
- **Use ceftriaxone, cefepime, or piperacillin-tazobactam** as first-line; add an aminoglycoside if needed [^aced2141] [^6e983245].
- **Use carbapenems for suspected ESBL or severe sepsis** [^868445cc].
- **Adjust to culture results and continue 7–14 days**, tailoring to response [^d5af9d6d] [^fc1d9dae].
- **Perform early source control** and provide supportive care [^54f13156] [^e99613d8].

---

Effective urosepsis management requires **rapid empiric therapy**, **early source control**, and **culture-guided de-escalation** to optimize outcomes and limit resistance.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

### Prostatitis [^0a5c8219]. Canadian Urological Association Journal = Journal de L'Association des Urologues du Canada (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial prostatitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, CUA 2011 guidelines recommend to administer IV high-dose aminoglycosides in combination with ampicillin, a broad spectrum penicillin in combination with a β-lactamase inhibitor, a third-generation cephalosporin, or a fluoroquinolone in patients with severe symptomatic febrile acute bacterial prostatitis until defeverescence and normalization of associated urosepsis. Switch to outpatient oral fluoroquinolones for 2–4 weeks following resolution of severe infection and for less severely ill patients.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^fc1d9dae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Epidemiology, definition and treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^d7c95956]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2020). High credibility.

UTIs are amongst the most frequent bacterial infections. However, the clinical phenotypes of UTI are heterogeneous and range from rather benign, uncomplicated infections to complicated UTIs (cUTIs), pyelonephritis and severe urosepsis. Stratification of patients with UTIs is, therefore, important. Several classification systems exist for the description and classification of UTIs, with the common rationale that cUTIs have a higher risk of recurrence or chronification, progression or severe outcome than uncomplicated UTIs. The pathophysiology and treatment of cUTIs and pyelonephritis are driven more by host factors than by pathogen attributes. cUTIs and pyelonephritis are associated with high antimicrobial resistance rates among causative pathogens. However, antimicrobial resistance rates can differ substantially, depending on the population being studied and whether the data being analysed are from surveillance studies, registry data or interventional studies, in which specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are used for patient selection. For example, antibiotic resistance rates are higher in patients with urosepsis than in those with less severe infections. Thus, treatment outcomes differ substantially among studies, ranging from 50% to almost 100% clearance of infection, depending on the patient population analysed, the UTI entities included and the primary outcome of the study. Pyelonephritis and cUTIs have emerged as infection models for the study of novel antibiotics, including extensive investigation of novel substances active against Gram-negative bacteria.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^6b5df6c0]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF research needs and gaps for asymptomatic bacteriuria — priority evidence deficits — highlight the absence of harm studies in nonpregnant adults, limited data on serious outcomes in modern pregnancy, and the need to understand microbiome and antibiotic effects. No studies were identified that addressed the harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults. There were few studies that examined asymptomatic bacteriuria and risk of serious outcomes (eg, pyelonephritis or urosepsis) in modern pregnant populations, epidemiologic evidence suggests that the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria has been lower in recent decades and many antibiotics used in older studies are no longer recommended for use in pregnancy, and clinical trials, observational studies, and natural experiments where screening and treatment are not the standard of care or guidelines are changing would be useful. Newer understandings of the human microbiome suggest that bacterial colonization may play a protective role in both mothers and babies, and for pregnant and nonpregnant populations research is needed to better understand the microbiology of a healthy urinary tract and the natural history of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The role of current patterns of antibiotic use is unclear; antibiotic use increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance and can change the microbiome, and more research is needed to understand potential harms and effects on newborn, child, and longer-term health.

Background and Objective

Urological infections significantly impact the wellbeing and quality of life of individuals owing to their widespread occurrence and diverse clinical manifestations. The objective of the guidelines panel was to provide evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and male accessory-gland infections, while addressing crucial public health aspects related to infection control and antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

For the 2024 guidelines on urological infections, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of a thorough medical history and physical examination for patients with urological infections. The guidelines stress the role of antimicrobial stewardship to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance, providing recommendations for antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration on the basis of the latest evidence.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

This overview of the 2024 EAU guidelines offers valuable insights into managing urological infections and are designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology has issued an updated guideline on urological infections. The guidelines provide recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, with a particular focus on minimising antibiotic use because of the increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e8b20eae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics (guidance for selection), IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider avoiding antibiotics for patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis, to which a resistant pathogen has been previously isolated from the urine.
Use more recent urine cultures as a better guide than more distant urine cultures.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^72f58a6d]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### An update on classification and management of urosepsis [^a7594ac9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The urinary tract is the infection site in severe sepsis/septic shock in 10–30%.

Recent Findings

There is a new Sepsis definition focusing on severe sepsis. Urosepsis is mainly due to obstructed uropathy of the upper urinary tract. The pathogenesis of sepsis is complex and is driven by the innate immune system. In the further course immunosuppression is developing. Management of urosepsis includes early diagnosis, early initiation of treatment such as identification and control of the complicating factor in the urinary tract and the specific sepsis therapy. As part of early diagnosis the value of the new defining criteria is still to be known. The management bundles are regularly updated according to the surviving sepsis campaign guidelines.

Summary

Sepsis has still a high morbidity and mortality rate. Although definition and diagnosis of sepsis has been recently updated, its translation into urosepsis management requires validation.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^5311e3c1]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^2e391f2e]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — recent antibiotic class exposure: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding fluoroquinolones if the patient has been exposed to that class of antibiotic in the past 12 months (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Sepsis associated with urinary tract infection… [^41b4985c]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Urosepsis is mostly induced by nosocomial gram-negative organisms. It is an infection that is difficult to treat and has high mortality, especially when associated with septic shock. For obstructive urosepsis, which occurs mostly after an acute stone occlusion of the upper urinary tract in pyelonephritis, intensive systemic medical therapy and drainage of the septic kidney are necessary. For non-obstructive urosepsis, which is mostly an iatrogenic complication of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures on the genitourinary tract, the same intensive medical care and urinary drainage are adequate. Systemic therapy in the treatment of urosepsis encompasses several disorders. Specific pathogenic mechanisms of shock, including failure of the microcirculation, hemostatic disorders, and microbiological problems, have to be considered in the systemic treatment of urosepsis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy may triple chances of survival.

In this connection, piperacillin was successfully used in 30 patients with urosepsis treated at our institution. Tunn UW, Thieme H. Sepsis Associated With Urinary Tract Infection: Antibiotic Treatment With Piperacillin. Arch Intern Med. 1982; 142: 2035–2038.

### Guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infections: evaluation of methodological quality using the appraisal of guidelines, research and evaluation II instrument [^c10af6fc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Reliance on evidence-based medicine requires high methodological standards from guideline developers. We sought to determine the methodological quality of guidelines on pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs). We included guidelines published by national or international committees in the last 10 years providing recommendations for antibiotic type or duration. We applied the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II checklist, adding under each item the specific focus relevant to bacterial infections, addressing antibiotic resistance and local epidemiology. Three assessors scored each guideline independently. Mean aggregated scores, converted to percentage per domain, are presented. We included 13 guidelines on the treatment of pneumonia and seven guidelines for the treatment of UTI. 'Scope and purpose' scored 69.4% for pneumonia and 71.4% for UTI. Guidelines were downgraded for lack of an epidemiological overview relevant to intended users. 'Stakeholder involvement' scored 39.5% for pneumonia and 44.5% UTI, with the major fault being lack of patient consultation. 'Rigour of development' scored 42.8% for pneumonia and 56.9% for UTI. Commonly, the search process lacked precision, no risk of bias assessment was performed, outcomes in primary studies were not critically assessed or used to direct recommendations, and there was no formal methodology for formulating recommendations. 'Clarity of presentation' scored highest: 67.7% for pneumonia and 68.5% for UTI. 'Applicability' of the guidelines in antibiotic stewardship programmes was usually not addressed: 16.9% and 25.4%, respectively. 'Editorial independence' scored 30.6% for pneumonia and 55.6% for UTI. Formal examination of guidelines in infectious diseases showed worrying findings related to core methodology and potential bias caused by competing interests.

### A randomized trial of catheter change and short course of antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in catheterized ICU patients [^6e510bab]. Intensive Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect on the occurrence of urosepsis of a treatment with a short course of antibiotics and indwelling urethral catheter replacement in clinically asymptomatic intensive care unit (ICU) patients with a positive urine culture occurring at least 48 h after catheterization.

Methods

A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in the medico-surgical ICU of a tertiary care centre. Sixty patients hospitalized in the ICU with an indwelling urethral catheter for longer than 48 h developing an asymptomatic positive urine culture were randomized to receive either a 3-day course of antibiotics associated with the replacement of the indwelling urethral catheter 4 h after first antibiotic administration or no antibiotics, no catheter replacement (standard of care).

Results

Three patients in each group developed urosepsis (P = 0.1). There were no significant differences in duration of mechanical ventilation between the study group and the standard of care group (9 [4–20] days vs 5 [2–15] days, P = 0.2), in duration of urinary catheterization (22 [11–40] days vs 18 [14–33] days, P = 0.8), or in length of ICU stay (28 [13–46] vs 19 [15–34], P = 0.6). The recurrence of positive urine culture at days 7 and 15 was not affected by the randomization (P = 0.1). The profile of bacterial resistance was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Treating a positive urine culture in an asymptomatic patient with an indwelling urethral catheter does not reduce the occurrence of urosepsis in the medico-surgical ICU.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^283966fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Endoscopic stone surgery: minimizing the risk of post-operative sepsis [^eb47a8f5]. Current Opinion in Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urosepsis from manipulation of the urinary tract during stone surgery can be catastrophic despite antibiotic prophylaxis and sterile pre-operative urine. We have reviewed recent literature with regards to pathogenesis, predictors of infected stones and prevention of urosepsis.

Recent Findings

Bladder urine culture has been found to correlate poorly with infection in the upper urinary tract, defined by either stone or pelvic urine culture. This specimen, which has been the cornerstone in pre-operative preparation of patients, does not predict urosepsis. Authors recommending routine stone culture found that the presence of infected stones is highly predictive of potential sepsis. Terminology for systemic infection has been standardized and used in recent literature to define urosepsis.

Summary

Recent studies have recommended changes in the approach to the peri-operative management of stone surgery. Predictors of potential sepsis have also been identified.

### The antibiotic strategies during percutaneous nephrolithotomy in China revealed the gap between the reality and the urological guidelines [^d32f987f]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is widely and successfully used in the management of patients with upper urinary tract stones, infection complications, especially urosepsis is still catastrophic and associated with significant morbidity. According to the guidelines of the Chinese Urological Association (CUA), the American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU), the application of antibiotics for PCNL patients perioperatively is a well-recognized strategy to prevent postoperative infections. However, guideline's recommendations cannot be given in every detail. Single-dose prophylactic antibiotic before PCNL for patients with negative urine culture (UC−) was recommend in both EAU and AUA guidelines, but the CUA guideline additionally recommend antibiotic treatment for 3–5 days in UC− patients with positive urine microscopy (UM+), while the Japanese guideline suggested that patients with stones ≥ 2 cm or hydronephrosis should receive 1 week of antibiotic treatment. Moreover, despite emphasizing that urinary tract infections (UTIs) should be controlled primarily based on UC and the bacteria sensitivity patterns whenever stone removal is planned, there are no clear strategies regarding doses or duration of antibiotic treatment. The strategies for post-PCNL antibiotics are also insufficiently clear. Therefore, the urologists potentially use antibiotics in several different practice patterns in PCNL.

Until now, there is limited information revealing the current practice of antibiotics in PCNL in China. Therefore, Investigation on how antibiotics actually used in PCNL will provide valuable information on the most appropriate strategies and hopefully reduce nonstandard use of antibiotics. The aim of this study was to assess the current status of antibiotic practice among Chinese PCNL patients, and the differences with current recommendations of urological guidelines.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^1ec6abc3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^dd9942a8]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^9345b820]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The only subtype of potentially suboptimal antibiotic treatment that was associated with the composite poor clinical outcome and CDI in our study was potentially suboptimal dose frequency. The risk of CDI was 2.42 times higher among those treated with a suboptimal dose frequency versus optimal treatment. Potentially suboptimal dose frequency was also associated with hospitalization/ED visits and all-cause mortality. In prior work, a dose-dependent increased risk of CDI has been observed, with increasing cumulative defined daily dose of antibiotics resulting in increasing risks of CDI. Our results suggest that dose frequency, in addition to drug choice and antibiotic duration, may also impact risk of CDI and other poor outcomes.

We found no difference in risk for UTI recurrence for residents treated with potentially suboptimal or optimal antibiotic treatment. Previous work has found that among women with UTI, longer courses of antibiotics may be associated with increased risk of recurrent UTI, possibly due to alterations in urogenital flora. However, among males with UTI treated in the outpatient setting, longer treatment duration was not associated with UTI recurrence, nor was antibiotic choice. Interestingly, for unclear reasons, among the subgroup of residents treated with initial beta-lactam therapy, suboptimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of UTI recurrence which requires further investigation.

It is possible that suboptimal initial treatment could lead to clinical failure, the consequences of which could be serious and may include bacteremia, urosepsis, acute care hospitalization, and potentially death. In our study, suboptimal treatment was not associated with mortality. It is possible that despite being suboptimal, an appropriate agent was ultimately used considering the susceptibility of the uropathogen causing the UTI. Three previous studies have similarly demonstrated that inappropriate empiric therapy for UTI was not associated with an increased risk of mortality. Excessive treatment duration versus optimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of mortality. The optimal duration of treatment of males with UTI is largely unknown. In females, durations as short as 3 days are recommended for those with uncomplicated infection, but for males longer durations between 7 and 14 days are generally recommended. Further investigation is needed to determine optimal treatment duration in males to decrease the risk of treatment failure.

### Appropriate antibiotic treatment of genitourinary infections in hospitalized patients [^01e3a0d3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The etiology of urinary tract infections (UTIs) that require hospitalization, whether they originate in the hospital or in the community, is changing, with increasing findings of gram-positive organisms. The Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) criteria recommend evaluating treatment choices on the basis of sound clinical evidence, potential for therapeutic benefits, safety, optimal duration of treatment, and cost-efficacy in order to improve antibiotic treatment. Evidence-based guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones for the treatment of patients with cases of pyelonephritis or bacterial prostatitis severe enough to warrant hospitalization. For other serious UTIs, fluoroquinolones are usually recommended either when traditional agents have failed or when resistance to traditional agents is high. Even in the context of rapidly changing antimicrobial resistance patterns, the fluoroquinolones have maintained consistent, well-tolerated efficacy against many of the principal organisms responsible for UTIs, and are generally considered safe for most patients. To increase the likelihood of treatment success with first-line therapy, an antimicrobial agent must attain sufficient concentrations in the target tissue or in the urine for an appropriate amount of time. Both levofloxacin and gatifloxacin are excreted unchanged in the urine in concentrations that far exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of most uropathogens. Factors that affect cost-effectiveness that should be considered include acquisition costs as well as treatment success and ease of use for hospital staff.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^753ac986]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).

### Increase in the community circulation of ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli despite reduction in antibiotic prescriptions [^02eb5e99]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance has reached pandemic proportions in the last few decades, increasing the mortality rates and healthcare costs associated with the prescription of ineffective antibiotics. These developments prompted the establishment of antimicrobial stewardship programs in healthcare institutions to minimize the overuse of antibiotics and optimize appropriate antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration of therapy. However, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are often circulating in the community as 'commensal' microbiota colonizing healthy individuals –, and it remains unclear how antibiotic use reduction has affected their prevalence in that reservoir.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) — bladder cystitis, pyelonephritis, and urosepsis of both community and nosocomial origin — are among the most common reasons for antibiotic treatment. Women of postmenopausal age — generally 50 years or older (50+ yo) — are especially at high risk for severe and drug-resistant forms of UTI. UTIs are primarily caused by extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli that are mostly associated with strains from specific clonal groups. Resident gut bacteria carried by the patient as commensal microbiota are the primary reservoir of UTI-causing E. coli, including the drug-resistant strains.

### Optimizing antibiotic duration and percutaneous nephrostomy timing in urosepsis complicated by upper ureteral stones: a retrospective study [^5d237d8c]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urosepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection that originates in the urinary tract and/or male genital organs. It accounts for approximately 25% of all cases of sepsis. Ureterolithiasis-related obstructions account for a significant proportion of urosepsis cases. Effective management of urosepsis necessitates prompt diagnosis, timely administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and, most importantly, the early decompression of the obstructed urinary system via percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) or ureteral stenting.

The therapeutic options for urolithiasis include medical expulsive therapy, chemolysis, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, and surgical interventions such as ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL). Although URSL is highly effective, it carries risks due to increased intraoperative irrigation pressure, which can cause bacterial or endotoxin reflux, thereby increasing the likelihood of systemic infection. Postoperative febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) can prolong hospitalization and increase morbidity in severe cases.

The duration of preoperative antibiotic administration and urinary drainage plays a crucial role in mitigating these risks. However, no established guidelines exist regarding the optimal timing of antibiotic administration, appropriate duration of urinary drainage, or scheduling of definitive URSL in patients with urolithiasis-induced obstructive acute pyelonephritis (APN). Consequently, these decisions typically depend on the clinical judgment of the treating urologist.

This study aimed to evaluate the key factors influencing the management of patients with urosepsis secondary to upper ureteral stones, with a focus on critical decision-making parameters. These include identifying the risk factors associated with post-URSL fever, determining the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy before definitive URSL, and establishing the optimal timing for PCN drainage. This analysis aimed to provide real-world insights to guide clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

Antibiotic durations should always be individualized to the patient and their clinical status. Many studies have underrepresentation of critically ill patients.

# 7 days is recommended in patients with community-acquired pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

* Consider prolonged courses of 14 days with non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli due to an increased risk of relapse/recurrence with shorter courses.

¶ After definitive source control.

† Trials excluded immunocompromised patients, patients with indwelling prostheses, infectious syndromes that required prolonged durations, or organisms that required prolonged durations of treatment (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis). Most evidence for shorter courses is in bacteremia from gram negative bacteria secondary to urinary tract infections. Control of the primary source and blood culture clearance should also be achieved.

Consider administering agents with a broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales, such as P. aeruginosa, enterococci, or MRSA, for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of complicated UTI is not clear or who are suspected to have complicated UTI due to these pathogens.

### Guidelines for the management of male urinary tract infections in primary care: a lack of international consensus-a systematic review of the literature [^c5e48507]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of adult male urinary tract infections (mUTIs) in primary care lacks international consensus. The main objective of this study was to describe the different guidelines for the diagnosis and management of mUTIs in primary care, to assess their methodological quality, and to describe their evidence-based strength of recommendation (SoR).

Methods

An international systematic literature review of the electronic databases Medline (PubMed) and EMBASE, and gray-literature guideline-focused databases was performed in 2021. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) assessment tool was used by 2 independent reviewers to appraise each guideline.

Results

From 1,678 records identified, 1,558 were screened, 134 assessed for eligibility, and 29 updated guidelines met the inclusion criteria (13 from Medline, 0 from EMBASE, and 16 from gray literature). Quality assessment revealed 14 (48%) guidelines with high-quality methodology. A grading system methodology was used in 18 (62%) guidelines. Different classifications of mUTIs are described, underlining a lack of international consensus: an anatomic classification (cystitis, prostatitis, pyelonephritis) and a symptomatic classification (approach based on the intensity and tolerance of symptoms). The duration of antibiotic treatment for febrile mUTIs has been gradually reduced over the last 20 years from 28 days to 10–14 days of fluoroquinolones (FQ), which has become the international gold standard. Guidelines from Scandinavian countries propose short courses (3–5 days) of FQ-sparing treatments: pivmecillinam, nitrofurantoin, or trimethoprim. Guidelines from French-speaking countries use a watchful waiting approach and suggest treating mUTIs with FQ, regardless of fever.

Conclusions

This lack of scientific evidence leads to consensus and disagreement: 14 days of FQ for febrile mUTIs is accepted despite a high risk of antimicrobial resistance, but FQ-sparing treatment and/or short treatment for afebrile mUTIs is not. The definition of afebrile UTIs/cystitis is debated and influences the type and duration of antibiotic treatment recommended.

Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

A Panel of International Experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^5887d644]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns.

### Current and emerging strategies to curb antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections [^72c55c45]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria compromise patient outcomes and prolong hospital stays. Consequently, new strategies are needed to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria. Over the past two decades, sizeable clinical efforts and research advances have changed urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment and prevention strategies to conserve antibiotic use. The emergence of antimicrobial stewardship, policies from national societies, and the development of new antimicrobials have shaped modern UTI practices. Future UTI management practices could be driven by the evolution of antimicrobial stewardship, improved and readily available diagnostics, and an improved understanding of how the microbiome affects UTI. Forthcoming UTI treatment and prevention strategies could employ novel bactericidal compounds, combinations of new and classic antimicrobials that enhance bacterial killing, medications that prevent bacterial attachment to uroepithelial cells, repurposing drugs, and vaccines to curtail the rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria and improve outcomes in people with UTI.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e7bb3d98]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — antibiogram use: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis (including acute pyelonephritis), we make no specific recommendation about using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice (no recommendation, knowledge gap). Patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from cUTI (less than or equal to 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality, and routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) treatment principles — treatment options "can be stratified by whether complicating features, such as known abnormal genitourinary anatomy, immunosuppression, and chronic catheterization, are present", and "Antibiotic therapy is typically used to treat active infections and prevent future infections; the treatment regimen, route, and duration will vary based on the clinical situation and should be individualized for each patient"; strategies "can be divided into treatment of an acute episode (provider prescribed or self-treatment) or prophylaxis (to prevent further episodes)"; "Whenever possible, rUTI patients should have a culture sent before treatment", although "Empiric therapy can be initiated before urine culture results if clinically indicated (such as history of UTI-related sepsis or pyelonephritis)", and "Antibiotic choice should be tailored to the individual patient and pathogens, community and patient resistance patterns, costs, drug availability, patient allergies, and patient tolerance/ability to comply"; clinicians "should be familiar with the antibiotic-resistant patterns in their communities which is generally available via antibiograms through any clinical laboratory", and "Empiric regimens should be altered if necessary based on the urine culture results".

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (proquin) [^767af160]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Proquin XR is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms listed below. Proquin XR is not interchangeable with other ciprofloxacin extended-release or immediate release oral formulations. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for specific recommendations.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PROQUIN XR IN TREATING PYELONEPHRITIS, COMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS, AND INFECTIONS OTHER THAN UNCOMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED. Alternative therapy should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic or develop fever and back pain while on treatment with Proquin XR.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Proquin XR and other antibacterial drugs, Proquin XR should only be used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and sensitivity information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^cc6759dd]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — antibiogram to tailor empiric therapy: In patients with sepsis assumed to be caused by complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice only if the antibiogram is local, recent, and relevant to the patient (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). An antibiogram is considered local if derived from the same healthcare facility, recent if based on data from the prior 12 months and relevant to the patient if based on organisms from a similar patient population. If an antibiogram is being used to further tailor empirical antibiotic choice, consider selecting an antibiotic for which 90% or more of the most relevant organism(s) are susceptible in patients in septic shock, or for which 80% or more of the most relevant organism(s) are susceptible in patients with sepsis without shock; these cutoffs are based on modeling of increased mortality risk associated with inappropriate empiric antibiotics in sepsis and septic shock. Septic shock is defined by the Sepsis-3 Task Force as a subset of sepsis in which despite volume resuscitation, vasopressors are required to maintain blood pressure and serum lactate level is greater than 2 mmol/L, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 40%.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^9e504cdb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; P = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^fb0d862e]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

### Urinary tract infections: core curriculum 2024 [^52dde126]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed. Choice and duration of antibiotics varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach. For individuals prone to frequent UTIs, some preventative measures can be utilized, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^e8c912dd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^cd8ef029]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with sepsis due to complicated UTI, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Agents with broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) may be considered for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of cUTI is not clear or who are suspected to have cUTI due to these pathogens.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^dd13220e]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections in ADPKD — AUA/CUA/SUFU-aligned statements: The Work Group agrees that statements from the American Urological Association (AUA)/Canadian Urological Association (CUA)/Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) for the general population apply to people with ADPKD, and notes this is not a formal endorsement and to refer to local guidelines where available. Recommendation 2.6.1 states clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in patients (1B). Recommendation 2.6.2 states clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women (1B). Recommendation 2.6.3 states clinicians should treat recurrent UTI (rUTI) patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (2B). Recommendation 2.6.4 states that, following discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, clinicians may prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the risk of future UTIs in women of all ages previously diagnosed with UTIs (2B). The text also notes that asymptomatic pyuria is relatively common in people with ADPKD and does not necessarily indicate a UTI, and that asymptomatic pyuria and asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antibiotics (except during pregnancy), which is the same recommendation as that for the general population.

Despite EU-wide risk minimisation measures in March 2019 to prevent inappropriate prescribing of systemic and inhaled fluoroquinolones, pharmacovigilance evidence suggests that decreases in prescribing have been of limited magnitude. We renew the call to adhere to guidelines on appropriate prescribing of fluoroquinolones. We also advocate for proper patient counselling on the risks of serious adverse reactions to these antibiotics, including how to recognise the symptoms, to facilitate shared-decision making with patients.

### Best practice statement on urologic procedures and antimicrobial prophylaxis [^e2baa0e3]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The primary rationale for antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) is to decrease the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) and other preventable periprocedural infections, with the secondary goal of reducing antibiotic overuse. This Best Practice Statement (BPS) updates the prior American Urological Association (AUA) BPS and creates a comprehensive and user-friendly reference for clinicians caring for adult patients who are undergoing urologic procedures.

Materials and Methods

Recommendations are based on a review of English language peer-reviewed literature from 2006 through October 2018 and were made by consensus by a multidisciplinary panel. The search parameters included timing, re-dosing, and duration of AP across urologic procedures where there was the possibility of SSI. Excluded from the search were the management of infections outside the genitourinary (GU) tract and pediatric procedures.

Results

Single-dose AP is recommended for most urologic cases and antimicrobials should only be used when medically necessary, for the shortest duration possible, and not beyond case completion. Surgeons are the most accurate discerners of an SSI, and should use standard definitions to make better calculations of patient risk. The risk classification developed is dependent on the likelihood of developing SSI, and not the associated consequences of SSI.

Conclusions

The AUA developed a multi-disciplinary BPS to guide clinicians on the proper usage of AP across urologic procedures and wound classifications. It is recommended that the lowest dose of antimicrobials be administered to decrease the risk of infection and to minimize the risk of drug-resistant organisms.

### Empagliflozin and linagliptin (Glyxambi) [^965a2c3c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

There have been reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving empagliflozin. Treatment with empagliflozin increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when GLYXAMBI is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin. Therefore, a lower dosage of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with GLYXAMBI.

5.6 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)

Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with GLYXAMBI presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue GLYXAMBI, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

5.7 Genital Mycotic Infections

Empagliflozin increases the risk for genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0f36364d]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

A recent global point prevalence survey of infections in 1,265 intensive care units (ICUs) documented bloodstream infection (BSI) among 15% of patients, and this rate may be increasing over time because of increased use of immunosuppressive drugs, invasive procedures, and older patients who have concomitant medical conditions and who are admitted to intensive care. These infections are a major contributor to patient morbidity and are associated with a doubling or even tripling of mortality. Mortality rates may be higher if delayed or ineffective initial antimicrobial therapy is prescribed, and so it is difficult to reduce broad-spectrum antibiotic use in the initial empiric phase of treatment in this vulnerable patient population. In contrast, it may be more feasible to reduce antibiotic use at the back end of treatment courses. Up to half of the antibiotic use in hospital wards and critical care units is unnecessary or inappropriate, and excessive durations of treatment are the greatest contributor to inappropriate use. A reduction in the length of antibiotic courses is, therefore, a potentially viable strategy to minimize the consequences of antibiotic overuse in critical care, including antibiotic resistance, adverse effects, Clostridium difficile colitis, and costs.

The optimal duration of therapy for primary BSI and BSI secondary to major organ system infections has been poorly defined. A review of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of infections most commonly encountered in the critical care setting - including guidelines for community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), pyelonephritis, and skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) - provides no guidance about the optimal duration of therapy for the subset of patients with bacteremia. In the absence of high-grade evidence, there is wide variability in antibiotic treatment duration recommendations from infectious disease and critical care specialists, and the presence of bacteremia is often used as a justification for extended courses of antibiotic therapy regardless of the observed clinical response to treatment. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining duration of therapy in several organ system infections have demonstrated that treatment can be shortened to 1 week or less without worsening patient outcomes, so it is plausible that treatment duration could potentially be shortened for BSIs as well.

IDSA 2023 guidance — preferred therapy for pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by DTR Pseudomonas aeruginosa states that ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, and cefiderocol are preferred; whenever possible, these agents should be preferentially administered as extended-infusion beta-lactams, with tobramycin or amikacin as alternative agents. Data are insufficient to favor 1 of these agents over the others, and once-daily tobramycin or amikacin are alternative agents for the treatment of P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis or cUTI, although there is a duration-dependent risk of nephrotoxicity.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^c3b6d50b]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Education and informed decision-making — supportive care and risk of progression note that the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is enhanced by the unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and that the diagnosis of UTI is highly imprecise. While no evidence exists to support the concept of withholding antimicrobials to patients with rUTIs, substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of UTI. For patients with episodes of acute cystitis without complicating factors, there is minimal risk of progression to tissue invasion or pyelonephritis, and additional characteristics of great concern do not reliably indicate risk or presence of bacteremic bacteriuria or pyelonephritis. In a representative study of older patients with bacteremia who had the same bacterial species cultured from the urine, only 1 of 37 participants aged 75 years and older had symptoms consistent with UTI, such as dysuria. Multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for acute cystitis offers little but mildly faster symptomatic improvement compared to placebo in patients with acute dysuria and significant bacteriuria, and the incidence of pyelonephritis in these patients is low and is not substantially different in individuals receiving antibiotics versus those treated with supportive care of analgesics and hydration; expectant management with analgesics and hydration while awaiting culture results is likely underutilized.

### The antibiotic strategies during percutaneous nephrolithotomy in China revealed the gap between the reality and the urological guidelines [^38e34ae4]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussions

Prevention and treatment of infection is a crucial part of the care of patients in the perioperative period of PCNL. The present study firstly reveals the current practice of perioperative antibiotics in patients treated with PCNL among Chinese urologists.

Preoperative use of prophylactic antibiotics is supposed to reduce the potential bacterial load in urine. Single-dose administration was recommended in AUA and EAU guidelines, as well as a joint guideline of the EAU Section of Urolithiasis and International Alliance of Urolithiasis. In a recent multicenter RCT, Chew et al. also concluded that a preoperative single dose of prophylactic antibiotics was sufficient in UC− patients, compared with courses of more than 7 days. It is worth noting that the positive leukocyte reaction combined with positive nitrite in preoperative UM was an early predictor of post-PCNL urosepsis. He et al. reported that UC-UM+ patients should be treated with extended period of antibiotic administration. In our study, most urologists prescribed multiple-dose antibiotics of 1–3 days of cephalosporins for UC− patients, irrespective of the UM results. However, recent studies showed that multi-dose antibiotics could not reduce the rate of postoperative infections in UC-UM+ patients, even though the frequency of positive urine nitrite and leukocyte reaction could be decreased significantly following preoperative antibiotic therapy. Therefore, the benefits of multi-dose antibiotics before PCNL for UC-UM+ patients are controversial. It was a common strategy to identify the risk factors of infections and start antimicrobial treatment as early as possible. A prolonged duration of pre-PCNL antibiotics might of value in patients with high risk factors for postoperative infections, such as indwelling urinary drainage tubes, diabetes, and hydronephrosis.

### Canagliflozin (Invokana) [^11ec90d2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving INVOKANA. Treatment with INVOKANA increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. INVOKANA may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

5.6 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)

Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including INVOKANA. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with INVOKANA presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue INVOKANA, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

5.7 Genital Mycotic Infections

INVOKANA increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor and treat appropriately.

### White paper: developing antimicrobial drugs for resistant pathogens, narrow-spectrum indications, and unmet needs [^88a6d888]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Despite progress in antimicrobial drug development, a critical need persists for new, feasible pathways to develop antibacterial agents to treat people infected with drug-resistant bacteria. Infections due to resistant gram-negative bacilli continue to cause unacceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Antibacterial agents have been historically studied in noninferiority clinical trials that focus on a single site of infection (eg, complicated urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections), yet these designs may not be optimal, and often are not feasible, for study of infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria. Over the past several years, multiple stakeholders have worked to develop consensus regarding paths forward with a goal of facilitating timely conduct of antimicrobial development. Here we advocate for a novel and pragmatic approach and, toward this end, present feasible trial designs for antibacterial agents that could enable conduct of narrow-spectrum, organism-specific clinical trials and ultimately approval of critically needed new antibacterial agents.

Guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of persons with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The evidence-based guidelines encompass diagnostic criteria, strategies to reduce the risk of CA-UTIs, strategies that have not been found to reduce the incidence of urinary infections, and management strategies for patients with catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria or symptomatic urinary tract infection. These guidelines are intended for use by physicians in all medical specialties who perform direct patient care, with an emphasis on the care of patients in hospitals and long-term care facilities.

### Comparative study of the bacterial distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens in older and younger patients with urinary stones [^409c1355]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urolithiasis is the most prevalent disease in the urinary system. Patients with urinary stones are more likely to suffer from tract obstruction dilatation and effusion, which are beneficial for pathogen reproduction and may lead to urinary tract infections (UTIs). Uropathogens can facilitate stone formation and urinary tract stones would be secondary to UTIs. UTIs patients with urolithiasis are prone to experience more serious complications following surgery procedures, such as postoperative infection, systemic inflammation and even death due to septic shock.

UTIs are common in older people and may cause serious complications. Symptoms may not be typical and therapeutic strategies should be adapted to this aged group, as unrevealed infection may be extremely harmful to older people but overtreatment might cause avoidable side effects and costs. Improper antimicrobial drugs use and the associated rise in antimicrobial resistance have become significant health challenges. Older patients with UTIs are at high risk of developing urosepsis. Therefore, new empirical treatment strategies that offer safe and effective antimicrobial approaches to manage UTIs could be crucial in the older people. Studies have demonstrated that age (over 65 years) is the only factor for post-flexible cystoscopy UTI and that the risk of UTI increases with age.

So far, urine bacteriology and resistance patterns in older and younger patients with stones have been incompletely understood and obsolete, facilitating the demand for further knowledge to ensure efficient empirical therapies. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate microbial spectrum and resistance patterns of uropathogens isolated from older and younger patients with urolithiasis and acquire insight into developing appropriate antimicrobial treatments.

### A prospective study examining the incidence of bacteriuria and urinary tract infection after shock wave lithotripsy with targeted antibiotic prophylaxis [^c2d71846]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Controversy exists regarding antibiotic prophylaxis before shock wave lithotripsy. The AUA (American Urological Association) guideline recommends universal antibiotic prophylaxis, whereas the EAU (European Association of Urology) guideline recommends prophylaxis only for select patients. We evaluated the use of targeted antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing urinary tract infections in patients undergoing shock wave lithotripsy.

Materials and Methods

A prospective single cohort study was performed during 6 months with patients undergoing shock wave lithotripsy. All patients underwent urine dipstick and culture before shock wave lithotripsy. Targeted antibiotic prophylaxis was provided at the discretion of the treating urologist. All patients had a urine culture performed after shock wave lithotripsy and completed a survey documenting fevers or urinary symptoms. The primary outcome was the incidence of urinary tract infections, urosepsis and asymptomatic bacteriuria after shock wave lithotripsy. The secondary outcome was the sensitivity and specificity of urinary dipstick leukocytes and nitrites.

Results

A total of 526 patients were enrolled in the study. Of the 389 patients included in the determination of the primary outcome, urinary tract infection developed in only 1 (0.3%), urosepsis did not develop in any patients and asymptomatic bacteriuria developed in 11 (2.8%). Eight (2.1%) patients were administered antibiotic prophylaxis. The specificity of urine dipstick nitrites was high (95%) while the sensitivity was poor (9.7%).

Conclusions

In our cohort study using targeted antibiotic prophylaxis the rates of urinary tract infection after shock wave lithotripsy and rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria were extremely low, with no development of urosepsis. This finding questions the need for universal antibiotic prophylaxis before shock wave lithotripsy.

5.5 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving canagliflozin. Treatment with INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^fde217b5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria — older, functionally or cognitively impaired patients: In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium (acute mental status change, confusion) and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection who experience a fall, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Values and preferences emphasize avoiding adverse outcomes of antimicrobial therapy such as CDI, increased antimicrobial resistance, or adverse drug effects when benefit is unproven. Remarks note that for a bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection (sepsis) and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^c9885831]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 3.3 — CRE infections outside the urinary tract that are not carbapenemase producing: For isolates that exhibit susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem (ie, MICs ≤ 1 μg/mL) but are not susceptible to ertapenem (ie, MICs ≥ 1 μg/mL), the use of extended-infusion meropenem (or imipenem-cilastatin) is suggested; if such isolates do not exhibit susceptibility to any carbapenem, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam are preferred treatment options. The rationale notes that less than 3% of the 1249 isolates resistant to ertapenem but susceptible to meropenem and imipenem contained a carbapenemase gene, and that standard-infusion meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin may be reasonable for uncomplicated cUTIs. For isolates susceptible to meropenem but not imipenem (and vice versa), the panel suggests basing treatment on severity of illness and site of infection. The panel suggests against the use of meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam to treat ertapenem-resistant, meropenem-susceptible and imipenem-susceptible infections, and suggests against the use of extended-infusion carbapenems with or without a second agent when susceptibility to meropenem or imipenem has not been demonstrated. Tigecycline or eravacycline are alternative options for CRE infections not involving the bloodstream or urinary tract.
