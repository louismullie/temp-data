## Question

what do you do about free T4 0.7 and TSH 5.0

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do about a free T4 of 0.7 with a TSH of 5.0. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding assay or transient causes. Then, I should verify whether this represents subclinical versus overt hypothyroidism. Next, I will consider patient-specific factors that modify treatment thresholds. After that, I should outline management options, including when to treat versus observe. Finally, I will specify monitoring intervals, medication choices if treated, and special scenarios like pregnancy or central hypothyroidism, and I will double-check that each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the laboratory pattern and its clinical meaning. A TSH of 5.0 mIU/L is above the typical upper limit of normal (about 4.0–4.5 mIU/L), and a free T4 of 0.7 ng/dL sits at the low end of normal in many assays, which together defines subclinical hypothyroidism rather than overt hypothyroidism, assuming the patient is not acutely ill and the axis is intact [^4bde2cf9] [^2cfb89b0].

> Wait, let me verify persistence before labeling this as disease. I should repeat TSH (and free T4) in about 3–6 months to confirm chronicity, because transient TSH elevations can occur with intercurrent illness, recovery from illness, or assay variability, and confirming persistence reduces overtreatment and misclassification [^34ead0d9] [^262398ad].

> Next, I should review patient-specific modifiers that lower my threshold to treat. I need to check for symptoms attributable to hypothyroidism, positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease or risk factors, goiter, and importantly, pregnancy or plans to conceive, because these factors increase the likelihood of benefit from treatment even when TSH is modestly elevated [^c8eb015b] [^79d492f2] [^dd841f40].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment for everyone with TSH 5–10 mIU/L. I should confirm the strength of evidence. High-quality guidance recommends against routine levothyroxine in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, as randomized trials show no meaningful improvement in quality of life or symptoms, so observation is reasonable unless the patient has the modifiers above or TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L, which carries higher risk and stronger support for treatment [^824d4918] [^262398ad].

> I will now examine management options. Option A is observation with repeat TSH and free T4 in 6–12 months, which is appropriate for asymptomatic patients without antibodies or cardiovascular risk, given the low progression risk and potential for spontaneous normalization. Option B is a cautious trial of low-dose levothyroxine (for example, 25–50 mcg daily) if symptoms, positive antibodies, dyslipidemia, or cardiovascular disease are present, with reassessment of symptoms and labs in 6–8 weeks. Option C is definitive treatment if TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L or overt hypothyroidism is present, which is not the case here [^824d4918] [^0af3b4a3] [^7c400ceb].

> Let me think about dosing and monitoring if I start levothyroxine. I should confirm the starting dose based on lean body weight and comorbidities, often 25–50 mcg daily in mild subclinical disease, then recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks and adjust in 12.5–25 mcg increments until TSH is normalized, recognizing that in older adults or those with cardiac disease I should start low and titrate slowly to avoid ischemia or arrhythmias [^7c400ceb] [^0af3b4a3].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or planning pregnancy? I should double-check that threshold. In women who are pregnant, planning pregnancy, or undergoing assisted reproduction, treatment is recommended at lower TSH thresholds (often > 2.5 mIU/L if antibody positive) to support fetal neurodevelopment, with close monitoring and trimester-specific targets, so I would initiate levothyroxine and coordinate obstetric care in that scenario [^dd841f40] [^b26a51a8].

> I need to ensure I am not missing central hypothyroidism. If TSH is inappropriately normal or low with a low free T4, that suggests pituitary disease; in that case, TSH cannot guide therapy and I should target free T4 in the upper half of normal, adjusting levothyroxone based on free T4 rather than TSH, with endocrinology input as needed [^318324c9] [^6bf11f69].

> Next, I should review special populations. In older adults, the TSH reference interval shifts upward with age, so a TSH of 5.0 mIU/L may be physiologic; I should be more conservative about treatment and prioritize observation unless symptoms or significant comorbidity are present, aligning with age-specific interpretation and the low likelihood of symptom benefit in this range [^37bd7e8b] [^824d4918].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure my plan is consistent with evidence. For a free T4 of 0.7 ng/dL and TSH of 5.0 mIU/L, this is subclinical hypothyroidism; confirm persistence in 3–6 months, assess for symptoms, antibodies, lipids, and cardiovascular risk, and individualize treatment. Most adults in this range do not benefit from levothyroxine, so observation is reasonable, but treat if symptoms, positive antibodies, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, goiter, or pregnancy are present, using low starting doses and careful monitoring if treatment is chosen [^824d4918] [^c8eb015b] [^7c400ceb].

---

For a free T4 of 0.7 ng/dL and TSH of 5.0 mIU/L, this is **subclinical hypothyroidism** (elevated TSH with normal free T4). Most patients do not require immediate treatment; **observe and recheck TSH and free T4 in 6–12 weeks** to confirm persistence, then every 6–12 months if stable. Consider **levothyroxine** if TSH is persistently ≥ 10 mIU/L, if there are hypothyroid symptoms, positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies, or if the patient is pregnant or planning pregnancy. If treated, start low (25–50 mcg/day) and titrate to a TSH of 0.5–2.5 mIU/L, monitoring every 6–8 weeks until stable. Do not treat based on symptoms alone without biochemical confirmation, and avoid overtreatment to prevent iatrogenic hyperthyroidism [^824d4918] [^4bde2cf9] [^262398ad].

---

## Confirm the diagnosis

Confirm the diagnosis by **repeating TSH and free T4** in 6–12 weeks to ensure persistence and exclude laboratory error or transient illness. Concurrently, **check thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb)** to assess autoimmune thyroiditis risk and guide treatment decisions [^4bde2cf9].

---

## Clinical significance of subclinical hypothyroidism

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common and often benign; **many patients remain stable or normalize spontaneously**, especially when TSH is < 10 mIU/L. Progression to overt hypothyroidism is more likely with higher TSH, positive TPOAb, or symptoms, but most patients with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L do not progress and may not benefit from treatment [^262398ad] [^4bde2cf9].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is **not routinely indicated** at TSH 5.0 mIU/L with normal free T4. Consider levothyroxine if any of the following are present:

- **Persistent TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L**: Strong indication [^824d4918].
- **Hypothyroid symptoms**: Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, or cognitive changes [^c8eb015b].
- **Positive TPOAb**: Indicates autoimmune thyroiditis and higher progression risk [^c8eb015b].
- **Pregnancy or planning pregnancy**: Target TSH < 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester [^b26a51a8].
- **Cardiovascular risk factors**: Dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, or heart failure [^c8eb015b].

---

## Management approach

### Observation

Observation is appropriate for **asymptomatic patients with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L**, normal free T4, and no pregnancy plans. Recheck TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months, and monitor for symptom development or TSH rise.

---

### Treatment with levothyroxine

If treatment is indicated, **start low and titrate**:

- **Initial dose**: 25–50 mcg/day (lower in elderly or cardiac disease) [^0af3b4a3].
- **Titration**: Adjust every 6–8 weeks to target TSH 0.5–2.5 mIU/L.
- **Monitoring**: TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually [^7c400ceb].

---

## Risks and benefits of treatment

Benefits include symptom improvement in those with true hypothyroid symptoms, potential cardiovascular risk reduction in high-risk patients, and prevention of progression to overt hypothyroidism. Risks include **overtreatment** with iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and anxiety; therefore, treatment should be individualized and monitored closely [^824d4918] [^4bde2cf9].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Treat to TSH < 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester; monitor every 4 weeks [^b26a51a8].
- **Elderly**: Start low and go slow; overtreatment increases cardiovascular and bone risks [^b2bf2570].
- **Drug interactions**: Calcium, iron, PPIs, and some foods impair absorption; separate dosing by 4 hours [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| Asymptomatic, TSH 5.0 mIU/L, normal free T4 | Observe; recheck in 6–12 weeks, then every 6–12 months |
| Symptomatic or TPOAb positive | Consider levothyroxine; start 25–50 mcg/day, titrate to TSH 0.5–2.5 mIU/L |
| Pregnancy or planning pregnancy | Treat immediately; target TSH < 2.5 mIU/L |
| Persistent TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L | Treat with levothyroxine |

---

A free T4 of 0.7 ng/dL with TSH 5.0 mIU/L is **subclinical hypothyroidism**; most patients should be observed, with treatment reserved for specific indications. If treated, use low-dose levothyroxine with careful monitoring to avoid overtreatment.

Monitoring of patients taking antithyroid drugs: An assessment of serum free T4 should be obtained about 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, and the dose of medication adjusted accordingly, and serum T3 also may be monitored since serum free T4 may normalize with persistent elevation of serum T3. Appropriate monitoring intervals are every 4–8 weeks until euthyroid values are achieved with the minimal dose of medication, after which biochemical testing and clinical evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and an assessment of serum free T4 and TSH are required before treatment and at intervals after starting treatment.

If the FT 4 level is low, the clinician should review medications the patient is taking, evaluate the pituitary gland, or consider euthyroid sick syndrome. |-| If the TSH level is low, hyperthyroidism is possible. 18 If the TSH level is high, a serum FT 4 level should be obtained.

A low FT 4 level indicates clinical hypothyroidism, specifically autoimmune hypothyroidism if the TPO antibody test result is elevated). The TSH level should drop by 50% per week on adequate treatment. After clinical improvement, the patient may transition to oral levothyroxine monotherapy. 21, 25. 7 More than 50% of patients older than 55 years with TSH levels of
5. 0 to 9. 9 mIU per L will normalize, whereas only 13% and 5% of patients normalize if the TSH level is greater than 10 mIU per L or greater than 15 mIU per L, respectively. Most adults older than 30 years with elevated TSH but normal FT 4 levels do not benefit from thyroid hormone therapy, and 60% normalize within five years. 37, 42 Patients who have a TSH level greater than 10 mIU per L are at higher risk of fracture, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure compared with patients who have a TSH level of 2. 0 to
2. 5 mIU per L.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^824d4918]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — central hypothyroidism targets: In the case of central hypothyroidism estimates of dose are based on 1.6 μg/kg L‑thyroxine daily and assessment of free T4, not TSH should guide therapy; determinations are best done prior to taking thyroid hormone, and the goal of therapy is generally to attain values above the mean for assays being employed.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^9b0ebfbb]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Discordant test results between thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine or triiodothyronine levels can lead to unnecessary follow-up, patient anxiety, and increased health care costs without clinical benefit. The US Preventive Services Task Force states that there is insufficient evidence for screening asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults for thyroid disease. 7 Given the risks of unnecessary treatment and overtreatment, it is critical to use a patient-centered approach. When should thyroid function tests be performed, and when should they be avoided. For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained.

1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. 8 Measuring TSH levels is also recommended as the first-line test for pregnant patients with a personal or family history of thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes, or a clinical concern for thyroid disease. In pregnant patients with hypothyroidism, TSH levels should be maintained between the trimester-specific lower limit and 2. 5 mIU/L, and TSH measurement should be obtained every 4 to 6 weeks to ensure appropriate levels of levothyroxine.
8. When treating primary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine dosing should be adjusted based on normalizing TSH and not free T 4 levels. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is recommended if TSH is greater than 10 mIU/L or thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated. 1 A previous American Family Physician article discusses dosing recommendations for hypothyroidism.

1.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels. TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks.

Hospitalized but not critically ill patients starting or increasing levothyroxine — therapeutic goal: The therapeutic goal of levothyroxine replacement in non-critically ill patients is long-term normalization of serum thyrotropin when steady-state thyroid hormone levels are achieved, and levothyroxine should not be titrated to serum free thyroxine levels unless serum thyrotropin cannot be relied upon. Strong recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^c543b4dd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere. Recommendations were based on published findings and on expert opinion when appropriate. The best available research evidence was used to develop recommendations. Preference was given to articles written in English, identified by PubMed searches with MeSH terms.

For each point, recommendations and evidence are described, with a modification in the grading evidence as follows: 1 = strong recommendation (applies to most patients in most circumstances, benefits clearly outweigh the risk); and 2 = weak recommendation (consensus opinion of working group or should be considered; the best action may depend on circumstances or patient values, benefits, and risks closely balanced or uncertain).

Qualify of evidence is indicated as follows: ⊕⊕⊕, high quality (prospective cohort studies or randomized controlled trials at low risk of bias); ⊕⊕○, moderate quality (observational studies or trials with methodological flaws, inconsistent or indirect evidence); and ⊕○○, low quality (case series or nonsystematic clinical observations).

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^318324c9]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^e2a5f855]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^76e1b6c4]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism in adults — therapeutic endpoints and TSH targets indicate that the most reliable therapeutic endpoint for primary hypothyroidism is the serum TSH value, since confirmatory total T4, free T4, and T3 lack sufficient specificity as stand-alone endpoints; when serum TSH is within the normal range, free T4 will also be normal, whereas T3 may be in the lower reference range and occasionally mildly subnormal. The normal TSH range with an upper limit of 4.12 mIU/L is largely based on NHANES III, but some propose an upper normal of 2.5 or 3.0 mIU/L because the distribution is skewed by values between 3.1 and 4.12 mIU/L and mean/median are approximately 1.5 mIU/L; however, measurements vary up to 50% above and below the mean, and setting 2.5 mIU/L as the upper normal could yield more than 10 million additional diagnoses per year in the United States without clear-cut benefit.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^e06cfc94]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^262398ad]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^b2bf2570]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

Regarding specific circumstances for Graves' disease, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (treatment monitoring), ETA 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that thyroid hormone concentrations (free T4 or free T3) should normalize in most patients in the first 6 weeks with a noticeable improvement in the first 4 weeks and TSH can remain suppressed for several months.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Levo-T) [^2200a7ba]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 IU per liter, and this usually requires a LEVO-T dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.

2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVO-T may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of LEVO-T therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of LEVO-T [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

### Use of electronic clinical decision support and hard stops to decrease unnecessary thyroid function testing [^58654cd1]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

The cost of our nation's healthcare has been on the rise since its inception. In 2014, 4.1% ($971.8 billion) of the Federal budget was attributed solely to hospital care, increased from 3.5% in 2013. The American College of Physicians, "High Value Care", recommends for physicians to give the finest, yet most efficient, care to patients by eliminating unnecessary costs. The American Medical Association, "Choosing wisely", also believes in the same ideology of "more care is not always better care". Thus, in accord with these ideologies along with one of the bedrocks of the Toyota Production System (TPS) Lean Methodology, eliminate muda (waste), our hospital embarked in a Zero Unnecessary Studies (ZEUS) initiative to identify and eliminate waste.

It has been shown that Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs) are ordered far more frequently than the number of patients with symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.TFTs are ordered more often than just a TSH level alone, even though the TSH level is substantial enough on admission to determine if future studies should be pursued. The clinical symptoms of thyroid dysfunction are very sensitive yet less specific, and thus, a majority of symptomatic patients will have normal TFTs. Furthermore, non-symptomatic patients with established hypothyroidism and compliance with treatment may not need fT3 and fT4 levels measured upon admission, as treatment can be adjusted as an outpatient if the TSH is appropriate during the hospital course.

The literature has illustrated that it is not effective to order TFTs for in-patients due to high false positives associated with Non-Thyroidal Illnesses. – During the stress of an illness, there are changes on the pituitary-thyroid axis, changes in the metabolism, and clearance of thyroid hormones. Small changes in T4 can create large changes in TSH. T3 is difficult to accurately interpret due to its short half-life and it can remain normal in severe cases of thyroid dysfunction. The most sensitive test for thyroid dysfunction is a TSH level. If the TSH level is abnormal, it is then appropriate to measure fT3 and fT4.

Specifically regarding TFTs orders, each facility would have their own ordering capabilities and regulations. As per literature searches, there has not been any attempts to solve the problem of only ordering a fT3 and/or fT4 level after the TSH is abnormal, through changes in an EMR. Thus, there was no evidence found regarding which changes would benefit or inhibit the issue of waste in an inpatient setting.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^cdf53b2f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is changed according to the serum TSH level as follows; 6–8 weeks after randomisation a blood sample is taken for serum TSH, with three possible actions:
TSH < 0.4 mU/L: treatment dose reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – blinding maintained by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose; these patients will have a further check TSH after 6–8 weeks; if TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.
TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose; patient to be reviewed at 12 months.
TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): additional 25 micrograms levothyroxine, giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of dose of levothyroxine (25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions, at 6–8 week intervals, with a check of serum TSH performed at 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained masked to the results of TSH measurements throughout the course of the study.

The above process (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month) then annually (at 24 and 36 months plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine that is prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the levothyroxine-treated group. We have adopted an adaptive schedule, in which the data centre allocates the same proportion of placebo patients to have dose adjustment (up and down) as are required in the levothyroxine group. This ensures that the burden of assessment, and number of tablets to be taken, is the same in both the levothyroxine and placebo groups. The computer generated allocation also ensures that the clinical investigators remain blind to treatment allocation.

### Approach to the patient with a suppressed TSH [^55bc3a9d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is a laboratory diagnosis defined by a serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration below the reference range (< 0.4 mU/L in most assays), and a free thyroxine (FT4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels (FT3) in the reference range. Many patients diagnosed with SCH will be clinically euthyroid while others may present with manifestations characteristic of thyroid hormone excess, such as tachycardia, tremor, intolerance to heat, bone density loss, or weight loss. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities, patient factors such as age, symptoms, and underlying heart and bone disease are used to stratify patients for the risk of adverse outcomes and determine the appropriate treatment. Evaluation should include repeat thyroid function tests to document persistent TSH suppression, investigation of the underlying cause, as well as evaluation of the patient's risk of adverse outcomes in the setting of a subnormal TSH. Persistent SCH has been associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse events, including cardiovascular events such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure, bone loss and fracture, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Despite the consistent association of these adverse events with SCH, prospective studies showing improved outcomes with treatment remain limited. Management options include observation without active therapy, radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid, antithyroid medication, thyroid surgery, or radiofrequency ablation, as appropriate for the patient and clinical setting. The choice of therapy should be guided by the underlying etiology of disease, patient factors, and the risks and benefits of each treatment option.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: screening and management [^217105a7]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Congenital hypothyroidism — treatment goals, timelines, and lab targets: The goal of L‑T4 treatment is to support normal neurocognitive development and growth, and optimal outcome depends on early initiation of adequate therapy (optimally by 2 weeks of age when detected on the first NBS). Rapid normalization of serum free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, optimally within 2 to 4 weeks of treatment initiation, leads to improved neurocognitive outcomes. After initial normalization, serum TSH should be maintained in the age-specific reference range and serum FT4 in the upper half of the age-specific reference range; the table specifies TSH is generally 0.5–5 mIU/L after 3 mo of life.

### Quetiapine [^b5623da2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.14 Hypothyroidism

Adults: Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated dose-related decreases in thyroid hormone levels. The reduction in total and free thyroxine (T4) of approximately 20% at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range was maximal in the first six weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression during more chronic therapy. In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T4, irrespective of the duration of treatment. The mechanism by which quetiapine effects the thyroid axis is unclear. If there is an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, measurement of TSH alone may not accurately reflect a patient's thyroid status. Therefore, both TSH and free T4, in addition to clinical assessment, should be measured at baseline and at follow-up.

In the mania adjunct studies, where quetiapine was added to lithium or divalproex, 12% (24/196) of quetiapine treated patients compared to 7% (15/203) of placebo-treated patients had elevated TSH levels. Of the quetiapine treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 3 had simultaneous low free T4 levels (free T4 < 0.8 LLN).

About 0.7% (26/3489) of quetiapine patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies. Some patients with TSH increases needed replacement thyroid treatment.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced thyroid dysfunction — screening and follow-up emphasize that "the majority of patients in whom thyroid dysfunction develops after ICI therapy are asymptomatic", and "all patients should be tested (TSH and free T4) at the baseline prior to therapy". Ongoing surveillance is advised with "frequent monitoring with each cycle or every 4 to 6 weeks from the start of ICI therapy or as needed… should allow for the detection of evolving thyroid disease". Baseline antibodies are not definitive because "Evidence for the measurement of the levels of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies at the baseline to predict future thyroid dysfunction is still emerging", though "additional laboratory investigations for TSH receptor antibodies… and thyroglobulin may help to distinguish the diagnoses", and "Additional imaging… may have a role in select cases". Management notes that "ICI therapy need not be interrupted or discontinued in cases of thyroid-related side effects", while "Patients with overt hypothyroidism (a low level of free T4 and persistently elevated level of TSH of more than twice the upper limit of the normal range) will require thyroid hormone replacement".

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^4e552c61]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients' symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^32fb5434]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^5ab7491c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^d4cafc0d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

Regarding specific circumstances for Graves' disease, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, antithyroid drugs, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to administer the lowest possible dose of antithyroid drug needed to keep the mother's thyroid hormone levels at or slightly above the reference range for total T4 and T3 values in pregnancy (1.5 times above nonpregnant reference ranges in the second and third trimesters), and the TSH below the reference range for pregnancy. Keep free T4 levels at or slightly above the upper limit of the pregnancy trimester reference range for the assay. Assess thyroid function at least monthly, and adjust the antithyroid drug dose, as required.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^6a7a3b3f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite a historically late start in its recognition as a disease entity, hypothyroidism has remarkably become one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the Western world, and levothyroxine one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide.

How could a condition that had been overlooked throughout the centuries of human culture rise to such prominence in such a short time period? Clearly, this was related to the convenient and sensitive measurement of serum TSH, which has achieved a pre-eminent position in defining primary hypothyroidism. Consequently, a new disease class of subclinical hypothyroidism was introduced, which is solely based on the presence of an elevated TSH while the thyroid hormones FT3 and FT4 remain within their respective reference ranges. This strategy has not remained unchallenged and the deficiencies of this diagnostic approach have been reviewed elsewhere. In an attempt to scale back on the avalanche of purported thyroid diseases created by this strategy, the TSH threshold for treatment was raised in recent guidelines. In doing so, another problem was created by dissociating the TSH-based diagnosis of the disease from the requirement of therapeutic intervention. However, doctors and patients find it incomprehensible that a thyroid condition labelled as a disease would not therefore require suitable intervention. This questions the practical value of designation and appropriateness of the current diagnostic entity of subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Standardization of free thyroxine and harmonization of thyrotropin measurements: a request for input from endocrinologists and other physicians [^9e7453d4]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

For fT4, the variability is substantial. Standardization will change results significantly — perhaps as much as 80% at the upper limit of the normal range — for some assays. For TSH, the alterations introduced by harmonization will be milder (approximately 20%). The Committee, comprising laboratory professionals and manufacturers, has received a positive response for this approach from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), albeit with the caveat to investigate the risks associated with changes in the numerical results for some of the assays.

To this end, we are reaching out to stakeholders to seek views on the benefits and risks arising from fT4 standardization and TSH harmonization.

1.000000000000000e+00 Benefits: We wish to learn about the benefits that you think would be achieved if all fT4 and TSH assays gave comparable results on patient samples.
2.000000000000000e+00 Risks: We wish to learn about the risks to patient safety and clinical outcomes that you think may arise as a consequence of a change in the numerical results for patients with thyroid disorders who are being followed, despite appropriate adjustments of the reference intervals. Particular attention should be paid to the question of whether standardization for uncomplicated hypo- and hyperthyroidism may detract from assay differences for important clinical populations (nonthyroidal illness, and elderly and pregnant individuals).
3.000000000000000e+00 Implementation: We wish to hear your views on how clinical laboratories can minimize the identified risks from fT4 standardization and TSH harmonization, and about the role that you could play for the patients you treat.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^22fb1b8f]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^de885b19]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

5.14 Hypothyroidism

Adults

Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated dose-related decreases in thyroid hormone levels.

In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T4, irrespective of the duration of treatment. The mechanism by which quetiapine effects the thyroid axis is unclear. If there is an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, measurement of TSH alone may not accurately reflect a patient's thyroid status.

### A 2013 survey of clinical practice patterns in the management of primary hypothyroidism [^370035d4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

In 2012, comprehensive clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were published regarding the management of hypothyroidism.

Objective

We sought to document current practices in the management of primary hypothyroidism and compare these results with recommendations made in the 2012 American Thyroid Association (ATA)/American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) hypothyroidism CPGs. In addition, we sought to examine differences in management among international members of U.S.-based endocrine societies and to compare survey results with those obtained from a survey of ATA members performed 12 years earlier.

Methods

Clinical members of The Endocrine Society (TES), the ATA, and the AACE were asked to take a web-based survey consisting of 30 questions dealing with testing, treatment, and modulating factors in the management of primary hypothyroidism.

Results

In total, 880 respondents completed the survey, including 618 members of TES, 582 AACE members, and 208 ATA members. North American respondents accounted for 67.6%, Latin American 9.7%, European 9.2%, Asia and Oceania 8.1%, and Africa and Middle East 5.5%. Overt hypothyroidism would be treated using l-T4 alone by 99.2% of respondents; 0.8% would use combination l-T4 and liothyronine (l-T3) therapy. Generic l-T4 would be used by 49.3% and a brand name by 49.9%. The rate of replacement would be gradual (38.5%); an empiric dose, adjusted to achieve target (33.6%); or a calculated full replacement dose (27.8%). A target TSH of 1.0 to 1.9 mU/L was favored in the index case, but 3.0 to 3.9 mU/L was the most commonly selected TSH target for an octogenarian. Persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite achieving a target TSH would prompt testing for other causes by 84.3% of respondents, a referral to primary care by 11.3%, and a change to l-T4 plus l-T3 therapy by 3.6%. Evaluation of persistent symptoms would include measurement of T3 levels by 21.9% of respondents. Subclinical disease with a TSH 5.0 to 10.0 mU/L would be treated without further justification by 21.3% of respondents, or in the presence of positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (62.3%), hypothyroid symptoms (60.9%), high low-density lipoprotein (52.9%), or goiter (46.6%). The TSH target for a newly pregnant patient was < 2.5 mU/L for 96.1% of respondents, with 63.5% preferring a TSH target < 1.5 mU/L. Thyroid hormone levels would be checked every 4 weeks during pregnancy by 67.7% and every 8 weeks by an additional 21.4%. A hypothyroid patient with TSH of 0.5 mU/L who becomes pregnant would receive an immediate l-T4 dose increase by only 36.9% of respondents.

Conclusion

The current survey of clinical endocrinologists catalogs current practice patterns in the management of hypothyroidism and demonstrates 1) a nearly exclusive preference for l-T4 alone as initial therapy, 2) the widespread use of age-specific TSH targets for replacement therapy, 3) a low threshold for treating mild thyroid failure, 4) meticulous attention to TSH targets in the pregnant and prepregnant woman, and 5) a highly variable approach to both the rate and means of restoring euthyroidism for overt disease. Both alignment and focal divergence from recent CPGs are demonstrated.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Thyquidity) [^b0c5d89c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism, despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of THYQUIDITY, may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

Although the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of THYQUIDITY therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — free T4 assessment, L-thyroxine timing, and pregnancy testing: A subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to establish hypothyroidism (primary with elevated TSH or central with normal/low TSH), and in previously hyperthyroid patients treated with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioiodine it is the primary test when TSH may remain low. For patients on L-thyroxine, blood for free T4 should be collected before dosing because levels increase by up to 20% after administration; in athyreotic patients, total T4 rose by 1 hour, peaked at 2.5 hours, while free T4 peaked at 3.5 hours and stayed above baseline for 9 hours. In pregnancy, measurement of serum total T4 is recommended over direct immunoassay of free T4; many patients have third-trimester free T4 values below nonpregnant ranges, and total T4 increases in the first trimester with the reference range ~1.5-fold the nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy. Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism.

2.4	Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of EUTHYROX may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of EUTHYROX therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of EUTHYROX [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)])].

"Within 1 month after starting Nivo, the level of TSH was mildly suppressed (0.44 mIU/L), but after 3 months, the level of TSH was fully suppressed at < 0.01 mIU/L, with a mildly elevated level of free T4 (1.84 ng/dL)". At 4 months, values were "TSH = 0.43 mIU/L; free T4 = 1.07 ng/dL", then "his TSH level rose to the 4.64 mIU/L", and by 10 months "TSH… 6.7 mIU/L" with "free T4… 0.66 ng/dL". He "was started on levothyroxine at 25 μg daily", later "increased to 125 μg daily… to normalize the level of TSH (with a peak value of 90.2 mIU/L)". Approximately 1 year after Nivo, morning cortisol was undetectable and "The level of ACTH was low at 2.2 pg/ mL", and he "was started on HC at a replacement dose of 15 mg in the morning and 5 mg at noon". Nivo "was uninterrupted, except for 3 doses at months 5 to 6 and once again at month 11", and the figure shows evolution "from mild hyperthyroidism… to hypothyroidism, followed by secondary adrenal insufficiency".

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^4b5003c6]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Thyroid Carcinoma — Principles of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression state that the use of levothyroxine to maintain low TSH levels is considered optimal for papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, although data are lacking to permit precise specification of serum TSH levels. In general, patients with known structural residual carcinoma or at high risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained below 0.1 mU/L. Patients who are disease free and at low risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained at the normal range, and for patients at low risk for recurrence with biochemical evidence but no structural evidence of disease (eg, Tg positive, but imaging negative), maintain TSH levels at 0.1–0.5 mU/L. Patients who remain disease free for several years should have their TSH levels maintained within the reference range. Given the potential toxicities associated with TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine — including cardiac tachyarrhythmias (especially in the elderly) and bone demineralization (particularly in post-menopausal women) as well as frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis — the risks and benefits of TSH-suppressive therapy must be balanced for each individual patient. Patients whose TSH levels are chronically suppressed should be counseled to ensure adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

The clinical utility of TSH measurement — serum TSH is widely used for diagnosis and screening, with age-specific interpretation needs; in newborns < 3 days of age results are confounded by the postnatal surge, while in newborns 3 days to 1 month a serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally treated as a clinical cutoff requiring immediate action; primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency; in the elderly the upper bound of the TSH reference interval increases with age; interpretation leverages the log-linear relationship between TSH and free thyroxine (fT4) and must consider factors such as iodine intake, age, sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used.

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^f9e258c8]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism management — surgery for TMNG or TA — If surgery is chosen as treatment for TMNG or TA, patients with overt hyperthyroidism should be rendered euthyroid prior to the procedure with methimazole pretreatment (in the absence of allergy to the medication), with or without beta-adrenergic blockade, and preoperative iodine should not be used in this setting. If surgery is chosen as treatment for TMNG, near- total or total thyroidectomy should be performed, and surgery for TMNG should be performed by a high-volume thyroid surgeon. If surgery is chosen as the treatment for TA, an ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy, or isthmusectomy if the adenoma is in the thyroid isthmus, should be performed, and we suggest that surgery for TA be performed by a high-volume surgeon. Following thyroidectomy for TMNG, we suggest that serum calcium or intact parathyroid hormone levels be measured, and that oral calcium and calcitriol supplementation be administered based on these results. Methimazole should be stopped at the time of surgery for TMNG or TA, and Betaadrenergic blockade should be slowly discontinued following surgery. Following surgery for TMNG, thyroid hormone replacement should be started at a dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 mcg/lb or 1.7 mcg/kg) and age, with elderly patients needing somewhat less, and TSH should be measured every 1–2 months until stable, and then annually. Following surgery for TA, TSH and estimated free T4 levels should be obtained 4–6 weeks after surgery, and thyroid hormone supplementation started if there is a persistent rise in TSH above the normal range.

While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

Thyroid hormone suppression of TSH — Postoperative levothyroxine to decrease thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is considered optimal for higher-risk papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, and the NCCN Panel recommends tailoring suppression to individual risk. For known residual carcinoma or high risk of recurrence, the recommended TSH level is < 0.1 mIU/L; for disease-free, low-risk patients, TSH should be maintained at the normal range; and for low-risk patients with imaging negative but concerning Tg, TSH should be maintained at 0.1–0.5 mIU/L. Potential toxicities include cardiac tachyarrhythmias, bone demineralization, and frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis; therefore, an adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 units/day) is recommended when TSH is chronically suppressed, and reports do not suggest altered bone mineral density in patients receiving levothyroxine.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^34ead0d9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

4 Discussion

4.1 Clinical Indications for Treatment with Thyroid Hormones

In line with international guidelines, this survey confirms that LT4 is the preferred treatment among Canadian endocrinologists for patients with hypothyroidism.

Approximately half of the respondents believed that thyroid hormones are never warranted in treatment‐naïve, biochemically euthyroid patients. However, one‐third would consider thyroid hormone therapy for euthyroid women with infertility associated with high thyroid antibody levels. Similarly, 42% of thyroid experts across European countries would also support treatment in these patients. This variation in practice may reflect the recommendation of the 2017 ATA guideline to consider low‐dose LT4 treatment for thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb)‐positive euthyroid women undergoing assisted conception, given its potential benefits in improving pregnancy success compared to limited risk. However, more recent systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials have found no benefit of LT4 in euthyroid women with thyroid autoimmunity, whether pregnant or planning pregnancy, irrespective of the use of assisted conception. Furthermore, an ongoing discussion over the years on the definition of the reference range of thyroid function tests in pregnancy might also affect the response to this question. International guidelines recommend local population‐ and pregnancy‐specific reference intervals for TSH and free T4, according to the laboratory assays used, even though this is not feasible for most centers. Therefore, many centers use the nonpregnant TSH upper reference limit of 4.0 mU/L, a value that may not be applied uncritically to pregnant women.

A mere 7.4% of Canadian endocrinologists indicated prescribing LT4 for patients with a growing goiter, compared to one‐third of European endocrinologists. This different European attitude, more evident in its Eastern regions, could be due to the former presence of areas of low‐iodine intake in which the treatment with thyroid hormones was reported as beneficial for nodular goiter. Accumulating evidence over the past decades has led to abandoning this treatment option based on a lack of clinically significant efficacy.

Overall, treating euthyroid individuals with LT4 has potential risks, and previous studies have shown associations with suppressed TSH in hypothyroid individuals and increased morbidity and mortality. Several factors might explain why physicians adhere to outdated treatment practices, including healthcare resources, patient‐related factors (expectations, age, and culture), and physician characteristics (age, gender, and work institution). This emphasizes the need for a greater focus on disseminating the latest research and guidelines to encourage physicians to follow evidence‐based practices.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — TSH target ranges for treatment: In nonpregnant patients, the target range should be within the normal range, and data are lacking to support targeting low normal or subnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. If third-generation assay normal limits are unavailable, use the NHANES III reference population range of 0.45–4.12. In pregnancy, there are no prospective trials establishing optimal target TSH ranges, and the lower range of normal for serum TSH in pregnancy is generally 0.1–0.2 mIU/L lower than the normal range for nonpregnant individuals.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets in long-term follow-up (Recommendation 70) are response-specific. In patients with a structural incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained below 0.1 mU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L, taking into account the initial ATA risk classification, Tg level, Tg trend over time, and risk of TSH suppression (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients who presented with high-risk disease but have an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, consideration should be given to maintaining thyroid hormone therapy to achieve serum TSH levels of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for up to 5 years after which the degree of TSH suppression can be reduced with continued surveillance for recurrence (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, especially those at low risk for recurrence, the serum TSH may be kept within the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients who have not undergone remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy who demonstrate an excellent or indeterminate response to therapy with a normal neck US, and low or undetectable suppressed serum Tg, and Tg or anti-Tg antibodies that are not rising, the serum TSH can be allowed to rise to the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

Management of TSH resistance

In patients with PHP1A, the average level of TSH is 14.1 ± 10.3 mUI/l, with a range of 1.4 mUI/l to 46.0 mUI/l (refs.). A prompt diagnosis of hypothyroidism after birth and initiation of treatment does not seem to prevent the development of motor or cognitive delay.

In patients with PHP1B, the degree of TSH resistance can vary with time. The average level of TSH is 5.3 ± 4.7 mUI/l (4.8 ± 3.4 mUI/l and 5.4 ± 5.2 mUI/l in autosomal dominant PHP1B and sporadic PHP1B, respectively), ranging from 0.8 mUI/l to 50.0 mUI/l (refs.).

The literature does not contain specific data on how to treat TSH resistance in patients with PHP and related disorders. Indications for treatment, drug formulations, doses and target serum concentrations of TSH and T 4 should be the same as those used in any other form of hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism.

In general, patients should be screened for auto-immune thyroid disease. Nevertheless, because autoimmune thyroid disease is highly prevalent, the presence of autoimmunity will not rule out concomitant TSH resistance in a given patient (see recommendation 3.11).

Recommendations

3.11. Evaluation of thyroid function (including autoantibodies in adolescents and adults) for early detection of TSH resistance and early intervention is recommended in all patients with PHP and related disorders at diagnosis. Thereafter, TSH monitoring is recommended every 6 months in patients < 5 years of age and yearly in older children and adults (A++).

3.12. The indication or indications to treat hypothyroidism, the dosage of levothyroxine and the therapeutic goals should be the same as for any patient with hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism – (A++).

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^2482b1d4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^48e51440]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: screening and management [^f20d5445]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Elevated TSH and normal FT4 — infant hyperthyrotropinemia management is guided by expert opinion using confirmatory thresholds and close follow-up. On the basis of expert opinion, if the confirmatory serum TSH is > 20 mIU/L, L-T4 treatment should be initiated even if FT4 is normal. If the confirmatory serum TSH is elevated but ≤ 20 mIU/L, treatment may be initiated, or alternatively serum TSH and FT4 may be followed closely every 1 to 2 weeks without treatment. Because repeated TSH elevation above 10 mIU/L has been associated with adverse outcomes in children with congenital hypothyroidism, expert opinion suggests that persistent TSH elevation > 10 mIU/L is an indication to initiate L-T4 treatment. For persistent elevations between 5 and 10 mIU/L after 4 weeks of age, the upper limit of normal TSH in infants age 1 to 3 months is around 4.1 to 4.8 mIU/L, and although TSH elevation above 5 mIU/L beyond 1 to 3 months is generally abnormal, there is insufficient evidence to support treatment versus observation; consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist can facilitate a patient-specific management plan.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy — outcome evidence and degree of suppression: A meta-analysis supported efficacy of TSH suppression therapy in preventing major adverse clinical events with RR = 0.73 (CI 0.60–0.88), p < 0.05. A large RCT from Japan showed disease-free survival was equivalent with normal TSH (0.4–5 mU/L) compared with LT4 suppression therapy (TSH < 0.01 mU/L). Retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated that TSH suppression to below 0.1 mU/L may improve outcomes in high-risk patients, with no such evidence of benefit in low-risk patients, and higher degrees of suppression to < 0.03 mU/L may offer no additional benefit. In a prospective, nonrandomized cohort study of 2936 patients, overall survival improved significantly when TSH was suppressed to undetectable levels in NTCTCSG stage III or IV disease and to the subnormal to undetectable range in stage II disease; however, there was no incremental benefit from suppressing to undetectable levels in stage II and suppression of TSH was not beneficial in NTCTCSG stage I disease.

Key Points

Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care.
Adjustment of the screening strategy will reduce costs, unnecessary follow-up and patient concerns.
An alternative strategy is to elevate the TSH cutoff value; this also led to improved positive predictive value (PPV) for clinical hypothyroidism

### How selective are the new guidelines for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism for patients with thyrotropin levels at or below 10 mIU / L? [^8963958e]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By consensus, a thyrotropin (TSH) level persistently > 10mIU/L is an indication for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Controversy exists regarding patients whose TSH level is elevated but < 10mIU/L. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published their position about factors that should be considered in the decision on treating SCH. This study evaluated the frequency of these factors among adult (non-pregnant) women with SCH whose TSH levels are ≤ 10mIU/L.

Methods

The presence of the conditions that should be considered for the treatment of SCH according to ATA and AACE was evaluated in 252 women who were diagnosed with SCH and had TSH levels ≤ 10mIU/L. Pregnant women were excluded.

Results

Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) were detected in 137 (54.3%) women. A high cardiovascular risk was observed in 43 (17%) women. Eighty (31.7%) women who were not at high cardiovascular risk presented at least one classical risk factor (arterial hypertension, elevated level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoking, or first-degree family history of premature coronary artery disease). At least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism that could not be explained by another condition was observed in 180 (71.4%) women. Two hundred thirty-two (92%) women had positive TPOAbs, or at least one classical cardiovascular risk factor, or at least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

According to the new ATA and AACE guidelines, L-T4 therapy would be considered for 92% of women with SCH and TSH ≤ 10mIU/L.

Conclusions

This update of the consensus guidelines on CH recommends worldwide neonatal screening and appropriate diagnostics — including genetics — to assess the cause of both primary and central hypothyroidism. The expert panel recommends the immediate start of correctly dosed LT4 treatment, and frequent follow-up including laboratory testing and dose adjustments to keep TH levels in their target ranges, timely assessments of the need to continue treatment, attention for neurodevelopmental and neurosensory functions and, if necessary, consulting other health professionals, and education of the child and family about CH. Harmonization of diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up will optimize patient outcomes. Lastly, all individuals with CH are entitled to a well-planned transition of care from pediatrics to adult medicine. This consensus guidelines update should be used to further optimize detection, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of children with all forms of CH in the light of the most recent evidence. It should be helpful in convincing health authorities of the benefits of neonatal screening for CH. Despite ∼50 years of neonatal screening for CH, some important questions remain, such as the genetic etiology of TD, the assumed harm of subclinical CH, that is, a normal fT4 in combination with an elevated TSH, and the cause of the gradually increased incidence of CH with GIS. Further epidemiological and experimental studies are needed to understand the increased incidence of this condition.

Pediatric Dosage - Congenital or Acquired Hypothyroidism

The recommended daily dose of EUTHYROX in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 1. Start EUTHYROX at the full daily dose in most pediatric patients. Start at a lower starting dose in newborns (0 to 3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and in children at risk for hyperactivity (see below). Monitor for clinical and laboratory response [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure:

Consider a lower starting dose in newborns at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity:

To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: EUTHYROX dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of EUTHYROX by 12.5 mcg daily to 25 mcg daily and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable EUTHYROX dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce EUTHYROX dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure EUTHYROX dose is appropriate.

New Onset Hypothyroidism: Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. In patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day). In patients with mild hypothyroidism (TSH less than 10 mIU per liter) start EUTHYROX at 1 mcg per kg body weight per day. Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust EUTHYROX dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer

The dose of EUTHYROX should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require a EUTHYROX dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day, depending on the target level for TSH suppression.
