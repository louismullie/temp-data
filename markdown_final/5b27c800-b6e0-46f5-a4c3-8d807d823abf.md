## Question

Empagliflozin for acute kidney injury

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of empagliflozin in acute kidney injury, including if it treats AKI, prevents AKI, and whether to continue it during an AKI or acute illness episode. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise clinical indication and what labeling and trials actually support. Then, I should evaluate evidence for AKI prevention versus risk. Next, I will review safety signals and guideline recommendations about withholding during acute illness. After that, I should examine data on initiation or continuation in acute settings. Finally, I will synthesize practical, guideline-concordant recommendations and summarize the risk–benefit balance.

> Let me first confirm the indication and scope, because I need to ensure I'm not extrapolating from CKD data to AKI treatment without evidence. Empagliflozin is indicated for chronic kidney disease to slow progression and for heart failure, and it improves cardiorenal outcomes in EMPA-KIDNEY, but it is not approved to treat established AKI or to reverse AKI once present [^115yzbag] [^112kjQJi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about harm or benefit in AKI without considering prevention data in stable populations. I will now examine whether empagliflozin reduces the risk of future AKI events in at-risk patients, and the signal is consistent: a network meta-analysis across event-driven trials showed SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin, lower AKI risk versus placebo, and a meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials also found fewer AKI events with SGLT2 inhibitors, with supportive real-world cohorts showing reduced AKI hospitalizations in older adults and routine practice settings [^114xGfzL] [^111ohiNz] [^112bvvTt] [^113sGjYN] [^116GQcvS].

> Wait, let me verify the safety context and guideline stance during acute stressors, because that determines whether to hold therapy when AKI might occur. The FDA labeling highlights intravascular volume depletion with empagliflozin, with post-marketing reports of AKI, so assessment and correction of volume status before initiation and vigilance in higher-risk groups are required, and major guidelines (KDIGO 2024 and UK Kidney Association 2023) recommend temporarily withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness, prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical illness when ketosis and hypovolemia risks are higher [^114GKRu7] [^112SxcxZ] [^113eHypy] [^115nTXzm].

> Let me consider how to distinguish a benign hemodynamic eGFR dip from true AKI, because misclassification can lead to unnecessary discontinuation. SGLT2 inhibitors predictably cause an early, reversible decline in eGFR related to reduced intraglomerular pressure rather than structural tubular injury, and UK guidance advises interpreting early eGFR changes cautiously to avoid unwarranted stopping of therapy, which aligns with mechanistic and post hoc analyses from CREDENCE on the initial eGFR dip [^115nTXzm] [^113p1Ukb].

> Next, I should review initiation or continuation during acute illness, but I need to acknowledge that direct AKI-treatment trials are lacking. Trials initiating SGLT2 inhibitors during acute conditions are limited yet reassuring: in acute heart failure (EMPULSE), empagliflozin numerically reduced investigator-reported AKI events versus placebo, and in acute COVID-19 hospitalization (DARE-19), dapagliflozin did not increase AKI and showed numerically fewer events, though guidelines remain conservative about use during acute illness pending more definitive AKI-focused data [^117V8BKX] [^117TamWh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, before giving practical advice I should ensure I'm integrating both prevention benefits and real-world safety with guideline-concordant actions. For established AKI or during acute illness with hypovolemia, hypotension, or perioperative fasting, I should advise temporarily withholding empagliflozin, assessing and correcting volume status, and then resuming when clinically stable; in stable CKD and HF populations, continuation delivers long-term kidney and cardiovascular protection that also translates into fewer AKI events over time, consistent with EMPA-KIDNEY and meta-analytic estimates of reduced AKI risk [^115nTXzm] [^112SxcxZ] [^113eHypy] [^112kjQJi] [^117AeSck] [^114xGfzL] [^111ohiNz].

> I should double-check monitoring advice, because I initially thought to schedule routine labs at 1–2 weeks for everyone after initiation to confirm the expected eGFR pattern; hold on, I should verify guideline language. UK Kidney Association guidance states that early kidney function testing is not routinely required after starting an SGLT2 inhibitor, though in higher-risk patients or those on aggressive diuresis an individualized early check can be reasonable, and counseling on hypovolemia symptoms with potential diuretic dose adjustments is advised, which I will align with FDA advice to assess volume status before initiation [^115nTXzm] [^114GKRu7].

> But wait, what if the presentation is active AKI right now and we're considering empagliflozin as a treatment? I need to ensure I'm clear: there are no randomized data supporting empagliflozin to treat established AKI, and standard AKI evaluation for etiology and correction of precipitating factors should proceed per best-practice guidance rather than adding SGLT2 inhibition during the active injury phase, with resumption considered only after recovery and stabilization [^115yzbag] [^115i7BJs].

> Let me synthesize the final recommendation. Empagliflozin is not indicated to treat established AKI and should generally be held during AKI or acute illness; in stable CKD and HF populations, it confers robust kidney and cardiovascular benefits with an associated reduction in AKI events over time, and clinicians should anticipate a modest reversible eGFR dip after initiation, manage volume status carefully, and follow guideline advice to pause therapy around acute stressors and surgery before resuming when safe [^115yzbag] [^112kjQJi] [^117AeSck] [^114xGfzL] [^114GKRu7] [^112SxcxZ] [^113eHypy] [^115nTXzm] [^113p1Ukb].

---

Empagliflozin is **not indicated for treating or preventing acute kidney injury (AKI)** [^115yzbag] and should be **withheld during acute illness or AKI** [^112SxcxZ] because of the risk of volume depletion and a transient eGFR decline [^114GKRu7]. While SGLT2 inhibitors reduce AKI risk in chronic kidney disease [^112kjQJi] and heart failure populations [^111ohiNz] [^114xGfzL], there is **no evidence to support initiation during AKI** [^115nTXzm]. If AKI occurs, stop empagliflozin [^114GKRu7], correct volume status, and monitor renal function; restart only after recovery and stabilization [^112SxcxZ].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms relevant to AKI

Empagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the proximal tubule, reducing glucose and sodium reabsorption and thereby increasing natriuresis and osmotic diuresis [^115gRbL1]. This can cause **intravascular volume depletion** and a transient eGFR decline [^114GKRu7], especially in patients with impaired renal function, older adults, or those on loop diuretics. These hemodynamic effects are typically reversible on discontinuation [^113p1Ukb].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding AKI risk

### Clinical trials and observational studies

- **EMPA-KIDNEY trial**: In CKD patients (with or without diabetes), empagliflozin reduced kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death [^112kjQJi], with a small, reversible initial eGFR dip [^115e4SnC] and no excess serious renal adverse events [^115KEygn].

- **EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial**: In T2DM with cardiovascular disease, empagliflozin reduced incident or worsening nephropathy [^116BsyB6] and slowed eGFR decline, with a transient initial eGFR dip that stabilized over time [^112MVzQg].

- **Meta-analyses**: SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a lower AKI risk versus placebo or other glucose-lowering drugs [^111ohiNz] (HR ~0.66–0.76) [^114xGfzL].

---

### Post-marketing surveillance

Post-marketing surveillance has prompted **FDA warnings** regarding AKI with empagliflozin [^114GKRu7], sometimes requiring hospitalization or dialysis, with risk higher in patients with impaired renal function, older adults, or those on loop diuretics [^115yzbag].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not recommend empagliflozin for AKI treatment or prevention; they emphasize **withholding during acute illness or AKI** and careful monitoring [^113ZUSG3]. Specific guidance includes **KDIGO 2024**, which recommends withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical illness due to ketosis risk [^112SxcxZ], and the **UK Kidney Association 2023**, which advises temporarily stopping SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness while interpreting early eGFR declines cautiously as expected drug effects [^115nTXzm].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations

Empagliflozin is **not recommended** for AKI treatment or prevention in any clinical scenario. It is, however, beneficial in CKD [^112kjQJi] and heart failure populations [^115xgKFA] for reducing kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events [^111ohiNz], with a favorable AKI safety profile in these settings [^114xGfzL].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

When using empagliflozin in patients at risk of AKI, clinicians should:

- **Assess volume status**: Correct volume depletion before initiation [^114GKRu7].

- **Monitor renal function**: Check renal function after initiation and during therapy, especially in high-risk patients [^114GKRu7].

- **Withhold during acute illness**: Temporarily stop during acute illness, surgery, or critical illness [^112SxcxZ] [^115nTXzm].

- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Watch for volume depletion, hypotension, and urinary tract infections [^114GKRu7].

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical context** | **Evidence summary** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| AKI treatment | No evidence supporting use [^115nTXzm] | Not recommended [^112SxcxZ] |
| AKI prevention | No evidence supporting use [^113ZUSG3] | Not recommended [^112SxcxZ] |
| CKD progression | Strong evidence of benefit [^112kjQJi] | Recommended |
| Heart failure | Strong evidence of benefit [^115xgKFA] | Recommended |
| Acute illness or AKI | Risk of volume depletion and transient eGFR decline [^114GKRu7] | Withhold temporarily [^112SxcxZ] |

---

Empagliflozin is **not indicated for AKI treatment or prevention** [^115yzbag]; it should be withheld during acute illness or AKI [^112SxcxZ] because of the risk of volume depletion and a transient eGFR decline [^114GKRu7]. It is beneficial in CKD and heart failure for slowing kidney disease progression and reducing cardiovascular events [^112kjQJi] [^115xgKFA], with a favorable AKI safety profile in these populations [^114xGfzL].

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112kjQJi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The study EMPA-KIDNEY was published by the EMPA-KIDNEY Collaborative Group and colleagues in 2023 in the journal New England Journal of Medicine. This study focused on chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The trial question was, what is the role of empagliflozin in patients with CKD?

The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population included 6,609 patients, composed of 2,192 females and 4,417 males. Inclusion criteria specified patients with CKD and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between ≥ 20 and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², or ≥ 45 and < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 200. Key exclusion criteria were polycystic kidney disease and prior kidney transplant recipients.

- **Interventions**:
	1. Empagliflozin (10 mg/day), n = 3,304
	2. Placebo, n = 3,305

- **Primary outcome**:
	- Significant decrease in progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes (13.1% vs. 16.9%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in hospitalization for heart failure (HF) or death from cardiovascular causes (4% vs. 4.6%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.07).
	- Significant decrease in the incidence of hospitalization for any cause (24.8 events/100 person-years vs. 29.2 events/100 person-years; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95).
	- No significant difference in death from any cause (4.5% vs. 5.1%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.08).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in serious adverse events was noted.

### Acute kidney injury with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors: A meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials [^111ohiNz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Three multicentre, large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cardiovascular outcomes with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have each shown substantial reductions in rates of hospitalization for heart failure and the progression of chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes. However, safety concerns remain for this ostensibly paradigm-shifting drug class. In particular, the US Food and Drug Administration has highlighted the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), a condition associated with high morbidity and mortality.

To investigate this further, we conducted a meta-analysis of the three trials to compare the frequency of AKI adverse event reports between participants treated with placebo and those who had received an SGLT2 inhibitor. Rather than an increase, we noted a consistent and robust reduction in the likelihood of AKI among those participants who had been randomized to receive an SGLT2 inhibitor (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.54–0.80). We further noted that the reports of AKI were similar in frequency to those of kidney disease progression.

The caveats of the non-adjudicated reporting of AKI in the trials notwithstanding, these data suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors may protect vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes from AKI, and prospective studies to evaluate this additional aspect of kidney protection are warranted.

### Synjardy [^114GKRu7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Volume depletion**: Empagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. In patients with volume depletion, correct this condition before initiating SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR. Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion and renal function after initiating therapy.

- **Urosepsis and pyelonephritis**: There have been reports of serious urinary tract infections, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis, requiring hospitalization in patients receiving empagliflozin. Treatment with empagliflozin increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Hypoglycemia**: Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. In adult patients, the risk of hypoglycemia may be increased when SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g. sulfonylurea) or insulin.

### Insights from CREDENCE trial indicate an acute drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate during treatment with canagliflozin with implications for clinical practice [^113p1Ukb]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

Canagliflozin slows the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and induces a reversible acute drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), believed to be a hemodynamic effect. Predictors of the initial drop and its association with long-term eGFR trajectories and safety outcomes are unknown. To assess this, we performed a post-hoc analysis of 4,289 participants in the CREDENCE trial with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease equally split into treatment and placebo groups who had eGFR measured at both baseline and week three.

The eGFR was categorized at week three as follows: greater than a 10% decline, between 0 and 10% decline, and no decline. Long-term eGFR trajectories and safety outcomes were estimated in each category of acute eGFR change by linear mixed-effects models and Cox regression, after adjustment for baseline characteristics and medication use. Significantly more participants in the canagliflozin group (45%) compared to the placebo group (21%) experienced an acute drop in eGFR over 10%. An over 30% drop occurred infrequently (4% of participants with canagliflozin and 2% with placebo). The odds ratio for a drop in eGFR over 10% with canagliflozin compared to placebo was significant at 3.03 (95% confidence interval 2.65, 3.47).

Following the initial drop in eGFR, multivariable adjusted long-term eGFR trajectories, as well as overall and kidney safety profiles in those treated with canagliflozin, were similar across eGFR decline categories. Thus, although acute drops in eGFR over 10% occurred in nearly half of all participants, follow-up data indicate…

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: a prespecified secondary analysis from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^115e4SnC]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). Low credibility.

Randomized trials of SGLT2i have consistently shown that this class of treatment reduces the risk of progression of kidney disease (measured with dichotomous outcomes) in patients with CKD, with or without diabetes, irrespective of the underlying primary kidney disease. Secondary analyses of two previous trials of SGLT2i in CKD populations found some evidence that the effects of SGLT2i on eGFR slope varied in different types of patients. However, because the trials only recruited patients with significant albuminuria, they were limited in their ability to explore whether this effect varied according to baseline albuminuria and other clinical characteristics.

Here, we present the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on eGFR slope from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, which recruited a uniquely broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression. This includes those with minimal albuminuria, low eGFR, and with and without diabetes.

### Empagliflozin and progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes [^116BsyB6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Diabetes confers an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal events. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. We wanted to determine the long-term renal effects of empagliflozin, an analysis that was a prespecified component of the secondary microvascular outcome of that trial.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area to receive either empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo once daily. Prespecified renal outcomes included incident or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of the serum creatinine level, initiation of renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal disease) and incident albuminuria.

- **Results**: Incident or worsening nephropathy occurred in 525 of 4124 patients (12.7%) in the empagliflozin group and in 388 of 2061 (18.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.70; P < 0.001). Doubling of the serum creatinine level occurred in 70 of 4645 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin group and in 60 of 2323 (2.6%) in the placebo group, leading to a significant relative risk reduction of 44%. Renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 13 of 4687 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin group and in 14 of 2333 patients (0.6%) in the placebo group, representing a 55% relative risk reduction.

### Network meta-analysis of novel glucose-lowering drugs on risk of acute kidney injury [^114xGfzL]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Little is known about the comparative effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), or sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). This study aimed to compare the effects of these three novel classes of glucose-lowering drugs on AKI risk in patients with or without type 2 diabetes by conducting a network meta-analysis of event-driven cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: We systematically searched electronic databases up to September 2020 and included 20 event-driven cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials. Out of these, 18 trials included patients with type 2 diabetes only, and two trials included patients with or without type 2 diabetes. A network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach was performed to compare the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1RAs, or SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of AKI and estimate the probability for each intervention as the safest one. The primary analysis included 18 trials with type 2 diabetes only, and a secondary analysis included 20 trials.

- **Results**: In the 18 trials with a total of 2051 AKI events (range: 1–300) among 156,690 patients with type 2 diabetes only, our network meta-analysis revealed that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a lower risk of AKI compared with placebo (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.88), whereas both DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs had neutral effects on the risk of AKI. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors were significantly associated with a lower risk of AKI than both GLP-1RAs.

### Synjardy [^115KEygn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the EMPA-KIDNEY study, empagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint. This included a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, an eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m², progression to end-stage kidney disease, or cardiovascular or renal death. The treatment effect was primarily reflected by reductions in sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m², progression to end-stage kidney disease, and cardiovascular death. Notably, there were few renal deaths during the trial.

Empagliflozin also lessened the risk of first and recurrent hospitalizations; however, the information collected on the reasons for hospitalization was insufficient to further characterize this benefit. Due to the metformin HCl component, SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are not indicated for patients with chronic kidney disease who do not have type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The effect of empagliflozin in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint was consistent among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.54, 0.78)] and for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin HCl as background therapy [HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.48, 1.09)].

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 update [^115nTXzm]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

- **Recommendations for implementation**: Acute kidney injury (AKI), hypovolaemia, and potassium. We recommend that individuals initiated on an SGLT-2 inhibitor do not routinely require an early assessment of kidney function or potassium following the initiation of treatment (Grade 1C). We suggest that if an individual has a kidney function assessment within the first few weeks post initiation of an SGLT-2 inhibitor, a decline in eGFR needs to be interpreted with caution and in the context of an expected drug effect to avoid unwarranted discontinuation of treatment (Grade 2B). We suggest that individuals on diuretics are counselled on the symptoms of hypovolaemia and advised to seek medical attention if they develop any such symptoms after starting SGLT-2 inhibition (Grade 2B). We suggest that clinicians consider an early clinical review and, if appropriate, a diuretic or antihypertensive dose reduction in individuals they consider at high risk of hypovolaemia (Grade 2C). We recommend that SGLT-2 inhibitors are temporarily withheld during acute illness (Grade 1C).

- **Rationale**: SGLT-2 inhibitors have proven benefits in relation to reducing the rate of long-term decline in kidney function in certain groups of people with CKD. The means by which they provide this benefit may involve changes to intraglomerular pressure and reduction in hyperfiltration at an individual glomerulus level. This can result in a reduction in eGFR over the initial few weeks following initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors, which is relatively small and largely reversible and should not usually be seen as an adverse effect.

### Cardiac and kidney benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure across the spectrum of kidney function: Insights from EMPEROR-Reduced [^115xgKFA]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

In EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction), empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization and total HF hospitalizations, and slowed the progressive decline in kidney function in patients with HF and a reduced ejection fraction, with and without diabetes. We aim to study the effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across the spectrum of kidney function.

- **Methods**: In this prespecified analysis, patients were categorized by the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 300 mg/g). The primary and key secondary outcomes were: (1) a composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization (primary outcome); (2) total HF hospitalizations; and (3) eGFR slope. The direct impact on kidney events was investigated by a prespecified composite kidney outcome (defined as a sustained profound decline in eGFR, chronic dialysis, or transplant). The median follow-up was 16 months.

- **Results**: Of 3730 patients who were randomized to empagliflozin or placebo, 1978 (53%) had CKD. Empagliflozin reduced the primary outcome and total HF hospitalizations in patients with and without CKD: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65–0.93) and HR = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.58–0.90), respectively (interaction P = 0.63). Empagliflozin slowed the slope of eGFR decline by 1.11 (0.23–1.98) ml/min/1.73 m²/yr in patients with CKD and by 2.41 (1.49–3.32) ml/min/1.73 m²/y.

### Empagliflozin improves kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure [^112MVzQg]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). High credibility.

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients), empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. Post hoc, we evaluated the effects of empagliflozin on kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure (HF).

- **Methods and results**: Individuals were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or a placebo. Prespecified analyses by baseline HF status included risk assessments of incident or worsening nephropathy and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope analyses. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the consistency of treatment effects across subgroups. Safety evaluations included monitoring for kidney-related adverse events.

At baseline, 244 (10.5%) and 462 (9.9%) patients had HF in the placebo and empagliflozin groups, respectively. Overall, the incidence of kidney outcome events was higher in patients with HF than those without. In the HF group, empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or worsening nephropathy or cardiovascular death by 43% (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42–0.77]) and progression to macroalbuminuria by 50% (hazard ratio, 0.50 [0.33–0.75]). After an initial transient decrease, the estimated glomerular filtration rate stabilized over time with empagliflozin, but gradually declined with placebo. Kidney effects in patients with HF were consistent with those in the overall study population (all P values for interaction > 0.05). Across groups, the incidence rate of kidney-related adverse events per 100 patient-years was higher.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 update [^113ZUSG3]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Large placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated kidney and cardiovascular clinical benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors. Data from the EMPA-KIDNEY and DELIVER trials and associated meta-analyses triggered an update to the UK Kidney Association Clinical Practice Guideline on Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) Inhibition in Adults with Kidney Disease. We provide a summary of the full guideline and highlight the rationale for recent updates. The use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in people with specific medical conditions is also considered. This includes type 1 diabetes, kidney transplants, and individuals admitted to hospital with heart failure.

- **Recommendations for future research**: Suggestions for future studies are outlined.

- **Recommendations for implementation**: Guidelines for practical application in clinical settings are provided.

A full "lay" summary of the guidelines is appended to ensure that these guidelines are accessible and understandable to people who are not medical professionals.

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin added to existing antidiabetes treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115gRbL1]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). High credibility.

Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Optimum glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is important to minimise the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and to slow the progression of CKD. We assessed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

- **Methods**: We conducted a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial at 127 centres in 15 countries. Patients with HbA1c of 7% or greater to 10% or less were eligible for inclusion. Patients with stage 2 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min per 1.73 m²; n = 290) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. Patients with stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²; n = 374) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo for 52 weeks. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated random sequence and stratified by renal impairment, HbA1c, and background antidiabetes medication. Treatment assignment was masked from patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 by ANCOVA in the full analysis set.

- **Findings**: In patients with stage 2 CKD, adjusted mean treatment differences versus placebo in changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 were -0.52% (95% CI -0.72 to -0.32) for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.68% (-0.88 to -0.49) for empagliflozin 25 mg.

### Comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin versus other antihyperglycemics on risk of major adverse kidney events [^112XM4J8]. Diabetes Care (2020). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the comparative effectiveness of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) empagliflozin and other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics on the risk of major adverse kidney events (MAKE), defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline of more than 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or all-cause mortality.

- **Research design and methods**: In a cohort study involving 379,033 new users of empagliflozin or other non-SGLT2i antihyperglycemics, predefined variables and covariates identified by a high-dimensional variable selection algorithm were used to build propensity scores. Weighted survival analyses were then applied to estimate the risk of MAKE.

- **Results**: Compared with other antihyperglycemics, empagliflozin usage was associated with a 0.99 (95% CI 0.51, 1.55) mL/min/1.73 m² less annual reduction in eGFR and a 0.25 (95% CI 0.16, 0.33) kg/m² greater annual decrease in BMI. There was also a reduced risk of MAKE with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.68 (95% CI 0.64, 0.73). The reduced risk of MAKE with empagliflozin use was observed in eGFR categories: ≥ 90, ≥ 60 to < 90, ≥ 45 to < 60, and ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², with HRs of 0.70 (95% CI 0.60, 0.82), 0.66 (0.60, 0.73), 0.78 (0.69, 0.89), and 0.71 (0.55, 0.92), respectively. The benefit was evident among participants without albuminuria, as well as those with microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, with HRs of 0.65 (95% CI 0.57, 0.75), 0.72 (0.66, 0.79), and 0.74 (0.62, 0.88), respectively. Additionally, both participants with and without cardiovascular disease exhibited reduced risk, with HRs of 0.67 (95% CI 0.61, 0.74) and 0.76 (0.69, 0.83), respectively. The association was evident in per-protocol analyses, which required the continuation of the assigned antihyperglycemic medication.

### Effects of empagliflozin on fluid overload, weight, and blood pressure in CKD [^11433QbH]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

The study EMPA-KIDNEY demonstrated the clear benefits of SGLT2 inhibition on kidney disease progression in a wide range of patients with CKD at risk of progression, including about a one-third reduction in the risk of needing to start kidney replacement therapy. This large EMPA-KIDNEY substudy benefits from its sample size, long duration, systematic measurements, and randomized double-blind design. These factors help ensure that between-group differences are unbiased and reliable.

- **Study limitations**: The BCM device has some technical limitations. For example, BCM parameters are derived, not direct measurements, and are based on formulae normalized to healthy reference populations. Estimations may also be less accurate at extremes of "fluid overload", although extremes of levels were uncommon in the substudy population. Furthermore, imprecision in fat mass estimates means the lack of statistical effect on fat mass does not exclude some effect. The BCM device also does not reliably assess subtypes of adiposity (e.g. visceral versus peripheral).

- **Impact of COVID-19**: Follow-up was affected by coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions, resulting in some missed bioimpedance measurements. The prespecified key secondary composite analysis was underpowered because of lower cardiovascular risk in the trial population than was predicted during its design. Nevertheless, this substudy collected sufficient data to provide reliable and clear results for the primary and other continuously measured outcomes.

- **Demographic considerations**: Owing to the regions contributing to the substudy, Asian, Black, Mixed, and other races were underrepresented, but effects on weight.

### Influence of endpoint definitions on the effect of empagliflozin on major renal outcomes in the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^113zpiQF]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

The EMPEROR‐Preserved trial was a large, international, double‐blind, and placebo‐controlled trial of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction. Patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction greater than 40% were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or empagliflozin for a median duration of 26 months. Empagliflozin reduced the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization by 21% [hazard ratio 0.79 (95% CI 0.69–0.90)] and decreased total (first and recurrent) hospitalizations for heart failure by 27% [hazard ratio 0.73 (95% CI 0.61–0.88)].

When the influence of baseline ejection fraction on these results was evaluated according to prespecified subgroups of 41–49%, 50–59%, and ≥ 60%, the baseline ejection fraction did not influence the effect of empagliflozin on the primary endpoint. However, ejection fraction did influence the effect of empagliflozin on total hospitalizations for heart failure (P-trend = 0.008), with an attenuated effect in patients with an ejection fraction ≥ 60%.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^117NHFcY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Slowing chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and avoiding end-stage kidney disease (ESKD, i.e. the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation) is highly desirable given the associated adverse effects on quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and high economic costs. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was established to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition with empagliflozin in a broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression. Findings from the active part of this trial and other large trials provided compelling evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors substantially slowed kidney disease progression and reduced cardiovascular risk. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and acute kidney injury in patients with CKD and other high-risk conditions, including diabetes and heart failure.

Post-trial follow-up tests how benefits evolve once participants stop the study drug, as it is possible that additional cardiorenal benefits or harms could emerge after its discontinuation. Our trial was relatively short, as it was stopped early for efficacy following a median of two years of follow-up. Consequently, there were a lower number of primary outcomes in participants who progressed more slowly, and a low number of ESKD and fatal outcomes. Post-trial follow-up provides particular value through prospectively collecting more ESKD outcomes, as these outcomes take longer to accrue than surrogates of progression, e.g. percentage declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

### SGLT2 inhibition in chronic kidney disease: A preventive strategy against acute kidney injury at the same time [^115SB6bf]. Kidney International (2022). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are known to slow down the progression of chronic kidney disease. However, theoretical concerns still exist that SGLT2 inhibitors could increase the risk of acute kidney injury. Heerspink et al. revealed that dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of abrupt declines in kidney function during the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial. Their findings may serve to reassure clinicians prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors to patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Dapagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116uf9ia]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The DAPA-CKD study was published by Hiddo J. L. Heerspink and colleagues in 2020 in The New England Journal of Medicine. This study pertains to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The trial investigated the role of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD. The study design was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The population included 4,304 patients (1,425 female, 2,879 male). Inclusion criteria required adult patients with CKD, while key exclusion criteria included a documented diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM); polycystic kidney disease; lupus nephritis, or ANCA-associated vasculitis; receipt of immunotherapy for kidney disease within the past six months.

- **Interventions**:
	- Dapagliflozin group (n = 2,152): 10 mg once daily.
	- Placebo group (n = 2,152): matching placebo once daily.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- Significant decrease in the composite outcome of sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes (9.2% in dapagliflozin group vs. 14.5% in placebo group; HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.72).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in the composite outcome of sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal causes (6.6% vs. 11.3%; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.68).
	- Significant decrease in the composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure (4.6% vs. 6.4%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.92).
	- Significant decrease in death from any cause (4.7% vs. 6.8%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.88).

This study highlights the potential benefits of dapagliflozin in reducing the progression of CKD and associated morbidity and mortality.

### Secondary analysis of the EMPACT-MI trial reveals cardiovascular-kidney efficacy and safety of empagliflozin after acute myocardial infarction [^116dTxPJ]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

In EMPACT-MI (Study to Evaluate the Effect of Empagliflozin on Hospitalization for Heart Failure and Mortality in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction), the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin reduced heart failure (HF) events among patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and an increased risk for HF, although without improvement in all-cause mortality. Patients with acute MI have a high burden of kidney dysfunction, with about 40% having chronic kidney disease (CKD) and high rates of acute decompensated HF.

Data regarding the cardiovascular–kidney efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with acute MI with variable kidney function are limited. DAPA-MI (Dapagliflozin Effects on Cardiometabolic Outcomes in Patients With an Acute Heart Attack) was the only other clinical trial to evaluate SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with acute MI, but it had limited enrollment of patients with kidney dysfunction, few HF events, and did not assess kidney outcomes. Studies of patients with HF have shown the benefit and safety of initiating SGLT2 inhibitors early, among many patients at index hospital admission, but have not assessed the safety in patients with acute MI. It is especially important to understand this safety profile among patients with acute MI because these individuals have a high risk for acute kidney injuries (AKIs), substantial risk for volume depletion or hypotension, and regular exposure to kidney stressors, such as contrast for imaging or cardiac catheterization or kidney-function-altering medications.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1154sVsb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The pre-specified primary post-trial assessment was the effect of allocation to empagliflozin during the original active trial on the time to the composite outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death occurring at any time during the entire follow-up period (i.e. the active trial and post-trial follow-up periods combined). Kidney disease progression was defined as a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline from randomization, ESKD, a sustained eGFR below 10 mL/min/1.73m², or death from kidney failure. Confirmation of "sustained" required values on two consecutive eGFR measurements at least 30 days apart, or was assumed if it was the last eGFR value before death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of a participant's follow-up. In primary analyses, previously reported primary outcomes from the active trial period were carried over irrespective of later eGFR results collected during the post-trial period. As central samples were not collected during the post-trial follow-up period, all eGFR-based post-trial measurements were relative to the local eGFR measurement at baseline (see Supplementary Methods for more details).

- **Secondary outcomes**: The post-trial follow-up protocol pre-specified key secondary outcomes of kidney disease progression alone and the composite of death from any cause or ESKD. The other secondary outcome was ESKD.

- **Tertiary outcomes**: These included death from any cause and, separately, death from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes (the latter being the safety outcome for post-trial follow-up), and the primary outcome assessed by key subgroups of interest.

### Short commentary on empagliflozin and its potential clinical impact [^116Kv8EB]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of drugs developed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They target the kidney by reducing renal glucose reabsorption and promoting urinary glucose excretion, which reduces hyperglycemia in individuals with T2DM. The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin has gained approval in the EU and the United States for the treatment of adults with T2DM (there is no indication for type 1 diabetes). Empagliflozin has shown a good efficacy and safety profile from clinical trials when given as monotherapy and as an add-on therapy to other glucose-lowering agents. This short commentary reviews the key efficacy and safety data from empagliflozin phase III trials and examines the potential role this agent may have in the management of T2DM.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^1128WzLB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

EMPA-KIDNEY's primary outcome incorporates a ≥ 40% decline in eGFR from the randomization value in the trial definition of kidney disease progression, compared with the larger ≥ 50% decline in eGFR pre-specified by DAPA-CKD and doubling of creatinine (effectively a ≥ 57% decline in eGFR) utilized in CREDENCE. EMPA-KIDNEY employed such a definition as it aimed to recruit a large proportion of people with low levels of albuminuria and without DM who are predicted to progress more slowly than people with albuminuric diabetic CKD. Smaller percentage declines in eGFR ensure such people contribute to the primary outcome. However, when testing interventions, which can cause an acute initial decline in eGFR (such as SGLT-2 inhibitors), smaller percentage declines in eGFR may be a less specific surrogate of progression to ESKD than large percentage declines. The EMPA-KIDNEY DAP has therefore pre-specified exploratory analyses of the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on a composite of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death using alternative eGFR thresholds, thereby allowing some harmonization across the three trials.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute kidney injury, specifically with respect to evaluation for etiology, the ERBP 2012 guidelines recommend determining the cause of AKI whenever possible.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes [^112B4tCc]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

For specific circumstances involving chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus, the DC 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors with proven renal benefits, such as empagliflozin or canagliflozin. These inhibitors may help reduce the risk of nephropathy progression in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have clinical cardiovascular disease and an estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², particularly if glycemic targets are not achieved with existing antihyperglycemic medications.

### Impact of diabetes on the effects of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes: Collaborative meta-analysis of large placebo-controlled trials [^117AeSck]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Based on the average risk in different trial populations, we estimated that for every 1,000 patients with chronic kidney disease treated for one year with an SGLT2 inhibitor, 11 first kidney disease progression events would be prevented in patients with diabetes, and 15 would be prevented in patients without diabetes. In these patients, such treatment also appeared to result in an estimated four to five fewer acute kidney injury events in patients with and without diabetes.

Individual trials have shown that kidney benefits translate into important reductions in the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation, and the cardiovascular and kidney benefits appear to be cost-saving in diabetic chronic kidney disease. We found no good evidence that the kidney benefits were modified by the average level of kidney function studied in the trials. Importantly, efficacy and safety data from EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD combined include information on nearly 3,000 patients with an eGFR of 20–30 mL/min per 1.73 m². A total of 489 kidney disease progression outcomes accrued in those with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² in those two trials.

Although some clinical practice guidelines have started recommending the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes at eGFRs down to 20 mL/min per 1.73 m² (based on grade B levels of evidence), many other recommendations limit initiation to those with eGFR greater than 25 mL/min per 1.73 m² or 30 mL/min per 1.73 m². As patients with decreased eGFR are at the highest absolute risk of kidney disease progression, our findings should encourage the initiation of treatment.

### Are the cardiovascular and kidney benefits of empagliflozin influenced by baseline glucose-lowering therapy [^112k5ukV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin, when given in addition to standard care, improved cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes and reduced mortality. Trial participants were on a variety of glucose-lowering therapies at baseline, some of which could potentially affect CV risk. This analysis investigated whether the use of background diabetes therapy affected the risk of CV death, hospitalizations for heart failure, and progression of chronic kidney disease among patients treated with empagliflozin.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, or empagliflozin 25 mg. Glucose-lowering therapy was to remain unchanged for 12 weeks and then adjusted to achieve glycaemic control according to local guidelines. Differences in the risk of cardio-renal outcomes between empagliflozin and placebo by baseline use of metformin, sulphonylurea (SU), and insulin were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model.

- **Results**: Of 7020 eligible patients, 74% were receiving metformin, 43% SU, and 48% insulin at baseline (each alone or in combination). The most common regimens were metformin plus SU (20%) and metformin plus insulin (20%). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of CV death irrespective of the use of metformin [with: hazard ratio (HR) 0.71 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.54–0.94); without: 0.46 (0.32–0.68); P interaction = 0.07]; SU [with: HR 0.64 (0.44–0.92); without: 0.61 (0.46–0.81); P interaction = 0.85]; or insulin [with: HR 0.63 (0.46–0.85); without: 0.61 (#text is incomplete and cutoff in the original document)].

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with and without type 2 diabetes: A prespecified analysis of the DARE-19 randomized trial [^117TamWh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Low credibility.

The rate of adverse events related to acute kidney injury was less common in the dapagliflozin group, both in patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). This finding aligns with a post hoc analysis of the DAPA-HF trial, which evaluated the efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with and without diabetes. Among participants with T2D, doubling of serum creatinine occurred in 2.0% of the dapagliflozin group, compared to 3.9% in the placebo group (p = 0.01). The discontinuation rate of the study drug was similar in both groups.

Furthermore, concerning the potential risk of volume depletion associated with SGLT2 inhibitors, our findings suggest that this concern is unfounded. The results demonstrate similarity in hematocrit levels — a surrogate marker for volume depletion (which typically rises if volume depletion occurs) — for both the dapagliflozin and placebo groups.

In addition to this study, several trials have evaluated the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness, supporting their safety. The ACTIV-4a trial, which included critically ill patients, found that initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was safe and did not result in worse outcomes. Acute kidney injury was reported in three (1%) patients in the SGLT2 inhibitor group and eight (3%) patients in the standard-of-care group. No cases of ketoacidosis were reported in either treatment group. Similarly, the RECOVERY trial found that initiating empagliflozin in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection was safe, with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurring in 5 (0.2%) patients receiving empagliflozin, versus 2 (0.1%) with usual care, and acute kidney injury was not significantly different.

### Renal effects of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure: From the EMPULSE trial [^117V8BKX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

Renal adverse events are an important consideration in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure. In the EMPULSE trial, renal adverse events by treatment group and baseline eGFR (< 45, 45 to < 60, ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m²) were analyzed. Renal disorders occurred more frequently in patients with a baseline eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m² compared to those with a baseline eGFR of 45 to < 60 and ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m². However, there was no significant interaction between the treatment group and baseline eGFR (p-value for trend = 0.6620).

Overall, renal disorders occurred in 17.0% of the placebo group compared to 11.2% in the empagliflozin group (p = 0.0528). Investigators reported that acute kidney injury events were more common in patients with a baseline eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m² compared to those with a baseline eGFR of 45 to < 60 and ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m², but there were insufficient events to fit the appropriate model. During the 90-day treatment period, investigator-reported acute kidney injury occurred in 7.2% of the placebo group compared to 3.8% in the empagliflozin group (p = 0.0935).

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^115Jm1Zo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

The EMPA-KIDNEY trial is event-driven, with follow-up planned until at least 1070 participants have experienced a first primary outcome (Figure 1). This number of outcomes provides 90% power at a two-sided P-value of 0.05 to detect an 18% relative risk reduction for the primary outcome. Extra eGFR measurements made outside of scheduled follow-up visits (e.g. triggered by a certain percentage decline in eGFR) are not requested, to minimize participant burden, thereby helping with long-term adherence to the follow-up schedule. Extra contact with participants between scheduled visits could also introduce differences in follow-up between treatment arms. To avoid introducing such bias, the term 'sustained' is defined as either measured at two consecutive scheduled study follow-up visits or measured at the last scheduled study follow-up visit or the last scheduled visit before death (or withdrawal of consent). For further details on how biases due to extra eGFR measurements are avoided, see the DAP.

ESKD is defined as the receipt of a kidney transplant or initiation of maintenance dialysis (i.e. duration ≥ 90 days). For ESKD, no local medical notes are collected for central review by a panel of blinded clinicians (i.e. no adjudication), but all initiations of dialysis and other changes to renal status (e.g. recovery from any dialysis requirement or transplantation) are subject to verification by local investigators. Outcomes based purely on laboratory values are also not subject to adjudication. eGFR-based analyses use measurements made at central laboratories.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^115VnKfs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

What is already known about this subject?

Prevention of kidney disease progression and decreasing cardiovascular risk are unmet clinical needs among people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In people with CKD, CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD trial results demonstrated that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors decrease the risk of kidney disease progression in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR) ≥ 200 mg/g. Prespecified subgroup analyses from DAPA-CKD also found such benefits extend to certain types of people with CKD and uACR ≥ 200 mg/g in the absence of DM.

- **What this study adds**: EMPA-KIDNEY is a streamlined double-blind randomized trial designed to assess the effect of empagliflozin 10 mg versus matching placebo, on top of standard care, on a composite primary outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death in a CKD population. Kidney disease progression is defined as end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to < 10 mL/min/1.73 m², renal death, or a sustained decline of ≥ 40% in eGFR from randomization. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial has wide eligibility criteria and has recruited a broad range of people with CKD, including those underrepresented in reported SGLT-2 inhibitor trials. Of the 6609 randomized EMPA-KIDNEY participants, 54% had no prior history of DM at recruitment, 78% had an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², and 48% had a uACR < 300 mg/g.

### Effects of early empagliflozin initiation on diuresis and kidney function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (EMPAG-HF) [^116ypUSX]. Circulation (2022). Low credibility.

Effective diuretic regimens using loop diuretics in patients with acute decompensated heart failure are often limited by the development of worsening kidney function. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors induce glucosuria and sodium excretion, demonstrating nephroprotective effects in patients with stable heart failure; however, their role in acute decompensated heart failure remains unclear.

- **Methods**: In this single-center, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, we randomly assigned patients with acute decompensated heart failure to empagliflozin 25 mg daily or placebo in addition to standard decongestive treatments, including loop diuretics. The primary end point was cumulative urine output over five days. Secondary end points included diuretic efficiency, dynamics in markers of kidney function and injury, and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide).

- **Results**: Sixty patients were randomized within 12 hours of hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure. The addition of empagliflozin daily to standard medical treatment of acute decompensated heart failure resulted in a 25% increase in cumulative urine output over five days (median 10.8 versus 8.7 L in placebo; group difference estimation 2.2 L [95% CI, 8.4 to 3.6]; P = 0.003). Empagliflozin increased diuretic efficiency compared with placebo (14.1 mL urine per milligram furosemide equivalent [95% CI, 0.6–27.7]; P = 0.041) without affecting markers of renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 51 ± 19 versus 54 ± 17 mL/min per 1.73 m²; P = 0.599) or injury (total urinary protein).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^113eHypy]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning SGLT-2 inhibitors, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend considering withholding SGLT-2 inhibitors during periods of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness. These scenarios pose a higher risk for ketosis.

### Canagliflozin for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease and implications for clinical practice: A narrative review [^1179W52A]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects millions of people worldwide, elevating their risk of developing a range of complications, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). People with T2DM and CKD, also known as diabetic kidney disease (DKD), have an increased risk of progressing to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), experiencing cardiovascular complications, and premature death. Despite this, DKD is primarily addressed through management of risk factors, and there are few pharmaceutical treatments capable of reversing or delaying disease progression.

Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor that was initially developed as a blood glucose–lowering agent for people with T2DM. Evidence from clinical trials of canagliflozin in people with T2DM, as well as evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials in people with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk, provided preliminary evidence suggesting that it may also have beneficial renal effects. The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial was a dedicated renal outcomes trial of canagliflozin that assessed its renal effects in people with DKD. Overall, the CREDENCE trial demonstrated that canagliflozin improves renal outcomes and slows early disease progression in people with DKD. These data supported the approval of canagliflozin for the treatment of DKD, marking it as the first new treatment in almost 20 years. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to understand how to implement this treatment in their clinical practice.

### Influence of endpoint definitions on the effect of empagliflozin on major renal outcomes in the EMPEROR-preserved trial [^114dJUVD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

In contrast to these favorable effects of empagliflozin on heart failure outcomes in EMPEROR-Preserved, empagliflozin did not exert a favorable effect on major renal outcomes using the EMPEROR definition, which relied on a threshold of a sustained ≥ 40% decrease in eGFR and did not include the occurrence of renal death. The hazard ratio for the effect of empagliflozin on major renal events was 0.95 (95% CI 0.73–1.24). The neutral effect of empagliflozin on kidney outcomes was similarly observed across the prespecified ejection fraction subgroups of 41–49%, 50–59%, and ≥ 60% (Figure 1).

Figure 1

Effect of empagliflozin on major renal outcomes in EMPEROR-Preserved, overall and in prespecified ejection fraction subgroups, using different definitions for a renal event. Shown are prespecified ejection fraction subgroups: > 40% to < 50%, ≥ 50% to < 60%, and ≥ 60%. Effect in the overall trial is shown in red, whereas effects in the ejection fraction subgroups are shown in blue. The renal endpoint based on a ≥ 40% sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was prespecified in the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials, whereas the renal endpoint based on a ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR and including renal death was prespecified in the DAPA-HF trial and was used in a meta-analysis of the EMPEROR-Reduced and DAPA-HF trials. Both endpoints included patients who required chronic renal replacement therapy or who experienced a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m². There were 14 renal deaths (10 on placebo and 4 on empagliflozin).

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111tPVXR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, had positive cardiorenal effects in patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression. Post-trial follow-up was designed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin would evolve after the discontinuation of the trial drug.

- **Methods**: In the active trial, patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo and were followed for a median of 2 years. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Subsequently, surviving patients who consented were observed for 2 additional years. No trial empagliflozin or placebo was administered during the post-trial period, but local practitioners could prescribe open-label SGLT2 inhibitors, including open-label empagliflozin. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death as assessed from the start of the active-trial period to the end of the post-trial period.

- **Results**: Of the 6609 patients who had undergone randomization in the active trial, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial period. During this period, the use of open-label SGLT2 inhibitors was similar in the two groups (43% in the empagliflozin group and 43% in the placebo group).

### Empagliflozin and cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across KDIGO risk categories: Analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial [^112V86o4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

In the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG Outcome), empagliflozin, in addition to standard care, significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 38%, hospitalization for heart failure by 35%, and incident or worsening nephropathy by 39% compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Using EMPA-REG Outcome data, we assessed whether the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD classification had an influence on the treatment effect of empagliflozin.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Patients with type 2 diabetes, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard care. Post hoc, we analyzed cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, and safety using the two-dimensional KDIGO classification framework.

- **Results**: Of the 6,952 patients with baseline eGFR and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio values, 47%, 29%, 15%, and 8% were classified into low, moderately increased, high, and very high KDIGO risk categories, respectively. Empagliflozin showed consistent risk reductions across KDIGO categories for cardiovascular outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.26 to 0.85) and kidney outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.16 to 0.60). In all KDIGO risk categories, placebo and empagliflozin had similar advantages.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^116NnC2d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

The effects of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin on renal and cardiovascular disease have not been tested in a dedicated population of people with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

- **Methods**: The EMPA-KIDNEY trial is an international randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing whether empagliflozin 10 mg daily decreases the risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death in people with CKD. Participants with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) were eligible provided they had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 20 but < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or an eGFR ≥ 45 but < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR) ≥ 200 mg/g. The trial design is streamlined to minimize additional work for collaborating sites, collecting only essential information.

- **Results**: Between 15 May 2019 and 16 April 2021, 6609 participants from eight countries in Europe, North America, and East Asia were randomized. The mean age at randomization was 63.8 years [standard deviation (SD) 13.9], with 2192 (33%) female participants and 3570 (54%) with no prior history of DM. The mean eGFR was 37.5 mL/min/1.73 m² (SD 14.8), including 5185 (78%) with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m². The median uACR was 412 mg/g (quartile 1-quartile 3: 94–1190), with a uACR < 300 mg/g in 3194 (48%). Causes of kidney disease included diabetic kidney disease [n = 2057 (31%)], glomerular disease [n = 1669 (25%)], hypertensive/renovascular disease [n = 1445 (22%)], other causes [n = 808 (12%)], and unknown causes [n = 630 (10%)].

- **Conclusions**: EMPA-KIDNEY will evaluate the efficacy of empagliflozin in reducing the progression of kidney disease or cardiovascular death among individuals with CKD.

### Impact of primary kidney disease on the effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease: secondary analyses of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^111xVigx]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

The EMPA-KIDNEY trial demonstrated that empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death in patients with chronic kidney disease, primarily by slowing progression. We aimed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin might differ by primary kidney disease across its broad population.

- **Methods**: EMPA-KIDNEY, a randomized, controlled, phase 3 trial, was conducted at 241 centers in eight countries (Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the UK, and the United States). Patients were eligible if their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 20 to less than 45 mL/min per 1.73 m², or 45 to less than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m² with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) of 200 mg/g or higher at screening. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 10 mg oral empagliflozin once daily or a matching placebo. Effects on kidney disease progression (defined as a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline from randomization, end-stage kidney disease, a sustained eGFR below 10 mL/min per 1.73 m², or death from kidney failure) were assessed using prespecified Cox models, and eGFR slope analyses were conducted using shared parameter models. Subgroup comparisons were performed by including relevant interaction terms in the models. EMPA-KIDNEY is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03594110.

- **Findings**: Between May 15, 2019, and April 16, 2021, 6609 participants were randomly assigned and followed up for a median of 2.0 years (IQR 1.5–2.4). Prespecified subgroupings by primary kidney disease included 2057 (31.1%) participants with diabetic kidney disease.

### Effectiveness of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin for kidney outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^116yX1bv]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

No large randomized clinical trial has directly compared empagliflozin with dapagliflozin, leaving their comparative effectiveness regarding kidney outcomes unknown. This study aimed to compare kidney outcomes between the initiation of empagliflozin and dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who were receiving antihyperglycemic treatment.

This target trial emulation used nationwide, population-based routinely collected Danish health care data to compare the initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes receiving antihyperglycemic treatment between June 1, 2014, and October 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to August 2024. Participants were followed up until an outcome, emigration, death, 6 years, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurred first.

- **Exposure**: Initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Outcomes included acute kidney injury, incident chronic kidney disease (stages G3 to G5 or stage A2 or A3), and progression of chronic kidney disease (≥ 40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline). Risks of kidney outcomes were estimated in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses using an Aalen-Johansen estimator that adjusted for 56 potential confounders and considered death as a competing event.

- **Results**: A total of 32,819 individuals who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and 17,464 with dapagliflozin were included (median [IQR] age, 63 [54–71] years; 18,872 female individuals [37.5%]).

### Acute kidney injury events in patients with type 2 diabetes using SGLT2 inhibitors versus other glucose-lowering drugs: A retrospective cohort study [^113sGjYN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors slow the progression of chronic kidney disease and prevent heart failure events. However, SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). Our objective was to assess whether SGLT2 inhibitor use, compared with all other glucose-lowering drugs (oGLDs), is associated with increased rates of AKI.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting and participants**: Adults in Manitoba, Canada, with type 2 diabetes mellitus were followed up from June 2014 until March 2017.

- **Exposures**: Initial SGLT2 inhibitor or oGLD use was ascertained through a province-wide outpatient prescription database.

- **Outcome**: The primary outcome was incident AKI, identified either by an increase in serum creatinine level and/or hospital discharge codes for AKI while taking glucose-lowering drugs (on-treatment approach).

- **Analytical approach**: A propensity score analysis was used to assemble groups of incident users of SGLT2 inhibitors and a 1:1 matched set of oGLD users. The rate of AKI was compared across matched groups using cause-specific hazards models. Sensitivity analyses considered exposure to be constant throughout follow-up after the initiation of the drug treatment (intention-to-treat approach) or incorporated re-exposures (new user design).

Comparing 4,778 incident users of SGLT2 inhibitors with 4,778 incident users of oGLDs, there were no differences observed in the primary outcome (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.40–1.03; P = 0.06) using an on-treatment approach. In neither set of sensitivity analyses were significant results obtained.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and the risk of acute kidney injury in older adults with type 2 diabetes [^112bvvTt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been found to offer significant benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes. Despite this, the potential increase in the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with SGLT2 inhibitors remains uncertain. This study examined the association between AKI hospitalization and the prior initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor in comparison to the initiation of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) among older adults with type 2 diabetes in routine practice.

- **Study design**: Population-based cohort study.

- **Setting & participants**: Older adults aged at least 66 years with type 2 diabetes who were enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service and began using SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, or GLP-1RAs between March 2013 and December 2017.

- **Exposures**: New use of an SGLT2 inhibitor versus new use of a DPP-4 inhibitor or GLP-1RA.

- **Outcome**: The primary outcome was hospitalization for AKI, defined by a discharge diagnosis of AKI in either the primary or secondary position.

- **Analytical approach**: New users of SGLT2 inhibitors were matched at a 1:1 ratio with new users of DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1RAs using propensity scores in two pairwise comparisons. Cox proportional hazards regression models generated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for propensity score-matched groups.

- **Results**: Totals of 68,130 and 71,477 new users of SGLT2 inhibitors were matched to new users of DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1RAs, respectively. The mean age of study participants was 72 years. The risk of AKI was found to be lower in the SGLT2 inhibitor group.

### Canagliflozin for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease and implications for clinical practice: A narrative review [^113x4U8w]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects millions of people worldwide, elevating their risk of developing a range of complications, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). People with T2DM and CKD — i.e. diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — have an increased risk of progressing to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), experiencing cardiovascular complications, and premature death. Despite this, DKD is primarily addressed through management of risk factors, and there are few pharmaceutical treatments capable of reversing or delaying disease progression.

Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor that was initially developed as a blood glucose-lowering agent for people with T2DM. Evidence from clinical trials of canagliflozin in people with T2DM, as well as evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials in people with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk, provided preliminary evidence suggesting that it may also have beneficial renal effects.

### Renal effects of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure: From the EMPULSE trial [^116wpLDy]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

Finally, renal adverse events were comparable between patients treated with empagliflozin and placebo. In patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronic heart failure, renal adverse events were less often observed in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. For example, in patients with chronic kidney disease, dapagliflozin reduced the primary outcome of a composite of a sustained decline in the eGFR of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes by 44%. Similarly, in patients with diabetes, empagliflozin reduced the incidence of doubling of serum creatinine by 44%. In patients with chronic heart failure, empagliflozin reduced the composite renal outcome of chronic dialysis or renal transplantation or a profound, sustained reduction in the eGFR by 50%.

This study has several limitations. First, we did not collect urine samples to determine urinary albumin excretion. Second, the number of patients in the present study (n = 530) was lower than in randomized clinical trials with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronic heart failure. Nonetheless, the findings in patients with acute heart failure were very consistent with these larger studies in chronic patients.

In conclusion, the present study shows that the beneficial clinical effects of empagliflozin in patients who are hospitalized for acute heart failure were consistent regardless of baseline eGFR. Empagliflozin caused an early modest decline in renal function, but already after 90 days, the difference in renal function stabilizes.

### Acute kidney injury in patients on SGLT2 inhibitors: A propensity-matched analysis [^116GQcvS]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are new medications that improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the Food and Drug Administration has issued alerts regarding increased acute kidney injury (AKI) risk with canagliflozin and dapagliflozin. We aimed to assess the real-world risk of AKI in new SGLT2 inhibitor users in two large health care utilization cohorts of patients with T2D.

- **Research design and methods**: We used longitudinal data from the Mount Sinai chronic kidney disease registry and the Geisinger Health System cohort. We selected SGLT inhibitor users and nonusers (patients with T2D without SGLT2 inhibitor prescription). We determined AKI by the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) definition. We performed 1:1 nearest-neighbor propensity matching and calculated unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and adjusted HRs (aHRs; accounting for covariates poorly balanced) for AKI in primary and sensitivity analyses.

- **Results**: We identified 377 SGLT2 inhibitor users and 377 nonusers in the Mount Sinai cohort, of whom 3.8% and 9.7%, respectively, had an AKI KDIGO event over a median follow-up time of 14 months. The unadjusted hazards of AKI KDIGO were 60% lower in users (HR 0.4 [95% CI 0.2–0.7]; P = 0.01), which was unchanged (aHR 0.4 [95% CI 0.2–0.7]; P = 0.004) post-adjustment. Similarly, we identified 1,207 SGLT2 inhibitor users and 1,207 nonusers in the Geisinger cohort, of whom 2.2% and 4.6% had an AKI KDIGO event. AKI KDIGO unadjusted hazards were lower in users (HR 0.5 [95% CI 0.

### Choice of endpoint in kidney outcome trials: considerations from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^115C4GSa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Doubling of serum creatinine [equivalent to a 57% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)] is an established surrogate for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); however, this endpoint necessitates lengthy follow-up and large sample sizes in clinical trials. We explored whether alternative eGFR decline thresholds provide more feasible surrogate kidney endpoints.

- **Methods**: The study involved post hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial. Adults with type 2 diabetes, high cardiovascular risk, and eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² were assigned empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg (n = 4687) or placebo (n = 2333), on top of the standard of care. We assessed composite endpoints incorporating different eGFR decline thresholds (≥ 30%, ≥ 40%, ≥ 50%, or ≥ 57%), combined with the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) or renal death. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01131676).

- **Results**: Empagliflozin versus placebo significantly lowered the risk of decline in eGFR for each threshold listed above, combined with initiation of RRT or renal death, ranging from a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–0.91] for endpoints based on a 30% eGFR decline to an HR of 0.37 (0.23–0.61) for endpoints based on a 57% eGFR decline. Lower thresholds (e.g. 30%) were associated with higher event rates but weaker treatment effects. The time to the 95% CI of the HR falling to < 1.0 decreased with increasing eGFR threshold.

- **Conclusions**: The composite of a 40% decline in eGFR, ESKD, or renal death appears to provide results that are reliable similar to the traditional 57% decline in eGFR.

### Synjardy [^116EW1mJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effectiveness of empagliflozin, a component of Synjardy and Synjardy XR, to reduce the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization has been established in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression based on an adequate and well-controlled study of empagliflozin [EMPA-KIDNEY (NCT03594110)]. This trial was designed to determine the treatment effect of empagliflozin compared to placebo in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with and without type 2 diabetes. The trial, which studied empagliflozin rather than Synjardy or Synjardy XR, included adults taking metformin HCl as a concomitant medication. The efficacy results of EMPA-KIDNEY are reported below.

EMPA-KIDNEY was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in adults with chronic kidney disease. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the effects of empagliflozin as an adjunct to standard of care therapy, including RAS-inhibitor therapy when appropriate, on time to kidney disease progression or CV death. A total of 6,609 patients were equally randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg orally once-daily or placebo.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: Which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future [^112RswSU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial was designed to specifically address this evidence gap. The trial demonstrated that an SGLT2 inhibitor, canagliflozin, substantially reduced the progression of DKD (doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, or cardiovascular or kidney-related death) in participants with T2DM and severely increased albuminuria who were already receiving RAS blockade. Indeed, CREDENCE demonstrated, for the first time ever, that a single intervention reduced the need for dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease in its own right. A 2019 meta-analysis synthesizing the accumulated trial evidence provided further strong support for the role of SGLT2 inhibition for kidney protection in people with T2DM. It emphasized that the combination of RAS blockade and SGLT2 inhibition should be routinely offered to patients with T2DM who have, or are at high risk of, progressive kidney disease, with the strongest evidence for canagliflozin.

In the face of these clear and substantial benefits for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, a number of other important questions remain. Who might benefit most from treatment? How should this evidence be applied in routine practice to maximize benefits and ensure potential harms are minimized? Are there other patient groups, aside from those with T2DM, who may benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors? Finally, how should these agents be used in combination with other currently available and future treatments? Some of these issues, including SGLT2 inhibition in people with…
