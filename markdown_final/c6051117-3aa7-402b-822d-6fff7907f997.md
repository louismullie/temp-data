## Question

Is it safe to administer Zofran to a patient with bradycardia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if it's safe to give ondansetron (Zofran) to a patient with bradycardia and which precautions, contraindications, and alternatives to consider. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how bradycardia modifies ondansetron's proarrhythmic risk. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling and primary data say about QT effects, dose, route, and monitoring. Next, I will review evidence in higher-risk settings, including ED and PICU data, to quantify risk. After that, I should reconcile conflicting hemodynamic findings about heart rate changes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, conditional recommendation with monitoring and alternative antiemetics, while double-checking for absolute and relative contraindications.

> Let me first clarify the clinical frame and the relevant risk axes. Bradycardia, especially in the context of bradyarrhythmias or conduction disease, is a labeled risk factor for drug-induced QT prolongation and torsades when using ondansetron, and FDA labeling explicitly recommends ECG monitoring in patients with bradyarrhythmias or other QT risk factors, while advising avoidance in congenital long QT syndrome, so I need to keep that front and center as I reason through safety in a bradycardic patient [^1129B9Jj] [^112jZ7ak].

> I need to check the established cardiac electrophysiology signal and dose-response. Ondansetron prolongs QT in a dose-dependent manner, with a mean placebo-corrected QTcF increase of about 19.5 ms at 32 mg IV over 15 minutes and about 5.6 ms at 8 mg IV over 15 minutes in healthy subjects, which confirms a clear concentration-response relationship that becomes more clinically relevant as dose or exposure rises [^113uwLLs]. Hold on, I should also verify route-specific risk; serious ECG changes and myocardial ischemia have been reported predominantly with intravenous administration, which supports favoring the oral route when feasible or minimizing IV dose and rate if IV is required [^112f1GDE] [^116f19NM] [^116Jhf9W] [^116tcX1V].

> Next, I should review how bradycardia interacts with this QT signal. The labels specifically call out bradyarrhythmias as a scenario where ECG monitoring is recommended, and they advise avoidance in congenital long QT syndrome; mechanistically, a slower heart rate lengthens repolarization windows and can unmask or potentiate drug-induced QT effects, which aligns with in vitro human cardiomyocyte data showing dose-dependent prolongation of repolarization with ondansetron across disease and control backgrounds, reinforcing the need for caution in bradycardia [^1129B9Jj] [^112jZ7ak] [^114k7h18].

> Let me examine real-world and prospective data in adults to estimate effect sizes. In adult ED patients, 4 mg IV produced a mean QTc prolongation around 20 ms without serious arrhythmic events in a small cohort, while another prospective ED cohort found small, early QT changes peaking at 5 minutes, again without conduction events, suggesting that although QTc prolongation occurs, clinical events are uncommon in general-risk populations receiving low IV doses with monitoring in place [^115iR6QT] [^115PRXBM]. I should double-check perioperative data too; low-dose ondansetron for PONV treatment showed mean QTc increases of roughly 20 ms within minutes, which is consistent with the ED signal and supports vigilance around timing and monitoring in susceptible patients [^1126be5U].

> Now I will look at pediatric and high-risk critical care settings to stress-test the risk. In a large pediatric health system analysis encompassing nearly 200,000 doses, ventricular arrhythmias within 24 hours were exceedingly rare and clustered in children with congenital conduction abnormalities or major cardiac diagnoses, underscoring that underlying substrate drives most of the observed risk signal [^113FpARa]. However, in a PICU cohort, QTc exceeded 500 ms in about 11% of administrations, strongly associated with electrolyte abnormalities and organ dysfunction, so I need to ensure electrolytes are normalized and organ failure is considered before dosing bradycardic or otherwise high-risk patients [^115ET9kZ].

> Wait, let me verify whether ondansetron directly slows the heart rate, because that would compound risk in bradycardia. One randomized study during spinal anesthesia showed ondansetron attenuated hypotension without significantly affecting heart rate versus placebo, which would argue against a direct bradycardic effect, but another comparison suggested ramosetron was superior to ondansetron in preventing decreases in both blood pressure and heart rate, hinting at possible modest differences across 5-HT3 antagonists under neuraxial conditions; meta-analytic data on post-anesthesia shivering generally found no excess bradycardia with ondansetron in healthier surgical cohorts, so my initial concern about a direct negative chronotropic effect seems overstated in typical patients, though neuraxial anesthesia physiology may confound this in specific settings [^112zCDAt] [^115H8mrP] [^113Ne1WE] [^115Xu8nJ]. Let me reconsider: in hemodynamically stable patients without conduction disease, ondansetron's direct effect on heart rate appears minimal, but in bradyarrhythmic or neuraxial contexts, vigilance remains prudent [^112zCDAt] [^115H8mrP].

> I should confirm absolute and relative contraindications and key precautions from authoritative labeling. Ondansetron should be avoided in congenital long QT syndrome and must not be coadministered with apomorphine due to profound hypotension and loss of consciousness risk, and labels recommend ECG monitoring for patients with bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, heart failure, or those taking other QT-prolonging agents; additionally, myocardial ischemia, often with IV use and rapid administration, is a labeled precaution, reinforcing the importance of adhering to recommended administration rates [^1129B9Jj] [^112jZ7ak] [^1134Kv1L] [^115HZ554] [^116tcX1V].

> Now, let me synthesize a practical, conditional approach for a bradycardic patient. If the bradycardia is mild and asymptomatic without known conduction disease, the ECG is normal without baseline QTc prolongation, electrolytes are normal or corrected, there are no concurrent QT-prolonging drugs, and antiemetic therapy is necessary, it is reasonable to prefer the oral route or the lowest effective IV dose with cautious administration and per-label ECG monitoring in the presence of bradyarrhythmias, given the small average QTc shifts at low doses observed in prospective studies and the concentration of serious events in high-risk substrates [^1129B9Jj] [^112jZ7ak] [^115iR6QT] [^113FpARa]. Hold on, I should verify administration details; slower administration and avoidance of rapid IV push is sensible in higher-risk patients, and labels emphasize not exceeding recommended infusion rates because of ischemic events with fast IV dosing, so I will avoid rapid bolus and follow labeled administration parameters, recognizing that QT studies used 15-minute infusions at higher doses and that clinical dosing should be tailored to the lowest effective exposure [^113uwLLs] [^116tcX1V].

> I need to ensure monitoring is aligned with risk. Before IV dosing in a bradycardic patient, I should obtain a baseline ECG and electrolytes, correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, avoid other QT-prolonging or interacting agents, and consider telemetry or post-dose ECG when the baseline risk is nontrivial or multiple risk factors coexist, consistent with labeling and supported by critical care data linking electrolyte derangements and organ dysfunction with marked QTc prolongation [^1129B9Jj] [^112jZ7ak] [^115ET9kZ]. But wait, what if the patient already has prolonged baseline QTc or symptomatic bradycardia? In that case, I should generally avoid ondansetron or use it only with specialist input, given the amplified proarrhythmic milieu [^1129B9Jj] [^112jZ7ak].

> I will now examine scenarios where use is inadvisable or where cardiology input is warranted. Symptomatic bradycardia, known sick sinus syndrome or higher-grade AV block without pacing, congenital long QT syndrome, recent or active myocardial ischemia, or uncorrected significant electrolyte abnormalities shift the risk-benefit balance against ondansetron unless the clinical context mandates use with close monitoring, as reflected in labeling warnings and the observed clustering of adverse events in patients with structural or electrical substrate [^1129B9Jj] [^112jZ7ak] [^116tcX1V] [^113FpARa].

> Let me consider alternatives when the QT or bradyarrhythmic risk feels prohibitive. For postoperative settings, low-dose IV amisulpride has demonstrated efficacy for PONV with small, not clinically meaningful QTc effects at guideline doses, and may be a reasonable substitute in high QT-risk patients; non-serotonergic options like transdermal scopolamine for motion-related or vestibular nausea can also be considered, though agent selection should be individualized to the emesis phenotype and comorbidities, with awareness that many dopamine antagonists carry their own safety trade-offs including extrapyramidal symptoms or QT effects at higher exposures [^115egx6f].

> Final check and synthesis: ondansetron is not absolutely contraindicated solely due to bradycardia, but bradyarrhythmias are a labeled risk condition requiring ECG monitoring, correction of modifiable risk factors, cautious dosing and administration, and heightened vigilance for QT interactions; in monitored settings with normal electrolytes and no concomitant QT-prolonging drugs, a single low-dose, preferably oral, administration may be acceptable in a patient with stable mild bradycardia, whereas in unmonitored or outpatient settings, or in the presence of symptomatic bradycardia, baseline QTc prolongation, or other red flags, it is safer to avoid ondansetron or to consult cardiology and consider alternatives with lower QT liability [^1129B9Jj] [^112jZ7ak] [^113uwLLs] [^115iR6QT] [^115ET9kZ] [^115egx6f] [^113FpARa].

---

Yes, ondansetron (Zofran) may be used in bradycardic patients when clinically indicated, but **use with caution** because it can prolong the QT interval [^113uwLLs] and cause bradyarrhythmias. Avoid in **congenital long QT syndrome** [^112jZ7ak] and **monitor the ECG** in patients with bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs. Use the lowest effective dose [^113uwLLs], correct electrolytes, and monitor for arrhythmias; consider alternatives if the risk is high [^115egx6f].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist [^112XaeTC] used to prevent **nausea and vomiting** [^115ijABQ]. It can cause **dose-dependent QT prolongation** [^114k7h18] and has been associated with torsades de pointes, particularly with IV use or in predisposed patients [^112jZ7ak] [^112f1GDE].

---

## Clinical evidence of cardiac effects

Clinical and postmarketing data [^116f19NM] show ondansetron can cause **bradycardia** [^112f1GDE], **QT prolongation** [^115iR6QT], and **torsades de pointes** [^115Vq7s6], particularly in patients with bradyarrhythmias or other risk factors [^112jZ7ak]. The risk is **higher with IV administration** and in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, heart failure, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs [^1129B9Jj].

---

## FDA warnings and precautions

The FDA warns that ondansetron can cause **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes** [^112jZ7ak]; **avoid in congenital long QT syndrome**, and monitor the ECG in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs [^112f1GDE]. A known adverse effect is **bradycardia**, especially with IV use.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

There are **no specific guidelines** for ondansetron in bradycardic patients, but **general recommendations** include:

- Avoid in **congenital long QT syndrome** [^112jZ7ak] [^114k7h18].
- **Monitor ECG**: in patients with bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or other QT-prolonging drugs [^112jZ7ak] [^113WRsKq].
- **Use lowest effective dose** and avoid rapid IV administration [^113uwLLs] [^116tcX1V].

---

## Clinical scenarios and risk assessment

Ondansetron may be appropriate in bradycardic patients when **benefits outweigh risks**, such as:

- **Severe nausea/vomiting**: requiring effective antiemesis [^115ijABQ].
- **No alternatives** or alternatives are less effective or have higher risk [^112U1sj1].
- **Correctable risk factors**: such as electrolyte abnormalities [^1129B9Jj].

However, **avoid** or use with **extreme caution** in:

- **Congenital long QT syndrome** [^112jZ7ak] [^114k7h18].
- **Severe bradyarrhythmias or significant conduction disease** [^112f1GDE].
- **Multiple QT-prolonging drugs** or uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities [^113WRsKq].

---

## Practical recommendations for clinical practice

When ondansetron is **necessary in bradycardic patients**:

- **Baseline ECG**: to assess QT interval and rhythm [^112jZ7ak].
- **Correct electrolytes**: potassium and magnesium before administration [^1129B9Jj].
- **Use lowest effective dose** and avoid rapid IV push [^113uwLLs] [^116tcX1V].
- **Monitor ECG** and heart rate during and after administration [^113WRsKq].
- **Be prepared**: to manage arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes [^115Vq7s6].

---

## Alternative antiemetic options

Consider alternatives with **lower QT risk** in high-risk bradycardic patients, such as metoclopramide (lower QT risk than ondansetron) or promethazine (use cautiously due to sedation and hypotension). **Dexamethasone** is another option that is effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea.

---

Ondansetron may be used in bradycardic patients when necessary, but **use with caution** because of QT prolongation and bradyarrhythmia risk. Avoid in **congenital long QT syndrome**, monitor the ECG, correct electrolytes, and use the lowest effective dose; consider alternatives if the risk is high [^112jZ7ak].

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^1129B9Jj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.

- **QT prolongation**: Ondansetron prolongs the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner. Postmarketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with the concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with an overdose of ondansetron injection alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include a combination of mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations), autonomic instability, neuromuscular symptoms (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). It is essential to monitor patients for signs of serotonin syndrome, especially during treatment initiation or dosage increases.

### Defining cardiomyocyte repolarization response to pharmacotherapy in long-QT syndrome type 3 [^114k7h18]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

We studied the effects of two commonly prescribed drugs: ondansetron, a serotonin-receptor blocker and antiemetic, and clarithromycin, an antibiotic, due to their widely reported increased arrhythmia risk in patients with long-QT syndrome (LQTS). Both drugs displayed a dose-dependent prolongation of the field potential duration corrected (FPDc).

Ondansetron showed a dose-dependent prolongation of the FPDc from 0.1 to 100 μmol in both healthy control patients with long-QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3) samples (SCN5A +/−) and genetically engineered LQT3 samples (SCN5A +/−) human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) compared with their baseline resting values (P < 0.05). The proportionate effect of prolonging repolarization (FPDc) with escalating drug doses of ondansetron appeared to show little difference between disease and control samples or between patient or genetically engineered LQT3 samples.

Clarithromycin showed a similar dose-dependent prolongation of the FPDc from 0.1 to 30 μmol in all tested clones compared with baseline values (P < 0.05). The genetic background appeared to contribute more significantly to the effects of higher doses of clarithromycin (1–3 μmol) between the patient-derived LQT3 clone and the genetically engineered LQT3 clone, as illustrated by the statistical significance of the FPDc compared with the control. When FPDc values were normalized to their baseline values, the proportional effect of escalating doses of clarithromycin appeared to be most notable for the control over the disease.

### Ondansetron [^1127RGEF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In the same trial, 56% of patients receiving a single 24-mg oral dose of ondansetron experienced no nausea during the 24-hour trial period, compared with 36% of patients in the oral ondansetron 8‑mg twice-a-day group (P = 0.001) and 50% in the oral ondansetron 32-mg once-a-day group. Dosage regimens of ondansetron 8 mg twice daily and 32 mg once daily are not recommended for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

In a second trial, the efficacy of a single 24-mg oral dose of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m², was confirmed.

- **Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy**: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double‑blind trial was conducted in the US with 67 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide‑based chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin. The first 8-mg dose of ondansetron was administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent dose 8 hours after the first dose, followed by 8 mg of ondansetron twice a day for 2 days after the completion of chemotherapy.

### Ondansetron has similar clinical efficacy against both nausea and vomiting [^114MyZ6G]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is widely believed to prevent postoperative vomiting more effectively than nausea. We analysed data from 5,161 patients undergoing general anaesthesia who were randomly stratified to receive a combination of six interventions, one of which was 4 mg ondansetron versus placebo. For the purpose of this study, a 20% difference in the relative risks for the two outcomes was considered clinically relevant. Nausea was reduced from 38% (969/2585) in the control group to 28% (715/2576) in the ondansetron group, corresponding to a relative risk of 0.74, or a relative risk reduction of 26%. Vomiting was reduced from 17% (441/2585) to 11% (293/2576), corresponding to a relative risk of 0.67, or a relative risk reduction of 33%. The relative risks of 0.67 and 0.74 were clinically similar, and the difference between them did not reach statistical significance. We thus conclude that ondansetron prevents postoperative nausea and postoperative vomiting equally well.

### Risk of ventricular arrhythmias and association with ondansetron [^113FpARa]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate the use of ondansetron in a tertiary care pediatric health system, this study assessed the incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia within 24 hours of ondansetron use, aiming to identify potential risk factors in children experiencing such events.

- **Study design**: This retrospective chart review identified children aged ≤ 18 years who received ondansetron within 24 hours prior to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Evaluations included other diagnoses, concomitant medication use, electrolyte abnormalities, or underlying conduction abnormalities that may have contributed to the arrhythmia.

- **Results**: A total of 199,773 doses of ondansetron were administered to 37,794 patients over 58,009 visits. The average dose was 0.13 mg/kg/dose (range 0.005–0.86 mg/kg/dose). Seven patients received ondansetron within 24 hours prior to a ventricular arrhythmia. All seven patients had underlying congenital cardiac conduction abnormalities (n = 3) or other major cardiac diagnoses (n = 4). In clinical review, torsades de pointes was found in only 1 of the 7 patients.

- **Conclusions**: This retrospective study found the risk of ventricular arrhythmia within 24 hours after ondansetron administration was 3 in 100,000 patients treated annually (0.003%). Children with major cardiac conditions could be considered for electrocardiogram screening and continuous cardiac monitoring while receiving ondansetron. Our findings do not support recommendations for electrocardiogram screening or continuous monitoring of other pediatric populations while receiving ondansetron.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^116tcX1V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Myocardial ischemia has been reported in patients treated with ondansetron. In some cases, predominantly during intravenous administration, the symptoms appeared immediately after administration but resolved with prompt treatment. Coronary artery spasm appears to be the most common underlying cause. Therefore, do not exceed the recommended infusion rate of ondansetron injection and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia during and after administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

- **Masking of progressive ileus and gastric distension**:
	- The use of ondansetron injection in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction. Ondansetron injection is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.

### Antiemetic guidelines: Are they being used [^111Sgy9g]. The Lancet Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines are regarded as therapeutic standards for many medical interventions. However, implementation of such recommendations seems to be rather difficult. An international antiemetic guideline for the treatment of patients undergoing chemotherapy was issued by the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer in 1997 and has been in use ever since. However, for many reasons, the guideline has not been followed completely, despite the fact that if antiemetics are used in accordance with guidelines, efficacy is similar to that achieved in randomised controlled trials. Structural difficulties, patient characteristics, and other barriers, such as the individual acceptance of guidelines and education of physicians and nurses, could be crucial factors for successful implementation. Thus, better adherence to antiemetic guidelines can only be achieved through a complex and long-term process, consisting of efficient education, training, and monitoring of all individuals involved.

### The acute effect of tropisetron on ECG parameters in cancer patients [^112fLcXh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

The 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists, including tropisetron, ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron, are agents effectively used for supportive care. They are utilized for the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced emesis. Despite their overall excellent safety profile, some electrocardiographic changes related to heart rate and repolarization have been reported. Ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron have been studied in this context; however, to our knowledge, there is no information regarding the cardiac side effects of tropisetron. This study aimed to determine the acute effects of tropisetron on ECG parameters related to repolarization, heart rate, and systemic blood pressure.

Fifty-five cancer patients who received tropisetron for the prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting were enrolled in this single-center, prospective study. Standard 12-lead ECG recordings were performed at baseline and 30 minutes after the administration of tropisetron (5 mg given over 1 minute IV bolus). P wave durations and corrected QT intervals were measured; P wave dispersion and QTc dispersion were calculated.

In comparison with baseline, the mean heart rate significantly decreased 30 minutes after the administration of tropisetron. Tropisetron did not result in a significant change in P wave duration, corrected QT interval, P dispersion, and QTc dispersion.

This study concluded that tropisetron did not exhibit any ventricular and atrial arrhythmogenic effects due to repolarization abnormalities, although it may cause a slight decrease in heart rate.

### Intravenous amisulpride does not meaningfully prolong the QTc interval at doses effective for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^115egx6f]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are significant issues in surgical patients, and additional treatment options are necessary. Dopaminergic antiemetics have been popular for their efficacy, but their use has been limited by safety concerns, particularly the potential for torsade de pointes arising from QT interval prolongation. Intravenous (IV) amisulpride, a dopamine D2 and D3 antagonist, is effective at preventing and treating PONV at doses of 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively. It has a dose-dependent effect on QT, but at 5 mg, it is not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval. This study was designed to evaluate the QT effect of a 10-mg dose of amisulpride, alone and when simultaneously administered with ondansetron, an antiemetic of a different class known to prolong the QT interval.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period, crossover study, healthy male and female volunteers aged 18–65 years received IV in a random sequence: (1) amisulpride 10 mg given twice, 2 hours apart; (2) amisulpride 10 mg and ondansetron 4 mg, given simultaneously; and (3) placebo.

- **Results**: Thirty subjects were enrolled, and 29 completed all 3 treatment periods. The largest mean placebo-corrected change-from-baseline QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) (ΔΔQTcF) after the first and second amisulpride dose was 5.2 milliseconds (90% confidence interval, 3.53–6.96 milliseconds) and 8.0 milliseconds (90% CI, 5.49–10.58 milliseconds), respectively.

### Effect of ondansetron on QT interval in patients cared for in the PICU [^115ET9kZ]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

There is no evidence regarding the effect of ondansetron on the QT interval in pediatric patients in the ICU. This study aimed to describe the effect of ondansetron on the corrected QT interval in patients cared for in the PICU.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort, consecutive enrollment study.

- **Setting**: Single-center, tertiary-level, medical/surgical PICU.

- **Patients**: All patients less than 8 years old who received ondansetron over an 11-month period were included. Exclusion criteria were atrial arrhythmia, bundle-branch block, known congenital long QT syndrome, and concomitant administration of proarrhythmic antiarrhythmic agents.

- **Interventions**: None.

Measurements and main results: Overall, 210 doses of ondansetron were administered to 107 patients, with a mean age of 10.5 ± 4.8 years; 49% were male. The corrected QT interval increased to 460–500 ms in 29% and to more than 500 ms in 11% of ondansetron administration events. The mean baseline corrected QT interval even before ondansetron administration was higher for these groups (460–500 and > 500 ms; 457 ± 33 and 469 ± 45, respectively; p ≤ 0.05). In multivariate analysis, both groups were significantly associated with underlying electrolyte abnormalities (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1–4.4 and odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8–15.7, respectively). The group with a corrected QT interval of more than 500 ms was also significantly associated with organ dysfunction (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1–9.4). As the number of risk factors increased from only ondansetron to three additional QT aggravating factors (electrolyte abnormalities, administrat…

### Ondansetron given intravenously attenuates arterial blood pressure drop due to spinal anesthesia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112zCDAt]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Side effects of spinal anesthesia include arterial hypotension and bradycardia. Both can be induced by sympathetic nerve blockade as well as by the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, which may be mediated by peripheral serotonin receptors (5-HT(3) type). The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis that blockade of type 3 serotonin receptors by intravenous ondansetron administration might reduce hypotension and bradycardia induced by spinal anesthesia.

- **Methods**: Seventy-one patients participated in the study; 36 in the ondansetron group (receiving 8 mg intravenous ondansetron), and 35 in the placebo group (receiving isotonic NaCl solution). Measurements of heart rate and arterial blood pressure were taken every 5 minutes after spinal anesthesia was performed with 4 mL of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine solution.

- **Results**: Decreases in mean, systolic, and diastolic arterial pressure, as well as in heart rate compared with baseline values, were observed in both groups. Minimal systolic and mean blood pressure values obtained over a 20-minute observation period were significantly higher in the ondansetron group. There were no significant differences in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate values between the groups.

- **Conclusions**: Ondansetron given intravenously attenuates the fall of systolic and mean blood pressure, but does not have an influence on diastolic blood pressure or heart rate.

### Efficacy and safety of ondansetron in preventing postanesthesia shivering: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113Ne1WE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). High credibility.

As for the dose-dependent effect of ondansetron on shivering, Powell et al. found that ondansetron was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in shivering, while this effect was not observed in the pooled effect. The incidence of shivering was 10% in individuals weighing about 52 kg with low-dose ondansetron (4 mg), but Powell et al. found the incidence was 8% in individuals weighing about 76 kg with high-dose ondansetron (8 mg). We presume that the various weights of the subjects might mask the dose-dependent effect.

When compared to other drugs, ondansetron is absent from the hemodynamic effects in the treatment and prevention of post-anesthesia shivering (PAS), which contributes significantly to its safety. Thus, the result showing no difference in bradycardia between ondansetron and placebo is acceptable despite a limited sample size. Additionally, two recent studies demonstrated ondansetron is safe for pregnant women and fetuses.

Apart from the primary outcome of PAS and the side effect of bradycardia, other side effects were mentioned but were not appropriate for quantitative analysis. Among these, none indicated a significant risk of convulsion, myoclonus, rash, pruritus, headache, pain, hypotension, sedation, nausea, or vomiting.

### QT prolongation, torsades des pointes, and cardiac arrest after 4 mg of IV ondansetron [^115Vq7s6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is a commonly used antiemetic in the emergency department despite a 2011 FDA warning regarding dose-related QTc prolongation and torsades des pointes (TdP). Cases of TdP from small ondansetron doses administered in the emergency department are lacking.

A 41-year-old woman with alcohol use disorder, on no medications or supplements, presented to an emergency department with one day of nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. Examination revealed a pulse of 77 beats/min and epigastric tenderness. The patient received 4 mg IV ondansetron, 30 mg IV ketorolac, and was placed on cardiac monitoring. An ECG obtained one minute after ondansetron demonstrated premature ventricular contractions with QTc = 653 ms. Thirteen minutes after receiving ondansetron, she suffered TdP and cardiac arrest. She received immediate CPR and IV epinephrine with successful defibrillation at one minute. She then received IV magnesium.

Post-arrest ECGs demonstrated persistent QTc prolongation immediately and at three hours post-arrest. Laboratory studies, drawn prior to arrest, demonstrated hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L), hypomagnesemia (1.3 mg/dL), and elevated lipase (4918 IU/L). She received no additional QT-prolonging agents. Transthoracic echocardiogram and troponins were normal; ECG intervals completely normalized within 12 hours, and she was discharged neurologically intact.

The patient returned 18 months later with recurrent pancreatitis and similar electrolyte abnormalities. QT-prolonging drugs were avoided at that time, and her course was uncomplicated.

### Intravenous ondansetron and the QT interval in adult emergency department patients: An observational study [^115iR6QT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is known to cause QT interval prolongation, but this effect and its clinical significance have not been prospectively studied in adult emergency department (ED) patients. The primary objective was to determine the mean maximal corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation after intravenous (IV) administration of 4 mg of ondansetron. The secondary objective was to report any serious adverse cardiac electrical events.

This prospective, observational, single-center cohort study was conducted between 2012 and 2013 in an academic military hospital ED. Adult patients ordered to receive 4 mg of IV ondansetron were eligible for the study. A six-lead electrocardiogram was recorded at baseline and every 2 minutes after ondansetron administration for 20 minutes. The QTc was calculated using the Bazett formula. Serious adverse cardiac electrical events, including nonsinus rhythm, severe bradycardia, and sudden cardiac death, were also recorded.

A total of twenty-two adult ED patients were enrolled. Ondansetron caused a mean prolongation of the QTc by 20 ms (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14 to 26 ms), with a mean proportion change from baseline of 5.2% (95% CI = 3.8% to 6.6%). There were zero (95% CI = 0 to 13%) reported serious adverse cardiac electrical events.

While QTc prolongation does occur in adult ED patients receiving IV ondansetron, the clinical impact is questionable.

### Effects of preoperative serotonin-receptor-antagonist administration in spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension: A randomized, double-blind comparison study of ramosetron and ondansetron [^115H8mrP]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The adverse effects of spinal anesthesia (SA) include arterial hypotension and bradycardia. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two type 3 serotonin receptor antagonists in SA-induced adverse effects. Specifically, we assessed whether ramosetron was more effective than ondansetron in reducing SA-induced decreases in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR).

A total of 117 patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and receiving SA were intravenously administered 0.3 mg of ramosetron (n = 39, group R), 4 mg of ondansetron (n = 39, group O4), or 8 mg of ondansetron (n = 39, group O8). Systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean BP (MBP), HR, and the lowest SBP, DBP, MBP, and HR values were measured preoperatively (baseline) and intraoperatively. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, the need for rescue antiemetics, the amount of patient-controlled analgesia consumption, and pain score in the first 48 hours after surgery were determined.

Baseline values did not significantly differ among the three groups. After SA, SBP, DBP, MBP, and HR were lower than their baseline values in all three groups. The differences between the baseline and the lowest values were significantly less in group R than in groups O4 and O8 with respect to SBP (P < 0.001), DBP (P = 0.001), and MBP (P < 0.001). Differences were less significant in group R than in group O4 with respect to HR (P = 0.032). Intergroup differences were not significant for postoperative nausea and vomiting, the need for rescue antiemetics, patient-controlled analgesia consumption, or pain score.

### The effect of intravenous ondansetron on QT interval in the emergency department [^115PRXBM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Ondansetron, a 5HT3 receptor antagonist, is commonly used in emergency departments to treat nausea and vomiting. In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that this medicine may cause QT prolongation, potentially leading to deadly arrhythmias. The objective of this study was to characterize the QT interval prolongation associated with ondansetron use in the emergency department.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, observational cohort study of adult patients who presented to the emergency department during a one-year period and were treated with intravenous ondansetron. We investigated the QT prolongation associated with dosages. ECGs were obtained before the medication and 5, 15, and 30 minutes after IV drug administration. Every QT measurement was recorded and compared to the zero point. The severity of drug-induced QT prolongation was determined according to the recommendations of the International Conference on Compliance (ICH). QTc prolongation was categorized as 'negligible' (20 ms), 'potential concern' (> 30 ms), or 'definitely worrying' (> 60 ms).

- **Results**: Of the 435 patients enrolled in the study, 60% (261 patients) were female, and the mean age was 39 (± 18). The QT prolongation peaked at the fifth minute and remained consistent at the fifteenth and thirty-first minutes. The maximum prolongation of the mean QT duration occurred at the fifth minute (7.9 ± 18.1 ms). No patient revealed any problems with cardiac conduction. The prolonged QT interval was not related to the dose of ondansetron, but QT measurements were consistent.

### Effect of ramosetron on QTc interval: a randomised controlled trial in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery [^113MUrsp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). High credibility.

Ramosetron is a relatively new 5-hydroxytryptamine three receptor antagonist with a higher binding affinity and a more prolonged duration of action compared to ondansetron. The present study was performed to evaluate the effects of ramosetron on the QTc interval and possible cardiovascular adverse effects in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

- **Method**: A total of 114 patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery were enrolled in this randomised placebo-controlled trial. Patients were allocated into two groups that received an intravenous injection of 0.3 mg ramosetron or normal saline during the induction of anaesthesia. QTc intervals were measured at various times:

- **Preoperative and intraoperative measurements**: Before the operation, intraoperatively (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 240 minutes after injection of ramosetron or normal saline)
- **End of operation and postoperative measurements**: At the end of the operation, and on postoperative day 1

- **Results**: There were no differences in the mean QTc interval between groups at every time point. However:

- **Maximal change in QTc interval**: Higher in the ramosetron group than the placebo group (25.1 ± 22.0 vs. 17.5 ± 14.5 ms, 95% CI 0.34–14.78, P = 0.040)
- **Increase in QTc interval > 60 ms**: More patients in the ramosetron group (5 vs. 0, 95% CI 1.6–18.0, P = 0.021)

There were no significant differences in cardiovascular complications.

- **Conclusions**: Ramosetron administered during the induction of anaesthesia may affect the maximal change in QTc interval during off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. Ramosetron should be used with caution in high-risk patients for developing Torsades de Pointes.

### Prolongation of QTc interval after postoperative nausea and vomiting treatment by droperidol or ondansetron [^1126be5U]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

At dosages above 0.1 mg/kg, droperidol induces a dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation. Although subject to controversy, low-dose droperidol has recently been suspected to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Hence, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 antagonists have become the first-line drug for managing postoperative nausea and vomiting. These drugs are also known to prolong the QTc interval at high dosages. This study describes QTc interval changes associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting treatment by droperidol or ondansetron at low doses.

- **Methods**: Eighty-five patients with postoperative nausea and vomiting were included in this prospective, single-blind study. Patients received either 0.75 mg intravenous droperidol (n = 43) or 4 mg intravenous ondansetron (n = 42). Electrocardiographic recordings were obtained before administration of the antiemetic drug and then 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after. Electrocardiographic monitoring was maintained for 3 hours in eight patients in each group.

- **Results**: The QTc interval was prolonged (> 450 ms in men, > 470 ms in women) in 21% of the patients before antiemetic drug administration, which was significantly correlated with lower body temperature and longer duration of anesthesia. Compared with predrug QTc measurement, both antiemetics were associated with a significant QTc interval prolongation (P < 0.0001). The mean maximal QTc interval prolongation was 17 ± 9 ms after droperidol occurring at the second minute and 20 ± 13 ms after ondansetron at the third minute (both P < 0.0001). Compared with predrug measurement, the…

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^113uwLLs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. While its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, it is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In normal volunteers, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. In another trial involving six normal male volunteers, a 16 mg dose infused over 5 minutes showed no effect on cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, blood pressure, or ECG. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in normal volunteers. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations. In a gender-balanced pharmacodynamic trial (n = 56), ondansetron 4 mg administered intravenously or intramuscularly was dynamically similar in the prevention of nausea and vomiting using the ipecacuanha model of emesis.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double-blind, single intravenous dose, placebo- and positive-controlled, crossover trial of 58 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction was 19.5 (21.8) ms and 5.6 (7.4) ms after 15-minute intravenous infusions of 32 mg and 8 mg ondansetron, respectively. A significant exposure-response relationship was identified between ondansetron concentration and ΔΔQTcF. Using the established exposure-response relationship, 24 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes has been assessed.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ondansetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Cardiovascular**: Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely, and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes, including QT interval prolongation, have been reported. Myocardial ischemia was reported predominantly with intravenous administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **General**: Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g. anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor), have also been reported. Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron.

- **Hepatobiliary**: Liver enzyme abnormalities.

- **Lower respiratory**: Hiccups.

- **Neurology**: Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions.

- **Skin**: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

- **Eye disorders**: Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported.

### SPL drug information for ondansetron hydrochloride [^111BFkMa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride IV (also known as Zofran):

- **Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm**: Use extreme caution in patients with hypersensitivity to selective 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists.

- **Mask symptoms of ileus, gastric distension**: Use caution in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or after abdominal surgery.

- **Myocardial infarction**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischemia.

- **Prolonged QT interval**: Use caution in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure (HF), bradyarrhythmias, or those taking other QT-prolonging medications. Obtain ECG monitoring and avoid using ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially in patients with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs such as SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, MAOIs, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue.

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: The BRAVO framework [^1167wWvB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

**Identified benefits and risks**: Ondansetron improves the success of oral rehydration therapy and prevents hospitalization. Appropriate dose selection is possible. However, infants up to 3 months of age have a greater risk for toxicity as exposure to ondansetron may be increased due to reduced clearance in this population. When correcting based on reduced clearance only, these children are at risk for underexposure due to the higher volume of distribution (Vd). Dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval may occur, especially in children with congenital long QT interval syndrome. Prolongation of the QT interval is dose-dependent. The use of ondansetron has a limited effect on the cessation of vomiting.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112U1sj1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although serotonin (5-HT₃) receptor antagonists are effective in reducing nausea and vomiting, they may be associated with increased cardiac risk. Our objective was to examine the comparative safety and effectiveness of 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists (e.g. dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, tropisetron) alone or combined with steroids for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until December 2015 for studies comparing 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists with each other or placebo in chemotherapy patients. The search results were screened, data were abstracted, and risk of bias was appraised by pairs of reviewers independently. Random-effects meta-analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs) were conducted.

- **Results**: After screening 9,226 citations and 970 full-text articles, we included 299 studies (n = 58,412 patients). None of the included studies reported harms for active treatment versus placebo. For NMAs on the risk of arrhythmia (primary outcome; three randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 627 adults) and mortality (secondary outcome; eight RCTs, 4,823 adults), no statistically significant differences were observed between agents. A NMA on the risk of QTc prolongation showed a significantly greater risk for dolasetron + dexamethasone versus ondansetron + dexamethasone (four RCTs, 3,358 children and adults, odds ratio 2.94, 95% confidence interval 2.13–4.17).

For NMAs on the number of patients without nausea (44 RCTs, 11,664 adults, 12 treatments), numb…

### Efficacy and safety of ondansetron in preventing postanesthesia shivering: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Q1Fof]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, with the increasing awareness of its undesirable aftermath, effective prevention of postanesthesia shivering (PAS) has become imperative. It has been reported that PAS can be prevented by warming the skin surface and administered fluids, but these methods are not perfect solutions. Many drugs have been shown to be effective in preventing PAS, such as opioids, α2-agonists, anticholinergics, CNS stimulants, and corticosteroids. However, few are recommended for PAS prevention due to various side effects. For instance, clonidine, a partial α2 adrenergic agonist, is associated with bradycardia, hypotension, and sedation.

Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, is widely used to prevent postoperative and pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. The 5-HT can affect body temperature and shivering in rats, as the balance of norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus controls the temperature set point. Several studies have consistently demonstrated that ondansetron can prevent PAS, making it a promising drug for postoperative complications, including PAS, nausea, and vomiting. However, a later large-sample study conducted by Browning et al. indicated that ondansetron did not prevent PAS among women undergoing combined spinal and epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. To our knowledge, no meta-analysis has identified the precise effect of ondansetron on PAS. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate and quantify the preventive effect of ondansetron.

### Minimal effective weight-based dosing of ondansetron to reduce hypotension in cesarean section under spinal anesthesia: a randomized controlled superiority trial [^112hV8gu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, we found that a weight-based dose of prophylactic ondansetron did not influence the incidence of maternal hypotension. The results of this study were consistent with two other studies but were in contrast with others. Two recent systematic reviews showed that ondansetron reduced the incidence of hypotension (relative risk ratio [RR] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45–0.88 and RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54–0.83, respectively) and bradycardia (RR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.19–0.50 and RR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.28–0.87, respectively) after spinal anesthesia in cesarean sections, even though a low quality of evidence was reported. However, the minimal effective weight-based dosing of ondansetron in parturients was not determined.

### Ondansetron [^113AmoCM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. While its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, ondansetron is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is not certain whether ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated centrally, peripherally, or in both sites. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. In humans, urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion increases after cisplatin administration in parallel with the onset of emesis. The released serotonin may stimulate the vagal afferents through the 5-HT3 receptors and initiate the vomiting reflex.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma-prolactin concentrations.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double-blind, single-intravenous dose, placebo- and positive-controlled, crossover trial in 58 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline correction was 19.5 (21.8) milliseconds and 5.6 (7.4) milliseconds.

### Efficacy and safety of ondansetron in preventing postanesthesia shivering: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115Xu8nJ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). High credibility.

According to our findings, compared with placebo, ondansetron could reduce the prevalence of postanesthesia shivering (PAS) from 49.3% to 23.4% without an increased risk of bradycardia. However, no superiority was observed for ondansetron over meperidine regarding the effect on antishivering and incidence of bradycardia.

The serotonin system plays an important role in thermoregulation. The mechanisms of ondansetron on PAS may be related to a central mechanism involving the inhibition of 5-HT reuptake in the preoptic anterior hypothalamic region. It has been proven that a 5-HT3 agonist can induce hyperthermia, while its antagonist can lead to hypothermia. However, in healthy volunteers, the core-temperature thresholds triggering shivering did not change when compared with placebo. Several studies have shown that the core-to-peripheral redistribution of body temperature after general anesthesia is characterized by a decrease in core temperature during the first 20 to 30 minutes, and this alteration remained similar in the ondansetron group. The evidence above suggests that the effect of ondansetron on PAS prevention is unrelated to core hypothermia. On the contrary, Kelsaka et al. found that core temperature was preserved in the ondansetron group rather than the placebo group, but this finding was not supported by other research, indicating limited evidence for temperature preservation as another antishivering mechanism.

Shivering differs between general anesthesia and neuraxial anesthesia. General anesthesia can impair central thermoregulation, while neuraxial anesthesia impairs both central and peripheral mechanisms.

Ondansetron injection is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist indicated for the prevention of:

- **Nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy**: Ondansetron injection is indicated for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including high-dose cisplatin. Ondansetron injection is approved for patients aged 6 months and older.

- **Postoperative nausea and/or vomiting**: Ondansetron injection is indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting. As with other antiemetics, routine prophylaxis is not recommended for patients in whom there is little expectation that nausea and/or vomiting will occur postoperatively. In patients in whom nausea and/or vomiting must be avoided postoperatively, ondansetron injection is recommended even when the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting is low. For patients who do not receive prophylactic ondansetron injection and experience nausea and/or vomiting postoperatively, ondansetron injection may be given to prevent further episodes. Ondansetron injection is approved for patients aged 1 month and older.

### The pronociceptive effect of ondansetron in the setting of P-glycoprotein inhibition [^113komqZ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is a potent antiemetic drug that acts through inhibition of the 5HT3 receptors for serotonin. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for isoflurane is not affected by systemic ondansetron; however, ondansetron is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, a transport pump expressed in the blood-brain barrier. We hypothesized that central nervous system concentrations of ondansetron might be reduced by the P-gp protein. As potent inhibitors of P-gp are in clinical trials to improve access of desirable chemotherapeutic and antibiotic drugs to the central nervous system, we studied the effect of ondansetron in the absence of extrusion by P-gp.

Normal rats were given lumbar intrathecal ondansetron or vehicle. P-gp knockout mice and wild-type controls were treated with systemic ondansetron in the presence and absence of clinically used P-gp inhibitors. Nociception was assessed as thermal hindpaw withdrawal latency, and immobility was assessed as isoflurane MAC. In rats, intrathecal ondansetron (20 g) increased thermal pain sensitivity by 20.0% ± 5.8% (P < 0.01). Systemic ondansetron (2 mg/kg) increased pain sensitivity in P-gp knockout mice but had no effect in wild-type mice (P < 0.01).

Systemic ondansetron had a small but statistically significant pronociceptive effect after treatment of wild-type mice with the P-gp inhibitor quinidine, but not with cyclosporine or verapamil. Isoflurane MAC was not changed by intrathecal ondansetron in rats or systemically administered ondansetron in P-gp knockout mice. Intrathecal ondansetron can enhance thermal pain sensitivity.

### Efficacy and safety of ondansetron in preventing postanesthesia shivering: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1143o8Rn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Directions for future research should be drawn from the meta-analysis. Adequate sample sizes and comprehensive side effect profiles should be considered in future studies. The effects of various dosages of ondansetron, different anesthetic techniques, and surgical settings on postanesthesia shivering (PAS) should also be explored. Furthermore, studies aimed at comparing ondansetron with other drugs should be conducted to evaluate both the clinical and economic efficacy of ondansetron. Finally, the definition of PAS should be standardized.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone. Most reports have been associated with the concomitant use of serotonergic drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue. Some reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with an overdose of ondansetron alone has also been documented. The majority of reports related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.

	- Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include a combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), and neuromuscular symptoms (e.g. tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination). Seizures may also occur, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be closely monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with the concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, ondansetron should be discontinued and supportive treatment initiated. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly if ondansetron is used alongside other serotonergic medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdose].

### Effect of intravenous ondansetron on the QT interval of patients' electrocardiograms [^111jiQsB]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Ondansetron improves the success of oral rehydration in children with gastroenteritis. In postoperative adults, ondansetron has been shown to prolong the corrected QT (QTc). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of ondansetron on the QT at peak effect and at 1-hour postpeak effect in pediatric patients.

- **Methods**: This was an observational study looking at patients aged 6 months to 18 years receiving intravenous ondansetron for nausea, vomiting, or the inability to take fluids in the emergency department. Patients had electrocardiograms performed at baseline, at ondansetron's peak effect, and 1 hour postpeak effect. A paired samples Student t-test compared QTc change at peak effect to zero. The peak effect of intravenous ondansetron occurs at 3 minutes.

- **Results**: One hundred patients were included. Fifty-five percent of patients were female with a mean age of 8.3 years. The mean (range) baseline QTc was 435 (388 to 501) milliseconds. The mean (range) change in QTc at the peak effect of ondansetron was 3 (-40 to 65) milliseconds (P = 0.072). The change in QTc 1-hour postpeak effect of ondansetron was 3 (-43 to 45) milliseconds (P = 0.082). No change at peak effect or 1-hour postpeak effect was clinically significant.

- **Conclusions**: Ondansetron does not affect the QTc of pediatric patients receiving the medication for nausea, vomiting, or inability to take fluids in the emergency department. No changes in the QTc are clinically significant. At the time of writing, there have been no studies evaluating the effect of ondansetron in this acutely ill population; therefore, a larger study is suggested.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^116Jhf9W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The postmarketing experience of ondansetron hydrochloride has identified several adverse reactions. These reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, making it challenging to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. They have been included here due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to ondansetron.

- **Cardiovascular**: Arrhythmias have been observed, including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation. Other issues include bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations such as second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression, as well as palpitations and syncope. Rare occurrences, primarily with intravenous ondansetron, include transient ECG changes like QT/QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Myocardial ischemia has also been noted predominantly with intravenous administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **General**: Flushing has been reported. There are rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe, such as anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, cardiopulmonary arrest, hypotension, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, shock, shortness of breath, and stridor. A positive lymphocyte transformation test to ondansetron suggests immunologic sensitivity to the drug.

- **Hepatobiliary**: Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported. Furthermore, liver failure and death have been noted.

### Fatal cardiac arrest in 2 children: Possible role of ondansetron [^111LfdFb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is commonly used to treat vomiting in gastroenteritis, but it has a United States Food and Drug Administration black box warning for the risk of Q wave to T wave time interval (QT) prolongation. We report two pediatric cases of fatal refractory cardiac arrest after the administration of ondansetron.

- **Cases**: A 10-year-old previously healthy boy presented to the emergency room with gastroenteritis symptoms. After intravenous fluids, morphine, antibiotics, and two doses of ondansetron, the patient became unresponsive with agonal respirations and a wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia. In a second case, an 86-day-old infant with previously unidentified congenital cardiomyopathy presented to our emergency department with gastroenteritis symptoms. The patient received ondansetron and subsequently experienced repeated bouts of supraventricular tachycardia, which progressed to ventricular fibrillation. Resuscitation efforts failed in each case, and both patients expired.

- **Discussion**: Ondansetron can cause dose-dependent QT prolongation effects, which are more clinically relevant when other proarrhythmic elements are present. There is very limited published experience on the use of ondansetron in children younger than two years. Our two cases join two previous case reports of death after ondansetron administration for gastroenteritis. The pharmacology of ondansetron's cardiac effects and drug-induced QT prolongation is discussed.

- **Conclusions**: Patients may have hidden risk factors that, together with ondansetron, could result in a proarrhythmic state.

### Randomized controlled trial comparing ondansetron and placebo for the reduction of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension during elective cesarean delivery in Egypt [^116udL15]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of prophylactic ondansetron on spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension and bradycardia among patients undergoing elective cesarean deliveries.

- **Methods**: A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled patients aged 20–40 years scheduled for elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia between January 1, 2015, and January 31, 2016, at Menoufia University Hospital, Egypt. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous ondansetron 4 mg in 10 mL of saline or 10 mL of saline. Participants and investigators were masked to group assignments. The primary outcomes were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate, measured at baseline, at 10-minute intervals up to 60 minutes, and at 2 hours. Per-protocol analyses were performed including patients who delivered under spinal anesthesia.

- **Results**: The analyses included 50 patients in each group. Decreases in systolic blood pressure were reduced among patients receiving ondansetron at all time points (P < 0.05). Among patients who received ondansetron, mean arterial pressure was higher immediately and 30 minutes after spinal anesthesia (P < 0.05), higher heart rates were recorded immediately, 20 minutes, and 50 minutes after anesthesia (P < 0.05), and the incidence of nausea (P = 0.020) and vomiting (P = 0.031) were lower.

- **Conclusion**: Prophylactic intravenous ondansetron significantly reduced hypotension and heart-rate fluctuations among patients undergoing elective cesarean deliveries under spinal anesthesia.

### A single prophylactic dose of ondansetron given at cessation of postoperative propofol sedation decreases postoperative nausea and vomiting in cardiac surgery patients: A randomized controlled trial [^113tMn67]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common occurrence after cardiac surgery. However, in contrast to other surgical populations, routine PONV prophylaxis is not a standard of care in cardiac surgery. We hypothesized that routine administration of a single prophylactic dose of ondansetron (4 mg) at the time of stopping postoperative propofol sedation before extubation in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit would decrease the incidence of PONV.

With institutional human ethics board approval and written informed consent, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in patients aged ≥ 19 years with no history of PONV undergoing elective or urgent cardiac surgery procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome was the incidence of PONV in the first 24 hours postextubation, compared by the χ test. Secondary outcomes included the incidence and times to first dose of rescue antiemetic treatment administration, the incidence of headaches, and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias.

PONV within the first 24 hours postextubation occurred in 33 of 77 patients (43%) in the ondansetron group versus 50 of 82 patients (61%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.70 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.51–0.95]; absolute risk difference, -18% [95% CI, -33 to -2]; number needed to treat, 5.5 [95% CI, 3.0–58.4]; χ test, P = 0.022). Kaplan-Meier "survival" analysis of the times to first rescue antiemetic treatment administration over 24 hours indicated that patients in the ondansetron group fared better than those in the placebo group.
