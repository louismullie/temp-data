## Question

What are the diagnostic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on echocardiography. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and why echocardiography is the reference standard. Then, I should verify the primary quantitative criterion (indexed LV mass) and the sex-specific thresholds. Next, I will examine the role of relative wall thickness to classify geometry. After that, I need to check alternative indexing methods and their implications. I will then consider special populations and ethnic-specific criteria. Finally, I should review measurement technique, prognostic relevance, and how to integrate this into clinical decision-making with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't gloss over basics: LVH is an increase in LV wall thickness and/or mass, and echocardiography is the first-line modality to detect and quantify it because it provides direct structural assessment and prognostic information beyond what ECG can offer, which is why guidelines prioritize echo for this purpose [^d88801d9] [^6b1c7b8e].

> I will now examine the primary quantitative criterion. Wait, let me verify the exact thresholds and indexing. The standard approach is to calculate LV mass using a validated formula (typically the ASE-cube method) and index to body surface area, with LVH defined as LVMI greater than 115 g/m² in men and greater than 95 g/m² in women; these cutoffs derive from population data and are the conventional ASE/EACVI reference limits used in adult hypertension and general risk stratification [^c19a70ae] [^70239275].

> Hold on, I should verify the geometric classification because mass alone doesn't tell the whole story. Relative wall thickness (RWT) is used to phenotype LVH: RWT greater than 0.42 indicates concentric geometry, whereas RWT less than or equal to 0.42 indicates eccentric geometry; this helps distinguish pressure overload (concentric) from volume overload or dilated phenotypes (eccentric) and is a required element in standard echo reporting of LV geometry [^3cf4d1a4] [^31d7fc58].

> Let me consider alternative indexing because body size and habitus can distort BSA-indexed values. Indexing LV mass to height raised to the 2.7 power (LVMI2.7) is recommended in some contexts, with proposed upper limits around 51 g/m2.7 in men and 47 g/m2.7 in women; this approach reduces obesity-related inflation of BSA-indexed mass and may better reflect pathologic hypertrophy in certain populations, though I should note that 3D echo reference values are less established and should be interpreted cautiously [^c19a70ae] [^02c7db8a].

> But wait, what if the patient is from a different ethnic background where reference ranges differ? I need to check ethnically specific criteria. The EMINCA study in Chinese adults proposed slightly different LVMI cutoffs (approximately 109 g/m² in men and 105 g/m² in women) and a higher RWT threshold for concentric remodeling (about 0.51), which meaningfully changes prevalence and risk associations; importantly, both ASE/EACVI and EMINCA-defined LVH independently predict cardiovascular death, underscoring that the choice of criteria can shift case finding and prognostic interpretation in population-level analyses [^77ef4492] [^c3d37b5c] [^ed5de5c0].

> Next, I should review measurement technique to ensure we are not introducing error. Linear measurements for wall thickness and cavity dimension should be made at end-diastole from parasternal long-axis views, ideally using 2D-guided M-mode at the mitral chordae level; LV mass is then calculated with the ASE-cube formula and indexed. I should double-check that this aligns with contemporary quantification guidance, which it does, and remember that 3D echo improves accuracy but requires good image quality and cooperation [^c19a70ae] [^e298003f].

> I will now examine the prognostic implications so I don't miss the clinical relevance. LVH detected by echo is independently associated with higher risks of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, with a graded relationship across LV mass categories; concentric hypertrophy in particular identifies a high-risk phenotype with adverse vascular and myocardial features, and even modest increases in LVMI carry measurable risk, which is why guidelines incorporate echo-LVH into risk stratification in hypertension [^d626a6e4] [^c8a0d8f7] [^6b1c7b8e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about when to order echo. I should confirm guideline indications. Echocardiography is reasonable in selected hypertensive patients to assess for LVH and LV function, especially when target organ damage is suspected, blood pressure is resistant or uncontrolled, there are symptoms or signs of heart failure, or there is a need to refine cardiovascular risk; it is not universally recommended for all hypertensive patients, so clinical judgment and resource considerations apply [^7a0ec2c3] [^21f61979] [^6b1c7b8e].

> Let me reconsider special populations briefly so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, LVH is typically defined using LVMI indexed to height2.7 with a threshold around 51 g/m2.7, and wall-thickness z-scores are sometimes used, though concordance with LVMI-based definitions is imperfect; in athletes, physiologic hypertrophy must be distinguished from pathologic, often requiring integration of wall thickness, cavity size, RWT, and tissue characterization; in suspected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, maximal wall thickness of 15 mm or more in adults is a key diagnostic threshold, with lower cutoffs acceptable in the presence of family history or known sarcomeric mutations [^9ae06853] [^b9a38534] [^c3b898bf].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnostic workflow is explicit: calculate LV mass from standard linear measurements, index to BSA (or height2.7 when appropriate), apply sex-specific thresholds to define LVH, compute RWT to classify geometry, and interpret findings in clinical context including ethnicity, body habitus, and comorbidities; this approach aligns with ASE/EACVI standards, accommodates ethnically specific data where relevant, and maximizes the prognostic value of echocardiography in detecting LVH [^c19a70ae] [^77ef4492] [^d88801d9].

---

Echocardiographic LVH is defined by **indexed LV mass > 115 g/m² in men or > 95 g/m² in women** [^c19a70ae] using 2D-guided M-mode or 2D echocardiography [^70239275], with **relative wall thickness (RWT) ≥ 0.42** distinguishing concentric from eccentric hypertrophy [^3cf4d1a4]. These thresholds are derived from population data and are the **standard ASE/EACVI criteria** [^c19a70ae]; alternative indexing to height^2.7 may be used in obesity or when BSA is misleading [^c19a70ae]. LVH is a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular risk [^d626a6e4] and should be interpreted alongside geometry and function [^6b1c7b8e].

## Quantitative criteria for LVH

### Left ventricular mass index (LVMI)

- **Definition**: LVMI is LV mass indexed to body surface area (BSA) [^c19a70ae].
- **Standard thresholds**: > 115 g/m² in men or > 95 g/m² in women [^c19a70ae] [^70239275].
- **Alternative indexing**: Height^2.7 may be used when BSA is misleading (e.g. obesity) [^c19a70ae].

---

### Relative wall thickness (RWT)

RWT is calculated as **2 × posterior wall thickness / LV internal diameter at end-diastole** [^c19a70ae] and is used to classify geometry: concentric hypertrophy has RWT ≥ 0.42, whereas eccentric hypertrophy has RWT < 0.42 [^3cf4d1a4].

---

## Geometric patterns of LVH

LVH is classified into **four geometric patterns** based on LVMI and RWT [^70239275]:

| **Geometry** | **Lvmi** | **Rwt** |
|-|-|-|
| Normal | Normal | ≤ 0.42 |
| Concentric remodeling | Normal | > 0.42 |
| Eccentric hypertrophy | Increased | ≤ 0.42 |
| Concentric hypertrophy | Increased | > 0.42 |

---

## Measurement techniques

- **2D-guided M-mode**: Traditional, widely used, but assumes uniform geometry [^c19a70ae].
- **2D echocardiography**: More accurate, accounts for shape, and is preferred when feasible [^c19a70ae].
- **3D echocardiography**: Highest accuracy, avoids geometric assumptions, but availability is limited [^e298003f].

---

## Clinical significance of LVH

LVH is a **strong independent predictor** of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death [^d626a6e4] [^fb23569f]. Concentric hypertrophy carries the highest risk, whereas eccentric hypertrophy reflects volume overload and is common in obesity and valvular disease [^c3975f4f] [^be2620fb].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Obesity**: May inflate BSA-indexed LVMI; height^2.7 indexing may be preferable [^c19a70ae].
- **Ethnicity**: Reference ranges may vary; ethnically specific criteria are being studied [^bf95dced].
- **Athletes**: Physiologic hypertrophy must be distinguished from pathologic LVH [^c3b898bf].

---

Echocardiographic LVH is defined by **LVMI > 115 g/m² in men or > 95 g/m² in women**, with RWT ≥ 0.42 distinguishing concentric from eccentric hypertrophy [^c19a70ae]. These criteria guide risk stratification and management, but should be interpreted in clinical context and with awareness of limitations.

### The different faces of echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy: clues to the etiology [^a217f725]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Low credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy is a nonspecific physiologic or maladaptive cardiac response to a large array of stimuli mediated by exercise and numerous cardiac and systemic diseases. Hypertrophy, however, is not uniform. Rather, depending on the underlying pathologic mechanism, it may display unique morphologic and functional characteristics. The precise characterization and quantification of left ventricular hypertrophy may therefore allow a more timely diagnosis of the underlying condition. The clinical reference standard to assess left ventricular hypertrophy is echocardiography, but a comprehensive description of how to approach this frequent finding in clinical practice is lacking. The current review systematically describes the typical echocardiographic patterns of important types of cardiac hypertrophy using both established and advanced imaging modalities, thus guiding clinicians' path to early diagnosis.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was one of the earliest studied echocardiographic characteristics of the left ventricle. As the myriad of measurable metrics has multiplied over recent years, this reliable and relevant variable can often be overlooked. In this paper, we discuss appropriate techniques for accurate analysis, underlying pathophysiology, and the contributions from various risk factors. The prognostic implications of LVH on stroke, serious arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death are reviewed. Finally, we examine the effect of therapy to reduce LVH and the resultant clinical outcomes.

Clinical Perspective

Presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death., Understanding the prevalence of LVH in the general population, therefore, has significant clinical and public health implications for estimating future CVD burden and developing prevention strategies.

The prevalence of LVH in a Chinese population has been reported previously., However, these studies were subject to small sample size, did not represent the general Chinese population, and did not evaluate prognostic implications of LVH., Echocardiographic criteria for LVH diagnosis in these studies were based on the American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (ASE/EACVI) criteria, which were derived from a White population. Results of the EchoNoRMAL (Echocardiographic Normal Ranges Meta‐Analysis of the Left Heart) study (an international echocardiographic collaboration study) and the EMINCA (Echocardiographic Measurements in Normal Chinese Adults) study (an echocardiographic study of the Chinese healthy population) have suggested that several echocardiographic parameters of cardiac structure and function differ by ethnicity, advocating for ethnically based thresholds to define the normality of echocardiographic parameters. Furthermore, results of our recent single‐center study show that LVH diagnosis based on the EMINCA study criteria might be better than the ASE/EACVI criteria in terms of its association with cardiovascular death and all‐cause death. However, large‐scale, population‐based studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.

Accordingly, using data from the echocardiographic subcohort of the China Hypertension Survey 2012 to 2015, we sought to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic implications of LVH based on the EMINCA study and the ASE/EACVI criteria, respectively. We hypothesized that echocardiographic criteria might influence the prevalence and prognostic implication of LVH in a general Chinese population.

### Influence of echocardiographic criteria on the prevalence and prognostic implication of left ventricular hypertrophy: a Nationwide population-based study [^a4275854]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical and Public Health Implications

The ASE/EACVI criteria, with a lower cutoff in women, can facilitate earlier identification and intervention in individuals with mild LVH, potentially preventing LVH progression to overt CVD. However, at a population level, applying these less strict criteria could result in a larger proportion of individuals being classified as having LVH, potentially increasing the burden on health care systems. In contrast, the cutoffs of EMINCA study criteria are higher and may better identify individuals with advanced or pathological LVH, prioritizing interventions for those at higher mortality risk and focusing resources on those likely to benefit most. However, the EMINCA study criteria may underdiagnose individuals with mild LVH who could benefit from timely preventive measures. For example, among individuals with borderline hypertension, presence of LVH may lead to early initiation of antihypertensive medications, thus preventing the progression of LVH to overt CVD.

Differences in the echocardiographic criteria for diagnosing LVH can lead to diagnostic discrepancies, significantly impacting clinical decision making and patient management. Incorporating additional diagnostic tools, such as advanced imaging or biomarkers, could complement the LVMI criteria and improve risk stratification. Clinicians should exercise caution when relying on a single criterion, particularly in populations with distinct genetic profiles and demographic characteristics. Future echocardiographic guidelines may consider incorporating population‐specific cutoffs or adjusted criteria to enhance the accuracy and consistency of LVH diagnosis.

Strengths and Limitations

The current study has several strengths, including a rigorous random sampling method, large sample size, and accurate outcome data collection. However, there are also several limitations. First, a proportion of participants were lost to follow‐up, and there were differences in baseline characteristics between participants who were followed up and lost to follow‐up, suggesting potential selection bias. Second, data on other major events, such as heart failure, were unavailable, and we were therefore unable to investigate the value of the criteria of the EMINCA study in predicting these outcomes. Third, time‐dependent covariates such as BP at follow‐up were unavailable, which might influence the relationship between LVH and outcomes. Lastly, although multiple covariates have been accounted for, residual confounding might still exist and influence the relationship between LVH and outcomes.

### Do we need new electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy? The case of the peguero-Lo presti criterion. A narrative review [^b9b60d10]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) represents an independent predictor of increased risk of cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in the general population and a variety of clinical settings. Systemic hypertension is the most important risk factor involved in the transition process from normal structure/geometry to LV remodeling up to LVH by inducing myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis resulting in alterations of both LV contractility and relaxation.LVH reflects an intermediate step in the disease continuum linking established risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, to nonfatal and fatal cardiovascular events. The detection of LVH has long been considered an important diagnostic objective for identifying high-risk patients deserving of targeted therapeutic interventions. Indeed, the identification of hypertensive-mediated cardiac organ damage is crucial for the proper stratification of the patient's overall cardiovascular risk. The importance of LVH detection has also increased with the recognition that LVH can regress as a result of therapy and that this can delay or prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In particular, different antihypertensive agents have proven effective in regressing LVH. The diagnostic accuracy in identifying LVH varies in relation to the technique used, being clearly lower with the electrocardiogram (ECG) than with imaging techniques such as 2- or 3-dimensional echocardiogram (ECHO), computerized tomography, and even more so with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although these imaging techniques provide a more accurate assessment of LV mass (LVM) than the ECG, they cannot systematically replace the ECG. Wide availability and low cost are the key factors that make the ECG still not replaceable as the first step in detecting LVH for clinical, epidemiological, and research purposes. Although the ECG is a routinely used screening tool its accuracy in predicting the presence of anatomical LVH, however, is largely suboptimal. Since the late 1940s, dozens of different ECG criteria mostly based on measurements of QRS voltages have been proposed in order to improve sensitivity and specificity.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy in Fabry disease: a practical approach to diagnosis [^f9766189]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Practical approach to the evaluation of left ventricular hypertrophy

Although several electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for the identification of LVH are available, additional investigations [notably transthoracic echocardiography (echo)] are invariably required due to the lack of sensitivity and specificity of ECG. The European Association of Echocardiography definition of LVH includes the demonstration of interventricular septal and/or posterior wall thickness in end-diastole ≥ 13 mm. Echocardiography can additionally interrogate valve function and characterize LVH as concentric (uniform mechanism, e.g. LV pressure overload, myocardial infiltration), or eccentric [e.g. asymmetrical septal hypertrophy in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)].

After the identification of LVH, a practical approach to its further assessment includes a clinical review with targeted investigations aimed firstly to exclude common causes; e.g. hypertension, obesity and valve disease. Thereafter, evaluation involves a systematic approach to exclude less common causes, e.g. hypertrophic and other cardiomyopathies, myocardial infiltration, metabolic disorders, and syndromic conditions associated with LVH.

Table 1 provides a systematic scheme incorporating clinical pearls and diagnostic pointers to help target adjunctive investigations and help identify the aetiology of LVH. Disorders causing or associated with LVH are arranged in a pathological hierarchical manner with common conditions appearing first, followed by rarities.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of conditions causing left ventricular hypertrophy and diagnostic pointers

Many heart muscle disorders presenting with LVH are due to inherited mutations in genes encoding contractile proteins of the cardiac sarcomere, metabolic pathways, or mitochondrial proteins. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the commonest inherited cardiac condition and an important cause of (potentially preventable) sudden arrhythmic death. As such, it is placed high in the systematic scheme of LVH (Table 1) and should be considered early in the diagnostic work-up of unexplained LVH.

DISCUSSION

Results of this large‐scale, population‐based study highlight the potential influences of echocardiographic criteria on the prevalence and prognostic implications of LVH. Specifically, based on the EMINCA study criteria, 8.3% of Chinese adults aged ≥ 35 years (≈56.8 million) had LVH. When applying the ASE/EACVI criteria, an additional 14 million Chinese adults were diagnosed as having LVH. Importantly, presence of LVH, based on both criteria, was independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death. Future research should evaluate the cost–benefit balance of broader (ASE/EACVI) versus stricter (EMINCA study) criteria in terms of patient outcomes and health care system efficiency.

Prevalence of

LVH is an important precursor of CVD, and understanding the prevalence of LVH in the general population is crucial for estimating future CVD burden and developing intervention strategies. Prior studies have described the prevalence of LVH in a Chinese population as ranging between 5% and 25%., However, participants of these studies were not randomly sampled, and the criteria for LVH diagnosis were based on the ASE/EACVI criteria, which might be less accurate in estimating the prevalence of LVH in a general Chinese population. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 showed that 36.5% of the increase in the global number of prevalent hypertensive heart disease cases during 1990 to 2017 was from China. However, hypertensive heart disease was defined based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD‐9; ICD‐10) code, and the specific prevalence of LVH was unknown. In this study, we used a stratified, multistage, random sampling method to obtain a nationally representative sample, and LVH was diagnosed based on the EMINCA study criteria, which might provide a more accurate estimate of LVH prevalence in China. In line with a prior report, results of this study demonstrate that a hypertensive heart disease such as LVH has become a serious public health problem in China.

### Diagnosis and management of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: role of multimodality cardiac imaging. A scientific statement of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^d88801d9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy consists in an increased LV wall thickness. LV hypertrophy can be either secondary, in response to pressure or volume overload, or primary, i.e. not explained solely by abnormal loading conditions. Primary LV hypertrophy may be due to gene mutations or to the deposition or storage of abnormal substances in the extracellular spaces or within the cardiomyocytes (more appropriately defined as pseudohypertrophy). LV hypertrophy is often a precursor to subsequent development of heart failure. Cardiovascular imaging plays a key role in the assessment of LV hypertrophy. Echocardiography, the first-line imaging technique, allows a comprehensive assessment of LV systolic and diastolic function. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance provides added value as it measures accurately LV and right ventricular volumes and mass and characterizes myocardial tissue properties, which may provide important clues to the final diagnosis. Additionally, scintigraphy with bone tracers is included in the diagnostic algorithm of cardiac amyloidosis. Once the diagnosis is established, imaging findings may help predict future disease evolution and inform therapy and follow-up. This consensus document by the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology provides an overview of the role of different cardiac imaging techniques for the differential diagnosis and management of patients with LV hypertrophy.

RESULTS

The first literature search identified 1,276 papers. After the initial screening of titles and abstracts, 1,026 studies were excluded as they were not related to the topic. Therefore, 250 studies were reviewed; of these, 140 did not compare the performance of the PLP criterion to standard ECG criteria (i.e. SL or CV) in diagnosing LVH or stratifying cardiovascular prognosis or mortality. Reviews, commentaries, and letters were excluded. As for the studies that tested the diagnostic sensitivity of the various ECG indices of LVH having as reference LVM mass determined by ECHO, we excluded those with fewer than 200 patients. This exclusion criterion was not used for studies in which LVM was determined with MRI due to the paucity of publications on this issue. A total of 21 studies containing sufficient clinical and cardiac imaging data were included in the final review (Figure 1). The Newcastle-Ottawa Score, used for assessing the quality of the studies, ranged from 7 to 9, the mean score being 7.7. Therefore, no study was excluded based on its limited quality.

On the whole, 41,030 individuals were included in 21 studies (sample size ranging from 200 to 10,614 participants), performed in 5 continental areas (Asia = 9, Europe = 6, North America = 3, Africa = 2, South America = 1).

Diagnostic value of PLP in detecting LVH defined by ECHO

Table 1 shows demographic and clinical characteristics of 14 comparative studies targeting the value of PLP criterion vs. established ECG criteria (i.e. SL and CV) in detecting LVH by ECHO. The mean age range was 48–77 years; 46.9% of participants were men. Mean body mass index varied from 22.8 ± 3.0 to 31.1 ± 3.9 kg/m 2 (data provided by 9 studies). Mean systolic blood pressure (BP) ranged from 126 ± 19 to 154 ± 30 mm Hg, and diastolic BP from 76 ± 11 to 95 ± 16 mm Hg. The majority of studies included patients referred to ECHO labs for suspected heart disease and free-living members of the general population; 3 studies were carried out in hospitalized patients, in elderly and in patients with aortic stenosis, respectively, and 2 studies in hypertensive cohorts.

1 INTRODUCTION

Left ventricular mass is measured by accurate techniques, such as echocardiography, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance, and three‐dimensional echocardiography. Electrocardiography (ECG) is the first‐choice technique for detecting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with hypertension due to its wide‐scale availability, low cost, repeatability, and established value prognostic. 1, 2, 3 Current guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension strongly recommend ECG as the only examination to be performed in all hypertensive subjects for detection of LVH. 4 However, it is well known that majority of LVH are left undetected. The presence of electrocardiographic LVH predicts a several‐fold increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with essential hypertension. 5, 6, 7 The most effective strategy for cardiovascular event prevention implies extensive knowledge of the probable outcome for each patient during the treatment.

The aim of the paper is to investigate clinical and prognostic significance of electrocardiographic criteria of hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy during 15‐year follow‐up period.

Background

The American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and European Association of Echocardiography (EAE) recommend the use of quantitative estimation of left ventricular (LV) mass and defined partition values for mild, moderate, and severe hypertrophy. However, the prognostic implications associated with this categorization are unknown.

Methods

In this observational cohort study of unselected adults undergoing echocardiography for any indication, LV hypertrophy was assessed using the ASE/EAE-recommended formula and measurement convention from LV linear dimensions indexed to body surface area. Mortality and incident hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease were the outcomes of this study.

Results

Of 2,545 subjects (mean age, 61.9 ± 15.8 years; 56.3% women), 52.9% had normal LV mass, and 15.4% had mild, 12.1% moderate, and 19.6% severe LV hypertrophy. During a mean follow-up period of 2.5 ± 1.2 years, 121 deaths and 292 incident hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease occurred. In multivariate models including age, gender, LV ejection fraction, wall motion score index, significant valvular disease, and atrial fibrillation, the adjusted hazard ratios for death were 1.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–3.20; P = 0.041) for mild, 2.31 (95% CI, 1.33–4.01; P = 0.003) for moderate, and 2.30 (95% CI, 1.39–3.79, P = 0.001) for severe LV hypertrophy. The adjusted hazard ratios for incident cardiovascular hospitalizations were 1.24 (95% CI, 0.84–1.82; P = 0.277) for mild, 2.02 (95% CI, 1.42–2.88; P = 0.0001) for moderate, and 2.38 (95% CI, 1.75–3.22, P < .0001) for severe LV hypertrophy. After adjustment for known risk predictors, there was a 1.3-fold risk for death and cardiovascular disease events per category of LV mass (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

In a cohort study of unselected adult outpatients, the categorization of LV mass according to the ASE/EAE recommendations offered prognostic information independently of age, gender, and other known predictors.

### Do we need new electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy? The case of the peguero-Lo presti criterion. A narrative review [^3dc9e530]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the evidence in favor of the greater diagnostic accuracy of the PLP criterion in the identification of subclinical cardiac organ damage such as LVH, phenotyped by ECHO or MRI, and in risk stratification of hard outcomes such as all-cause mortality, fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events compared with traditional ECG criteria does not appear to be sufficiently proven.

In perspective, further large studies are needed in order to better delineate the diagnostic role of this criterion in detecting the presence of LVH, taking into account important variables that have not yet been well focused on, such as sex, age, ethnicity, body size, and comorbidities. In this regard, however, it is worthy of note that the diagnosis of LVH exclusively based on the amplitude of the QRS voltage represents a largely imprecise pathophysiological approach. It has been shown that, in addition to increases in QRS amplitude, many other ECG changes are associated with LVH including QRS duration, changes in QRS vectors, abnormalities in the ST segment, in T and P waves. On that physiopathological basis, the advent of high-frequency acquisition of digital ECG signals and processes relying on artificial intelligence for analyzing multiple ECG parameters with the implementation of clinical variables will make possible the development and implementation in clinical practice of new, more accurate ECG-LVH criteria allowing to overcome the limits of traditional diagnostic criteria based on the simple evaluation of the QRS amplitude.

### Prevalence of left-ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension: an updated review of echocardiographic studies [^92cc4377]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a cardinal manifestation of hypertensive organ damage associated with an increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. We reviewed recent literature on the prevalence of LVH, as assessed by echocardiography, in order to offer an updated information on the magnitude of subclinical alterations in LV structure in contemporary human hypertension. A MEDLINE search using key words 'left ventricular hypertrophy', 'hypertension', 'echocardiography' and 'cardiac organ damage' was performed in order to identify relevant papers. Full articles published in English language in the last decade, (1 January 2000–1 December 2010), reporting studies in adult or elderly individuals, were considered. A total of 30 studies, including 37,700 untreated and treated patients (80.3% Caucasian, 52.4% men, 9.6% diabetics, 2.6% with CV disease) were considered. LVH was defined by 23 criteria; its prevalence ranged from 36% (conservative criteria) to 41% (less conservative criteria) in the pooled population. LVH prevalence was not different between women and men (range 37.9–46.2 versus 36.0–43.5%, respectively). Eccentric LVH was more frequent than concentric hypertrophy (range 20.3–23.0 versus 14.8–15.8, respectively, P < 0.05); concentric phenotype was found in a consistent fraction (20%) of both genders. Despite the improved management of hypertension in the last two decades, LVH remains a highly frequent biomarker of cardiac damage in the hypertensive population. Our analysis calls for a more aggressive treatment of hypertension and related CV risk factors leading to LVH.

### Do we need new electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy? The case of the peguero-Lo presti criterion. A narrative review [^77bbc006]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular risk associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the community and, particularly, in the hypertensive fraction of the general population, represents the rationale for its timely and accurate identification in order to implement adequate preventive strategies. Although electrocardiography (ECG) is the first-line and most economical method of diagnosing LVH its accuracy is largely suboptimal. Over the last 70 years, dozens of different ECG criteria, mostly based on measurements of QRS voltages, have been proposed. In this long journey, a few years ago Peguero et al. developed a novel ECG voltage criterion, currently recognized as Peguero-Lo Presti (PLP) suggesting that it has greater sensitivity than traditional ECG-LVH criteria. Considering that in the last 5 years numerous studies have investigated the diagnostic value of this new index, this review aimed to summarize the data published so far on this topic focusing both on the accuracy in identifying the presence of LVH compared with imaging techniques such as echocardiography (ECHO) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the value in predicting hard outcomes. The evidence in favor of the greater diagnostic accuracy of the PLP criterion in detecting LVH, phenotyped by ECHO or MRI, and in the stratification of hard outcomes compared with traditional ECG criteria does not appear to be sufficiently proven. Given that the diagnosis of LVH by all ECG criteria (including the PLP) exclusively based on the QRS amplitude is largely imprecise, the development of new multiparametric ECG criteria based on artificial intelligence could represent a real improvement in the diagnostic capacity of the ECG.

Study Design and Participants

Study design of the China Hypertension Survey has been described previously. Briefly, it is an observational study, which has used a stratified multistage random sampling method to obtain a nationally representative sample of a general Chinese population across the 31 provinces in mainland China. Per study design, during the survey, participants aged ≥ 35 years from 14 provinces (including 16 cities and 17 counties) were randomly sampled for the echocardiography substudy between 2012 and 2015, 34 994 (response rate, 62.5%) natives or inhabitants who lived in the investigation points for > 6 months joined the substudy, and 31 496 participants finished the baseline echocardiographic examination. After excluding those who did not have data on left ventricular mass index (LVMI; n = 1736); had established CVD (including coronary heart disease/myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke, and valvular heart disease; n = 2647); or were lost to follow‐up after baseline echocardiographic assessment (n = 6903); a total of 20 210 participants free of CVD were included (Figure S1). All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of Fuwai Hospital (Beijing, China).

### Electrocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy: the effect of left ventricular wall thickness, size, and mass on the specific criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy [^8ea89975]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of our study was to determine the relative importance and effect of an increased left ventricle wall thickness, left ventricular diastolic diameter, and left ventricular mass (LVM) on the performance of the 4 major electrocardiogram (ECG) criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and to determine how these findings could be incorporated into the routine ECG interpretation of LVH.

Methods

The ECG criteria of LVH that we chose to examine were voltage, repolarization abnormalities, left atrial abnormality, and ventricular conduction time. We analyzed data from 608 consecutive patients with left ventricular wall thickness of > 13 mm on the echocardiogram and with a concurrent ECG. We arbitrarily divided patients into 3 groups (groups I-III) according to the calculated LVM. Group I had an LVM of < 400 g; group II had an LVM from 400 to 600 g, and group III had an LVM of > 600 g. We evaluated the effect of increasing LVM, wall thickness, and ventricular diameter on the performance of the 4 ECG criteria at different severity of thickness, diameter, and mass.

Results

An increase in the echocardiogram-derived LVM had significant effect on all 4 ECG criteria. As LVM progressively increased from groups I to III, the frequency of voltage criteria for LVH increased from 52% to 83%; left atrial abnormality rose from 46% to 68%; ST-T wave changes increases from 55% to 95%, and QRS prolongation significantly increased from 42% to 70%.

Conclusion

Increased wall thickness and ventricular diameter failed to correlate with the overall ECG score or significantly influence the frequency of any of the 4 ECG criteria for LVH in patients when LVM was held relatively constant. We also demonstrated that an increasing number of criteria on the ECG are associated with a greater mean LVM.

Prognostic Implication of

The presence of LVH plays a crucial role in hypertension management. Therefore, hypertension guidelines have emphasized the importance of screening LVH in clinical practice. Consistent with prior reports, we found that LVH was independently associated with cardiovascular death. These findings confirm prognostic implications of LVH based on the EMINCA study criteria.LVH based on the ASE/EACVI criteria was also independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death. The adjusted hazard ratios for cardiovascular death were relatively higher with the EMINCA study criteria compared with the ASE/EACVI criteria (1.55 versus 1.31). This might be because the ASE/EACVI criteria use a lower LVMI cutoff for diagnosing LVH in women (95 g/m 2 versus 105 g/m 2 in the EMINCA study), resulting in the inclusion of more female participants with less severe LVH. In contrast, the EMINCA study criteria might include more female participants with more severe LVH and thus a less favorable prognosis, potentially leading to a higher risk of cardiovascular death associated with LVH. However, given the positive relationship between LVMI with cardiovascular death, LVH whether diagnosed based on the EMINCA study or ASE/EACVI criteria remains a valuable marker in identifying individuals who are at an increased mortality risk.

The mortality risk associated with LVH by age, sex, and urbanity has not been well studied. Investigating these aspects may provide additional insights into the disproportional burden of LVH on specific sociodemographic groups. One of the major findings were that although people aged < 65 years had a lower prevalence of LVH, they experienced a higher risk for cardiovascular death and all‐cause death, suggesting that LVH might be more relevant for mortality prediction in the younger population. On the other hand, LVH proportionally influenced mortality in both sexes and in people from rural and urban areas, emphasizing the importance of improving LVH management regardless of sex and urbanity.

RESULTS

Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of patients

The 702 study participants included 449 men (64%), and had a mean (± SD) age of 51.9 ± 15.2 years. The proportion of patients with echocardiographic LVH was 30.3% (n = 213), including 92 patients concentric and 121 patients eccentric. Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of these patients with LVH and those with normal geometry (n = 489). The 3 groups significantly differed in most of the characteristics (P < 0.05), except for body mass index, body surface area, serum triglycerides, and fasting plasma glucose (P > 0.05). They also significantly differed in the use of all major classes of antihypertensive drugs (P < 0.001), except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (P = 0.58).

Table 1.
Clinical characteristics of patients by echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy status

Table 2 shows the echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular structure and function in the 3 groups of patients. Patients with concentric LVH had the greatest IVSTd, posterior wall thickness, RWT, LVM, and LVMI. Patients with eccentric LVH had the greatest left ventricular diastolic and systolic diameters and lowest left ventricular ejection fraction.

Left ventricular structure and function by echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy status

Sensitivity and specificity of various ECG criteria

The cutoff values for these 7 ECG criteria and sensitivity and specificity of various ECG criteria for echocardiographic LVH are shown in Table 3. In general, all ECG criteria had low sensitivity (15%–31.9%) and high specificity (91.6%–99.2%), especially for eccentric LVH. Regardless of the LVH pattern, the Cornell product criterion had the highest sensitivity for the diagnosis of LVH (43.5% and 23.1% for concentric and eccentric LVH, respectively). ECG diagnosis of LVH according to any of the 4 ECG criteria including the Sokolow–Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, and RavL voltage had similar sensitivity (54% vs. 56.8% for overall, 71.7% vs. 72.8% for concentric LVH, and 40.5% vs. 44.6% for eccentric LVH) and specificity (86.3% vs. 83.4%) as any of all 7 ECG criteria.

Prevalence and Prognostic Implications ofGeometry

As expected, the LVMI cutoff for LVH diagnosis in women was lower with the ASE/EACVI criteria than with the EMINCA study criteria, leading to a significantly lower weighted prevalence of normalcy. Additionally, the RWT cutoff for diagnosing concentric remodeling was lower with the ASE/EACVI criteria, resulting in a higher weighted prevalence of concentric remodeling compared with the EMINCA study criteria. When applying the EMINCA study criteria, the weighted prevalence of eccentric LVH was much higher than concentric LVH (7.4% versus 0.8%). Of note, when applying the ASE/EACVI criteria, the observed substantial difference in the prevalence of eccentric LVH and concentric LVH diminished (6.4% versus 5.3%), which could be due to a lower cutoff of RWT to define concentric remodeling.

Based on the EMINCA study criteria, in reference to normalcy, only eccentric LVH was independently associated with cardiovascular death. Lack of significant association between concentric LVH and outcomes could be due to the fact that the prevalence of concentric LVH was small, which limited the statistical power. In light of a relatively higher prevalence of eccentric LVH in the general Chinese population, specific intervention may be needed to prevent and reverse this adverse remodeling. For example, reduction of volume overload, a key mechanism linked to eccentric remodeling, with a low‐salt diet or use of a diuretic such as indapamide for hypertension management, may be particularly beneficial to patients with hypertension with eccentric LVH. In contrast, medications such as antagonists of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system could be more helpful to a Western population with more prevalent concentric LVH, which is related to increased pressure overload.

### The assessment of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension [^60b1acb6]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertension, as detected by the electrocardiogram or echocardiography, is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity several times above and beyond the risk of hypertension alone. The LIFE (Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension) study confirmed that pharmacological agents, which reduce LVH, confer further reduction in morbidity and mortality. This makes the identification of patients with LVH all the more important. In this article we describe the various methods available to diagnose the presence of LVH in patients with hypertension, and consider their strengths and their place in clinical practice and in research.

Echocardiographic Examination and Parameters

All ultrasonographers were trained to be familiar with the study protocol, and complex cases were discussed and confirmed with the experts from the coordination center. All measurements were performed according to the ASE/EACVI criteria. Relative wall thickness (RWT) was calculated as 2 × left ventricular posterior wall diameter/left ventricular end diastolic diameter, with an RWT > 0.51 defined as concentric remodeling for both sexes according to the criteria of the EMINCA study and an RWT > 0.42 for both sexes according to the ASE/EACVI criteria. An enlarged left atrium (LA) was defined as LA anteroposterior diameter > 4.0 cm for men and > 3.8 cm for women, or LA diameter/height > 2.61 cm/m for both sexes. An enlarged left ventricle (LV) was defined as left ventricular end diastolic diameter/body surface area > 30 mm/m 2 for men and > 31 mm/m 2 for women. Left ventricular mass was calculated as 0.8×(1.04×[interventricular septum diameter+left ventricular posterior wall diameter+left ventricular end diastolic diameter 3 −left ventricular end diastolic diameter 3])+0.6, and left ventricular mass was indexed to body surface area, with an LVMI > 109 g/m 2 for men and > 105 g/m 2 for women defined as LVH according to the criteria of the EMINCA study and an LVMI > 115 g/m 2 for men and > 95 g/m 2 for women according to the ASE/EACVI criteria. Because the China Hypertension Survey was launched before 2016, and the 2009 guidelines were used to define left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, moderate or grade II (pseudonormal LV filling), severe or grade III (restrictive filling), and left ventricular ejection fraction were estimated using the biplane method of disks (Simpson's rule). LV geometry (normalcy, concentric remodeling, eccentric LVH, and concentric LVH) was evaluated according to the presence of concentric remodeling and LVH.

Study Outcomes

Study outcomes included all‐cause death and cardiovascular death, which was defined as death primarily due to CVD. The outcome data were retrospectively collected by study staff in the 14 provinces through directly contacting the participants' immediate relatives and health care providers. These events were confirmed using the national mortality surveillance system for death registration and mortality surveillance of China, and the accuracy of these data has been previously confirmed.

### Performance of electrocardiographic criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy in Chinese hypertensive patients [^73e2d745]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is common in patients with hypertension, and is associated with the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Both electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography can be used for the diagnosis of LVH. Echocardiography has high sensitivity but limited availability and high technical requirement. In contrast, ECG is low cost and reproducible but has low sensitivity.ECG is a routine test for LVH detection in patients with hypertension in all major hypertension guidelines. It is recommended to every single hypertensive patient and especially suitable for LVH screening.

Several ECG criteria, such as the Sokolow–Lyon index, Cornell voltage or Cornell voltage duration product, and RavL, are available to assess LVH. Most of previous studies have been conducted in Caucasians, and the diagnostic performance of ECG criteria for Asians especially Chinese remains under investigation. A few previous studies of small sample size evaluated correlation between ECG criteria and LVH diagnosed with the old echocardiographic left ventricular mass index (LVMI) cutoff values (> 125 g/m 2 for men and > 120 g/m 2 for women) and showed inconsistent sensitivity and specificity in the Chinese population. Recent hypertension guidelines reduced the LVMI cutoff values of echocardiographic LVH diagnostic criteria to > 115 g/m 2 for men and > 95 g/m 2 for women. In the present study, we aimed to assess the accuracy of these ECG criteria for the diagnosis of the newly defined echocardiographic LVH including both concentric and eccentric patterns in Chinese adult hypertensive patients.

### Influence of different echocardiographic criteria for detection of left ventricular hypertrophy on cardiovascular risk stratification in recently diagnosed essential hypertensives [^49c66177]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) need a prompter and more intensive pharmacological treatment than subjects without evidence of cardiac involvement. So the detection of LVH plays an important role for decision-making in hypertensives.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of different echocardiographic criteria to define LVH in a more precise stratification of absolute cardiovascular risk in hypertensives without target organ damage (TOD) as assessed by routine investigations.

Methods

A total of 100 never treated patients with grade 1 and 2 essential hypertension (53 men, 47 women, age 44 ± 12 years) referred for the first time to our outpatient clinic were included in the study. They underwent the following procedures: (1) family and personal medical history, (2) clinic blood pressure (BP) measurement, (3) routine blood chemistry and urine analysis, (4) electrocardiogram, (5) echocardiogram. Risk was stratified according to the criteria suggested by the 1999 WHO-ISH guidelines. TOD was initially evaluated by routine procedures only, and subsequently reassessed by using six different echocardiographic criteria to recognise LVH: (a) left ventricular mass index (LVMI) > 120 g/m(2) in men and 100 g/m(2) in women; (b) 125 g/m(2) in men and 110 g/m(2) in women; (c) 134 g/m(2) in men and 110 g/m(2) in women; (d) 125 g/m(2) in men and 125 g/m(2) in women; (e) 51 g/m(2.7) in men and 47 g/m(2.7) in women; (f) 126 g/m in men and 105 g/m in women.

Results

According to the first classification based on routine investigations, 46% were low risk and 54% were medium risk patients. Significant changes in risk stratification were obtained when LVH was assessed by echocardiography. A percentage of patients, ranging from 9 (f) to 25% (d), were found to having LVH according to different criteria, and consequently moved from low and medium risk strata to high risk stratum.

Conclusions

The detection of LVH by echocardiography allowed a much more accurate identification of high risk patients. In particular our results suggest that: (1) cardiovascular risk stratification only based on a simple routine work-up can often underestimate overall risk; (2) a better standardisation in defining LVH is needed, considering that the impact of cardiac hypertrophy on risk stratification is markedly dependent on the echocardiographic criteria used to diagnose it.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

LV structure and left atrial (LA) volume and function — structural remodeling supports diastolic dysfunction as LA enlargement, in the absence of chronic atrial arrhythmia and mitral valve disease, is a marker of chronic elevation of LAP and should be interpreted only after exclusion of other causes such as anemia, biatrial heart transplant technique, hyperdynamic state, or athletic status; pathologic LV hypertrophy is usually associated with increased LV chamber stiffness; and increased LV mass index and LA enlargement are among the criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Conclusion

LVH begins before the arbitrary LVWT threshold of 15 mm and there is a wide range of diagnoses from the threshold of 12 mm. The evolution of prevention strategies and treatments according to the different aetiologies should encourage to review explorations thresholds to allow early detection and treatment.

### ACCF and AHA update guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment… [^81a9a90d]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

HCM is a common genetic cardiovascular disease that affects approximately one out of every 500 persons. Generally, the condition is characterized by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy associated with nondilated ventricular chambers, without the presence of another cardiac or systemic disease that, by itself, would be capable of producing the extent of hypertrophy seen in a given patient. Although there are a variety of patterns and distributions of LV hypertrophy associated with HCM, about one-third of patients have largely segmental wall thickening that involves only a small portion of the left ventricle; such patients with HCM usually have a normal calculated LV mass.

Differential diagnosis of HCM and other cardiac conditions with LV hypertrophy may arise, most often with hypertensive heart disease, or with the physiologic remodeling that can result from intense athletic training, usually when maximum wall thickness is between 13 and 15 mm. Noninvasive markers, such as sarcomeric mutations, family history of HCM, LV cavity dimension, diastolic function, a pattern of LV hypertrophy, or short deconditioning periods, often help resolve these distinctions. Electrocardiography and Echocardiography Recommendations Twelve-lead electrocardiography is recommended in the initial evaluation of patients with HCM, and as a screening component for first-degree relatives of those with HCM. To detect ventricular tachycardia and identify patients who may be candidates for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy, the initial evaluation of patients with HCM should include 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring.

Screening with 12-lead electrocardiography is also recommended for adolescent first-degree relatives of patients with HCM who have no evidence of hypertrophy on echocardiography. Twenty-four–hour monitoring or event recording is recommended in patients with HCM who develop palpitations or lightheadedness. Repeat electrocardiography is recommended for patients with HCM when there is worsening of symptoms. Transthoracic echocardiography is recommended in the initial evaluation of all patients with suspected HCM, and as a screening component for family members of patients with HCM. Patients with HCM who have a change in clinical status or a new cardiovascular event should undergo repeat transthoracic echocardiography.

EACVI and ASE recommendations on echocardiography in adult hypertension — scope and topics: As the left ventricle is a main target organ in hypertension and echocardiographic measures of structure and function carry prognostic information, this report establishes a consensus position and emphasizes that recent developments in assessing left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular systolic and diastolic function prompted its preparation. The stated focus is on cardiovascular responses to hypertension rather than diagnosing secondary hypertension, and sections address pathophysiology of cardiac and vascular responses, measurement of left ventricular mass, geometry, and function, and effects of treatment, with the table of contents highlighting topics such as left ventricular hypertrophy, measurement of LVM, two-dimensional and three-dimensional echocardiography, identification of left ventricular geometric patterns, the natural history of left ventricular geometry in hypertension, tissue characterization, and arterial function and ventriculo-arterial matching.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^24db2b29]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) assessment — echocardiography-based geometry categories and indexing — Echocardiography is used to assess the presence of left ventricular target organ injury related to hypertension in children, with the basis for assessment including the relationship of left ventricular mass (LVM) to blood pressure (BP), the independent and strong relationship of LVH to adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes in adults, and that a significant percentage of hypertensive children and adolescents demonstrate a degree of LVH associated with adverse adult outcomes; the CPG stratifies left ventricle (LV) structure into 4 groups based on LVM and relative wall thickness (RWT): normal geometry with normal LVM and normal RWT, concentric geometry with normal LVM and increased RWT, eccentric LVH with increased LVM and normal RWT, and concentric LVH with both increased LVM and increased RWT; because heart size relates to body size, indexing LVM is required, and for 2017 the CPG definitions for LV target organ injury regarding hypertrophy, RWT, and ejection fraction (EF) were chosen based on American Society of Echocardiography guidelines and associations of thresholds for indexed LVM with adverse outcomes in adults.

### Usefulness of the assessment of the appropriateness of left ventricular mass to detect left ventricular systolic and diastolic abnormalities in absence of echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy: the LIFE study [^c53108c9]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Conventional definitions of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy do not account for interindividual differences in loading conditions. We may define LV mass as inappropriately high when exceeding 128% of theoretical values predicted by gender, height(2.7), and stroke work, which explain up to 82% of the variability of LV mass in normal reference subjects. In 652 participants in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study without clinically overt cardiovascular disease or diabetes, we investigated whether inappropriately high LV mass is associated with relevant LV abnormalities independent of traditional definition of LV hypertrophy (ie, LV mass index > 116 g/m(2) in men and > 104 g/m(2) in women). The study sample was divided into three groups: patients with inappropriately high LV mass but without LV hypertrophy were compared to patients with LV hypertrophy and to patients with appropriate LV mass and without LV hypertrophy. Patients with inappropriately high but nonhypertrophic LV mass had higher body mass index and relative wall thickness, and lower LV myocardial systolic function, than patients with appropriate LV mass or patients with LV hypertrophy. In multivariate analyses, inappropriately high LV mass was independently associated with lower myocardial systolic function independent of LV hypertrophy and other covariates. Inappropriately high LV mass was also associated with prolonged isovolumic relaxation time and lower mitral E/A ratio independent of covariates. In conclusion, inappropriately high LV mass was associated with relevant, often preclinical, manifestations of cardiac disease in the absence of traditionally defined echocardiographic LV hypertrophy and concentric geometry.

### Is electrocardiography-left ventricular hypertrophy an obsolete marker for determining heart failure risk with hypertension? [^71dbe364]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The results from Johnson et al 2 offer new insights indicating how much we still do not understand about the complex underlying pathophysiology leading to HF and the importance of addressing not only BP control, but also other potential contributors to HF. At this time, routine imaging evaluation of LVH is not recommended because of limited data on the cost‐effectiveness for risk classification and management 1; in fact, routine evaluation of hypertension with echocardiogram received a score of 3 on the Appropriate Use Criteria from 2011, considering it inappropriate. 20 Contrarily, imaging can be helpful in young individuals, those with secondary hypertension, uncontrolled hypertension, or HF symptoms. 1

For curtailing the persistent morbidity and mortality because of uncontrolled hypertension, the most prevalent and potent CVD risk factor, some questions related to LVH determination remain unanswered. Future research should help clarify whether beyond ECG‐LVH measurements, screening for LVH with echocardiogram, or even CMR, in patients with hypertension is useful, how we can adjust for factors that affect accuracy, and what is the best way and time to follow up and approach these patients therapeutically.

Association BetweenandGeometry With Outcomes

After a median follow‐up of 4.9 (interquartile range, 4.2–5.2) years, people with LVH had a higher cumulative rate of cardiovascular death (4.7% versus 1.6%, log‐rank P < 0.0001) and all‐cause death (9.3% versus 4.1%, log‐rank P < 0.0001) compared with those without LVH (Figure 1). After adjusting for covariates (Table 3), LVH was associated with 55% higher risk for cardiovascular death (P < 0.001) and 14% higher risk for all‐cause death (P = 0.16). When applying the ASE/EACVI criteria, individuals with LVH had a higher cumulative rate of cardiovascular death and all‐cause death (both log‐rank P < 0.0001; Figure S2). After adjusting for covariates (Table S4), LVH was associated with 31% higher risk for cardiovascular death (P = 0.047) and 12% higher risk for all‐cause death (P = 0.22). Increase in LVMI was associated with higher risks of cardiovascular death (P < 0.001).

Figure 1

B, At follow‐up, the cumulative rate of all‐cause death was higher in people with LVH than in those without LVH (log‐rank P < 0.0001). CV indicates cardiovascular; and LVH, left ventricular hypertrophy.

### Do we need new electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy? The case of the peguero-Lo presti criterion. A narrative review [^86916e5f]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

However, despite emerging evidence in favor of this new criterion, the 2023 European Society Hypertension (ESH) guidelines recommended 4 different traditional criteria, exclusively (i.e. SL and R wave in AVL) or partially based on R wave amplitude (i.e. CV and CV × QRS duration).

Thus, in an attempt to offer an updated contribution to knowledge on the value of the PLP in the diagnosis of LVH compared with traditional ECG criteria, we examined this interesting issue targeting: (i) sensitivity/specificity/diagnostic accuracy of this criterion in studies having as reference LVM assessed by ECHO and MRI; (ii) prognostic capacity in predicting cardiovascular events and mortality.

As regards ECHO studies, in this review we have considered only those with populations of at least 200 cases with the aim of focusing on studies based on sufficiently representative samples and, potentially with a reliable power of discrimination of the performance of the various diagnostic criteria. On the contrary, we did not use the sample size filter for studies that had MRI as the gold standard for LVH, due to the very limited availability of the literature data.

The diagnostic sensitivity of the PLP criterion was higher than the SL in 12 out of 13 studies and in 11 of 13 compared with the CV. On the contrary, its specificity was lower than the SL in 8 out of 13 studies and in 11 out of 13 studies compared with the CV. Regarding diagnostic accuracy, the receiver-operating characteristic curves, of the 3 ECG-LVH scores for the prediction of ECHO LVH, generated by plotting sensitivity over specificity, showed that the CV had the highest AUC in 9 of 10 studies that provided this kind of information. The PLP criterion performed better than the SL in all the studies considered with the exception of that of Chen et al. which highlighted that the SL criterion had a higher AUC in men. The studies included in the present review do not allow to draw indications whether the sensitivity/specificity parameters can be influenced by the prevalence of LVH in a given population, considering that no differences emerged between studies with low (i.e. < 20%) compared with those with high LVH prevalence (i.e. > 40%).

### Left-ventricular hypertrophy and obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of echocardiographic studies [^c3975f4f]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

Left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a frequent complication in obese individuals; an updated review and meta-analysis focusing on this issue is lacking. Thus, we analysed the literature in order to provide a comprehensive information on the left-ventricular structural changes, as assessed by echocardiography, associated to obesity.

Design

A literature search using the keywords 'left ventricle', 'left-ventricular hypertrophy', 'cardiac hypertrophy', 'obesity', 'hypertension' and 'echocardiography' was performed in order to identify relevant papers. Full articles published in English language in the past 12 years reporting studies in adult obese individuals were considered.

Results

A total of 22 studies including 5486 obese individuals were considered. Overall, in the pooled obese population, prevalence of LVH, defined by 12 criteria, was 56.0% (range 20.0–85.0%). Data provided by 15 studies (n = 4999 obese individuals), including 6623 non-obese controls, showed that the probability of having LVH was much higher in cases than in non-obese counterparts (odds ratio 4.19, 95% confidence interval 2.67–6.53, P < 0.01). A meta-regression analysis (n = 2214; 14 studies) showed a direct correlation between BMI and left-ventricular mass (P < 0.01). Among obese patients with LVH (n = 1930; 15 studies), eccentric hypertrophy was more frequent than the concentric phenotype (66 versus 34%; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Our analysis shows that LVH is present in a consistent fraction of the obese population and that eccentric hypertrophy prevails over the concentric phenotype. As obesity-related LVH is a powerful risk factor for systolic/diastolic dysfunction, the prevention/treatment of obesity may have a strong, favourable impact on incident heart failure.

Demographic and clinical characteristics of 14 comparative studies targeting the value of Peguero–Lo Presti (PLP) criterion vs. established diagnostic electrocardiographic criteria (SL, Sokolow–Lyon voltage; CV, Cornell voltage) in detecting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) having echocardiography as reference

As reported in Table 2, the prevalence of ECHO LVH varied markedly between studies (i.e. 11.6%–58.0%), although it should be emphasized that most of them included samples with a high prevalence of this adverse cardiac phenotype (over 40% in 7 of the 13 studies providing provided this information). The diagnostic sensitivity of the PLP criterion compared with SL and/or CV criteria was greater in 11 out of the 13 studies. A gender-based analysis performed by 2 studies suggested greater PLP sensitivity in both sexes. On the contrary, the diagnostic specificity of the PLP criterion was lower than the traditional ones in almost all the studies considered. Table 3 summarizes the overall diagnostic performance of the 3 ECG criteria assessed by receiver-operating characteristic curves and expressed as area under the curve (AUC). All but one of the 10 studies providing this metric reported that the AUC associated with the PLP was lower than with the CV criterion. This was not the case for the SL criterion whose AUC was lower than that of PLP in the majority of studies.

### Electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy in children [^61ab12ad]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) results from adaptation of the heart to increased haemodynamic burden. Therefore, early detection of LVH is important, especially in children. Although the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is still valued as an initial diagnostic test for LVH, its sensitivity in this respect leaves to be desired. In a recent large study on HIV-infected children, Rivenes et al. found sensitivities of < 20% at specificity levels of 88% to 92%. On the other hand, in a number of smaller studies on patients with a specific cardiac disease, the performance of the pediatric ECG was found to be higher. For example, in a group of 19 aortic stenosis patients and 21 normals, Fogel et al. found a sensitivity of 67% at 95% specificity. None of these studies was done on an unselected pediatric hospital population with mixed cardiac abnormalities. For the present investigation we have collected such a population and have sought to improve the sensitivity of the pediatric ECG in detecting LVH by means that issue from the following considerations:

First, in pediatric electrocardiology, only a limited number of criteria have been used for assessing LVH. Several criteria that were shown to improve the detection of LVH in adults have not been tested in children. Pediatric electrocardiographers have focused on the QRS amplitude, although the time-voltage area of the QRS complex or its approximation by the product of maximum QRS voltage and QRS duration was proposed in adults as a useful criterion to improve LVH diagnosis. Likewise, in adults combinations of criteria have been shown to improve performance, which approach has not yet been attempted for children.

Second, older validity studies have used obsolete limits of normal for the pediatric ECG parameters. In a previous study, we established new age-dependent normal limits that differ considerably from the older figures. Hitherto, normal limits have not been revised for LVH detection.

Finally, the reference standard for LVH on the ECG has usually been the left ventricular mass (LVM) as estimated from echocardiographic measurements. This reference has been criticized for being vulnerable to measurement error and for its oversimplification of the geometry of the left ventricle. Alternatively, a combination of increased LVM and clinical evidence of volume or pressure overload of the left ventricle may be a better reference standard for the validity of ECG criteria.

### Influence of echocardiographic criteria on the prevalence and prognostic implication of left ventricular hypertrophy: a Nationwide population-based study [^7d111f7a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Aging is significantly associated with the development of LVH through arterial stiffness and elevated blood pressure. The number of Chinese people aged ≥ 65 years is estimated to be 366 million (26.0% of the population) in 2050. Our study showed that prevalence of LVH in people aged > 65 years was 2‐fold higher than those aged < 65 years. The China Hypertension Survey 2012 to 2015 showed that hypertension prevalence in people aged ≥ 65 years was 55.7%, whereas the control rate was 18.4%. Poor control of hypertension along with other comorbidities might together contribute to a high prevalence of LVH in older individuals.

Compared with men, women are more likely to have LVH as suggested by studies of the Chinese and Western populations., Importantly, we found that although women had a significantly higher prevalence of LVH compared with men, this difference was marginal (≈0.8% difference) based on the EMINCA study criteria. When applying the ASE/EACVI criteria, women had > 3‐fold higher prevalence of LVH than men. Such differences could be explained by larger differences in the LVMI cutoff for LVH diagnosis between men and women in these 2 criteria (men versus women ASE/EACVI criteria: 115 g/m 2 versus 95 g/m 2 and EMINCA study criteria: 109 g/m 2 versus 105 g/m 2).

In the China Hypertension Survey 2012 to 2015, the prevalence of hypertension was similar between urban and rural areas. However, the control rate of the overall participants and the control rate among patients receiving antihypertensive therapy was lower in rural areas than urban. People from rural areas commonly have lower socioeconomic status, which may limit their access to health care resources including hypertension specialists and effective medications. These factors may contribute to a higher prevalence of LVH in rural areas. In light of a higher CVD incidence in rural areas than urban areas in China, specific strategies for preventing LVH development in rural areas is urgently needed.

### Prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the UK biobank population… [^ab92bf20]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The value above each bar corresponds to the proportion of individuals with maximal wall thickness greater than the threshold value. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes considerable morbidity and mortality, including sudden death and death from heart failure and stroke. 1 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is defined by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy, which is defined as a maximum left ventricular wall thickness of 15 mm or more, out of proportion to loading conditions. 1 The cited prevalence in the general population is 0. 2%, based on studies in the community, in the military, and among athletes2 that relied on echocardiography.

Cardiac magnetic resonance produces images with optimal myocardial blood definition; mass and wall-thickness measurements are more accurate and reproducible compared with echocardiography, and milder hypertrophy in some segments can be missed by echocardiography. 1 The use of CMR in family screening increases the yield of phenotype detection. We adapted an automatic segmentation algorithm based on deep learning5 to measure LV wall thickness. We applied this method to calculate MLVWTs from short-axis measurements of 44 836 participants. Images with outlying MLVWT values and MLVWTs of 13 mm or more were manually validated by 2 European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging CMR level 3 experts.

Guidelines1 consider that MLVWT values of 15 mm or more in White individuals and 20 mm or more in Black individuals are in favor of HCM vs hypertensive heart disease. If we included these participants regardless of hypertension status, prevalence of HCM was 0. 22%. The presence of MLVWT values of 15 mm or more was mostly located in the basal anterior and anteroseptal segments. It is not entirely clear what the causative mechanism of left ventricular hypertrophy for the cases within 13 to 14 mm is. Environmental factors might be a relevant contributor. The higher volumes might be partially explained by the same reason, associated with larger body sizes; left ventricular dimensions and derived volumes are known to be smaller in echocardiography compared with CMR, because the contrast between the blood pool and endocardial border is worse.

### Electrocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy [^dd570ee8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have low sensitivity.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to test a new method to improve the diagnostic performance of the electrocardiogram.

Methods

The study was divided into 2 groups, a test and a validation cohort. In the test cohort, 94 patients were analyzed, including 47 with the diagnosis of hypertensive crisis and 47 with normal blood pressure at admission. Echocardiography was used to estimate the left ventricular mass index. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was used for comparison of single and combined leads. The McNemar test was used to assess agreement among the ECG criteria against the left ventricular mass index. The proposed ECG criteria involved measuring the amplitude of the deepest S wave (S D) in any single lead and adding it to the S wave amplitude of lead V 4 (SV 4). Currently accepted LVH ECG criteria such as Cornell voltage and Sokolow-Lyon were used for comparison. The validation cohort consisted of 122 consecutive patients referred for an echocardiogram regardless of the admitting diagnosis.

Results

The S D was the most accurate single lead measurement for the diagnosis of LVH (AUC: 0.80; p < 0.001). When both cohorts were analyzed, the S D + SV 4 criteria outperformed Cornell voltage with a significantly higher sensitivity (62% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 50% to 72%] vs. 35% [95% CI: 24% to 46%]). The specificities of all the criteria were ≥ 90%, with no significant difference among them.

Conclusions

The proposed criteria for the ECG diagnosis of LVH improved the sensitivity and overall accuracy of the test.

### Electrocardiographic criteria which have the best prognostic significance in hypertensive patients with echocardiographic hypertrophy of left ventricle: 15-year prospective study [^00267825]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The prevalence of arterial hypertension in Serbia is 42.7%. 13 Left ventricular hypertrophy has been a well‐known complication of arterial hypertension. It is actually a sign of primary hypertension organ damage and indicates late‐stage of the disease, which is a marker of bad prognosis for the occurrence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. It can be diagnosed by radiography, ECG, echocardiography and, recently, by nuclear magnetic resonance.

The incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy may vary and mostly depends on diagnostic method. The standard ECG is reliable for diagnosing LV hypertrophy, regardless of the presence of atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm at the time of ECG recording. 14 The newly proposed ECG criteria (Peguero) are calculated by adding the amplitude of the deepest S wave of D lead in any single lead to the S‐wave amplitude of lead V 4. The criteria provide an improved sensitivity for the ECG diagnosis of LVH compared to existing criteria. 15 Peguero ECG LVH is predictive of increased risk of death similar to the traditional ECG‐LVH criteria. 16

Additionally, prognostic significance of LVH may vary. Leigh et al. 17 monitored patients aged ≥ 65 during 10.6 years of follow‐up and found the frequency of ECG‐LHV at 3.5% pts and echocardiography hypertrophy at 11% pts. They concluded that the association of ECG‐LVH with CVD events did not depend on echocardiographic LVH. This finding supported the perception that electrocardiographic LVH was an electrophysiological marker with predictive properties independent of LV anatomy. Similarly, the conclusion of Bacharova et al. 18 research was that discrepancy in LVH detection by ECG and magnetic resonance imaging could be improved by taking participants' characteristics into consideration. Discrepancy in diagnostic performance and agreement on predictive ability suggested that LVH by ECG and LVH by imaging were likely to be distinct, but related phenotypes. Nuclear magnetic resonance was the most precise method of identifying LVH, but since it was not always available, ECG represented a significant and most available method in daily clinical practice. ECG had low sensitivity and high specificity. 19

### Performance of electrocardiographic criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy in Chinese hypertensive patients [^d15b3cb8]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The low sensitivity of ECG criteria in the detection of LVH is probably typical for the Chinese and other eastern Asian populations. Other reasons may also play a part. A straightforward explanation could be the change of the echocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of LVH. In our study participants, the prevalence of echocardiographic LVH increased from the old to the new criteria by 80.5%. If the old echocardiographic criteria would be used, the diagnostic sensitivity of the Cornell product criteria did increase to 41.5% with a specificity of 95.5%.

Peguero et al. recently reported a new criterion of the amplitude of the deepest S wave (S D) in any single lead plus the S wave amplitude of lead V 4, i.e. (S D + SV 4). In 94 hypertensive patients, the new ECG criterion had a higher sensitivity (62%) in the detection of LVH defined according to the new echocardiographic criteria than all the other ECG criteria (up to 35%). In our present study, this new criteria, S D + SV 4, also had a slightly higher sensitivity (44.6%) than the other criteria. However, it had much lower specificity (75.8%) and area under the curve (0.62).

Our findings on the slightly higher sensitivity of the Cornell product are in line with the results of several previous studies. The mechanisms for the difference remain unexplained. One possible explanation is that the Cornell voltage index includes a limb lead in addition to the precordial one, and hence is less dependent on the thickness of the chest wall. In addition, combining QRS voltage with duration will further increase the area under the QRS complex in comparison with either QRS voltage or duration alone. Thus, the Cornell product may reflect the presence and severity of hypertrophy more accurately than ECG scores that involve only QRS voltage or duration.

Our observation on the even poorer sensitivity for the detection of eccentric hypertrophy remains under investigation. A possible explanation could be that the enlarged chamber and thinner wall thickness of the left ventricle influence both voltage and conductance and hence ECG evaluations of the heart. Left ventricular dilatation in eccentric LVH could cause elongated distance of the intraventricular conductance pathways, which produces a stretching of the conduction system, and in turn reduces the power of conductivity. Eccentric LVH may have even worse prognosis and hence even greater need for screening. It is imperative to further delineate the ECG characteristics of this pattern of LVH.

Relative wall thickness (RWT) geometry — patients with normal left ventricular (LV) mass can have either concentric remodeling when RWT ≥ 0.42 or normal geometry when RWT ≤ 0.42; patients with increased LV mass can have either concentric (RWT ≥ 0.42) or eccentric (RWT ≤ 0.42) hypertrophy, and these LV mass measurements are based on linear measurements.

### Diagnostic accuracy of a 2D left ventricle hypertrophy score for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1edf2ff3]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To study the diagnostic value of a new 2D left ventricle hypertrophy (2D LVH) score in families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in comparison with the conventional maximal wall thickness (MWT) measurement (> 13 mm in adults), which is limited by a low sensitivity in relatives.

Methods and Results

The study was performed in 237 adults from genotyped families with HCM. Population A (derivation sample) comprised 109 adults and population B (validation sample) comprised 128 adults. MWT and 2D LVH scores (sum of thicknesses of four segments) were determined by echocardiography. Genotyping was the gold standard for diagnosis. In population A, a theoretical value for LVH score was determined in the healthy population by a multiple linear regression model including age, sex, and body surface area. An abnormal cut-off value was defined as an LVH score above a maximum theoretical value according to receiver operating characteristic analysis. Sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 73 and 96% for 2D LVH score and 62.5 and 100% for MWT. Improvement of sensitivity was particularly important in adults < 50 years of age (69 vs. 54%, respectively, P < 0.04). These results were validated in population B: sensitivity and specificity of LVH score were, respectively, 75 and 96% in this sample and 67 and 97%, in the subgroup < 50 years. In the latter, sensitivity of LVH score increased when compared with that of MWT (67 vs. 53%, P < 0.03).

Conclusions

The LVH score has a higher diagnostic value for HCM than the conventional criterion of MWT, particularly in young adults. This echographic parameter may be proposed as an alternative diagnostic criterion for familial screening.

Prognosis ofAccording to Age, Sex, and Urbanity

As shown in Figure 2, LVH was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular death and all‐cause death in people aged < 65 years versus ≥ 65 years (P ‐interaction = 0.002 and P ‐interaction = 0.03). There was no significant interaction between sex, urbanity, and LVH for cardiovascular death and all‐cause death. When LVH was defined based on the ASE/EACVI criteria, significant interaction was noted between age and LVH for cardiovascular death only (P ‐interaction = 0.01; Figure S5).

Figure 2
Association between LVH and cardiovascular and all‐cause death by age, sex, and urbanity.

LVH was associated with higher risk for CV death and all‐cause death in people aged < 65 years vs those aged ≥ 65 years (P ‐interaction = 0.002 and P ‐interaction = 0.03). There was no significant interaction between sex, urbanity, and LVH for CV death and all‐cause death (all P ‐interaction > 0.05). CV indicates cardiovascular; HR, hazard ratio; and LVH, left ventricular hypertrophy.

Baseline Characteristics in Participants Who Were Followed Up and Lost to Follow‐Up

In comparison with those who were followed up (Table S6), participants who were lost to follow‐up were older, more likely to be women, less likely from rural area, and less likely to be a current smoker, a current drinker, and have family history of CVD. They were more likely to have hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Although there was no difference in the prevalence of LVH, participants who were lost to follow‐up were more likely to have concentric remodeling and an enlarged LA but less likely to have an enlarged LV.

### Performance of electrocardiographic criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy in Chinese hypertensive patients [^fd500674]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Performance of electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in Chinese hypertensive patients is not well known. We investigated the accuracy of various ECG criteria for the diagnosis of the echocardiographic LVH according to the new cutoff values of left ventricular mass (LVM) index (> 115 g/m 2 for men and > 95 g/m 2 for women) in Chinese hypertensive patients.

METHODS

Our study included 702 consecutive hypertensive inpatients including 92 (13.1%) concentric and 121 (17.2%) eccentric LVH on standard echocardiography. Diagnostic accuracy of 7 ECG criteria was evaluated by calculating sensitivity and specificity and by using the receiver operating characteristic curves.

RESULTS

The ECG criteria for the detection of the echocardiographically defined LVH had a sensitivity of 15%–31.9% and specificity of 91.6%–99.2% overall, 20.7%–43.5% and 91.6%–99.2% concentric, and 7.4%–23.1% and 91.6%–99.2% eccentric. ECG diagnosis of LVH defined as the positive diagnosis of any of 4 ECG criteria including Sokolow–Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, and RavL voltage had a sensitivity of 54% and specificity of 86.3% overall, 71.7% and 86.3% concentric, and 40.5% and 86.3% eccentric. After adjustment for confounding factors, various ECG criteria were significantly correlated with LVM, with standardized β coefficients from 0.20 to 0.39 (P < 0.001) and the highest coefficient for the Cornell product criterion.

CONCLUSIONS

All ECG LVH indexes had low sensitivity and high specificity in Chinese hypertensive patients. Combination of 4 or all ECG criteria might improve sensitivity without any loss of specificity.

### Recommendations for multimodality cardiovascular imaging of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography, in collaboration with the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, and the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^c3b898bf]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). High credibility.

Multimodality imaging for suspected or confirmed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) thresholds and patterns: Wall thickness ≥ 15 mm in a non-athlete left ventricle (LV) defines HCM, while end diastolic wall thickness ≥ 13 mm can be diagnostic with a family history or a known mutation; massive LVH (≥ 30 mm), occurring in about 10% of individuals with HCM, has been used as a threshold for ICD implantation. In pediatrics, a single cut-off cannot be applied across sizes and hypertrophy is diagnosed at a z score > 2. Focal asymmetric hypertrophy of the basal anterior septum — defined as septal/posterior wall thickness > 1.3 in a normotensive patient — is the most common pattern. All imaging modalities should report the pattern and distribution of hypertrophy and the location and magnitude of maximal wall thickness at end-diastole.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^c19a70ae]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular mass (LV) quantification — recommendations and reference limits: In the normally shaped left ventricle, both M-mode and 2D echocardiographic formulas to calculate LV mass can be used, and normal values for these techniques remain unchanged from the previous guidelines and should be reported indexed to BSA; reference upper limits of normal LV mass by linear measurements are 95 g/m2 in women and 115 g/m2 in men, and by 2D measurements are 88 g/m2 in women and 102 g/m2 in men. Calculation of relative wall thickness (RWT) with the formula (2 × posterior wall thickness)/(LV internal diameter at end-diastole) permits categorization as concentric (RWT > 0.42) or eccentric (RWT ≤ 0.42) hypertrophy, and studies suggest that indexing to height raised to allometric powers such as 1.7, 2.13, and 2.7 has advantages over indexing to BSA; however, limited upper normal limits of 3D echocardiographic LV mass data are currently available and are insufficient to substantiate recommendations for reference values.

Left ventricular geometry — classical echocardiographic categories using left ventricular mass (LVM) and relative wall thickness (RWT) are defined as follows: Normal requires LVM ≤ 115 g/m2 (men) or ≤ 95 g/m2 (women) with RWT < 0.42; Concentric hypertrophy requires LVM > 115 g/m2 (men) or > 95 g/m2 (women) with RWT > 0.42; Eccentric hypertrophy requires LVM > 115 g/m2 (men) or > 95 g/m2 (women) with RWT ≤ 0.42; Concentric remodelling requires LVM ≤ 115 g/m2 (men) or ≤ 95 g/m2 (women) with RWT > 0.42. Measurements are performed using 2D-directed M-mode.

### Improvements in ECG accuracy for diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity [^7520832b]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

As electrocardiographic determination of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is not costly, is simple to perform and yields indices linked to mortality, it is widely used in clinical practice and appears in international guidelines. As a result, the electrocardiogram (ECG) remains, worldwide, the most commonly used screening tool.

The two most commonly used ECG criteria are the Sokolow–Lyon indexand the Cornell criteria. Despite their routine clinical use, the diagnostic accuracy of these surface ECG criteria is limited, with poor sensitivity for the detection of LVH. Indeed, the original authors of the Sokolow–Lyon index report only a 32% sensitivity, making its uptake into clinical practice and its continued use surprising. Obesity, which is now pandemic in the Western world, results in three distinct processes that affect the surface ECG — lateral displacement of the anatomical left ventricular (LV) axis, increased chest wall fat and increased pericardial fat mass, all of which decrease voltage amplitude on the ECG. This reduces the diagnostic sensitivity of the surface ECG even further and is likely to render ECG criteria generated in a society with a much lower body mass index (BMI) (∼20 kg/m 2 in 1949)to be obsolete in the modern age of obesity, where LVH is increasingly seen.

Although previous attempts have been made at improving the diagnostic accuracy of the ECG by adjusting for body habitus, they have either relied on echocardiographic determination of LV mass, which is severely limited in obesity, or have not taken into account the anatomical LV axis deviation that accompanies obesity. Furthermore, although all report diagnostic performance improvement, these studies all implemented complex statistical modelling to derive adjustment formula that could be applied to the ECG to adjust for obesity. Hence, they are not practical to perform as a quick screening tool and have failed to enter routine clinical practice.

The aim of this study was to develop a simple BMI-based adjustment factor for the ECG that could be used in everyday clinical practice to improve diagnostic accuracy of the detection of LVH in the modern population, where obesity is increasingly prevalent.

Differentiating HCM from phenocopies — echocardiographic features and next steps: Asymmetric hypertrophy or dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) are more commonly seen in HCM than other pathologies but are not pathognomonic; therefore, correlation with the 12‑lead ECG and clinical history is recommended to narrow the differential diagnosis and guide selection of further advanced imaging.

### Additional impact of electrocardiographic over echocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy for predicting the risk of ischemic stroke [^1cd91998]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Although echocardiography is commonly used for the diagnosis of LVH, there is little information about the potential role of electrocardiography in providing additional prognostic information. The purpose of this study is to determine if electrocardiographically derived criteria for LVH provide additional prognostic value over echocardiography for predicting ischemic stroke in a multiethnic population.

Methods

A population-based, case-control study was conducted in 177 patients who had had a first ischemic stroke and in 246 control patients matched for age, gender, and race or ethnicity. Left ventricular mass was measured by using 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk of stroke associated with the presence of LVH diagnosed by electrocardiography (defined by 4 established criteria) after adjustment for the presence of other stroke risk factors and for echocardiographically determined LVH.

Results

After adjustment for the presence of other established stroke risk factors, ECG-LVH was associated with ischemic stroke, using Sokolow-Lyon (odds ratio [OR] 2.12, 95% CI 1.05–4.30), Cornell voltage (OR 2.06, 95% CI, 1.26–3.35), and Cornell product criteria (OR 2.12, 95% CI, 1.13–3.97). Cornell voltage criterion (men, > 2.8 mV; women, > 2.0 mV) was associated with ischemic stroke even after adjustment for echocardiographically determined LVH (OR 1.73, 95% CI, 1.04–2.88). The combination of echo-LVH and a positive Cornell voltage criterion was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in stroke risk.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that the presence of ECG-LVH is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke after adjustment for other stroke risk factors. For Cornell voltage criteria, this relationship persisted even after adjustment for echocardiographic LVH. Electrocardiographic results can provide independent information for left ventricular myocardial changes and should be considered together with echocardiographic results to fully assess the risk of ischemic stroke.

Hypertensive heart — left ventricular morphology definition and end-stage features: LV hypertrophy is defined on a normative basis; a definition based on 2 SD above the mean LVM in the general population will differ from a definition based on the healthy population without obesity or hypertension, and separate cutoffs are required for men and women. If LVM is corrected for BSA, it should be recognized that this corrects for obesity-related LVM, or for height; in the end-stage hypertensive heart, there is an increase in LV volumes and sphericity, a decrease in stroke volume, and finally a reduction in ejection fraction (EF).

### Performance of electrocardiographic criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy in Chinese hypertensive patients [^d7412bed]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our key finding was that the ECG criteria had low sensitivity and high specificity in the diagnosis of the echocardiographic LVH, especially the eccentric pattern. Nonetheless, the use of any of the 4 ECG criteria including Sokolow–Lyon voltage, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, and RavL voltage or any of the 7 ECG criteria may improve the diagnostic sensitivity for LVH in Chinese hypertensive patients.

Although it is known that the ECG LVH criteria might be ethnic dependent, few studies explored this important issue, and no study has yet evaluated the performance of ECG criteria for the new echocardiographic LVH criteria in Asians. With the old echocardiographic LVH criteria for the diagnosis of LVH, several previous studies investigated the accuracy of ECG criteria in the detection of LVH in Asians. In 546 Chinese patients with hypertension, Xie et al. found that the Cornell voltage and product criteria had a higher sensitivity to detect echocardiographic LVH (28% and 36.6%, respectively). In 539 young army men in Taiwan, Su et al. found that the Cornell voltage and product criteria had better performance for the echocardiographic LVH than the Sokolow–Lyon criteria, with a sensitivity of 22.2%, 27.8%, and 8.3%, respectively. However, in 332 Korean patients seen in a cardiology department, Park et al. demonstrated that the Cornell product criterion was superior to the Sokolow–Lyon voltage criterion in women, but the opposite was true in men.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^f1bd6f9b]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of heart failure with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is supported when the rate of ventricular relaxation is slowed with an elevated LV filling pressure in a patient with normal LV volumes and contractility, but in practice rests on typical heart failure symptoms and signs in a patient with a normal LVEF and no valvular abnormalities on echocardiography, with every effort made to exclude other possible explanations; noninvasive Doppler echocardiography has significant limitations because cardiac filling patterns are readily altered by loading conditions, aging, changes in heart rate, or mitral regurgitation, whereas analysis of BNP levels together with echocardiographic filling patterns can improve diagnostic accuracy and a normal BNP with completely normal diastolic filling parameters makes heart failure much less likely, though heart failure remains a strictly clinical diagnosis; patients with evidence of heart failure and relatively preserved LVEF who present with symptoms typical of heart failure should be classified as Stage C, and most patients will have some detectable structural abnormality such as left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial dilation, mitral annular calcification, aortic sclerosis, or myocardial scar.

Echocardiography in clinical management of hypertension — risk stratification and prognostic markers. The value of transthoracic echocardiography is recognized in the 2013 ESC/ESH guidelines, where it is listed as a class II indication (level of evidence B) for cardiovascular risk assessment in asymptomatic adults with hypertension, and it received a high appropriate use criteria score of 8 (scale 1–9) for the initial evaluation of suspected hypertensive heart disease. In this document, LV hypertrophy, LV diastolic dysfunction, and LA enlargement are described as specific signs of hypertensive heart disease, and LV hypertrophy is recognized as evidence of target organ damage in hypertension by the Joint National Committee for the prevention, detection, and evaluation of high blood pressure (JNC 7) of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute). In patients with hypertension, the type of LV remodelling (concentric remodelling, eccentric hypertrophy, and concentric hypertrophy) is predictive of the incidence of CV events; the presence of LVH on echocardiography identifies hypertensive heart disease with a higher sensitivity and specificity compared with electrocardiography, and several population cohort studies have shown that LVH is predictive of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, independent of blood pressure, and across all racial groups that have been studied.

### Application of echocardiographic data in patients with chronic kidney disease [^2b6e852b]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a high risk for cardiovascular events and mortality, particularly heart failure. Echocardiography is the most commonly used diagnostic imaging modality for heart failure. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent literature that demonstrates how echocardiography may be used to define cardiac structure and function in the CKD population and to identify echocardiographic abnormalities that have utility in predicting clinical outcomes in this population.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have highlighted the high prevalence of echocardiographic abnormalities in this population, and the challenge of identifying specific echocardiographic criteria for heart failure. There have been advances in application of strain echocardiography for evaluating systolic function in patients with normal ejection fraction, understanding pulmonary hypertension and identifying echocardiographic correlates of albuminuria. Additional studies have focused on diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy and echocardiographic findings in children with CKD.

Summary

Recent studies demonstrate the utility of echocardiography in characterizing heart structure and function and in providing potential tools for risk stratification in the high-risk CKD population.

Mitral "L" velocity — markedly delayed LV relaxation with elevated LV filling pressures allows ongoing mid-diastolic LV filling and thus an L velocity and patients usually have bradycardia; when present in known cardiac disease (e.g. LV hypertrophy [LVH], HCM) it is specific for elevated LV filling pressures but overall sensitivity is low; it is rarely seen in normal LV diastolic function when the subject has bradycardia and is then usually < 20 cm/sec.

### Electrocardiographic criteria which have the best prognostic significance in hypertensive patients with echocardiographic hypertrophy of left ventricle: 15-year prospective study [^9c148c83]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nowadays, numerous experts attempt to redefine the existing LVH criteria by using magnetic resonance as gold standard. Rodrigues et al. 19 noticed that obese individuals had less frequent LHV positive results in terms of voltage criterion and suggested their correction. The prognostic significance of this should be tested on large number of patients. Each positive step in terms of increasing sensitivity and preserving specificity had a significant clinical importance for this inexpensive and widely available diagnostic method. 20 Leese et al. 21 pointed out that combination of ECG and selective use of echocardiography could reduce the costs in the United States, which was supported by cost‐effectiveness analysis. On the other hand, European guidelines recommended that each patient should be subjected to echocardiography and electrocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy by means of corrected Lyon‐Sokolow criteria and Cornell product. 9 This study tested prognostic significance of large number of electrocardiographic criteria during a 15‐year patient treatment and follow‐up. The patients were divided into two groups based on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events which occurred during the study. All patients were treated in accordance with valid recommendations for treating hypertension and thus there were no statistically significant differences in terms of applied therapy. This was very important, since the evidence showed that the regression of LVH after hypertensive treatment was accompanied by improvement in prognosis. 22 This study showed no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of risk factors, BMI and blood pressure parameters, despite the fact that these factors might be responsible for the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Recently published study indicated that visit‐to‐visit blood pressure variability was a predictor of cardiovascular risk category in general population. 23 Hansen et al. 24 showed that correlation between 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and LVH was better than the correlation between office‐measured blood pressure and LVH. The values of blood pressure were not good predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients with LVH, as it was shown in our 5‐year study. 4, 25

Echocardiography — detection of target organ damage and LV hypertrophy (LVH) definitions: The American Society of Echocardiography recommendations should be followed with regard to image acquisition and LV measurement for calculating LV ejection fraction, mass, and relative wall thickness; LV ejection fraction may be significantly decreased in severe or acute onset HTN with associated congestive heart failure and may be mildly depressed in chronic HTN; because the heart increases in size in relation to body size, indexing LV mass is required and is particularly important in infants and younger children because of their rapid growth, with surrogate formulae needed and uncertainty about reference populations; LV structure is usually stratified into 4 groups based on LV mass and relative LV wall thickness, comprising normal geometry, concentric geometry with increased wall thickness, eccentric LVH, and concentric LVH; for this document, LVH is defined as LV mass > 51 g/m2.7 or LV mass > 115 g per body surface area (BSA) for boys and LV mass > 95 g/BSA for girls.

Echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) — prognostic associations across cohorts are quantified as follows: For every 50 g/m^2 higher left ventricular mass index, there was a relative risk of death of 1.73 (95% CI 1.19–2.52) independent of blood pressure; among African-Americans in ARIC, LVH was linked to cardiovascular events with HR of 1.88 in men and 1.92 in women; and in the Strong Heart Study, echocardiographic LVH prevalence was 9.5% with a seven-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality and a four-fold increase in all-cause mortality. Concentric LVH on echocardiography identifies a high risk phenotype with abnormal flow-mediated dilation and decreased myocardial flow reserve.

### Normal values of left-ventricular mass: echocardiographic findings from the PAMELA study [^0afbc111]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Upper reference values of echocardiographic left-ventricular mass in the European population are based on scanty data mostly derived from northern European population-based samples. Furthermore, data in apparently healthy populations have included individuals with conditions affecting left-ventricular mass such as obesity, diabetes and masked hypertension. Thus, from 1051 individuals with normal office blood pressure (BP) belonging to the PAMELA (Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate E Loro Associazioni) study population, we selected a group of 675 sustained normotensive individuals in order to provide reliable echocardiographic reference values for defining the criteria of left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

Methods

The study group (women 58%, mean age 42 ± 11 years) was identified after excluding individuals with isolated home or ambulatory hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and echocardiographic examinations of insufficient quality to evaluate left-ventricular mass.

Results

Sex-specific upper limits of normality [mean + 1.96 standard deviation (SD)] for left-ventricular mass, left-ventricular mass indexed to body surface area, heightand height were the following: 213 g, 114 g/m, 51 g/h, 123 g/h in men and 161 g, 99 g/m, 47 g/h, 101 g/h in women. In multivariate analyses, body size measures and ambulatory BP levels were the most important correlates of left-ventricular mass.

Conclusions

Our investigation by providing upper reference limits of left-ventricular mass in a southern European population sample, carefully selected after exclusion of a large number of conditions affecting left-ventricular mass, may offer a contribution for revising diagnostic criteria of echocardiographic LVH currently recommended by European hypertension guidelines.

### Electrocardiography is a poor screening test to detect left ventricular hypertrophy in children [^5a452d2a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Detection of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is clinically important because it can be predictive of adverse clinical outcome. However, the best method for detecting LVH in clinical practice is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate electrocardiography (ECG) compared with echocardiography (ECHO) as a screening test to detect LVH in a high risk population.

Method

In a prospective, double-blinded, single centre analysis of a population of children with chronic kidney disease, LVH detected using standard 12-lead ECG (ECG-LVH) was compared with that detected with 2D-guided M-mode ECHO (ECHO-LVH). Two electrocardiographic methods (A and B) were used to diagnose ECG-LVH and compared with three different indexation methods to define ECHO-LVH.

Results

70 consecutively enrolled participants had 107 ECG and ECHO studies performed on the same day. The prevalence of ECHO-LVH ranged from 17% to 55% using different indexation methods. Increased R wave amplitude using recent age and gender specific voltage criteria (ECG method B) demonstrated the highest sensitivity (68–76%) and specificity (43–77%) for detecting ECHO-LVH. The negative predictive value (NPV) for R waves using ECG method B was 52.4% (range 40–68.6%). For all other ECG criteria, sensitivity did not exceed 13% irrespective of the ECG or ECHO method used.

Conclusions

In children, the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram has low sensitivity and low NPV for detecting LVH. These findings are relevant for physiological LVH and should not be extrapolated to detection of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In clinical practice, ECHO alone should be used to exclude LVH.

### Relation of echocardiographic left ventricular mass and hypertrophy to persistent electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients: the LIFE study [^b001a743]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) trial used left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on a screening ECG to identify patients at high risk for morbid events. Because of regression to the mean, not all patients who met screening criteria had persistent ECG LVH on the ECG performed at study baseline.

Methods

The relationship of echocardiographic LV mass and LVH to persistence or loss of ECG LVH between screening and baseline evaluation was examined in 906 hypertensive patients in the LIFE study, who had echocardiograms and additional ECG performed at study baseline. Patients were categorized according to the presence or absence of ECG LVH by Cornell voltage-duration product criteria or Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria; echocardiographic LVH was defined by LV mass index (LVMI) > 104 g/m2 in women and > 116 g/m2 in men.

Results

A total of 678 patients (75%) had persistent ECG LVH at baseline evaluation. Compared with the 228 patients without ECG LVH on the second ECG by either criterion, the 106 patients with LVH by both Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon criteria had significantly higher LVMI (140 ± 31 v 114 ± 21 g/m2, P < .001) and a higher prevalence of echocardiographic LVH (86% v 55%, P < .001). Patients with ECG LVH on the baseline ECG by either Cornell product criteria (n = 410) or Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria (n = 162) had intermediate values of LVMI (125 ± 25 and 121 ± 21 g/m2) and prevalences of echocardiographic LVH (78% and 62%). After controlling for possible effects of age, sex, ethnicity, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index, persistence of ECG LVH on the baseline ECG was associated with an increased risk of echocardiographic LVH: compared with patients with neither ECG criteria for LVH, patients with only Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria had a 1.2-fold increased risk of echocardiographic LVH, those with only Cornell product criteria had a 2.7-fold increased risk, and patients with both ECG criteria had a 4.1-fold increased risk of echocardiographic LVH (P < .001).

Conclusions

Persistent ECG LVH between screening and LIFE study baseline identified patients with greater LV mass and a higher prevalence of echocardiographic LVH, suggesting that these patients may be at higher risk for subsequent morbid and mortal events.

### Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic detection of myocardial infarction in patients with left-ventricular hypertrophy. the LIFE study [^6006b038]. American Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a recognized risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI). However, detection of MI by standard electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria may be hampered in patients with LVH. In this setting of hypertensive LVH, the accuracy of two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography in detecting incident MI is unknown. Thus, we compared the accuracy of 2D echocardiography with Minnesota-code ECG criteria in detecting incident MI, adjudicated during serial evaluation in patients with hypertension and LVH.

Methods

In the ECG substudy of the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) Study, complete baseline wall-motion (WM) evaluation was obtained in 904 hypertensive patients with ECG LVH who did not have a left-bundle branch block. Electrocardiography and echocardiograms obtained at annual follow-up visits were evaluated for ECG Q-waves by Minnesota codes and WM abnormalities, respectively (mean follow-up, 4.8 ± 0.9 SD years). Occurrence of incident clinical MI during follow-up was adjudicated by an expert end-point committee.

Results

In two logistic models adjusting for confounders, incident MI was independently associated with either incident Q-waves by the Minnesota code (odds ratio [OR], 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–15.3) or incident and worsened WM abnormalities (OR, 11.9; 95% CI, 4.5–32.0), and the association was stronger for WM abnormalities than for Q-waves (P < .0001). Detection of incident MI by ECG or 2D echocardiography was obtained with sensitivities of 29% and 68% and specificities of 95% and 84%, respectively.

Conclusions

Wall-motion abnormalities on serial 2D ECGs recognize incident MI better than do Minnesota-code ECG criteria during follow-up of patients with hypertension and LVH.

### Obesity and risk of incident left ventricular hypertrophy in community-dwelling populations with hypertension: an observational study [^b29ed09f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography is commonly used to diagnose LVH in daily clinical practice, but the criteria recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (ASE/EACVI) were derived from European populations. Results of the international EchoNoRMAL (Echocardiographic Normal Reference Ranges of the Left Heart) study have shown ethnic differences in the reference values of echocardiographic parameters. The EMINCA (Echocardiographic Measurements in Normal Chinese Adults) study also found that the ASE/EACVI criteria might lead to misdiagnosis of LVH in Chinese patients with hypertension, arguing for the necessity of applying ethnic‐specific criteria to define LVH. Accordingly, in this study, using the EMINCA criteria to define LVH, we aimed to (1) evaluate the association between obesity and incident LVH in community‐dwelling populations with hypertension and (2) to investigate whether this association would be attenuated by a lower achieved SBP level (eg, < 130 mm Hg) at follow‐up.

### Application of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / Heart Failure Society of America heart failure staging guidelines in adults with chronic kidney disease [^02c7db8a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of Echocardiographic Parameters

Structural heart disease was defined as reduced left ventricular systolic function, ventricular hypertrophy, or chamber enlargement on echocardiograms. Assessments of cardiac structure and function were performed using echocardiography according to American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Research transthoracic echocardiograms were obtained at the individual CRIC sites in accordance with a standardized imaging protocol across all participating clinical centers. Sonographers were initially trained in telephone conference calls and provided with a detailed scanning manual complete with a checklist. The CRIC Central Echocardiography Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania monitored quality control and adherence to the scanning protocol and provided the sites with evaluations of the quality of the first several hundred echocardiograms. Supplemental training was provided on an as‐needed basis. All echocardiograms were then quantified at the CRIC Central Echocardiography Laboratory by a single registered diagnostic cardiac sonographer who was blinded to the identity of participants.

Left ventricular hypertrophy was defined using the Cornell Criteria; abnormal was considered ≥ 50 g/m 2.7 for men and ≥ 47 g/m 2.7 for women. Left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated using diastolic and systolic left ventricle volumes measured by the single‐plane Simpson rule method: left ventricular ejection fraction = [(Dvol2Svol)/Dvol]3100. Left ventricular ejection fraction was examined as a dichotomous variable, with a cutoff of ≥ 50% based on prior literature of preserved systolic function. Left atrial enlargement was defined as left atrial diameter ≥ 4.7 cm in men and left atrial diameter ≥ 4.3 cm in women.

### Distinct role of electrocardiographic criteria in echocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy according to age, in the general population: the ikaria study [^8c6e5f35]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The age-dependent performance of electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria was examined for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) prediction.

Methods

During 2009, 570 middle-aged (54 ± 7 years, 45% men) and 507 elderly (75 ± 6 years, 45% men) inhabitants of the Ikaria Island were studied. Seven ECG criteria were calculated (Sokolow-Lyon voltage and product, sex-specific Cornell voltage and product, Gubner-Ungerleider voltage, Lewis voltage and Framingham), whereas LVH was defined as left ventricular mass indexed for body surface area (BSA) at least 125g/m in men and at least 110g/m in women or left ventricular mass indexed for height 49g/m or more in men and 45g/m or more in women.

Results

The Framingham criteria had in hierarchical order the highest, although insignificant, sensitivity among the elderly individuals, either when LVH was indexed for BSA or for height (18.4 and 16.7%, respectively). Cornell voltage and product criteria had hierarchically the highest sensitivity among middle-aged participants, either when LVH was indexed for BSA (19.0 and 23.8%, respectively) or for height (17.2 and 20.3%, respectively). In the multiadjusted analysis applied in elderly participants, Cornell voltage, its product and Framingham criteria were associated with echocardiographic detection of LVH (indexed for BSA); however, when LVH was indexed for height, the Sokolow-Lyon and Framingham criteria were associated with LVH detection. In contrast, among middle-aged individuals, the Cornell product was the only ECG criterion that was associated with LVH detection (irrespective of indexation).

Conclusion

Age should be taken into consideration in selection of appropriate ECG criteria for LVH detection. Indexation of left ventricular mass differentiates the diagnostic ability of ECG criteria, especially in older patients.

### Performance of electrocardiographic criteria for echocardiographically diagnosed left ventricular hypertrophy in Chinese hypertensive patients [^efa3ad12]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography

Standard 2-dimensional (2D) echocardiography was performed at rest by an experienced research sonographer blinded to clinical information and ECG findings using the Philips IE33 device (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), diastolic posterior wall thickness (PWTd), and diastolic interventricular septum thickness (IVSTd) were imaged from a parasternal long-axis window at the level of the mitral chords using 2D-targeted M-mode echocardiography. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was calculated according to the American Society of Echocardiography-cube formula: LVM (g) = 0.8 × [1.04 × {(LVEDd + PWTd + IVSTd)3 − (LVEDd)3}] + 0.6. LVM was indexed for body surface area to obtain LVMI. LVH was defined as a LVMI > 115 g/m 2 in men and > 95 g/m 2 in women. The relative wall thickness (RWT) was calculated as the sum of anteroseptal and posterior wall thickness divided by LVEDd. LVH was classified according to RWT as concentric (RWT ≥ 0.42) and eccentric patterns (RWT < 0.42).

Blood pressure measurement

Blood pressure was measured on the day of admission at the hypertension inpatient ward. An automated oscillometric electronic blood pressure monitor was used during the entire study period (Omron BP-1300, Omron Healthcare, Kyoto, Japan). Two consecutive readings were obtained with a 1-minute interval after at least 5 minutes rest in the seated position. These 2 blood pressure readings were averaged for statistical analysis.

Statistical analysis

Means (± SD) and proportions were compared by the Student t test and Fisher's exact test, respectively. We also performed analysis of variance for comparisons between the 3 groups according to the echocardiographic LVH status. Diagnostic accuracy for each ECG criteria was evaluated by calculating sensitivity and specificity and by the receiver operating characteristic curves. We also performed multiple linear regression analyses to analyze the relationship between the 7 ECG indexes and LVM after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. We reported the standardized β coefficients for the 7 ECG indexes. P values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software, version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

### Electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy in children [^2b9f1182]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Previous studies to determine the sensitivity of the electrocardiogram (ECG) for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in children had their imperfections: they were not done on an unselected hospital population, several criteria used in adults were not applied to children, and obsolete limits of normal for the ECG parameters were used. Furthermore, left ventricular mass (LVM) was taken as the reference standard for LVH, with no regard for other clinical evidence. The study population consisted of 832 children from whom a 12-lead ECG and an M-mode echocardiogram were taken on the same day. The validity of the ECG criteria was judged on the basis of an abnormal LVM index, either alone or in combination with other clinical evidence. The ECG criteria were based on recently established age-dependent normal limits. At 95% specificity, the ECG criteria have low sensitivities (< 25%) when an elevated LVM index is taken as the reference for LVH. When clinical evidence is also taken into account, the sensitivity improved considerably (< 43%). Sensitivities could be further improved when ECG parameters were combined. The sensitivity of the pediatric ECG in detecting LVH is low but depends strongly on the definition of the reference used for validation.

Eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy — mechanism and echocardiographic features: It is associated with volume, rather than pressure overload, usually due to significant valvular regurgitation or high cardiac index as seen in elite athletes; systemic pressure is normal and peripheral resistance is not increased; echocardiography shows increased LV cavity size, normal LV wall thickness, and increased LVM; patients share similar changes in diastolic and longitudinal/radial function as in concentric hypertrophy, but generally have low normal or mildly impaired systolic function due to chronic volume overload.

Aortic stenosis — left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and hypertension considerations: Left ventricular hypertrophy commonly accompanies AS, and the small LV ejects a small stroke volume so that, even when severe stenosis is present, the AS velocity and mean gradient may be lower than expected for a given valve area, while continuity-equation valve area is accurate in this situation. Hypertension accompanies AS in 35–45% of patients; control of blood pressure is recommended before echocardiographic evaluation, whenever possible, and the echocardiographic report should always include a blood pressure measurement recorded at the time of the examination.

Abstract

Background

Electrocardiography is the first‐choice technique for detecting left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with arterial hypertension. It is necessary to know the probable outcome for every patient during the treatment, with the aim of improving cardiovascular event prevention.

Hypothesis

Certain electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy may predict outcomes of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy during a 15‐year follow‐up.

Methods

Fifteen‐year prospective study of 83 consecutive patients (53 male and 30 female; mean age 55.3 ± 8.1) with echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass index 170.3 ± 31.6 g/m 2). Electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy was determined by means of Gubner‐Ungerleider voltage, Lewis voltage, voltage of R wave in aVL lead, Lyon‐Sokolow voltage, Cornell voltage and Cornell product, voltage RV 6 and RV 5 ratio, Romhilt‐Estes score, Framingham criterion and Perugia criterion.

Results

One or more composite events were registered in 32 (38.5%) patients during 15‐year follow‐up. Positive Lyon‐Sokolow score (17.6% vs. 47.3%; P < 0.05), Lewis voltage (9.8% vs. 21.9%; P < 0.05), Cornell voltage (15.7% vs. 37.5%; P < 0.05), and Cornell product (9.8% vs. 34.4%; P < 0.01) were more frequent in a group of patients with composite events. Odd ratio for Cornell product was 4.819 (95% CI 1.486‐15.627).

Conclusion

Patients with echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy who had positive Lewis voltage, Lyon‐Sokolow voltage, Cornell voltage, and Cornell product showed worse 15‐year outcome. The strongest predictor of cardiovascular events was positive result of Cornell product.

Left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension — regression and prevalence. LV hypertrophy represents an important end-organ consequence of hypertension and therefore LVH has been proposed as a surrogate marker of outcome, with LVH shown to be reversed or prevented by a variety of haemodynamic, non-haemodynamic, and pharmacological factors; however, hypertrophy occurs in 36–41% of hypertensive subjects, but hypertension is not the only cause of this problem.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — assessment of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function and filling pressures is recommended using a comprehensive approach that includes E/e' ratio, left atrial (LA) volume index, pulmonary vein atrial reversal velocity, and peak velocity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet by continuous-wave (CW) Doppler; individual variables alone have modest correlations with LV filling pressures, while 2D and Doppler indices provide incremental prognostic information, with septal E/e' predicting adverse outcomes in children and similar adverse associations in adults (enlarged LA, abnormal diastolic function by E/e', or restrictive LV filling).

Pre-hypertension — guideline recommendations and potential role for echocardiography: In the category of pre-hypertension (systolic blood pressure 130–140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 80–90 mmHg), JNC 7 recommends intense lifestyle modification in such patients, and clinicians may obtain echocardiography to evaluate the presence of LV hypertrophy in such patients with pre-hypertension, particularly where there is a strong family history of hypertension and cardiovascular complications. Current guidance emphasizes blood pressure control rather than imaging-based risk stratification, as JNC 7 recommendations do not risk stratify patients for treatment on the basis of target organ damage and current guidelines recommend the use of combination treatment to get blood pressure to goal, thus blood pressure remains the primary target of therapy. Evidence gaps remain: no studies have examined whether a patient's knowledge of echocardiography demonstrating LVH will improve adherence to lifestyle modifications or pharmacological treatment, and NICE notes uncertainty about how to assess the impact of blood pressure treatment in people aged < 40 years with grade 1 hypertension and no overt target organ damage or CVD.

### Biological, electrical and echocardiographic indices versus cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy [^5ff658f8]. Hypertension Research (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) versus cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in detecting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The study included 42 hypertensive subjects with mean ± s.d. age 48.1 ± 12.3 years, 57.1% men, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure 144/89mmHg, left ventricular ejection fraction > 50%, without symptoms of heart failure, and not taking any drugs that interfere with hormonal regulation. The accuracies of the methods in detecting LVH were compared at two diagnostic LVH cutoffs: low, 83gm(-2) in men and 67gm(-2) in women; and high, 96gm(-2) in men and 81gm(-2) in women. With the low and high LVH cutoffs, the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves and the optimal values for NT-proBNP were 0.761, 0.849, 200 and 421pgml(-1), respectively. An NT-proBNP level under 30pgml(-1) ruled out LVH with 100% sensitivity. The optimal values and literature-based values of NT-proBNP allowed a correct classification of 73–81% of the subjects. In 80–90% of the cases, the diagnostic accuracy of NT-proBNP was close to that of ECG criteria but lower than that of TTE criteria. Interestingly, combining ECG criteria and NT-proBNP level improved the diagnostic performance to be at least comparable to that of TTE: the percentages of correctly classified subjects were 73–95% vs. 67–86%, respectively. Of note, the range considers both diagnostic LVH cutoffs. The simultaneous use of ECG criteria and NT-proBNP plasma levels seemed to be powerful enough to detect LVH in most hypertensive subjects.

Is There a Definitive Diagnostic Algorithm for?

What Is Known

Several diagnostic algorithms for CS make use of electrocardiographic criteria, different imaging modalities, and the response to immunosuppressive therapy to secure the diagnosis and at the same time recognize the low diagnostic yield of the endomyocardial biopsy,(Table 1). These multiple diagnostic tools partly allow diagnosis and treatment of CS in the absence of a positive endomyocardial biopsy. As pointed out in recent publications, the same person may fulfill the criteria to diagnose CS in 1 score but may fail to do so in another. Classifying patients as having CS can be especially difficult in borderline cases where some criteria are met in 1 score but not fulfilled or nonexistent in another.

Table 1
Comparison of Present Criteria in Expert Consensus Statements and Guidelines

There are no specific diagnostic findings for CS, but some occur frequently:
ECG: signs of conduction disturbance (higher‐degree atrioventricular block), premature ventricular contractions, or ventricular tachycardia.
Echocardiography: reduced regional strain values, segmental postsystolic contraction, hypertrophy, septal thinning, and delayed time to peak strain.
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging: multifocal late‐gadolinium enhancement with involvement of the interventricular septum, left lateral free wall, and right ventricle.
Positron‐emission tomography (F18‐fluorodeoxyglucose‐PET‐computed tomography [CT]): focal or focal on diffuse F18‐fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, if possible in combination with myocardial perfusion imaging.

### Concordance of measures of left-ventricular hypertrophy in pediatric hypertension [^b9a38534]. Pediatric Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that any child diagnosed with hypertension have an echocardiogram to evaluate for the presence of left-ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) and advocates that LVH is an indication to initiate or intensify antihypertensive therapy. However, there is no consensus on the ideal method of defining LVH in the pediatric population. Many pediatric cardiologists rely on wall-thickness z-score of the LV posterior wall and/or interventricular septum to determine LVH. Yet, the AAP advocates using LV mass indexed to 2.7 (LVMI(2.7)) ≥ 51 g/m(2.7) to diagnose LVH. Recently, age-specific reference values for LVMI ≥ 95% were developed. The objective of the study was to determine the concordance between diagnosis of LVH by wall-thickness z-score and diagnosis by LVMI(2.7) criteria. A retrospective chart review was performed for subjects diagnosed with hypertension at a single tertiary care center (2009–2012). Echocardiogram reports were reviewed, and assessment of LVH was recorded. Diagnosis of LVH was assigned to each report reviewed according to three criteria: (1) LV wall-thickness z-score > 2.00; (2) age-specific reference values for LVMI(2.7) > 95th percentile; and (3) LVMI(2.7) > 51 g/m(2.7). Cohen's kappa statistic was used as a measurement of agreement between diagnosis by wall-thickness z-score and diagnosis using LVMI(2.7). A total of 159 echocardiograms in 109 subjects were reviewed. Subjects included 31 females and 77 males, age 13.2 ± 4.4 years, and 39 (42%) with a diagnosis of secondary hypertension. LVH was diagnosed in 31 cases (20%) based on increased wall-thickness z-score. Using LVMI(2.7) > 95%, LVH was found in 75 (47%) cases (mean LVMI(2.7)42.3 ± 17.2 g/m(2.7) [range 11.0–111 g/m(2.7)]). The wall-thickness z-score method agreed with LVMI(2.7) > 95% diagnosis 71% of the time (kappa 0.4). Using LVH criteria of LVMI(2.7) ≥ 51 g/m(2.7), 33 (21%) subjects were diagnosed with LVH. There was 79% agreement in the diagnosis of LVH between the wall-thickness z-score method and LVMI(2.7) > 51 g/m(2.7) (kappa 0.37). There is poor concordance between the diagnosis of LVH on echocardiogram reports using wall-thickness z-score and diagnosis of LVH using LVMI(2.7) criteria. It is important to establish a consensus method for diagnosing LVH because of the high frequency of cardiovascular complications in children with hypertension.
