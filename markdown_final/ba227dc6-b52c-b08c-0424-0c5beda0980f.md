hypocalcemia approch

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a stepwise approach to hypocalcemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypocalcemia and distinguishing total versus ionized calcium. Then, I should assess severity and symptoms to decide on urgency. Next, I will consider the etiologic framework using PTH, vitamin D, and magnesium. After that, I will outline acute management by severity, followed by chronic strategies and special populations. Finally, I will integrate monitoring, safety, and a concise algorithm, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis carefully, because pseudo-hypocalcemia from hypoalbuminemia is common and can mislead management; I should calculate corrected total calcium or, better yet, obtain ionized calcium when results are discordant with symptoms or in critical illness, and I should remember that albumin-adjusted calcium is unreliable in ICU settings, so ionized calcium is preferred there [^4a5245f3] [^97f2d2f7].

> Wait, let me verify the severity and symptom mapping before jumping to IV therapy; severe symptomatic hypocalcemia presents with tetany, seizures, prolonged QT, or cardiac irritability, whereas mild cases may be asymptomatic or have paresthesias and cramping, and this stratification will drive whether I use IV calcium gluconate immediately or start with oral therapy while I investigate the cause [^c0d0f5d9] [^00d0db16].

> I will now examine the etiologic framework, and I need to ensure I anchor it to PTH because that is the most informative first test; low or inappropriately normal PTH points to hypoparathyroidism, high PTH suggests vitamin D deficiency or resistance, renal failure, or malabsorption, and normal PTH with hypocalcemia should make me reconsider measurement error or magnesium-related issues, so I should order PTH, 25(OH)D, magnesium, phosphate, and creatinine early in the workup [^0edf4531] [^c0d0f5d9].

> Hold on, I should verify magnesium's role because it is frequently overlooked; hypomagnesemia impairs PTH secretion and action, so if magnesium is low, I must replete it first or else calcium correction will be refractory, and I should double-check for drugs that lower magnesium or interfere with PTH, such as loop diuretics, PPIs, or cisplatin, before escalating calcium therapy [^c0d0f5d9] [^4b835cb8].

> For severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, I need to act immediately; 1–2 g IV calcium gluconate over 10–20 minutes with cardiac monitoring is appropriate, and I should avoid calcium chloride peripherally due to tissue injury risk unless via a central line, then follow with a continuous infusion if needed, while concurrently checking magnesium and correcting it to restore PTH responsiveness [^474ca296] [^474ca296].

> Let me consider moderate disease next; if the patient is symptomatic but stable, I should start oral calcium carbonate 1–2 g elemental calcium every 6 hours and add calcitriol 0.5–1 mcg daily, titrating to symptoms and serum calcium, and I should monitor closely for rebound hypercalcemia as I uptitrate, especially in postsurgical patients [^27e6a0ae] [^4b835cb8].

> For mild asymptomatic cases, I should confirm the cause first and avoid overtreatment; oral calcium 500–1000 mg elemental twice daily with vitamin D repletion if deficient is reasonable, and I should avoid chronic supraphysiologic calcium loads that increase nephrocalcinosis risk, particularly in hypoparathyroidism or CKD [^27e6a0ae] [^663200d8].

> Next, I should review chronic management of hypoparathyroidism; conventional therapy with calcium and active vitamin D can maintain calcium but often at the expense of hypercalciuria and renal complications, so I should target the low-normal calcium range, monitor 24-hour urine calcium, and consider PTH replacement such as rhPTH 1–84 or palopegteriparatide when control is suboptimal or complications emerge, balancing benefits and risks carefully [^8ceb2727] [^5b27264e] [^663200d8].

> But wait, what if the hypocalcemia is postsurgical; I should confirm that early PTH measurement predicts risk, with PTH less than 10–15 pg/mL indicating high likelihood of hypocalcemia, and I should either use selective supplementation based on PTH or routine prophylactic calcium with calcitriol to reduce symptomatic events and facilitate safe discharge, tapering over weeks to avoid iatrogenic suppression of parathyroid recovery [^f7747f23] [^19a37e9c] [^92cb1fb2].

> I need to ensure I address CKD-MBD specifically; in CKD, KDIGO advises tolerating mild asymptomatic hypocalcemia to avoid calcium loading, correcting symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia, and avoiding hypercalcemia, with dialysate calcium 1.25–1.5 mmol/L in dialysis patients, so I should individualize targets and be cautious with calcium-based phosphate binders and vitamin D analogs [^1a04fe87] [^5982fc32] [^61ee5457].

> Let me reconsider special populations; in pregnancy, I should maintain maternal calcium at the low-normal range, anticipate increased needs during lactation, and monitor the neonate for hypocalcemia if maternal disease was poorly controlled, whereas in children with vitamin D deficiency, I should treat with high-dose vitamin D and add calcium if symptomatic, then transition to maintenance dosing once replete [^7030790c] [^671227f5] [^787109da].

> I should double-check trauma and massive transfusion contexts; hypocalcemia is common and contributes to coagulopathy, so I should monitor ionized calcium and give calcium chloride early during resuscitation, particularly after every 2–4 units of blood products, to mitigate the lethal diamond of acidosis, coagulopathy, hypothermia, and hypocalcemia [^e19dc4dc] [^c97ef47a] [^58996ff5].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety; during active correction I will check calcium every 4–6 hours initially, then space out as stable, monitor for hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and ectopic calcifications in chronic therapy, and in postsurgical patients I will reassess PTH at 6–12 months to distinguish transient from permanent hypoparathyroidism before committing to long-term replacement [^8ceb2727] [^8232b506].

> Hold on, I should verify drug-induced contributors; denosumab and other antiresorptives can precipitate hypocalcemia, especially with vitamin D deficiency or CKD, so I should correct vitamin D and calcium before initiation, monitor closely after dosing, and treat symptomatic hypocalcemia promptly while avoiding routine treatment of asymptomatic cases in tumor lysis syndrome, where calcium can worsen calcium-phosphate precipitation [^b327b4c6] [^3067df1e] [^4a08a658].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying; confirm true hypocalcemia with ionized calcium when uncertain, assess symptoms to determine IV versus oral therapy, obtain PTH, 25(OH)D, magnesium, phosphate, and creatinine to classify etiology, treat severe disease with IV calcium gluconate and correct magnesium, treat moderate disease with oral calcium and calcitriol, and tailor chronic therapy to the underlying cause with attention to CKD, pregnancy, pediatrics, and postsurgical nuances, documenting response and adjusting to avoid both hypo- and hypercalcemia [^4a5245f3] [^0edf4531] [^8ceb2727].

---

Hypocalcemia management is **stepwise**: confirm true hypocalcemia with ionized calcium or albumin-corrected total calcium [^4a5245f3], assess severity and symptoms, and correct magnesium if low [^4b835cb8]. For severe symptoms (tetany, seizures, arrhythmias), give **IV calcium gluconate** 1–2 g over 10 minutes, then a continuous infusion; for mild cases, use oral calcium 1–2 g elemental TID plus calcitriol 0.25–0.5 mcg daily, titrating to keep calcium at the low-normal range. Identify and treat the cause (e.g. vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, CKD, medications) and monitor calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and renal function regularly to avoid hypercalcemia and complications [^8ceb2727].

---

## Step 1: confirm true hypocalcemia

- **Ionized calcium**: preferred in critical illness, low albumin, or when total calcium is discordant with symptoms [^4a5245f3].
- **Albumin-corrected total calcium**: use when ionized calcium is unavailable [^4a5245f3].
- **Repeat testing**: confirm persistent hypocalcemia before chronic therapy [^8232b506].

---

## Step 2: assess severity and symptoms

| **Severity** | **Serum calcium (mg/dl)** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe | < 7.0 | Tetany, seizures, laryngospasm, QT prolongation, arrhythmias |
| Moderate | 7.0–8.0 | Paresthesia, muscle cramps, Chvostek/Trousseau signs |
| Mild | 8.0–8.5 | Often asymptomatic or mild paresthesia |

---

## Step 3: correct magnesium deficiency

Low magnesium impairs PTH secretion and action; **replete magnesium** to ≥ 2.0 mg/dL before or alongside calcium therapy [^4b835cb8].

---

## Step 4: acute management based on severity

### Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia

- **IV calcium gluconate**: 1–2 g (10–20 mL of 10%) IV over 10 minutes; repeat until symptoms resolve [^474ca296].
- **Continuous infusion**: 1–2 g in 1 L D5W at 0.5–1.5 mg/kg/h; titrate to maintain calcium 8–9 mg/dL.
- **Cardiac monitoring**: essential during IV calcium administration [^notfound].

---

### Moderate hypocalcemia

Use **oral calcium** 1–2 g elemental TID and **calcitriol** 0.25–0.5 mcg daily; titrate to low-normal calcium.

---

### Mild hypocalcemia

Use **oral calcium** 1–2 g elemental daily and **calcitriol** 0.25 mcg daily if needed; monitor and titrate.

---

## Step 5: identify and treat underlying causes

- **Vitamin D deficiency**: replete with cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, then maintain 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL [^00d0db16].
- **Hypoparathyroidism**: lifelong calcium and active vitamin D; consider PTH replacement if refractory [^8ceb2727] [^5b27264e].
- **CKD-MBD**: avoid hypercalcemia; tolerate mild hypocalcemia to limit calcium load [^1a04fe87] [^5982fc32].
- **Medications**: stop or adjust offending agents (e.g. calcimimetics, bisphosphonates, denosumab) [^cbf7d6fd] [^b327b4c6].

---

## Step 6: monitoring and adjustment

- **Calcium and magnesium**: check every 4–6 hours initially, then daily until stable.
- **Renal function and phosphate**: monitor regularly to guide therapy and avoid complications [^8ceb2727].
- **Hypercalcemia**: reduce or stop calcium/calcitriol if calcium rises above normal [^2dfb943c].

---

## Step 7: long-term management and prevention

- **Dietary calcium**: 1–1.5 g/day.
- **Vitamin D**: maintain 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL [^00d0db16].
- **Patient education**: recognize symptoms, adhere to therapy, and seek care promptly [^49e894cb].

---

## Special considerations

- **Postsurgical hypoparathyroidism**: early calcium and calcitriol reduce symptomatic hypocalcemia; taper as PTH recovers [^92cb1fb2].
- **Pregnancy**: maintain low-normal calcium; monitor closely to avoid maternal/fetal complications [^7030790c].
- **Trauma/massive transfusion**: monitor ionized calcium and correct promptly to support coagulation [^c97ef47a].

---

A structured approach — confirm, assess, correct magnesium, treat acutely, address the cause, and monitor — ensures **safe, effective correction** of hypocalcemia while minimizing complications [^notfound].

### Investigation and management of hypocalcaemia [^0edf4531]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypocalcaemia is a common clinical scenario in children with a range of aetiological causes. It will often present with common symptoms but may occasionally be identified in an asymptomatic child. An understanding of the physiological regulation of plasma calcium is important in understanding the potential cause of hypocalcaemia and its appropriate management. The age of presentation will influence the likely differential diagnosis. We have presented a stepwise approach to the investigation of hypocalcaemia dependent on the circulating serum parathyroid hormone level at the time of presentation. The acute and long-term management of the underlying condition is also reviewed.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines [^0ce46239]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and absent or deficient PTH. This report presents a summary of current information about epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, clinical features, and management and proposes guidelines to help clinicians diagnose, evaluate, and manage this disorder.

Participants

Participants in the First International Conference on the Management of Hypoparathyroidism represented a worldwide constituency with acknowledged interest and expertise in key basic, translational, and clinical aspects of hypoparathyroidism. Three Workshop Panels were constituted to address questions for presentation and discussion at the Conference held in Florence, Italy, May 7–9, 2015. At that time, a series of presentations were made, followed by in-depth discussions in an open forum. Each Workshop Panel also met in closed sessions to formulate the three evidence-based reports that accompany this summary statement. An Expert Panel then considered this information, developed summaries, guidelines, and a research agenda that constitutes this summary statement.

Evidence

Preceding the conference, each Workshop Panel conducted an extensive literature search as noted in the individual manuscripts accompanying this report. All presentations were based upon the best peer-reviewed information taking into account the historical and current literature.

Consensus Process

This report represents the Expert Panel's synthesis of the conference material placed in a context designed to be relevant to clinicians and those engaged in cutting-edge studies of hypoparathyroidism.

Conclusions

This document not only provides a summary of our current knowledge but also places recent advances in its management into a context that should enhance future advances in our understanding of hypoparathyroidism.

### Parathyroid disorders… [^00d0db16]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Initial Approach to Calcium Abnormalities Parathyroid disorders are most often identified incidentally by abnormalities in serum calcium levels when screening for renal or bone disease or other conditions. 1, 2, 4–6 Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a paraneoplastic syndrome mediated by PTH-related peptide, should be considered in patients with low PTH levels, rapid onset of symptoms, and other signs and symptoms of malignancy. It is most often associated with squamous cell carcinoma and solid tumors of the lung, breast, esophagus, skin, cervix, and kidney. 4 Vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause of hypocalcemia.
5. Severe symptomatic hypercalcemia should be managed acutely with intravenous fluids, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, denosumab, or dialysis.

6 Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, which can present acutely with carpopedal spasm, tetany, seizures, and a prolonged QT interval, should be managed with intravenous calcium gluconate while the cause is being determined.
12. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder that presents with abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood, low urinary calcium excretion, and normal or slightly elevated PTH levels. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia generally does not require treatment, including surgery. | Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism and any of the following: 50 years or younger at diagnosis Serum calcium level > 1 mg per dL above the upper limit of normal Osteoporosis, fragility fracture, or evidence of vertebral.

All patients should be encouraged to maintain adequate hydration to reduce the risk of nephrolithiasis, maintain adequate physical activity to minimize bone resorption, and avoid medications that increase hypercalcemia. Maintaining adequate dietary calcium intake and vitamin D intake to keep 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at 20 or 30 ng per mL or higher helps avoid further increases in PTH level.

### Endocrine and metabolic emergencies: hypocalcaemia [^5669b9bb]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Hypocalcaemia is a common electrolyte disturbance, especially in the inpatient setting. There are a wide variety of causes of hypocalcaemia and correct management depends on the underlying diagnosis. However, acute hypocalcaemia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be managed as a medical emergency. Chronic care of the hypocalcaemic patient is also briefly described, as this is an important opportunity to reduce further admissions related to both hypocalcaemic and hypercalcaemic presentations.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^97f2d2f7]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Hypocalcaemia is common in critical illness but tends to normalize during the early days of admission to intensive care.

- In most cases normalization of calcium status is not associated with improved outcome, however mortality may be higher in severely hypocalcaemic patients who remain hypocalcemic on the fourth day of their admission.

- Calcium supplementation does not improve either calcium normalization or survival and a large randomized controlled trial is required to assess the effectiveness and side effects of this intervention.

- Albumin-adjusted calcium is a poor predictor of low ionized calcium in critical illness and should not be used in this setting.

- Low magnesium, sodium and albumin are independently associated with low ionized calcium and this should be considered in the overall management of each patient.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^671227f5]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency–associated hypocalcemia — calcium and calcitriol dosing guidance includes that hypocalcemia should be treated with calcium supplements, with parenteral calcium as calcium gluconate (10–20 mg of elemental calcium per kg intravenously slowly over 5–10 minutes, usually given as 1–2 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate) in cases of manifest tetany or convulsions. Recommended doses of elemental calcium are 30 to 75 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses, and calcitriol may be necessary in doses of 20 to 100 ng/kg per day in 2 to 3 divided doses until calcium levels normalize. High doses of calcium are necessary early in the course of therapy, after which doses are reduced by half for the next 1 to 2 weeks. Once vitamin D is reduced to 400 IU/day with normal PTH and 25(OH)-D levels, calcium supplementation is usually not necessary.

### Medical management of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism [^3a63397d]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a clinical update on the management of hypoparathyroidism with focus on postsurgical hypoparathyroidism.

Methods

Using PubMed, English-language literature was searched related to management of hypoparathyroidism after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. We discuss the incidence, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, early diagnosis, and treatment of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism.

Results

Hypoparathyroidism is a well-recognized complication after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Transient hypoparathyroidism occurs in 10% of patients who undergo total thyroidectomy. Less than half of patients who develop transient hypoparathyroidism after thyroid surgery develop permanent hypoparathyroidism. Postsurgical hypocalcemia resulting from inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion could cause neurologic complications and respiratory compromise. Calcium supplements and vitamin D analogues effectively treat hypocalcemia associated with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. Measurement of PTH after thyroid and parathyroid surgery allows early identification of patients likely to require calcium supplements and vitamin D analogue therapy. Early identification and appropriate management of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism prevent hypocalcemia-related complications and allow patients to be discharged from the hospital earlier. Patients who develop permanent hypoparathyroidism should receive appropriate follow-up care to monitor for long-term complications related to supplemental therapy. PTH replacement therapy is currently being evaluated for the treatment of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach involving an endocrinologist and surgeon is imperative to reduce the morbidity associated with hypoparathyroidism after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Supplemental therapy with calcium and vitamin D analogues is standard. New drugs currently in clinical trials offer promising treatment options.

### A practical approach to hypercalcemia [^752c52f4]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a disorder commonly encountered by primary care physicians. The diagnosis often is made incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Clinical manifestations affect the neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Some other important causes of hypercalcemia are medications and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. An initial diagnostic work-up should include measurement of intact parathyroid hormone, and any medications that are likely to be causative should be discontinued. Parathyroid hormone is suppressed in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism. It is essential to exclude other causes before considering parathyroid surgery, and patients should be referred for parathyroidectomy only if they meet certain criteria. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a benign course and do not need surgery. Hypercalcemic crisis is a life-threatening emergency. Aggressive intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of management in severe hypercalcemia, and antiresorptive agents, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates, frequently can alleviate the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemic disorders.

### Hypercalcemic crisis: a clinical review [^abcfc4ee]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic perturbation. However, hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency, with little clinical scientific data to support therapeutic strategy. We review the relevant scientific English literature on the topic and review current management strategies after conducting a PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search for articles published between 1930 and June 2014 using specific keywords: "hypercalcemic crisis", "hyperparathyroid crisis", "parathyroid storm", "severe primary hyperparathyroidism", "acute hyperparathyroidism", and "severe hypercalcemia" for articles pertaining to the diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies. Despite extensive clinical experience, large and well-designed clinical studies to direct appropriate clinical care are lacking. Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality rates have substantially decreased since early series reported almost universal fatality. Improved outcomes can be attributed to modern diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier diagnosis, along with the recognition that primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common etiology for hypercalcemic crisis. Hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency that portends excellent outcomes if rapid diagnosis, medical treatment, and definitive surgical treatment are expedited.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^bf3c8309]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Both hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia can lead to serious complications in patients with advanced cancer. Bisphosphonates are effective treatments for both osteolytic and humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy. In patients with persistent or relapsed hypercalcaemia of malignancy that fails to respond or no longer responds to bisphosphonate treatment, denosumab offers a therapeutic option and, as such, has been approved for this indication in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Russia. Denosumab is a more potent inhibitor of bone resorption than zoledronic acid and is more effective at preventing hypercalcaemia. It is possible that the incidence of hypercalcaemia of malignancy may further decrease as potent inhibitors of bone resorption are used more commonly and earlier in the course of management of patients with metastatic cancer. On the other hand, inhibitors of bone resorption have been shown to increase the risk of developing hypocalcaemia. This risk is higher with denosumab than with zoledronic acid; however, it can be managed by proper identification of at-risk patients and careful monitoring of those receiving these agents. Given the potential improvements to quality of life that inhibitors of bone resorption offer patients with advanced cancer, the benefits and risks associated with their use must be assessed. Further to this, physicians need to be aware of the measures they can take to counteract these risks and to find the balance between hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia.

### Hypocalcemia prevention and management after thyroidectomy in children: a systematic review [^f5b01c35]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypocalcemia is the most common complication following thyroidectomy in children. Guidelines to manage post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia are available for adults, but not children. The objective of this review was to identify practices related to hypocalcemia prevention and management in pediatric patients.

Methods

We identified studies examining the prevention and management of hypocalcemia in pediatric patients post-thyroidectomy within PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Three independent reviewers screened citations and reviewed full-text papers.

Results

A total of 15 studies were included, representing 1552 patients. The overall study quality was weak with lack of randomization and inconsistent outcome reporting. The pooled incidence of hypocalcemia from the 15 studies was 35.5% for transient hypocalcemia and 4.2% for permanent hypocalcemia. All studies discussed post-operative hypocalcemia treatment, with most patients requiring admission for intra-venous calcium therapy. One study described a protocol discharging asymptomatic patients on calcitriol and calcium. Three studies discussed preoperative calcium supplementation in patients at risk of hypocalcemia. No studies examined routine use of calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation to prevent post-operative hypocalcemia.

Conclusion

A significant number of children undergoing thyroidectomy develop hypocalcemia. Despite this high incidence, our systematic review demonstrates significant practice variation surrounding post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia prevention and management in children.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^19a37e9c]. AAES (2020). High credibility.

Calcium supplementation after thyroidectomy — risk and protocols indicate that because 2 contralateral parathyroid glands remain in situ, there is no risk of hypocalcemia with initial lobectomy and no need to measure postoperative calcium. After total or completion thyroidectomy, common approaches include postoperative serum calcium measurement with selective calcium ± calcitriol supplementation, routine prophylactic calcium ± calcitriol for all patients, or PTH-guided early supplementation. In a prospective cohort study of > 400 patients, PTH-based selective dosing of calcium and vitamin D reduced symptoms of hypocalcemia and critically low calcium levels.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^f7747f23]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association postoperative hypoparathyroidism — risk factors, thresholds, and management are summarized as follows: Hypoparathyroidism occurs when a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is accompanied by hypocalcemia. Risk factors for post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism include bilateral thyroid operations, autoimmune thyroid disease, central neck dissection, substernal goiter, surgeon inexperience, and malabsorptive conditions. Measurement of intraoperative or early postoperative PTH levels following thyroidectomy can help guide patient management, and in general, a postoperative PTH level ≤ 15 pg/mL indicates increased risk for acute hypoparathyroidism. Effective management of mild to moderate potential or actual postoperative hypoparathyroidism can be achieved by administering either empiric/prophylactic oral calcium and vitamin D, selective oral calcium and vitamin D based on rapid postoperative PTH level(s), or serial serum calcium levels as a guide for supplementation; for more severe hypocalcemia, inpatient management may be necessary. Permanent hypoparathyroidism has long-term consequences for both objective and subjective well-being, and should be prevented whenever possible.

### A systematic review supporting the endocrine society clinical practice guideline on the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults [^a27d9cea]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Hypercalcemia is a common complication of malignancy that is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To support development of the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed 8 clinical questions prioritized by a guideline panel from the Endocrine Society. Quantitative and qualitative synthesis was performed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Results

We reviewed 1949 citations, from which we included 21 studies. The risk of bias for most of the included studies was moderate. A higher proportion of patients who received bisphosphonate achieved resolution of hypercalcemia when compared to placebo. The incidence rate of adverse events was significantly higher in the bisphosphonate group. Comparing denosumab to bisphosphonate, there was no significant difference in the rate of patients who achieved resolution of hypercalcemia. Two-thirds of patients with refractory/recurrent hypercalcemia of malignancy who received denosumab following bisphosphonate therapy achieved resolution of hypercalcemia. Addition of calcitonin to bisphosphonate therapy did not affect the resolution of hypercalcemia, time to normocalcemia, or hypocalcemia. Only indirect evidence was available to address questions on the management of hypercalcemia in tumors associated with high calcitriol levels, refractory/recurrent hypercalcemia of malignancy following the use of bisphosphonates, and the use of calcimimetics in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with parathyroid carcinoma. The certainty of the evidence to address all 8 clinical questions was low to very low.

Conclusion

The evidence summarized in this systematic review addresses the benefits and harms of treatments of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Additional information about patients' values and preferences, and other important decisional and contextual factors is needed to facilitate the development of clinical recommendations.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^4a5245f3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In light of these factors, we suggest that unadjusted calcium remains the best and most practical alternative to ionized calcium in most clinical settings. Clinicians should be thoughtful about ordering ionized calcium instead of total calcium. Ionized calcium should be considered to inform on acute management of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients, especially in the critically ill. It should also be considered in patients with preexisting calcium disorders (eg, hypo- or hyperparathyroidism) when the total calcium does not reflect a patient's symptoms or clinical status. This is particularly important in the current health care climate, where there is emphasis on the reduction of unnecessary testing.

### Hypocalcemia… [^c0d0f5d9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

There is much individual variability in the clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia. The rapidity of the development of hypocalcemia will determine whether or not symptoms will be present. Signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia consisted of tetany, seizures, diminished to absent deep tendon reflexes, papilledema, mental changes, and skin changes. Etiologic factors for hypocalcemia in man include decreased calcium absorption or increased loss from the gastrointestinal tract; parathyroid hormone deficiency; skeletal resistance to parathyroid hormone; ineffective parathyroid hormone; decreased production or increased degradation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol or 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol; increased complex formation with calcium; increased skeletal uptake of calcium; hypomagnesemic state; and direct inhibition of bone resorption.

Measurement of total and ionic calcium, magnesium, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D metabolites, and nephrogenous cyclic adenosine monophosphate are especially helpful in the laboratory evaluation of the hypocalcemic patient.

### Assessment and management of patients with abnormal calcium [^fc3276ac]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Calcium is essential for homeostasis, and normocalcemia should be maintained strictly during the perioperative period. The biochemistry of calcium equilibrium results from the calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid glands, which detect changes in calcium concentrations and initiate the proper response. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is a common metabolic derangement that is often discovered on routine serum screening. The most common etiologies are primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer. Increasingly, parathyroidectomy is the preferred therapy for primary hyperparathyroidism. Severe hypercalcemia ("hypercalcemic crisis") should be managed aggressively with a combination of intravenous fluids, steroids, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin. Some of these patients may require an urgent parathyroidectomy for calcium control. Hypocalcemia needs to be verified, as many cases of hypocalcemia are the artifact of hypoalbuminemia. Severe hypocalcemia occurs after subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with auto transplantation as well as after massive resuscitation or blood transfusion. Strategies aimed at correcting calcium concentrations depend on the severity of symptomatology. If symptoms are mild, oral calcium supplementation can be given; otherwise, intravenous calcium should be administered.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: present and future [^44ee550f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Conventional management of hypoparathyroidism has focused upon maintaining the serum calcium with oral calcium and active vitamin D, often requiring high doses and giving rise to concerns about long-term consequences including renal and brain calcifications. Replacement therapy with PTH has recently become available. This paper summarizes the results of the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Management of Hypoparathyroidism.

Evidence Acquisition

Contributing authors reviewed the literature regarding physiology, pathophysiology, and nutritional aspects of hypoparathyroidism, management of acute hypocalcemia, clinical aspects of chronic management, and replacement therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH peptides. PubMed and other literature search engines were utilized.

Evidence Synthesis

Under normal circumstances, interactions between PTH and active vitamin D along with the dynamics of calcium and phosphorus absorption, renal tubular handing of those ions, and skeletal responsiveness help to maintain calcium homeostasis and skeletal health. In the absence of PTH, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skeleton are all affected, leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, reduced bone remodeling, and an inability to conserve filtered calcium. Acute hypocalcemia can be a medical emergency presenting with neuromuscular irritability. The recent availability of recombinant human PTH (1–84) has given hope that management of hypoparathyroidism with the missing hormone in this disorder will provide better control and reduced needs for calcium and vitamin D.

Conclusions

Hypoparathyroidism is associated with abnormal calcium and skeletal homeostasis. Control with calcium and active vitamin D can be a challenge. The availability of PTH (1–84) replacement therapy may usher new opportunities for better control with reduced supplementation requirements.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^49e894cb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment and prevention of hypocalcaemia

Hypocalcaemia in patients with cancer can have severe consequences, whether occurring with or without the use of inhibitors of bone resorption, but responds well to calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, when treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is required for the management of metastatic bone disease, hypocalcaemia can usually be prevented by identification and appropriate management of at-risk patients. Case reports and retrospective analyses have identified a number of risk factors associated with the development of hypocalcaemia in those receiving inhibitors of bone resorption; these include vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, osteoblastic metastases, prostate cancer, and low baseline blood calcium levels (Table 2). It is therefore important that vitamin D and calcium levels are assessed and supplementation initiated before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption. This evaluation is particularly important given the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency among patients with metastatic cancer. Furthermore, all patients receiving inhibitors of bone resorption for the prevention of SREs should receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation; use of these supplements has been shown to lower the risk of developing hypocalcaemia by 27% and 40% in patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab, respectively. An interim analysis of an open-label observational study of treatment persistence in patients with cancer who were receiving denosumab to prevent SREs found that most patients (80%) received calcium and vitamin D supplementation at the start of denosumab treatment. Long-term follow-up persistence data, however, are not yet available. Previous reports suggest that adherence to calcium and vitamin D supplementation is low; patients should, therefore, be counselled on the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake in order to improve adherence. Use of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active metabolite of vitamin D, might offer further advantages in the prevention and treatment of hypocalcaemia; however, trials are required to confirm this.

Although hypocalcaemia can occur at any time during treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption, studies show that it often develops soon after treatment initiation; within 7 days, in some cases. Therefore, careful monitoring of at-risk patients after starting treatment is important to enable quick detection and resolution of hypocalcaemia. At-risk patients should also be educated about the symptoms of hypocalcaemia and encouraged to report any indicative symptoms. If hypocalcaemia occurs while a patient is receiving inhibitors of bone resorption, additional calcium and vitamin D supplementation and further monitoring are advised. Delaying the administration of inhibitors of bone resorption because of hypocalcaemia is rarely necessary.

### Targets for parathyroid hormone in secondary hyperparathyroidism: is a "one-size-fits-all" approach appropriate? A prospective incident cohort study [^7629a803]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Recommendations for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) consider that a "one-size-fits-all" target enables efficacy of care. In routine clinical practice, SHPT continues to pose diagnosis and treatment challenges. One hypothesis that could explain these difficulties is that dialysis population with SHPT is not homogeneous.

Methods

EPHEYL is a prospective, multicenter, pharmacoepidemiological study including chronic dialysis patients (≥ 3 months) with newly SHPT diagnosis, i.e. parathyroid hormone (PTH) ≥ 500 ng/L for the first time, or initiation of cinacalcet, or parathyroidectomy. Multiple correspondence analysis and ascendant hierarchical clustering on clinico-biological (symptoms, PTH, plasma phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase) and treatment of SHPT (cinacalcet, vitamin D, calcium, or calcium-free calcic phosphate binder) were performed to identify distinct phenotypes.

Results

305 patients (261 with incident PTH ≥ 500 ng/L; 44 with cinacalcet initiation) were included. Their mean age was 67 ± 15 years, and 60% were men, 92% on hemodialysis and 8% on peritoneal dialysis. Four subgroups of SHPT patients were identified: 1/ "intermediate" phenotype with hyperphosphatemia without hypocalcemia (n = 113); 2/ younger patients with severe comorbidities, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia, despite SHPT multiple medical treatments, suggesting poor adherence (n = 73); 3/ elderly patients with few cardiovascular comorbidities, controlled phospho-calcium balance, higher PTH, and few treatments (n = 75); 4/ patients who initiated cinacalcet (n = 43). The quality criterion of the model had a cut-off of 14 (> 2), suggesting a relevant classification.

Conclusion

In real life, dialysis patients with newly diagnosed SHPT constitute a very heterogeneous population. A "one-size-fits-all" target approach is probably not appropriate. Therapeutic management needs to be adjusted to the 4 different phenotypes.

### Standardizing the reporting of postoperative hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy: consensus statement from the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons, the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, and the international association of endocrine surgeons [^92cb1fb2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Early substitution with oral calcium and active vitamin D should be routinely initiated in patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism within 24 h post-surgery. This approach was shown to reduce the risk of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, including muscle cramps, paraesthesia, and cardiac irritability, and supported safe discharge planning. Use of standardized supplementation protocols should be helpful to prevent under-treatment and avoid emergency hospital readmissions. Sessa et al.compared three protocols for preventing symptomatic hypocalcaemia after total thyroidectomy: PTH-driven selective postoperative supplementation with calcium and active vitamin D (calcitriol); high-dose routine preoperative and postoperative supplementation; and low-dose routine preoperative and postoperative supplementation. High-dose routine preoperative and postoperative supplementation resulted in the shortest hospital stays and the lowest rate of symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Although overall hypocalcaemia rates were similar across groups, PTH-driven selective supplementation alone had significantly more symptomatic cases. No readmission for hypoparathyroidism or hypercalcaemia occurred in the study. High-dose routine preoperative supplementation was deemed the most effective and safest approach, making it the protocol recommended by Sessa et al. In addition, maintaining appropriate serum magnesium levels is essential for PTH function. Low intracellular magnesium impairs PTH responsiveness due to its role as a cofactor for adenylate cyclase, while elevated serum magnesium may suppress PTH synthesis and secretion by activating the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR).

Statement 4: Patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism within 24 h after surgery should have oral calcium supplementation with or without an active vitamin D analogue started before discharge to reduce the risk of developing clinical manifestations of hypocalcaemia.

Consensus: Yes (8.311)

Outliers: 8

Negative outliers: 1

Evidence level: Moderate

Statement 4A: Serum calcium levels (albumin-adjusted and/or ionized) should also be measured.

Consensus: Yes (7.800)

Outliers: 11

Negative outliers: 7

Evidence level: Moderate

Adjustment protocols for calcium and vitamin D supplementation vary widely among external follow-up providers, leading to inconsistent management. To prevent iatrogenic suppression of PTH, excessive calcium intake, and potential renal complications, thyroid surgeons should proactively recommend a structured tapering strategy for supplementation.

### Approach to the patient: management of parathyroid diseases across pregnancy [^318e5457]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Parathyroid disorders during pregnancy are relatively rare and are characterized by disturbances in calcium and mineral metabolism. In primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) elevated or inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels increase serum calcium concentrations, while in hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), reduced or inadequately low PTH levels lead to hypocalcemia. PHPT is a common endocrine disease with a female predominance and an age-dependent increase in prevalence, whereas HypoPT is a rare condition that is mainly caused by anterior neck surgery.

Management of parathyroid disorders during pregnancy can be challenging and significantly differs in various ways from nonpregnant patients. Scientific evidence from systematic evaluations regarding this issue is very limited, in particular regarding maternal management and fetal outcomes. Clinicians taking care of pregnant patients with parathyroid disorders do not only require sufficient knowledge on the pathophysiology of the diseases itself, but also on the physiology of pregnancy which induces the fundamental changes in bone and mineral metabolism in women during pregnancy and lactation which have been summarized in Fig. 1.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^0680096a]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease postoperative calcium management — strategies and risk assessment (Recommendation 29) states that following thyroidectomy for GD, alternative strategies may be undertaken for management of calcium levels, with a weak recommendation, low-quality evidence: serum calcium with or without intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels can be measured and supplementation given based on results, or prophylactic calcium with or without calcitriol prescribed empirically. Low iPTH levels (< 10–15 pg/mL) in the immediate postoperative setting appear to predict symptomatic hypocalcemia and need for supplementation. Patients can be discharged if asymptomatic and their serum calcium levels corrected for albumin are 8.0 mg/ dL (2.0 mmol/L) or above and are not falling over a 24-hour period. Persistent hypocalcemia may warrant measurement of serum magnesium and possible repletion; following discharge, serum iPTH should be measured in persistent hypocalcemia to determine if permanent hypoparathyroidism is present or whether "bone hunger" is ongoing. In patients with severe hypocalcemia, teriparatide has yielded encouraging preliminary results, but more data are needed before it can be considered for clinical practice; intravenous calcium gluconate should be readily available and may be administered if symptoms worsen despite oral therapy.

### The diamond of death: hypocalcemia in trauma and resuscitation [^c00c7792]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early recognition and management of hemorrhage, damage control resuscitation, and blood product administration have optimized management of severe trauma. Recent data suggest hypocalcemia exacerbates the ensuing effects of coagulopathy in trauma.

Objective

This narrative review of available literature describes the physiology and role of calcium in trauma resuscitation. Authors did not perform a systematic review or meta-analysis.

Discussion

Calcium is a divalent cation found in various physiologic forms, specifically the bound, inactive state and the unbound, physiologically active state. While calcium plays several important physiologic roles in multiple organ systems, the negative hemodynamic effects of hypocalcemia are crucial to address in trauma patients. The negative ramifications of hypocalcemia are intrinsically linked to components of the lethal triad of acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia. Hypocalcemia has direct and indirect effects on each portion of the lethal triad, supporting calcium's potential position as a fourth component in this proposed lethal diamond. Trauma patients often present hypocalcemic in the setting of severe hemorrhage secondary to trauma, which can be worsened by necessary transfusion and resuscitation. The critical consequences of hypocalcemia in the trauma patient have been repeatedly demonstrated with the associated morbidity and mortality. It remains poorly defined when to administer calcium, though current data suggest that earlier administration may be advantageous.

Conclusions

Calcium is a key component of trauma resuscitation and the coagulation cascade. Recent data portray the intricate physiologic reverberations of hypocalcemia in the traumatically injured patient; however, future research is needed to further guide the management of these patients.

### Evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism summary statement and guidelines from the second international workshop [^8ceb2727]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline addresses the prevention, diagnosis, and management of hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) and provides evidence-based recommendations. The HypoPT task forces included four teams with a total of 50 international experts including representatives from the sponsoring societies. A methodologist (GG) and his team supported the taskforces and conducted the systematic reviews. A formal process following the Gradingof Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the systematic reviews provided the structure for seven of the guideline recommendations. The task force used a less structured approach based on narrative reviews for 20 non-GRADEd recommendations. Clinicians may consider postsurgical HypoPT permanent if it persists for > 12 months after surgery. To predict which patients will not develop permanent postsurgical HypoPT, we recommend evaluating serum PTH within 12 to 24 hours post total thyroidectomy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). PTH > 10pg/mL (1.05pmol/L) virtually excludes long-term HypoPT. In individuals with nonsurgical HypoPT, genetic testing may be helpful in the presence of a positive family history of nonsurgical HypoPT, in the presence of syndromic features, or in individuals younger than 40years. HypoPT can be associated with complications, including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, cataracts, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, depression, and an increased risk of infection. Minimizing complications of HypoPT requires careful evaluation and close monitoring of laboratory indices. In patients with chronic HypoPT, the panel suggests conventional therapy with calcium and active vitamin D metabolites as first-line therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers the use of PTH. © 2022 The Authors.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^973da749]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is the most common complication following bilateral thyroid operations. Thyroid surgeons must employ strategies for minimizing and preventing post-thyroidectomy hypoPT. The objective of this American Thyroid Association Surgical Affairs Committee Statement is to provide an overview of its diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

Summary

HypoPT occurs when a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is accompanied by hypocalcemia. Risk factors for post-thyroidectomy hypoPT include bilateral thyroid operations, autoimmune thyroid disease, central neck dissection, substernal goiter, surgeon inexperience, and malabsorptive conditions. Medical and surgical strategies to minimize perioperative hypoPT include optimizing vitamin D levels, preserving parathyroid blood supply, and autotransplanting ischemic parathyroid glands. Measurement of intraoperative or early postoperative intact PTH levels following thyroidectomy can help guide patient management. In general, a postoperative PTH level < 15pg/mL indicates increased risk for acute hypoPT. Effective management of mild to moderate potential or actual postoperative hypoPT can be achieved by administering either empiric/prophylactic oral calcium and vitamin D, selective oral calcium, and vitamin D based on rapid postoperative PTH level(s), or serial serum calcium levels as a guide. Monitoring for rebound hypercalcemia is necessary to avoid metabolic and renal complications. For more severe hypocalcemia, inpatient management may be necessary. Permanent hypoPT has long-term consequences for both objective and subjective well-being, and should be prevented whenever possible.

### Acute management of hypercalcemia of malignancy – A review of pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^bc8cf9a8]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is one of the most common metabolic disorders in patients with cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This narrative review summarizes pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, and therapies available for the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy in acutely ill adult patients.

Recent Findings

We reviewed both classic and recent literature to provide practical recommendations for managing cancer-related hypercalcemia. Our findings are presented in the context of recently published societal guidelines. Timely identification and treatment of acute hypercalcemia of malignancy is vital. Understanding of the underlying disease processes and available therapies is needed to optimize patient care and healthcare resource utilization.

### Targets for parathyroid hormone in secondary hyperparathyroidism: is a "one-size-fits-all" approach appropriate? A prospective incident cohort study [^cbfeb5ab]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

In this grey zone, our study identified four statistically distinct subgroups of patients. Our description of each group reflected a clinical reality, and was therefore clinically appropriate. Noteworthy, at bedside, these distinct phenotypes should be distinguished by doctor rather by biological cut-offs. This pleads for patient-doctor contact. A recent publication has demonstrated a positive association between patient-doctor contact and outcomes. Last but not least, our study reinforces the recent publication by Levin that has recommended acknowledging the heterogeneity of chronic kidney disease populations and appropriately characterizing populations for studies.

The group of "elderly patients with a few cardiovascular comorbidities", in majority with normocalcemia and normophosphatemia, had a PTH which, at first, should impressed clinicians. In another hand, normal serum phosphorus could not be explained by malnutrition; despite their old age, nutritional markers (such as albumin and phosphatemia) were not statistically different from those in the other groups. PTH seemed to be associated with a good clinical condition and a low prevalence of comorbidities. These results are consistent with those from previous studies in showing that, particularly in elderly, PTH is inversely correlated with score of comorbidities. At the time of diagnosis of SHPT, this subgroup of patients did not require presumably an intensive therapeutic management.

The group of "younger patients with severe cardiovascular comorbidities", by contrast, consisted of a majority of patients (66%) with PTH within targets. However, the mean PTH was similar to the one found in the previous group. They seemed to be most likely to have bone and cardiovascular complications, as in previous cohorts, possibly linked to hyperphosphatemia, with a high proportion of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity. As a result, they should require an intensive care management. Of note, most of them had hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia despite multiple treatments. It is obvious that this phenotype is characterized by very low adherence to first-line strategies for SHPT, e.g. calcium, vitamin D and phosphorus binders. For this treatment category, a recent meta-analysis has pointed out poor adherence in a majority of patients.

Conclusion

Hypocalcemia in trauma patients is associated with increased mortality. Recent data highlight the integration of hypocalcemia into the trauma lethal triad — comprising hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy — as a predictor of prognosis and mortality in critically injured patients. Based on our findings, we suggest that hypocalcemia should be closely monitored regardless of the history of transfusion. Further prospective evaluation is warranted to validate the benefits of early calcium administration in trauma patients.

### Calcium, vitamin D or recombinant parathyroid hormone for managing post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism [^a5cb0b82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-surgical hypoparathyroidism is a common complication after thyroid surgery. The incidence is likely to increase given the rising trend in the annual number of thyroid operations being performed. Measures to prevent post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism including different surgical techniques and prophylactic calcium and vitamin D supplements have been extensively studied. The management of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism however has not been extensively evaluated. Routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements in the postoperative period may reduce the risk of symptoms, temporary hypocalcaemia and hospital stay. However, this may lead to overtreatment and has no effect on long-term hypoparathyroidism. Current recommendations on the management of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism is based on low-quality evidence. Existing guidelines do not often distinguish between surgical and non-surgical hypoparathyroidism, and transient and long-term disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise evidence on the use of calcium, vitamin D and recombinant parathyroid hormone in the management of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. In addition, we aimed to highlight deficiencies in the current literature and stimulate further work in this field.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of calcium, vitamin D and recombinant parathyroid hormone in managing post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase as well as ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search for all databases was 17 December 2018 (except Embase, which was last searched on 21 December 2017). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised control trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) examining the effects of calcium, vitamin D or recombinant parathyroid hormone in people with temporary and long-term post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts for relevance.

Main Results

Database searches yielded a total of 1751 records. We retrieved potentially relevant full texts and excluded articles on the following basis: not a RCT or CCT; intervention, comparator or both did not match prespecified criteria; non-surgical causes of hypoparathyroidism, and studies on prevention. None of the articles was eligible for inclusion in the systematic review.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review highlights a gap in the current literature and the lack of high-quality evidence in the management of post-thyroidectomy temporary and long-term hypoparathyroidism. Further research focusing on clinically relevant outcomes is needed to examine the effects of current treatments in the management of temporary and long-term post-thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia.

KDOQI US Commentary on the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline Update for chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) states that CKD-MBD "encompasses laboratory and bone abnormalities and vascular calcification and has deleterious effects on clinical outcomes", and clarifies that the article "presents the views of the KDOQI CKD-MBD work group". The KDOQI work group "agrees with most of the KDIGO guideline update recommendations, particularly the suggestions regarding bone mineral density testing, joint assessments of longitudinal trends in mineral metabolism markers, and dietary phosphate counseling focused on phosphate additives", but "has some concerns about the suggestions related to hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia, phosphate-binder choice, and treatment of abnormal parathyroid hormone concentrations". The introduction emphasizes that CKD-MBD "is a nearly universal complication of progressive loss of kidney function" and that its components "are consistently associated with increased risks for morbidity and mortality in large observational studies across the spectrum of CKD".

### Efficacy and safety of transCon PTH in adults with hypoparathyroidism: 52-week results from the phase 3 paTHway trial [^663200d8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Conventional therapy for the management of hypoparathyroidism includes active vitamin D (ie, calcitriol or alfacalcidol) and elemental calcium. According to the 2022 Guidelines from the Second International Workshop, treatment with conventional therapy is suggested as first-line therapy to raise serum calcium to the target range (ie, the lower half or just below the reference range) and alleviate symptoms of hypocalcemia while avoiding hypercalciuria to reduce the risk of renal disease. However, the Guidelines grade this as a weak recommendation for first-line treatment of hypocalcemia and its symptoms, citing low-quality evidence. Though conventional therapy aims to alleviate hypocalcemia and its symptoms, it does not restore normal PTH physiology and is associated with long-term complications including nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and renal dysfunction. Chronically elevated phosphate levels and a high calcium-phosphate product, resulting from both hypoparathyroidism itself and the long-term use of conventional therapy, can contribute to ectopic calcifications in the kidney, brain, eye, or vasculature. Individuals with hypoparathyroidism treated with conventional therapy may report a substantial pill burden with unpredictable fluctuations in serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia, decreased kidney function, reduced HRQoL, impaired physical functioning, and well-being. The 2022 Guidelines recommend considering the use of PTH replacement therapy when conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory because of inadequate control of biochemical and clinical parameters (ie, symptomatic hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, renal insufficiency, hypercalciuria, and poor quality of life), malabsorption or intolerance of large doses of vitamin D and calcium, or the requirement of high doses of conventional therapy. For individuals with hypoparathyroidism, there remains an unmet need for a PTH therapy capable of providing physiological levels of PTH, reducing symptom burden and long-term complications, and improving HRQoL.

Post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism — incidence variability and definitional criteria are outlined as follows: Hypoparathyroidism is the most common complication of bilateral and re-operative thyroid operations. Reported rates are influenced by different time points after surgery, diverse electrolyte supplementation protocols, variable operation aggressiveness and surgeon expertise, and by variable use of clinical criteria including symptomatic versus asymptomatic hypocalcemia, biochemical criteria (serum parathyroid hormone [PTH] and/or calcium and/or ionized calcium), and treatment criteria (requirement for calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation). According to a recent meta-analysis, the median incidence of temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy ranges from 19% to 38% and 0% to 3%, respectively.

### Post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia: impact on length of stay [^db8350e1]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Hypocalcemia is a recognized complication following thyroid surgery. Variability in the definition of hypocalcemia and different opinions on its management can lead to unnecessary patient morbidity and longer hospital stays as a result of inappropriate or untimely treatment. Therefore, we developed a management guideline for the recognition and treatment of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia, and we conducted a retrospective study to assess its impact on length of stay (LOS). Between April 1, 2007, and March 31, 2009, 29 adults had undergone a total or completion thyroidectomy at our large district general hospital. Of this group, postoperative hypocalcemia (defined as a serum calcium level of < 2.00 mmol/L) developed in 13 patients (44.8%) during the first 3 postoperative days. Our guideline went into effect on July 1, 2009, and from that date through June 30, 2010, 18 more adults had undergone a total or completion thyroidectomy. Of that group, hypocalcemia developed in 7 patients (38.9%); the guideline was actually followed in 5 of these 7 cases (71.4%). In the preguideline group, the development of hypocalcemia increased the mean LOS from 2.0 days to 7.0 days (p < 0.001). The management of postoperative hypocalcemia in these cases was highly variable and was dictated by variations in practice rather than patient needs. In the postguideline group, postoperative hypocalcemia increased the mean LOS from 2.7 days to only 3.7 days (p = 0.07). While the difference between LOS in the two hypocalcemic groups did not reach statistical significance, we believe it merely reflects the relatively small number of patients rather than any lack of guideline efficacy. The implementation of a simple flowchart guideline for the management of postoperative hypocalcemia in our hospital has resulted in more uniform management and a reduced LOS.

### Approach to the patient: management of parathyroid diseases across pregnancy [^e3ca3db5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Postpartum care in women with HypoPT and their offspring

In the peripartum period and, in particular, immediately after delivery and during lactation, the requirements for active vitamin D and calcium supplements significantly decrease and may increase the risk of maternal hypercalcemia, as reported in some case series. Thus, frequent biochemical monitoring, weekly within the first month after birth and then every 4 weeks during lactation should be performed. In addition, it should also be noted that abrupt cessation of breastfeeding can be associated with maternal hypocalcemia so that additional laboratory measurements immediately after stopping breastfeeding seem to be reasonable.

Newborns of mothers with HypoPT may have been exposed to intrauterine hypo- and/or hypercalcemia that may impact their postnatal calcium metabolism so that it appears reasonable to measure serum calcium levels every second day for the first week of life. This should be regarded as a rough guidance that may be modified according to the degree of disease control during pregnancy. Usual native vitamin D supplementation in the newborns is, of course, recommended. Main recommendations for HypoPT during pregnancy and lactation are summarized in Table 4.

Post-thyroidectomy monitoring — calcium measurement and follow-up: Serum calcium levels (albumin-adjusted and/or ionized) should also be measured. In patients with biochemical hypoparathyroidism and/or low serum calcium levels and/or manifestations of hypocalcaemia, measurements of calcium should be repeated as necessary to assure diagnosis and to allow tailoring of calcium and/or active vitamin D analogue supplements. To prevent iatrogenic suppression of PTH, excessive calcium intake, and potential renal complications, thyroid surgeons should proactively recommend a structured tapering strategy for supplementation.

Denosumab — dosing interval, discontinuation effects, and hypocalcemia risk are characterized as follows: Doses "should not be delayed and should be administered on an every-6-month basis", and "Injections should be given every 6 (± 1) months". After discontinuation, "levels of serum C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide (CTX) and procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) increase above baseline values within 3 to 6 months", with bone mineral density returning "to pretreatment levels within 24 months", and "BMD declines by 18 to 24 months after treatment discontinuation"; missed dosing is "to be strictly avoided". The guideline quantifies hypocalcemia as a "decline in serum calcium to < 1.88 mmol/L or 7.6 mg/dL" with an estimated frequency of "∼0.05%… (2 of 4050 patients)" in large trials and "14% to 25%" in small studies of at‑risk subjects; "underlying CKD", "Vitamin D deficiency at baseline", and "higher rates of baseline bone turnover" may increase risk.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^787109da]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment dosing for deficiency or insufficiency: We recommend treating infants and children who are vitamin D insufficient or deficient with 1000 IU/day for infants < 1 month old, 1000 to 5000 IU/day for children 1 to 12 months old, and > 5000 IU/day for children ≥ 12 months old; vitamin D levels should subsequently be maintained with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. For patients who demonstrate poor compliance, a high dose of vitamin D may be given as a single dose or repeated intermittently. It is important to recognize that simultaneous calcium supplementation is necessary, symptomatic hypocalcemia requires parenteral calcium replacement, and calcitriol and dihydrotachysterol can help treat hypocalcemia associated with rickets but do not build up vitamin D stores.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^acf27ecd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone.

Methods

This review is an evidence-based summary of hypoparathyroidism in terms of relevant pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic concepts.

Results

Many clinical manifestations of hypoparathyroidism are due to the lack of the physiological actions of parathyroid hormone on its 2 major target organs: the skeleton and the kidney. The skeleton is inactive, accruing bone without remodeling it. The kidneys lose the calcium-conserving actions of parathyroid hormone and, thus, excrete a greater fraction of calcium. Biochemical manifestations, besides hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone, include hyperphosphatemia and low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Calcifications in the kidney, brain, and other soft tissues are common. Removal of, or damage to, the parathyroid glands at the time of anterior neck surgery is, by far, the most likely etiology. Autoimmune destruction of the parathyroid glands and other genetic causes represent most of the other etiologies. Conventional treatment with calcium and active vitamin D can maintain the serum calcium level but high doses may be required, adding to the risk of long-term soft tissue calcifications. The advent of replacement therapy with recombinant human PTH(1–84) represents a major step in the therapeutics of this disease.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of hypoparathyroidism have led to greater understanding of the disease itself and our approach to it.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^27e6a0ae]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — prophylactic postoperative management can include oral calcium carbonate given as 500–625 mg to 1000–1250 mg two to three times a day, and routine administration of oral calcium has been reported to reduce postoperative hypocalcemia to approximately 10%; adding calcitriol (1,25-(OH)2-D3), usually 0.5–1.0 μg per day, increases effectiveness, and calcitriol has a half-life of 5–8 hours; in a prospective randomized study, 1500 mg of oral calcium salts and 1 μg of calcitriol increased calcium and PTH superior to 0.5 μg of calcitriol administered twice a day or no calcitriol; given risks of overshooting and hypercalcemia, biochemical monitoring for medication titration is mandatory; costs noted indicate the cost of calcitriol and calcium tend to be less than PTH testing, though PTH testing is considerably lower than an emergency room visit or hospital admission; when postoperative hypoPT is known to be present, higher baseline calcium and activated vitamin D replacement are associated with better chances of parathyroid recovery.

### Evidence for the role of perioperative PTH measurement after total thyroidectomy as a predictor of hypocalcemia [^cfc049aa]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Total thyroidectomy is now accepted worldwide as the standard surgical procedure for the management of benign bilateral nodular thyroid disease. Hypocalcemia is the most common complication of that procedure and a variety of strategies for diagnosing and managing post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia have been advocated. Increasingly, the use of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been utilized to try to predict those patients at risk of developing post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia.

Methods

A Medline search of English language literature was performed and we reviewed the evidence in relation to the following three issues: the accuracy of PTH in predicting hypocalcemia, the optimal timing for measuring PTH, and the routine use of oral calcium supplements.

Results

Post-thyroidectomy PTH levels accurately predict hypocalcemia but lack 100% accuracy. Progressive and severe hypocalcemia is unlikely in the setting of a normal PTH level and hence PTH can be cautiously used to facilitate discharge within 24 h for many patients. In addition, PTH levels can be used to implement early treatment with calcium and/or vitamin D supplements to reduce the incidence and severity of hypocalcemia. A single PTH measurement taken any time from 10 min to several hours postoperative will provide equally accurate results for predicting post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia. Routine use of oral calcium supplements may reduce the incidence and severity of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia.

Conclusion

Postoperative PTH can be used to stratify the risk of patients developing hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy. In addition, the routine use of oral calcium supplements can lead to decreased incidence and severity of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia. Protocols based on PTH and the routine use of oral calcium supplements can lead to improved patient outcomes after thyroidectomy.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^8b6a613a]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

Epidemiological evidence linking higher calcium concentrations to increased mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events in adults with CKD has accumulated since the KDIGO guideline on CKD-MBD from 2009. On this basis the grade of this guideline has changed from 2D to 2C. This is still a relatively weak evidentiary base, due to the lack of prospective studies targeting higher calcium concentrations with the aim to improve clinical outcomes. Although the original guideline suggested maintaining serum calcium in the normal range, correction of hypocalcemia carries a risk of inducing a positive calcium balance, and persistently low calcium levels in subjects treated with cinacalcet in the EVOLVE study was not harmful. Therefore, the KDIGO committee considered it reasonable to consider low serum calcium within an individualised perspective, refraining from a generalised suggestion as in the previous of the KDIGO guideline to maintain calcium in the normal range for all CKD patients as mild and asymptomatic hypocalcemia (e.g. in the context of calcimimetic treatment) can be tolerated in order to avoid inappropriate calcium loading in adults.

The previous Renal Association guideline suggested that albumin-adjusted serum calcium levels are kept within the normal reference range for the laboratory used and ideally maintained between 2.2 and 2.5 mmol/l, with avoidance of hypercalcaemic episodes (2D).

RA recommendation

In patients with CKD G3a-G5D, we suggest avoidance of hypercalcaemia, maintaining serum calcium below the upper limit of the reference range for the laboratory used. Hypocalcaemia should be managed in an individualised way as over-correction may also lead to patient harm.

2009 KDIGO guideline

According to the ATA statement, transient hypoparathyroidism refers to cases lasting < 6 months following surgery, whereas permanent hypoparathyroidism persists beyond that time frame. These two classifications are based on and expand upon existing literature, supported by extensive research and data. Relative hypoparathyroidism, though characterized by normal serum PTH and calcium levels, still necessitates treatment due to clinically relevant symptoms or signs of hypocalcaemia. While the ATA's diagnostic criteria for hypoparathyroidism are valuable for identifying patients based on hypocalcaemia symptoms and guiding clinical care, they may not accurately reflect the true incidence — potentially leading to either underestimation or overestimation. Qiu et al.found that PTH levels recovered between 6 and 12 months after thyroid surgery with central neck dissection in 25.4% of patients diagnosed with permanent hypoparathyroidism at 6 months after surgery and that PTH levels recovered or did not recover after 12 months in 74.6% of patients. This phenomenon can be partly explained by the fact that most autotransplanted parathyroid glands typically require 2–6 weeks to gradually regain function, although, in some cases, full recovery may take several months. Villarroya-Marquina et al.studied 854 patients undergoing total thyroidectomy and found that 14.5% of patients had postoperative hypoparathyroidism, with their parathyroid function recovering at different times (< 6 months in 8.5%, 6–12 months in 2.5%, and > 12 months in 1.4%; 4.2% of patients did not recover during follow-up). These data support the 12-month threshold for distinguishing transient from permanent hypoparathyroidism, as a substantial proportion of patients continue to show recovery of parathyroid function between 6 and 12 months after surgery. This approach is consistent with the most recent definition developed and approved by an international panel of experts presented as part of the best practice recommendations discussed at the Parathyroid Summit, held as a pre-Endocrine Society meeting in May 2024 (Boston, MA, USA), stating that a diagnosis of permanent hypoparathyroidism is confirmed ≥ 12 months after surgical intervention in the presence of hypocalcaemia (albumin-adjusted or ionized calcium) determined on two separate occasions (≥ 2 weeks apart) with inappropriately normal or low PTH levels.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) — definitions and diagnostic thresholds — Biochemical hypoPT is defined as a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level below the laboratory lower limit (usually 12 pg/mL) with hypocalcemia, while clinical hypoPT adds symptoms or signs of hypocalcemia; hypocalcemia itself is a total serum calcium below the center-specific reference range. Transient or temporary hypoPT lasts for less than six months after surgery, and permanent hypoPT continues beyond six months. The short half-life of PTH (3–5 minutes) contributes to postoperative vulnerability of parathyroid function. Parathyroid insufficiency (relative hypoPT) can occur after central neck surgery with symptoms despite normal laboratory values.

### Hypocalcemia in trauma patients: a systematic review [^58996ff5]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Therapy

Replacement of blood loss is a cornerstone of management in trauma patients. The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following traumarecommends ionized calcium levels be monitored and maintained within the normal range during massive transfusion with appropriate administration of calcium chloride to correct hypocalcemia. The prevalence of hypocalcemia in up to 97% of trauma patients within 24 hours of massive transfusionsfurther highlights the importance of treating this aberrancy to ameliorate outcomes such as mortality, blood transfusion requirements, and coagulopathy.

While none of the studies included in this review studied the potential therapeutic benefit of timely correction of hypocalcemia in trauma patients, there is some evidence to suggest benefit in correction of hypocalcemia. In a retrospective review of 297 military combat trauma patients who received an average of 4 U of blood products before hospital admission, hypocalcemia was present in 28.3% of the cohort treated with 10 mL 10% intravenous calcium chloride, while hypocalcemia was evident in 70.0% of the nontreatment group. In shocked patients requiring colloids, calcium-containing haemaccel infusions have been reliably found to increase ionized calcium concentrations.

Although in the context of transfusion, Giancarelli et al.identified a threshold of 0.9 mmol/L to commence calcium therapy in the form of 2 g of calcium chloride for every 2 to 4 U of blood products transfused given that even 1 U of blood can cause hypocalcemia in trauma patients. Dickerson et al.suggested a short-term infusion of 4 g of intravenous calcium gluconate for the treatment of moderate to severe hypocalcemia in critically ill, adult multiple injury patients. Correction of hypocalcemia in certain subsets of this patient population yields an improvement in left ventricular function and mean arterial pressure.

### Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia [^0a5c36eb]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management options for benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

Methods

We present a systematic summary of benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia after review of the current available literature.

Results

Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by lifelong hypercalcemia, relative hypocalciuria, and inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR). Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is important clinically because it can be difficult to distinguish from primary hyperparathyroidism. It is a benign condition, and affected patients should be advised against parathyroidectomy. The incidence of complications associated with primary hyperparathyroidism, like osteopenia and nephrolithiasis, is not increased in persons with benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and the rates are similar to those in the general population. Rarely, a severe form of this disease, namely neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism is seen in infants with homozygous CASR mutations.

Conclusions

Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a small but important cause of hypercalcemia, especially in the younger population. Hypercalcemia persists after subtotal parathyroidectomy. It is important to diagnose this condition, not only in the index case but also in family members, because these patients should be advised against surgical intervention.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^97ef2e0a]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a disease characterized by inadequately low circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) resulting in low calcium levels and increased phosphate levels in the blood. Symptoms of the disease result from increased neuromuscular irritability caused by hypocalcaemia and include tingling, muscle cramps and seizures. The most common cause of the disease is inadvertent removal of, or injury to, the parathyroid glands during neck surgery, followed by genetic, idiopathic and autoimmune aetiologies. Conventional treatment includes activated vitamin D and/or calcium supplements, but this treatment does not fully replace the functions of PTH and can lead to short-term problems (such as hypocalcaemia, hypercalcaemia and increased urinary calcium excretion) and long-term complications (which include nephrocalcinosis, kidney stones and brain calcifications). PTH replacement has emerged as a new treatment option. Clinical trials using human PTH(1–34) and PTH(1–84) showed that this treatment was safe and effective in studies lasting up to 6 years. Recombinant human PTH(1–84) has been approved in the United States and Europe for the management of hypoparathyroidism; however, its effect on long-term complications is still being evaluated. Clinical practice guidelines, which describe the consensus of experts in the field, have been published and recognize the need for more research to optimize care. In this Primer, we summarize current knowledge of the prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of hypoparathyroidism.

### Contemporary management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^a701f235]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be asymptomatic or symptomatic, as well as classic, normocalcemic, or normohormonal. It is important to rule out other causes of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism. Preoperative localization with imaging is necessary for a minimally invasive approach and can be helpful even if planning 4-gland exploration. There are a variety of intraoperative techniques that can assist with localization as well as confirming success. Standard of care remains surgical resection of affected glands. However, there are less invasive management strategies that can be considered for poor surgical candidates.

Treatment and monitoring of HypoPT during pregnancy

Active vitamin D treatment and calcium supplements are the main treatment modalities during pregnancy and the goal is to aim for an albumin-adjusted and/or ionized calcium level in the lower end of the normal range. Native vitamin D supplements to achieve 25(OH)D concentrations in the normal range are also recommended, and magnesium supplements should also be used in case of a respective deficiency. In case of severe (life-threatening) acute hypocalcemia with tetany and/or cardiac arrhythmias we suggest, as an emergency treatment, the intravenous infusion of 1 to 2 g of calcium gluconate over 10 minutes.

It is critical to avoid hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia in the mother during pregnancy. Maternal hypercalcemia leads to hypercalcemia of the fetus and may suppress PTH levels and thus cause HypoPT with risk of symptomatic hypocalcemia in the newborn after birth. Conversely, maternal hypocalcemia may not lead to fetal hypocalcemia until maternal serum calcium is severely reduced because calcium is transferred by the placenta to the fetus at the expense of the maternal skeleton. Severe and longstanding maternal hypocalcemia can, however, cause fetal hypocalcemia during pregnancy. This in turn, may lead to fetal hyperparathyroidism and demineralization of the fetal skeleton and increased risk of intrauterine fractures, low birth weight and fetal death. While earlier case reports and case series suggested a relatively high risk of pregnancy complications for women with HypoPT, recent larger national registry studies documented a relatively low risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The largest registry study from Sweden included 97 women with HypoPT and reported on an increased risk of induction of labor (odds ratio 1.87; 95% CI, 1.13–2.94) and lower birth weight (−188 g; 95% CI, −312.2 to −63.8) when compared with age-matched controls, but there was no increased risk for other relevant outcomes, such as small for gestational age, malformations, or perinatal death.

### Is calcium supplementation always needed in patients with hypoparathyroidism? [^8df6c69a]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Oral calcium salts are recommended for the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), although dosimetry is variable between individual patients and clinicians. However, patient feedback on calcium salts can be negative, particularly due to gastrointestinal side effects and hypercalciuria-related complications. We begin with a clinical case of a HypoPT patient taking oral calcium salts following thyroid surgery, who requested support in reducing her dose of these with a view to stopping entirely. To evaluate her request, we first describe the usual treatment of HypoPT according to current guidance and then present data from (a) a case note review of a cohort of 24 HypoPT patients managed with a "no calcium" treatment regimen by single physician (b) a comprehensive online survey of HypoPT patients' treatment and experiences (n = 330). The case note review found that target range serum calcium levels were successfully achieved in all 24 patients since transitioning to a "no calcium" regimen, without any breakthrough hypocalcaemia-related symptoms, the development of new renal stones, the occurrence of calcium-related hospital admissions or the finding of significant hypercalciuria. The online survey identified 36% of HypoPT patients who continued to take activated vitamin D, but had discontinued calcium supplements. HypoPT patients not currently taking calcium reported a significantly lower prevalence of adverse effects and outcomes, both compared with their previous experiences whilst taking calcium and also compared with the 64% of patients who continued to take oral calcium. We conclude that, subject to methodological limitations, there are significant issues of tolerability arising from conventional calcium-based treatment regimens for patients with chronic HypoPT. For selected patients, it may be reasonable to facilitate a managed therapeutic transition to "no calcium" regimen, and we also propose that calcium-based regimes be prospectively evaluated against calcium-free (or calcium-low) alternatives.

Diagnosing HypoPT during pregnancy

Hypoparathyroidism is only rarely diagnosed during pregnancy as it is, in most cases, already known before pregnancy. In pregnant women without a known diagnosis of HypoPT, hypocalcemic symptoms such as paresthesia (eg, tingling in the fingertips), muscle aches, or even cramps should lead to laboratory evaluations with calcium measurements. If hypocalcemia is detected, PTH and 25(OH)D should be determined to evaluate the diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism as a condition with hypocalcemia in combination with reduced or inappropriately low PTH concentrations. Given that anterior neck surgery is a main cause of hypoparathyroidism (75% of the cases), knowledge on such a previous surgery or just a respective surgical scar can be a useful hint for the diagnostic evaluation.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in adults: an international working group clinical practice guideline [^c9bb3568]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to management of tertiary hyperparathyroidism, calcimimetics, XLH-IWG 2025 guidelines recommend to administer calcimimetics (off-label), such as cinacalcet, to treat tertiary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of hypercalcemia with anticipated multi-gland involvement. Carefully monitor serum calcium levels to prevent hypocalcemia.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^3b63222a]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Hypocalcemia is a common finding in patients admitted to a general ICU. In this large cohort of patients, levels tended to normalize over the early days of admission and this was not associated with outcome. However, patients severely hypocalcemic on admission whose calcium failed to rebound to normal trended towards having a higher mortality and may be a target for intervention. Findings also indicate that calcium supplementation is not associated with calcium normalization or improved outcome, although this study was observational in nature. A large randomized controlled trial of calcium supplementation in critically ill patients with different degrees of hypocalcemia is required to determine the effectiveness and side effects of this treatment and its role in clinical practice.

### Hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, management and emerging therapies [^5b27264e]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion or action and results in hypocalcaemia, and can lead to hyperphosphataemia and hypercalciuria. Most cases of hypoparathyroidism occur as a complication of surgery, with the remainder due to causes including autoimmune disease, genetic causes, infiltrative diseases, mineral deposition or due to abnormalities in serum levels of magnesium. Hypoparathyroidism can cause multisystem disease, with long-term complications resulting from ectopic calcification as well as renal complications with nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and renal impairment in addition to respiratory, cardiac or neurological manifestations. Conventional therapy consists of oral calcium salts and active vitamin D but it has limitations, including fluctuations in serum levels of calcium and a high pill burden, and can increase the risk of long-term complications. By contrast, PTH replacement therapy can effectively achieve normal serum levels of calcium, and lower serum levels of phosphate. The long-acting PTH analogue, palopegteriparatide, has been shown to normalize urine levels of calcium. In addition, PTH replacement therapy reduces the pill burden. Palopegteriparatide is also associated with improved quality of life in comparison to conventional therapy. This Review summarizes current recommendations regarding the pathophysiology, evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and also references the 2022 international hypoparathyroidism guidelines. Palopegteriparatide has now been approved as PTH replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism. Emerging therapies will also be presented in this Review.

Adult CKD calcium rationale — "novel epidemiological evidence linking higher calcium concentrations to increased mortality in adults with CKD has accumulated", and "hypocalcemia contributes to the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and renal osteodystrophy". Although prior guidance favored "maintaining serum calcium in the normal range, including the correction of hypocalcemia", newer observations include that a large dialysis cohort "confirmed the association between hypocalcemia and mortality risk", that "the prevalence of hypocalcemia may have increased after the introduction of calcimimetics (cinacalcet) in patients on dialysis", and that in the EVOLVE trial ITT population "no negative signals were associated with the persistently low serum calcium levels in the cinacalcet arm of the trial".

### A quality improvement project for managing hypocalcemia after pediatric total thyroidectomy [^57fb1468]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives Hypocalcemia following total thyroidectomy (TT) is relatively common. It may result in significant morbidity, prolonged hospital stay, and increased costs. Treatment with intravenous (IV) calcium gluconate may also carry significant risks. In pediatrics, management consensus guidelines are lacking. Methods At Phoenix Children's Hospital, a team of pediatric endocrinologists, surgeons and otolaryngologists developed a clinical pathway for patients undergoing TT. It was a Quality Improvement (QI) project with the primary aim of decreasing IV calcium gluconate use from a baseline of 68% to less than 40% over 15 months. Secondary aims included reducing hypocalcemia and length of hospitalization. Interventions included sending weekly pathway reminder emails, starting pre-operative calcium, and pathway implementation into the electronic health record. Results Twenty-seven patients underwent TT over 15 months. IV calcium gluconate use dropped to 48%. Hypocalcemia and length of hospitalization were 96% and 52.7 h (range 21.1–115.7) respectively. Pathway adherence improved after targeted interventions. Eleven (73%) of the 15 patients whose post-operative parathyroid hormone (PTH) nadir was below 15 pg/mL required IV calcium gluconate vs. two (17%) out of 12 with levels above this threshold. Conclusions Standardizing care allowed for objective outcome analysis. We learned that post-operative serum PTH level was the main risk factor for requiring IV calcium gluconate. Implementing the pathway as a QI project allows for revisions based on outcomes, ultimately resulting in a pathway that best utilizes our infrastructure to optimize care. Other pediatric institutions may face similar challenges and can potentially learn from our experience.

### Investigation and management of hypercalcaemia in children [^6a704d8a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Hypercalcaemia is a far less common finding in children than in adults. It may present with characteristic symptoms or may be identified as a coincidental finding in children investigated for a variety of complaints. Assessment of hypercalcaemia requires an understanding of the normal physiological regulation of plasma calcium by the combined actions of parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and the calcium sensing receptor. Hypercalcaemia will usually require treatment using a number of different modalities but occasionally it can be due to a benign asymptomatic condition that requires no intervention. This article presents a logical approach to the investigation and subsequent management of this condition.

### Best practice in primary care pathology: review 11 [^db157df9]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

This eleventh best practice review examines two series of common primary care questions in laboratory medicine: (i) thyroid testing, and (ii) hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia. The review is presented in the same question-answer format as in the previous reviews. These questions and answers deal with common situations in men and non-pregnant women. The recommendations represent a précis of guidance found using a standardised literature search of national and international guidance notes, consensus statements, health policy documents and evidence-based medicine reviews, supplemented by Medline Embase searches to identify relevant primary research documents. In the case of the thyroid series, the recommendations are drawn from the 2006 guidelines published by the Association for Clinical Biochemistry, the British Thyroid Association and the British Thyroid Foundation. They are not standards but form a guide to be set in the clinical context. Most are consensus rather than evidence based. They will be updated periodically to take account of new information.

The Panel Proposes

Provide ongoing care by an expert in metabolic bone disease who recognizes the importance of multidisciplinary services at the transition to adulthood — along with patient support groups — to address disease-related comorbidities.
Continue medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) for at least several years following epiphyseal closure enabling the optimization of peak bone mass which occurs at approximately 20 to 25 years of age in asymptomatic individuals.
Provide medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) in the presence of symptoms or biochemical/histological evidence of osteomalacia (bone pain, weakness, osteomalacic fractures, elevated ALP, or osteomalacia on bone biopsy)
Optimize medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) prior to undertaking orthopedic surgeries or dental implant surgeries.
Provide ongoing adult care with pharmacotherapeutic management (with either burosumab or conventional therapy) with consideration of the benefits and risks of therapy and the patient's capacity for ongoing monitoring.
When treating with burosumab, adhere to the recommended starting dose and adjust doses to achieve serum phosphorus levels in the low to mid normal (peak) or just below the normal or low normal (trough) range for age, while avoiding hyperphosphatemia at any point in the dose cycle.
If burosumab is not available, symptomatic adults should be treated with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts).
Phosphate salts should not be used as monotherapy.
When treating with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts), the fasting serum phosphorus should not serve as a target. It is not necessary to achieve normal fasting serum phosphorus levels to treat XLH, and the high phosphate loads used to accomplish this often lead to severe hyperparathyroidism.
Treatment with active vitamin D and phosphate salts should be modified to avoid hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.
Burosumab is contraindicated in CKD (GFR less than 30 mL/min), and in acute kidney injury. Cautious use may be considered in the presence of an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min with careful monitoring.
Treat hypertension using current regional recommendations pertaining to hypertension management.
Treat tertiary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of hypercalcemia, where multi-gland involvement is anticipated, with off-label use of calcimimetics (ie, cinacalcet) to lower PTH levels, with careful monitoring of serum calcium to prevent hypocalcemia. If hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia remain uncontrolled, a subtotal parathyroidectomy should be considered.
Treat hypercalciuria by reducing the dose of active vitamin D, and in persistent hypercalciuria, hydrochlorothiazide or potassium citrate may be used. The panel also proposes a low sodium intake (< 1500 mg/day) and increased fluid intake up to 3 L/24 hours in the presence of hypercalciuria.
Early referral to the spinal team with physiotherapy in cases of spinal scoliosis.
Treat spinal scoliosis with surgical fixation if the Cobb angle is greater than 30 degrees depending on the rate of progression and location of the curve.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^474ca296]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — management when symptoms progress or become severe: If symptoms progress and serum calcium remains < 7 mg/dL, magnesium levels should be measured and supplemented as needed; if severe symptomatic hypocalcemia develops despite oral calcium and calcitriol, a 12-lead EKG should be performed, corrected QT interval measured, and intravenous calcium administered. For rapid correction, an i.v. bolus (1–2 g of calcium gluconate [93 mg elemental calcium in one vial of calcium gluconate] in 50 mL of 5% dextrose infused over 20 min) can be used; calcium gluconate (90 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) is preferred for peripheral i.v. repletion, whereas calcium chloride (270 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) is prone to phlebitis and local tissue necrosis unless delivered through a central line or appropriately diluted.

### Ultraviolet radiation and effects on humans: the paradigm of maternal vitamin D production during pregnancy [^07baedad]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Current evidence indicates that neonates born of mothers with vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy have greater risk for developing hypocalcemia, rickets and extra-skeletal disorders. Despite the classic knowledge that ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure is the most efficient way for a future mother to obtain optimal vitamin D concentrations, no current consensus or clinical recommendations exist regarding the duration and timing of UVB exposure for pregnant women. This article offers a narrative review of available data regarding how UVB exposure affects maternal vitamin D production during pregnancy, along with a discourse on clinical implications of this public health issue. Future studies would benefit from adopting UVB exposure estimates to recommend appropriate UVB exposure to pregnant women. Doing so could provide a more holistic and practical approach in managing maternal hypovitaminosis D during pregnancy.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^d5ea8364]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association — Table 4 key recommendations for prevention and management of hypoparathyroidism: Conduct surgery so as to avoid removal or devascularization of parathyroid tissue. Autotransplant devascularized or inadvertently removed parathyroid glands. Either treat at-risk patients empirically with calcium, or measure calcium and/or PTH in the immediate postoperative period and treat according to evidence-based protocols. Titrate calcium with or without calcitriol to maintain eucalcemia, and wean calcium and/or calcitriol when appropriate. Communication between providers is critical, since hypoPT may be prolonged and can negatively affect multiple organ systems. Inability to achieve independence from calcium by six months indicates permanent hypoPT. Recombinant human PTH analogues may be considered for patients with permanent hypoPT. Avoiding hypoPT is much less costly than treating hypoPT. Teriparatide acetate (recombinant human PTH 1–34; rhPTH[1–34]) is an approved treatment for osteoporosis, but it is currently being studied as a possible off-label treatment for postoperative hypoPT.
